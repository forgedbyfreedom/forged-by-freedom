Big needs to announce the winner of the winner of the show. Who knows? Well, it's all because it has the afterthought. It's good at the real classic. That's good. Yeah. That's good. Hasn't happened to deserve that, man. You know? He's good to love right there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All these guys. Take a really like each other. Wow. You're gonna have some type of energy, right? All right. Thank you, president. Yeah. Guys, don't go too far. We're gonna get some pictures, please. But it's really cool to see each other gradually. One another. On this. Years worth of hard work.

You're pretty sure. But Chris really brought it in and shout out to Honey Rambod as new coach. Wow. Right. I just got quite a group here at this point. Yeah. He's got a busy, he had a busy weekend. We actually ate last night together. He was giving me the run down on the game plan. Can't share that all with you yet. But yeah, he wasn't getting any sleep last night. He did not sleep last night because he had to make sure that Chris gets up at five A.M. every morning to get this routine. It's just gentleman in the front row would say. Yeah, but I can't. Can't understand. Four time Olympia champion Chris. Four times. How's it feel? Feels damn good. He's again hard to explain to me completely honest. It feels really beautiful being up here again. And I mean, I felt so good to be pushed by these guys. There was 59 of us on stage. So around of a plush, really amazing competitors and class with each. This division is so exciting to be a part of. And I'm so grateful to be here and be at the top of it this year. They really push me to be my best. And I'm really grateful for that. And you know, it's been a beautiful year for me to say the least. There's been a lot of talk of my retirement for whatever reason. Not retiring. Don't worry, guys. I'm not going away. I'm here. I fuck love what I'm doing. But I think it's really kind of beautiful that people thought that because I think it shows that I'm learning to really enjoy the moment in the journey of your president. It's because a lot of people don't have the opportunity to kind of enjoy the moments that they look back and realize what they just went through. And they were like, wow, that was like, I wish I'd been a little more present and enjoyed that a little bit more. And I think the fact people think I'm done is because I'm actually here enjoying it now. And it's a beautiful thing. I met a friend of mine that comes in here. This summer in June. And he had a cancer and he was 18 years old. He was a battling for the third time. And he told me something that you don't have to be dying to start living. And he was 19 years old to cancer the third time. And the most present, grateful man I had ever met in my life. And I wore his bracelet up until I got my tan every single day. He wrote this prepped and I think he had him. And while he taught me and it was one of those beautiful things. And he sadly passed a month after that we had taught me that lessons. But he listened to it with me forever and that's something that I want to pass on to everyone. And just enjoying the moment being present. Love your family. Just like, see here, soak it all in. And I had a moment this morning, two hours on stage and honey comes up to me. He's like, soak this in. These moments come once a year. And I'm so proud. You know what I was like? You're so right. Like he's moments are so grand. They're so beautiful. So I'm just trying to enjoy everything I wanted them. I'm so grateful. There's so many of you guys who love me. That my support team is so big. My fiance now who's here who loved me. I love you. I love you, Courtney. My parents are here. My boy Maddie Calvin was me through absolutely everything. Ian who showed us the road of how to get here. And honey who took me on it. Being in this prep is my new coach. I can't thank you enough. You're crazy. But I love you. You put me through it. And it all paid off. Thank you so much for everything you've done for me. I'm so grateful. And the manians, wine burger, chick wood, the Olympia Dan, everyone. Such a beautiful stage. Such a beautiful show. This weekend. I'm so grateful to be here and be a part of it. Come back next year for number five. I'm ready to rock it. I love you guys. I love you guys so much. I can't wait to be back here next year. We'll do it all again. Chris, you're not the one to class act my friend. Congratulations. Four-time Olympia Champion. Seabomb in the house. Alright, and speaking of great moments, we enjoyed you.

It's so Michael Jordan. See this? We can do it. That's right. I haven't seen a bit of it. Did you design this? Good job, Maddie. This is our cool show. That's awesome. Yeah. I want to see the line. I said a little bit ago. You don't have to know you're dying to start living. And that was a, I would be one take away for like anybody that's listening. And people always tell me like, Would you've always wanted change? Like not having cancer? Like would you restart your life? I was like, no. I never do it because I wouldn't be. Personally without cancer. Like I always tell people to like having cancer is like the best thing that's could have happened to me. Because it made me who I am today. Nope. And it got me to wear a mat today. Every time I've got cancer, I'm always saving somebody else from getting it. That's just who I am. It's crazy. Yeah.

This is too. It's crazy. It's good. I'm 30, I'm 30. Can't believe it. You're so good. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not in the press, are I going to do it? Come on. Come on, Chris. Come on. Come on. We come, I'll let you in, Chris. Let's go, Chris. You're done. Sorry, I'll get you. I'll get you one. One. Yeah. Push it, Sharon's going to roll with? Yeah. Yep. These are all the secrets. One potato? It's one potato. Every 27 minutes. Nice. Put a pound of ball over there. There you go. Set. Do you have to tell secrets? I think the potato is 40 different ways. Just to keep up the diversity. So that Mr. Bumsat can stay bougie. Boosie. Anyways, what is up YouTube? Mustache is a full effect. Wings are in... 3 hours. Probably 4 hours. It's been a long time since I've been in interest in day. We woke up under 240. And it's just been about keeping me there all day. So lower my water, lower my sodium, and literally tracking everything that's going in my body from the time to the gram, so the ounces to the water. Everything that's going in me and then every time I eat a drink. I take off all my clothes, I step on the scale. And then we see that I'll give you a little more. Can you drink a little more? Which is balancing that out pretty much. I'm just being a wizard right now. And it's bouncing around. And the corn is been a chef all day. Cookin' steak, salmon, rice, fish, potatoes, anything you can imagine. Right now we saw some different ways. We wasted out when we see which one sucks the most liquid out of it. So we're kind of a bunch of bored to the other part. But the more cars I can hear right now with some minimal amount of liquid, the better, so we're just trying to drive this shit out of it. That an air fryer would be amazing, but I did not get an air fryer during the next time we will get an air fryer because the air fryer is a little bit of a best. But we're three hours away right now. If you don't pretty good, I've literally haven't left the hotel room. I've been like sleeping, shaped my beard, sleeping, eating, kind of stretching, moving around, trying to make sure that I'm not too stagnant with the food in me. So that I can actually move through and have a good poop in everything. So yeah, it's pretty much what's been going on all day. And we're going to keep doing this to the APM. Make way. Eat some food. We're going to have a late night workout. So after in the hotel, I had some biceps, alarms, just whatever I've been finishing up we need to do, and then the more I'll be getting. So, let's see. Alright, that was an underning shit tomorrow. So, right? But you're not doing shit tomorrow. I got a 10 press conference, maybe another 10. Oh, sorry, that's for... I think meat and meat, 10. A lot of you go on the long run. Yeah, tomorrow's a very, very loaded day. A lot of the meat and meat are so difficult. The long day in the meat grid at like 9pm, and you're just like fully depleted. So, luckily you have an extra need to rest. Yeah. I've opened up like swollen after standing there for three out of meeting people. And like, people who are mad at you, if you leave it like 10 o'clock, I'm like, I had a complete year here to watch me look good, you know? But, I'll part of the game. Yeah, it's hard to come up with these because I spent too much time at the main grid. That's why I had a lot of it. Right? Yeah, see you later. See you later. Also, it also is for the appetito. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Sounds good. I'll show you a few little things. You water it after too. Which you're food? Yeah, every bag, like every... Just bring the, you know, where you're going to water. I'm going to bring a bag in a bottle, a smaller bottle. Imagine the water, you know? Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me have you in. Yeah. That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. How do you get that? That was going out yesterday. You felt a lot. It was pretty good to show out at the moment. Yeah. Oh, that was good. What? What? Here. A little lower. There. I'll pick you up. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm ruined that. Good job, Eddie. It's 6-2. It's so hard. It's so hard. It's so hard. You could have found it. My life was pretty scared to do that. You're going to pick me up like, you're going to have done this recently. That was perfect. Now we're going to make an extra 10 pounds. Not actually, but I'll be 6-1. In a half. Alright, so we are officially 30 minutes out. 20 minutes out of weigh-ins. So walking over to play in Hollywood now is going to find the ballroom on the way-ins. I think there's a meeting to 12. I want you to be able to form yourself a while, but I'm currently like pound under 240 on my scale. Hopefully there's a scale that's similar. On you and check their scale earlier just to make sure it was close to ours. And you said it was pretty much right on. Mine was a little bit heavier. So we're going to head over there, weight it out. You've got a beautiful meal in the bag ready to go for a while. And just stay put your potato. Then late night workout. It's good to bed. How do we get that? This is it.

Hello athletes and fans of bodybuilding Terrikel Gindy with the Mr. Olympia. Three-time classic physique, Mr. Olympia champion, Christopher Bumstead, aka Ceebum. Chris. Now, while back you said to me, the most relevant Olympia for me was the second one. I felt like those the most relevant. It had a lot of importance to me. But if you win the fourth one, that's a dynasty. That's you cementing your name saying, hey, I am the one who put a statement on that category. How do you feel? I mean, I'll tell you how I feel after it. Don't tell me that you don't tell me that. But like I said, 2018 was special memory for me because I went through. But each one had its own beautiful moments to it. It'd be great for everything. A lot of me. Now I'm just excited. It's journey so far. It's been so good this year. And I feel great. I'm ready to bring my best luck in it. Maybe it'll be my favorite one yet. I'll never know. So obviously, working with Hany Ramon, he's a great coach. He's got many Mr. Olympus on his camp. Tell me a little bit about this modification. It's a new coach. Did you feel like it was an easy transition? I think it would be easy transition. To be coached for me, Bahá'í, when it's in the street for a year. He's been with champions for years. You know what that takes meant like this. And I think it's what we've done a pretty impressive because you've got like a lot of the name ropes don't fix it. But the champion is a better every single game. We've got to get better and better that I'm going up against. We had to bring my level, might just get to the next level. I believe we did just that so. Should show up. Chris Bumstad, he is one of the greatest competitors we have now days. And every year he continues to get better. My name is Terakil Gendu with the superstar C-Bum. We'll see you on stage. Good job.

And he pushed the thick heart on my head. Like down. All my hair down. Oh my god. I tried to make my hair puffy. Didn't work. He just pushed it down. He said, oh, you're almost sixty. I'm like, my sixty. Or they're like, six, one and a half. I'm like, oh, I need it. So I was 237.8, which means I have two point two pounds to play with. I'm never in the evening drink until I start. I think I could put on four or five pounds. Thanks, too. So make it. But for now, to the ease. Arms. Let's do it. All right. So late. Very late right now to go 11. 20 almost 130. And in the gym, hitting some late minibisep's last minibisep. And it's a great night. So tired. Finish wayins, made way. A little bit of food. A little bit more water. Just kind of re-aduring myself. And it's supposed to be my final workout today. But the way it took way longer because of sixty people in classically serious health. Took a minute to get out of there. It's probably hardly any workout. Tomorrow I rest. Got a bunch of stuff going on today. After I rest on the two days of the rest between. So we're just finishing out this final little workout. The last weight lifting workout. It's a beautiful hotel gym. This is great on me. Awesome great music. I'm trying to just get through this. Go get some food. Put a bed up. I'm going to bed at like 9.30. So it's like 11.30 right now. It's the latest health. I don't want to be here. But we're going to wrap it up. I don't work out of the year. Then it's all food from here. So it's got to get us over with. Awesome. Really good. Awesome. Really good. Really good. Really good. It's good. It's great. You're good looking. Yeah. Yeah. Not that didn't be for this workout. Just trying to get through it. Push it hard. They did a lot. Few workouts. Some of my biceps are being neglected. Just finished this shit off-struck. It's late. I'm tired. Ready for bed. What? I mean barely, but feel it. All right. Yeah. But I'm going to come up soon. Where are you right now? You're going to head in the bathroom right here. All right. So we wrapped that up pretty half as a workout. But I honestly felt it marms a little bit and how hard I've been pushing. It's all I really need. I'm not trying to like fatigue and beat up my muscle right now so that they get hurt. I can't get pumped without too sore. So my mean being tired, it gets helped out. Turned out your shit iron was there. Had to even know they were going to be here. They felt some clips too. If you saw them in the background, another camera. But that was. But the wrap on today, Wednesday tomorrow's the big busy day of running around a whole bunch and making me tired. And it's automatic. They made weight. I get to eat some food. It's beautiful. It's really fucking lit right now. So I'm going to shower, eat, and get my ass to bed. Because I am tired as fuck and I know Calvin is too. So peace out.

Wave has not that time, but we had to cook salmon. So, the fat pieces salmon in the oven right now. We stockpiled with fish. It was like... The world's most expensive whole foods run. Stockpiled the cabinets with all the revised supplements. No pre-workout anymore sadly for the last five days, so I got some caffeine pills. So, you know, although we shouldn't get the eat yet. And yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm pretty brain-divisant, I just got along day. So, you're gonna eat the salmon for the bed, hopefully sleep good tonight. And then two more workouts. So, you're gonna eat up a tiny tomorrow. Trades and chest, I think. Yeah, people you get is on... But I've no idea what I'm saying. So, I'm gonna sign that. Thank you for watching. I'll visit the Olympia. Go on to five. See you guys tomorrow.

You need a little... We are the stage. Good. Watch! Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on! Come on! We come on! Let me in, Chris! Come on! Come on! Come on, Chris! What is up, YouTube? We're in the good elevator today. There's another elevator that has stake on the wall. I would much rather look at this signature peanut butter and bacon bigger. Just drool and watch out for you now. But Monday yesterday of Sunday didn't really vlog yesterday, we counted in at it. I was feeling so hot. When someone was brutally killing me, I was like, no fat, no car. I was just like pushing that like, that's how you get gas. You couldn't go to the bathroom. I just didn't feel good. So, took it down to vlog and we're back out of today. Fireton took a little poop. A whole lot better today. I want to give you some fat soup if I wait dropping and I'm fucking shredded right now. So, feeling good, you love me. You have a little bit more fat in my diet. And that's very beneficial. So, we have to jump right now and see you guys out. You're on. All right, here we are. Back at our old man gym. Final back day. Monday, back workout. Like I was saying on the elevator before people were coming up with us and we talked with a poop. I had some fat and maybe you feel more aware of that or so. I ended up with a little bit higher today. Trying a little bit earlier too, which feels better. So, happy about that. Doing good spirits are up. And weights coming down. So, we're going to make it. We'll make way. We get through that workout and get on with the dinner. We're going to do that. We're going to start the workout. Let's go. We're going. Come on. Good job. Let's go. Let's go. Good.

Good. Good. Good. Two more. One more. And that's it. Good. The hand position. So, what we can do is we can go ahead and lighten it by one. If you want, or take a 45 off and I recommend it to 25. And then do it over hand. So, let's grab the 45. Take it off. Yeah. We can't. We're going to go high, bro. Yeah, a little bit. It's really awkward for my long arm. Okay. So, let's go ahead. I'll have that problem too with my long arms. Yeah. Yeah. Seven for one. I'm six one. It's the lens on Calvin's camera. Yeah. This is my way limit is 3400. Good. I said one. Yeah. I'm a second one.

Excellent. Not a little bit. Wait. Let's get on the ice right now. I think it's a little bit difficult. I'm exhausted. I'm like, finished it. But I can do this. Typically, I'm used to being so fucking tired. I like to like, like, it's beyond. Then you can make it. Yeah. You feel good to have a little more life in here. Yeah. I mean, you want to have enough energy to do a set. But you should feel tired. In between the sets. Because your body should be depleted. But not so to put you in the ground stand. Put your pants on and like, you put it in my shorts on. But sometimes it's really, it's just like, it's a nice set down on me. When you have to say, babe, come put on my pants for me. It's not cool. Yeah. Sheave my butt. White my butt. Just put my pants on. Yeah. Just sit down. Yeah. Yeah. Two, two, two. One more. Partial. Got it. So let's go over and just finish that off. And then we'll be a straight-run pull down. And then we'll finish up with some kind of extensions and we'll go over the other shot. I think we'll be on the coach. That's not a judge. My sheet of cables only right now. We're just going to contract and make sure that my muscles are like firing. And now they sort of feed myself up. It's going into my muscles. So it's like diving on that eating line now. I had a little extra cards. So just really make sure the muscles stay alive and move in. And that's not going to feed them up. And definitely not trying to injure myself with fucking heavy rows when I'm this dry and lean. My like, you're flush it and you're flue it and fucking all your joints. Like my spine can like hurt sometimes. So nothing really body was part of all cable shifts. We used to piss out of it. We're half of these last few workouts. And you know the drill. You're right that back. Good. Try that back. Good. Good. One more. Good job. How's it going? One second. One more. Good. I'll just get it today. Three, two, one. Try it. One more. I can try that.

Everyone this weekend or you're signing up, and you're definitely recording all of we back and that's what you meanриating and Skipping on someone every chair. Are we doingские people? Only thing we keep as the soul. We are everything. We Aren't every man. Whatever you create. It's fine. He's more important. Yeah. So like we'll literally just sit down and like brainstorm anything. I haven't seen this movie back on here Try this one I'm having baby feet. Oh no. No. I would say to be fit. To floppy. Has to be to floppy. We're thinking of the warmest. Do you have to pick one sugar kid? What is this? Classic. They're all classic babies. I need to send this to Melissa. She's gonna die. Women's that's the best. They are the 990s. Nevermind. 590s. You would say that. I don't know. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. So hurry. We got the law. We have the law. Billy. Bobby. Yeah they do. I'm like brown black. I'm good. I don't care about clothes. I know you love the website. I don't know. I love the website. Wow. Bobby some nice kicks. We got a pair of Jordan Threes. I first ever pair of threes. Got the muggles. Beautiful sugar. Jordan got the muggles. You're not that sure. One of my favorite shoes. So it's like that. It's like that favorite online store. So we're checking out the muggles. But the shadows are the guys that have been accepted. Give them free shirts and free socks. Give them free shoes. I'm sure everyone your shoes. I'm not sure of them. I mean it was too bright in there. It's too bright. All right. So back from the mall. We're in the whole legit calories. My weight was good today. So I got a bunch of food. And I got a bunch of cheese. So we're like. I put them all. My first pair of Jordan Threes. So something more I need to provide. Why would you? Why don't I get one? Does that like a cream? It is cream. And like a light blue. It's very nice. Just a little hint of red. I like it. So maybe we're going to have to jump tomorrow. That would be like all the pancakes and bacon. It's a cool accomplished shopping bag. Putting up the delicious shoes for sure. But. I can't talk about these. Well, that's going to be wrapped on today. What happens today? Turn back to the eat. Some more food. And now we're back to the ground because tomorrow's Tuesday. And then I have to weigh in a PMO. I do like I said. So we're trying to go over a game plan. Of like how are we going to have my weight below 240 at 8 p.m. Because like at night I'm like 246 typically. So it's just a. Renching the game plan. Then we typically do considering weighing in at 10 a.m. A lot easier. So we're figuring out maybe I just drink a lot. Eat a meal throughout the night. Train really early. And then kind of nap all day. And just chill. Lower my sodium a little bit. Then it'll make me flush more water due to less water. And just like monitor it. Be on the scale all day. Making sure I'm not going over or over too much. And then kind of be there by 8 p.m. So we're going to figure that out. But tomorrow's still working out. So I think we are maybe just because my last full workout workout took two say. And then I'll be doing like a lighter upper body. They said one say probably. And roll out all the week. So thank you guys for. Thank you for the part of this journey. Please remember to subscribe. The top of the grinding on the videos. And be loved by our subscriptions. And we'll be vlogging every day for the rest of the week. I may have a lot of days where I don't talk. I may have had a lot of days where I do talk. So you'll see how I feel based off the move of vlog. I guess watching. Peace out.

Just fill it up, say. Just get a hold on. I'm going to try it. I was waiting. Get in there. You want to do it, honey? Probably the work thing I like to do. Great. What is up YouTube? Last night, beautiful night. Kelvin wanted to watch a shitty UFC 5-3 to film a little bit. But honey let me get an in-note burger and some cereal. And what? Yeah, but I didn't really get a date for a brunch. We went in at 11 o'clock at night and Kelvin tapped up by them. So you guys don't get to see any of my cheat meal, but I haven't been in the open. I'm going to get a pretty fire. So I'm enjoying that. And today's like this, I'm trying to put it to work. And get some big ol' legs. So let's go to the exact way he said. Three ways, what? 600 pounds. No. Five many times. Five these times. They're for sure. That's not fair. That's not fair. That's pretty good. Good. Good. Three. Three. You're going to keep going. Good. Good. Good. Here we go. Go, go, go. Good. Partial, partial, three. Two. That's it. That one. That's just like it's like always going out. You have to have the... ...this part's clear. Okay. Let's go. Go. Good. Go on. Keep going. Good. Keep going. You're going. Good. Now partial. Go. Two. Three. Keep going. One more. That's it. Good. That's it. That's it. Failed bats are too. That's what? Did that... Did you hurt your leg on that one? Or your knee? Yeah, both of these people in there. It's like maybe I should hear it a little bit more. I know that was the one you hear a lot's during. Yeah. Do not amazing machine. You're going to love so much. I didn't hate the machine until now. It just hates you. Yeah. See that my leg works. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Put your toe. Put your toe. Can go. Like that. Go. Just go to feel it. Good. Go. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's it. Tell you. Good. Partial. Three. Two. All right. Good. Good. Sunday, late, month. Good. Good. Excellent. Fire. Good. Good. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Keep a moving. Go. Okay. You need partial stuff. Partial. Partial. Keep going. Good. Good. Keep going. Good. And you're done. Good. Go. Good. That's who three of those. I feel too is okay. I think we can go into a compound movement now. Let's go into a. You don't have a Smith machine squad. You won't be here to all the later next week. So I think we can avoid it and then do. Smith machine squad. We can do late press. We can do that vertical late press. Have you guys seen something? No. You know a vertical late press is. Oh, we can do 45. We have vertical. We have 45. We also have two different hacks. Actually, this this one right here. This pendulum is pretty bad. It's pendulum. I think the home of the starting was like press. And then moving to either belt or pendulum. But we just did felt. It's been a good look for so. You know, tired me on when the late press is in do this or do this first. I think you're actually this is so smooth. I'd like for you to try out this machine first. And then go over. And then maybe on the late press. If you didn't 45 before, we can do vertical. Because you know, you have to put it on. No. We're going to try that. It's matched the how it is. This is for his only fan's page. Come on. You're straight. Two. Two. Two. Two. Five. Six. Two. Two. Two. Four. Four. Two. Four. Two. One. Four. One. Oh. Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. You're good. Good. Good. Go go go drive. Go you come on go drive. Go go go now. Now I'll start. Go go drive. Are you still go two more go up drive one more one more with me. Come on Chris drive it all the way through. Go go. I got really happy. Chris. Heard so bad. He's got no looney five. It's a hotty. He's six, six, six, we. Okay. What is he seven? I mean I honestly feel like you can probably do that way again but it's up to you. But if you want more volume or less, I want to see him out of volume because I don't think it will do more. Oh, I don't think it will do more. Oh, I'm sure. There you go. Sorry, but. Hey. Oh, good. You going. You going moving. Right. Go. Right. Good. Good drive drive. Good one more one more. Got this. Come on Chris. And drive all the way up. Good job. How's that all man? So bad. You cracks but. Moving. Cracks and creaks. Yeah. So. I was no loosey duty set. Good job. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Come on Chris. Good. Keep moving in. Move away. Right. Drive. Excellent. Good. Right. Right. Right. Good. Right. What? I think that's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on Chris. Drive it. Come on Chris. Drive it. Drive it. Good. Keep moving. Go. Drive. Good job. Drive. Good. One more. Go. And drive. Go. Go. Good job. Like that. It's not easy. I'm not going. It's not a big smooth push. There's too much touching on the machine rather than weight moving. Like the bench is to come under through pushing the weight up. You're kind of pushing the weight against the metal. Like it's on a track and it's that you're pushing up. What's that? You're pushing into the metal and then up. It's a lot of friction. Yeah. I also think that you're, it's like where you're putting your feet to on this one. It was a sign. It's a sign a little bit for your higher foot position. I mean, this chair is too far back. It's too far back to too open. You need to be like, you need to be a little bit more upright. Or no, this whole thing needs to be more under. So pushing will up instead of out. To me, it feels like it's a little too far back. That's what I mean, this needs to hold between these two and stuff. So you're more underneath. See how it feels. We're going to start with two and then work our way up a little bit. There you go. This definitely provides much more resistance when you're doing single leg. Then do the double. So that's why you went lighter than half. You want to quarter or more about it. But. Okay. Okay. Good. Squeeze. Set your retard. That works. Don't say that word. My coach is retired. I don't know. I thought you're still talking about somebody else. What? Yeah. Did you realize it would be a pain in your life? Jason, 20. Of course I realized it was me dummy. Sure. Couldn't even think of a name that started with endless name. We had a game going for four hours last night. Four hours at the dinner table. What is fairness called the game? I don't even know how to go. It's like it makes up categories. Cam picks a category. He says he picks celebrities and people. Essentially in movies or celebrities. And he said the name like George Washington and then Washington and then Washington and then between to make another famous person that starts with and and he goes around the circle. And then so. You can't think of a name you lose a point. You get three points to lose in your up. No. No. We went through probably like 20 people with last name and like back and forth. And the order just fucked. There was a lot. Four hours of just a name. Literally. Yeah. The entire dinner we stayed there longer. And I was of course one. We had a letter one. Zero strikes. No you had one pass. No pass.

Got some good food after. Got a good leg day and then flew home and it just been a whirlwind of life and everything that it always is. But it was going to be a good to be going for a while now. And the exciting news is that we are going to be starting the official prep series vlogs. Next week we're going to have a little intro that Calvin is going to edit up. You can have a full day eating a leg day and then we're going to be diving into more of the traditional prep series vlog videos that are a little bit more intensive. A little bit more just showing everything I'm doing eating, training life, home feeling, and all that good stuff. So appreciate you. Appreciate you. Good watching as always stay tuned and thanks for your videos coming up. I'm going to be.

You put his face forward and you're lifting it up. No matter if it's that 50,000 dollars in the title. That's the 50,000 dollars. You're looking at the score, please. Do one more winner. Every year brings new challenges. This year certainly hasn't been short of them. I tossed him turn at night, stuck in my thoughts, staring at the ceiling, asking myself, why am I doing this? Does any of this even worth it? If it feels like every time I get into a good groove, everything falls apart. Every year I've been tested, why did I think this year would be different? I've worked hard over the years to be more present and enjoy this beautiful journey I'm on. But this year is testing me. Extreme life changes, living in fear, health scares, injuries, personal stress, more and more responsibilities. It's funny. The more difficult your goals become, the more challenges life throws at you. When you need focus the most, it's hard as to get. I started my bodybuilding career without a care in the world, just an impossible goal I was chasing. Now that I've achieved that goal, it feels even harder to hold on to. What was once impossible is now expected of me. What was once a dream is now crushing weight on my shoulders. But I lie here wonder, who might have feel sorry for myself? I've been not worked hard every day to earn these pressures. Has life not tested me again and again to prepare me for this? The choice is mine. I'll either get back to work or I quit. I never wanted an easy life. I wanted the strength to earn a life worth living. I've built that strength these past 10 years. The strength to lift his weight of my shoulders. Better yet, I have loved ones who will help me lift that weight. I might doubt myself at times, but I know I have an army behind me of people who believe in me. I've never experienced a job. I will not let them down. It's time I take a look in the mirror, slow the fuck down. I've long surpassed what was just a dream in the years ago. I need to broaden my view. Stop focusing on what's going wrong. Focus on what I can make great. Focus on what matters most to me. Not the expectations of others. Focus on my effort, not the result. My integrity, the people I love. And remember, I love this shit. Enjoy the damn process. One, two, three, four Olympia titles felt hard. Welcome to level five. You're going to earn this shit. Is your choice to enjoy it or drown in it? I hate losing, but I will not become a product of circumstance. I will not let an outcome dictate my happiness. When my time is up, the trophies on my shelves will be but a reminder that I had a goal. And I can honestly tell myself, I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man than I did. I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man, like I did. I did everything in my power to achieve that goal. I worked hard to become a better man along the way. I built relationships with Sheriff's Revere. I enjoyed the damn journey. And I never fucking quit.

Happy birthday, Jay Capri, sponsored here. I'm sad I can meet you, but if I see you, hopefully I have a great birthday and I'll be doing well, man. Thank you so much. You have inspired him?

It's a beautiful mega-fit meals. They got the new green box. Very fancy. We got a bum box too. It's bum some more. So never miss a meal. Okay, for that we're going to check it over. Right now, maybe get some fun, you know? Get some good food. Good Kelvin, that'll trust that we know a good father. We'll get some fun, yeah? Well, yeah. We're going to be traveling out of people. She can hand kiss and date with the lovely dreams. So stay tuned. All right, first order of business. Make sure you door closed. We leave the auto. Second order of business. We went to this amazing Fumple X last year. And like I said, come to the side to go because his mom makes delicious food. The grandma grandma makes a lot of fun. Oh, my God. The grandma makes a lot of fun. She makes a good father. Probably not that good, but it's certainly good. So we're going to go snack. Yeah, because all we like to do when you travel at the get good food, because what better things are to do than throw in that food. Eat them. So you lied to me, so that doesn't get off. This is wrong. Yeah, that's wrong. I forgot. That's why bad. But I like rubbing better food. We're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? You're all laughing at me. What's that? What's that? Do you have that Marry To Eat? That's what I'm talking about. You have that. You have that. You have that. You have that. That's what I like. That's what I like. Each Iraqi ramen. Yeah, this is the Naruto dish. That's why I actually really loved it. But you took out the most important part. The mushroom? You say that, but for leaving it, you have a spiritual experience for a bad and to the shiit. You have no Naruto dish. What? You even know this game. Yeah. Roodle. Why? It's like him. Oh, I know that. I was in the last one. It was just a trick. This is something I heard. I'm going to play cover news. Where's he going? Yes. Yes. He's a hero. He's going to... But it's a character that can all... moldy and then he doesn't fall in? No? Please? No. I'm going to go ahead and pursue it. I have to do it. And I'm probably out of here. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. I thought they'd kick me in. They asked you. I would give it a kiss. You're so high-bro and you're like, how high-bro? Because that high-bro. Yes. I thought they'd go away if I left Florida. They'd go away if I'd get wild. But it was smoked blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. It was a blood. What? What? A weed. Fuck. He's high-drew. I wish him to fill me to him on a cup of also high-tech. Oh, yeah. That's it for today folks. We got some meeting tomorrow. We got a swing, some protein, and some bond trees, and some bomb energy. So we're going to be doing some meeting with distributors. And then I'm going to have a seminar with Harni. I'm going to have a meat grid, and then signature, and then dinner. We're going to be a long-distance day. So I'm going to go to bed soon. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll see you guys tomorrow. Do you guys win? No? Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the birthday, guys. Can we transition every clip like this? No. So did you sell it? Yeah. I've never loved everything. They were hooked on literally everything. Dom is a fucking... What's that word? What's the jokes that they always say? So whatever you picture, you know? What? A salesman? No, there's those jokes. People always say, can't remember that they're really funny. They could sell it and they didn't want. But it's like a joke. Someone in the comments could tell me what it is. And I'll remember it. But you could sell it if you don't want. So they really liked it. They were super happy. They didn't even have any energy. It was just because it didn't make it a sin. But they still love the concept of it. The idea of it, the look of it, the love of our treats, everything. So beautiful, good to go. Check off number one on two and another one. What is this? What is this? The cafe means dope. Okay, what is this? It's like a lot of tape it was less milk. A lot of tape is a kind of hat. This is like three quarters of coffee. Corking that. Yeah, yeah. I think that's what I thought. It might be wrong, but it's an envelope. It's like pretty much a black coffee with a little milk. It's a steam remote. So it's not like an equivalent of this steam. So it's not as heavy as a lock. Is it an envelope? No. It's a catapult. But two bigs like others from my. Jesus. Yeah. I don't know which one of those. A little bit of bugs. It's a hybrid. Someone has the order of courty's eye here. Someone has the order of letters. Because they were talking about stable. So I'm eating shit. It's horrible digestion. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What are we going to do? I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to, I should have scared of you. I was going to. I was going to. I was going to go to my course all the spike will be sent last so long. He's going to hold the water if he limp you up. I was going to do that. I'm still worried about that. That's it.

Alright, so we just wrapped up. Seven hours of honey. Foot-of-off with people and autographs. I'm losing my mind right now. There's a lot of people. They're super organized here at the Arnold. It's really nice. We're going to VIP treatment. Bring me in the back room. We have security walk me from place to place. Which is really nice. And I can't walk through the Expo anymore. So it was very convenient and organized. Not for a lot of pictures. Everyone was super nice. I got to meet. Yeah, so thank you guys for coming out. We'll listen to seven of our kids before we'll offer a piece of your gift. We did make it in. Try new lot of events so I can get to meet you guys in much of a possible. Very tiring for me. But it's definitely fun to actually meet you guys. Put a face to some of the numbers on social media and all that stuff. I'm a more of a personal guy in person. So that's a wrap on day one. We are here at the place called Natta's Mexican food. It's Mexican food. It makes him feel probably my favorite food group. Absolutely delicious. Chip, welcome, boy. Plantage, chip, fajita tacos. We can eat it all day. So we're going to chat down right now. She'll hopefully get to bed early and pretty much repeat tomorrow. So we'll wrap on the day. We're going to see what we're doing here. Just kidding. I think I like how many people eat for coffee this morning. We're going. It's really good. See you. We're going. It's really good. See you. You know what we're doing here? No. See you. We're trying to figure out how many sexes we've had. It's a wonderful event. Yeah. But therefore, it doesn't matter what you do. Because we have to think of something. You speak with us. No, my own. No, no, no. Exactly. But it's a journey that we're going to work on. We're going to work on the early and the early and the early and the early. See. We're going to try and go again. We're going again. We're going again. I think we're going to go. I think we're going to go. Very clear. I think we're going to go. Let's go. Wait. I want to see you. I'm sorry. Thank you. I think we're going to... I think we're going to be... But we're going to have a chance. We're going to be... Go, maybe. Go. Okay. We'll be going. Okay. We'll be going. We'll be going. Let's make it all tonight. Talk to Pettler. Let me do this off. Can you imagine what I don't send? He competed in Europe. One of the universe. Got on a plane. He came all the way here. Can you US. It's not that on stage really. 40-hour later. And it should want the Mr. World. Can you even imagine doing such a thing? I can't help. I like to fly in two weeks before I show up. I have to fly in some of the 48 hours. It's no time. Not enough time. So, credit is too guys. It's super crazy. And I mean, I want to take a quick home setting up here. Can you give me a few sticks of gym or a bird? I want to give a few stick to our own. For making this sport such an amazing... I don't know where I should look today. The biggest popular thing in some of my family. And I can go home. He grateful to be in the United States too. I'm making a whole lot of things myself. Thank you, Arnold. Since they're all, they've got a two-week free shit to you. And everyone lives day. Thank you for all of you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. I'm a big and power of this. We've become very good friends. Because I think this is what the world is looking for when they look at the ideal body. They don't want to be as monsters as some of those guys. They want to have the real beautiful proportions. The symmetry, the muscle separations. They're great pose and routine that you have. I mean, you know, I've seen pictures of you from far away. And the silhouette is so fantastic. And that's really the quality of the face. It's the silhouette. When you're far away, you know, the beach. You can see someone that you see the deltudes popping out. You see the abs. You see the calves. You see all this great proportion. Rather than you see someone wiling down. And the beach right right. And over 300 pounds. That's the bad actionist. This is bad actionist. And this is why you're still making millions of people in Maori and New York. And following you and all this stuff. That's why you're as successful. So how we should all do greatest of the luck. You deserve it because you're fantastic. You see. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So Saturday morning woke up. It's morning and apparently I had to do this thing at 8 am. And we had no idea what it was. Show up. And it's something with Arnold. I guess I'm like, okay. I mean, I'm not going to complain. But it gets to see Arnold Schwarzenegger. And he comes in and he's like, I look at him. I'm like, you know what I'm doing here? He's like, I have no idea. I know what we had no idea what we were doing. They're out half asleep. And he no coffee in me. And then they threw us out there. And just had to, I guess, talk to Kill Time to kind of start the show and give the VIP ticket holders like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't experience the listen to Arnold talk. And yeah, it was pretty cool. I honestly being up there with him. And honestly, very honored that they showed me to put up there. Bob Chick-Low, Chick-A-Rell was kind of like, I'm seeing it. And then being Arnold channe up there for a bit. Mainly just Arnold talking because he's a girl to show. We were just listening to him. But it's cool to be all sand up there with him. So not about where to start Saturday morning. But back here, we go high at Otao through the Arnold. Exactly where I'm at right now. We have another meeting at 10 a.m. today. I think that's it for meeting today. And then I have the meet grief, signatures again. And then that's it for today and for a few tomorrow. So that's the Arnold class for you. We're in the dressing. What? You trained? If we had time today, I won't work out. I probably have time after this to work out for two and ten and three. 10, 33 or whatever. So maybe try and get a workout in this new gym here, build American Barbell. I don't put up in the apparently really close. I heard training there so we might try and check that out. But yeah, it's better when we chill in the day. We're going to get some Starbucks. Maddie's going to get it. We're hiding upstairs. And yeah, also I've plastic with the graph that last day. I remember one look pretty fucking nutty. I'm not gonna lie. Definitely more shred than he was at the LMP last year. So last year this year, whatever fuck you want. He looked really good. Happy for him. He seemed like he watched his acceptance speech. He was like in shock. He was like, you know, he was like, you know, he was like he was like, you're supposed to be in person when I story like shit crazy man, shit crazy. He was speaking. He was very well. He was so excited to be out there with Arnold. So it was really cool to watch. Happy for him. Errskim second. No surprise there. He looked really good too. It was a little bit off. I think something going to happen before the show. But still to the fact that him being a little off comes second at the Arnold super impressive. So it was cool. And make the badass. Like some are feel, I knew I knew what it was. He came third I believe. So hats top five and you don't be on third of the Arnold. You got to stay play. He's placed in the top five classes. He's right now. He looks really good. And then I think Alex Caminaro was in fourth. So you know, really good lineup. And it was cool to see it and get the watch to show. Sadly, but they look really good. So happy for them. Love me some classic. Now we're going to get some food going about today. So I'll see you guys later. Crack open the cold one brother in light of our meeting this morning that was revolved around energy. When a crack open in a bummer energy, have I show this on YouTube? Yeah, actually officially. The first YouTube appearance of bummer energy. We'll look at this beautiful can. It's actually a really beautiful. Take us a fucking minute to make it. But it looks really good. This is our new energy room coming. We're doing a beer style can. So look cool. We're going to maybe put it like beer boxes in the future. Got like that little vintage retro look to it. Got much exact caffeine in the happening. I would say 112. 112. 112. 112. I'm going to have the caffeine. So it's a couple of like a large 12 ounce cup of coffee. But it's not one of those things we can blast your face off with three hundred milligrams of caffeine. That's what pre-workout is for. But this is more of a casual sipping energy drink that you can have multiple day. Not feel bad about yourself. And it tastes literally like cornstoda. Like out of a fountain. That McDonald's more soda. We also have cherry flush flavor, which tastes like. Wait. Red cherry flush. Frost thing. But it tastes delicious. So we're going to have a caffeine ourselves. Get to the gym. Get a quick workout because we're going to be back here in like two hours. So let's be on the room. I hate public germs. So we're here at this random esports class at the convenience. I don't know what you mean is. I'm going to try and bang with some shoulders. So I'm probably not going to talk much through it. But you guys know the typical drill. I'm going to try and bang on a lot of real delts. Because how do you tell me to focus on that this offseason. It's a bunch of real delts. A little bit shoulders. It's a quick 45 minute workout. We've got to get to the expo. So I'm hoping that I don't get bothered too much. And I can finish the workout quick. Wish me luck. I'm going to do it. I want to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Alright, so I'm not venturing over the dumbbell section. So it's going to be a machine cable kind of workout. It's a root out cable flies. People, lateral rates, that might say we're all going to do anyway. We're just machine only because the other machine's faking finished with a play load of machine. And then we'll see what time it is. And if I have to sample one more root out, it'll be that. And then, get that a lot on out of here back to the F. Like not getting happy when it's a more weight loss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's true. That's true. That one's good. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the rap on day two of six. Calvin throws the camera on me. I hope he says it doesn't often work. So we're going to try and try and cross the street. Talk to the camera until time. Let's rap on day two of six. That was a longer day. But it was a beautiful day. They're very organized. So I'm sorry we thought we're going to get some steak. She's taking this. She's taking this. We're almost running to it. But yeah, so we're going to eat. And I'll see you guys later tomorrow. I don't know. But it's day and error. It's in your reach out. Is it for me anymore? That's all he gave us. Has he? That's what he did. No, that's because we've worked in the past. No, because he's just... But we said he just snapped it all the boys in line with me. But I guess he was just rest on them. I don't know. Can you just like home? It was day all along. It's like... Yeah. We're all right, we're going to do that. I didn't think it through. I was like, oh shit. You know, he's not going to be able to touch the box. You're like, you're going to use it now. I don't know. There's no good. You're telling me to have a baker in the back of that one.

They're both torn now. Oh, let me go change my quads now. I'll read it. Everything happens for a reason. Come on! Come on, Chris! Come on, you're one in two, four, four, two, three, yeah, go, for me. What's the... All right, we love raw, but what do you make? Yes. The ultimate pre-workout concoction here. We're going to go next level gains. So, stick a comb. Let's do it three, four, five, six, six. So, and then actually, we got one more, so we'll be seven, because just like at the C7, seven, we'll send you a question. So, we'll go ahead and create one more. It's the C-bomb energy, you know. I love it. I love it. All right, let's do the great concoction game, guys. What we can do is we'll do a little tasting. I'll say south. Yeah, a little taste test. I know if it's good, you'll come out with it next week. I want a great bomb energy. Yeah, round time candy. Who would it ho? All right, let's just... We'll go with the captain. It's 200, but I'm just going to use this one for taste. So, we're going full-send mode. We're going to go EVP Extreme N0. We've got 200 milligrams of caffeine. It's got the nitrates. It's got the Argentine... Argentine trade. It's got the Citroën. It's got the mushroom extract for focus. And then we're going to add in the glyphogen, because it's off season. And so we're going to add in a little bit of that cherry to go along with that grape. So it's going to be either really, really good or it's completely disgusting, but it doesn't matter because you want to be huge. We'll need your shots. You ready? I'll need you. I feel like I've reached out to you. And these shaker cups will not have been certified to give you 20% more pump. To go along with your pre-workout. All right, let's go. It's magical. It's magic. It's really hard. It's really hard. Our wine's so hot for you. It's really hot. I'm like... You're... You're... Just like a test. It's kind of... I mean, the oxidative is in your back there. Okay. The white film in me? Yeah. Something starts running down your leg. You know why? It goes pepper. It's a great fun game. It's a great cotton candy with a stupid cherry to like a jack. And a half a lit of acu. So you're going to get the full mess. The focus. Now, when the use of tummies will throw them like you should or so? Yeah. Yeah. I need to say that. You can't. You just... What? Yeah. It's a long time. It shouldn't. No, the two of them. Did you get me to give me 20 grams? Yeah, well, I just give you 10 for now. Because you're used to three. It's doses three. So you give me 10? Yeah. 10, half a lit. And too much makes you shut yourself into give me three. Yeah, it's much like 20. If you haven't, you're not used to it. And you take a full 20. You're not used to it. You're going to feel a little grumbly through the sun. You're going to be like, should I? Yeah, I mean, you're going to be... You're going to be... You're going to be so cool. It's definitely done with the style. Oh, cool. It'll be fine. You'll be fine. The end result is going to come out of your roof. Oh, dude. The end result is trying to get out of me last night. I thought I'd be like an alien in me. I was driving home and I was like, something was going to come out of my chest. You? I'm out. I get, but I get to tell you this man, I still have heart-aid about it. I gotta tell you. Heart-aid looked way better than that. Yeah. Heart-aid? What I heard? That was kind of a disappointment last night. There's a little bit I was like, oh. I was waiting back because she was like, I wasn't good at it again. You hyped it up so much though. You're still my favorite. I didn't press it better. Am I a pin? Ooh, I don't know, me on. I don't know. I'm literally still like this. It looks way better. Because I had this brand that far. Yeah, well, like, if I take you to walk up and pull it off the barbeque, rather than, like, if you do, it was at their hands. Yeah. I was just confused as to what you were touching. Yeah. The next place we have to take is like, no, it's not for the last time. It's both on the road. It goes on the road. Pearl I like it. No, it's like you want to be a fan. No, you're cool. Maybe it's like your favorite? that went on for not a three-a-a little stretch on that one on the other. I can't remember there's one of them that was a little bit short and it might be the last hold down there. I think it was a converging one, right? What is up YouTube? We're back at Hubslerry Comjun. During the back today, honey said this is where I was trying to put on a few pounds on my back and on my arm so it's what we're doing here. It's a little bit stressful in the gym because a lot of people and I love you guys, but if you think of a gym and you're staring at me, just imagine if you were at a gym and every one at the gym you walked in the Alsteria, you pulled the front end so it's zooming in and filming. You know a little bit uncomfortable, so I'm pushing you guys in the front and finish my workout, come up after. I'm still here at my video, Tim is holding up and I'm very awkward. I'm making a comfortable. So yeah, back there, joining the huge. Soon you'll get all the back on, honey. Oh that's honey. This is a price of fame. Good. Good. Squeeze. Good. Good. You're in that, there you go. We're going to turn that wrist to that. You can really really fire that lower back. Back is a finesse body part. It's finesse movement. It's pull. One more like that. One more. Pull. Good job. I'm still getting shit on my Instagram about calling this two-mode deadlift shooting. You think it's shooting? Yeah, because I had camera was doing it. And I said, why do you have camera doing that? I said, you don't have a monitor. That's what shooting. I said, because you're shooting. You don't have a screen shoot. This is screen shoot. This is a screen shoot. It's a deadlift shoot. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good. Go in and pass. Go in and pass. Good. Good. Good machine. I have to get one of these. Told you. I told you. It's a little panado pieces. Yeah. Find yourself a bougie to do like this. But don't find yourself one because I'm here. Don't come. Leave your one. Shawk. Such a baby. I like it. I always do. More people come. More people. More people. More people. More people. Oh, staring at me. Woo. Woo. I'm hoping to press his upper blitz. That's right. Yeah, only for one day or two. No. It's because he's just getting back. He's getting a C legs back. It's true. He's a big deal for two of them. Yeah. We've got to go to places where they don't recognize unlike in the snow. The barn. We've got some good workouts in that barn. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm talking about during the off season. Since after the Olympia snowboarding going out to Canada, Mom and Pop, this house, eating and Kentucky, make it with meals that the luxury gourmet basement with cinnamon rolls. That's time to get back to the snow cinnamon rolls, those big muffins. Book. Booking those. I'm happy. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. No. We're in for him. I got two. What? Good job, man. Good. Good. That's good. You got harder when I went over him. Squeeze that back. Good. Squeeze. Overhand now. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. That's one. That's one. That's one. Good job. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Really? What's your special moment? There you go. A little bit of a little bit of a feeling of a lot. A little bit of a feeling of a lot. And a little bit of a stretch. Good. Just get a little bit of that one bar. No. Is that her back? I don't know. I don't know. Heard it. It's like, I don't know why it's just all low back. Because the angle doesn't allow me to get over it. It's like pulling me down. Oh, it's one of the four. It's like things that have been offered. Like. Okay. It's just trying to arch your back slightly. And then just get a good stretch and then pull. But don't go so far that it throws you off. I'm going to, I don't like your ergonomics with this one. It's okay. So that one we last time was better. Yeah, the other one was last time. You know what I mean? Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. You can't do that. I know what you're doing more than once. In the 225. For a little while. Nice. We're already both with field now. Oh, it's really nice. Puppet, the cherry. Right, they're off now. So no more bent over reverse crimp. Well, the first. Perfect. Heavy weight. We just got to fill our way up in the next month. 225 is a max. We just can't believe they've got sets covered. Calvin, make sure you call me. He'll just be face to me. I'll get a call from honeymen to work. Calvin is the back of the snitching on me. He's going to be holding the camera on live. You're going to do a face time. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. One more. Good. Good. The bodywork. See that barbecue put in the work. Brisk it in my veins. I can't even talk about it. You just say you don't like it. So it's not good. It's a hater. Very out of shape. I believe my sleep. Spring training is like. It is. It is like when I first like pushed myself like hard. Like I was doing like sets of like 15 and 20. And I was like literally hovering the garbage. It's like corny's like stopping dramatic. I'm like no, I'm literally throw up. Was that before after party weekend? I was like 170. 170. Fuck is wrong with me. I have no idea how much it wrong with me. I'm going to turn into a book. The list of things wrong with me. That's a very big book. That's the next. Yeah, the book. There's a book. There's a book. Yeah. The book is like right. The book is too bad. Yep. Yes. It's a full of machine and they're all over the world. It's really my reason to pull over machine is because we're trying to keep the way I'm elbow, keep the way off my bike side so we can't be fatigued in my arms. I guess I can't hear but I'm just trying to repeat what he's saying over there. It's not like I'm smart but I'm not. Let me see the whole goes back, right here. Let me get my motorcycle. Yeah, this is always mission needed for me to pull the little coach here. We're made for shorter people. It's not perfectly ergonomically good for my body. It's just one of these average strikes that you can find for a bigger ride. That one not a list. Jimmy Chin and Florida, in my favorite pool. That was the thing that came. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. One, two, three. Two, three, four, four, five. Two, three, four, five. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.

I Branch Made & motion I tried to train a bit early and belly feels full which honestly is kinda nice, because it's normally fucking empty all the time. I've been going a bit hungry, we get up in the late hungry, but it's a good thing because getting shredded, slowly moving forward every day. And yeah, feeling good. So I've been in a good structure lately if I actually sleeping, we've been bedded at nine o'clock last night and I woke up at like eight, which is fucking absurd. I was up a lot during the night, but it's still a long time for me in bed. Thanks guys, turn it down. But yeah, it's just a day. So it's a good day, Calvin's back in town. We had a cool little outing with GBRS which a bunch of contents gonna come out on our YouTube podcast and everything I'm talking to you guys about already. So that's coming as soon. But we're back in action now. Axel's also coming to town this week, which I'm pumped about. If you ever remember, Axel from 2020, one of the go-to Olympias that I did. The COVID Olympia, my training partner, one of my best friends from back in Ottawa. So he's coming down the chair with me for a bit and visit Florida. So he should be your Thursday, four days, so we're seeing a bit of him. But until then, it's just day. I've been using this multi-function, that camera was called machine cable, but I'm switching it up to the good old life that is packed that great. Now this is the exact same thing as from Canada that was in good life. Growing up my whole life. So throwing that on there, I've maxed it out. So I'm gonna be busted out of the gym pin. I just found it male gym bag, luckily I didn't even know I had it. So I'm gonna pull like a 25, maybe on it. It's starting to really warm up my pack get a good contraction and then move on to some pressing. So, for a start with. The shit I do for you. The shitty music I listen to for you guys. You guys can listen to the fans. I know you all are complaining about the fans. I have to listen to bullshit music, so we all losing. I'm still pretty lay, I'll see if I can put another 25 on the gym pin without breaking the machine. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that actually fell heavy. So for a several long time, a pack deck felt that heavy, so God bless the gym pin. Oh, I got it, it's still heavy. Damn, motherfucker. Oh, shit, that's 25 weight a lot less than I thought. That's a real job, sir. Oh, maybe I'm just tired. Yeah. Yeah. Go off. Good enough for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit. I'm starting to feel that just like, it's this transition, right? I'm just like, full right now because I'm eating okay enough. And I've been eating so much more sodium than I normally do, but I feel like empty, like, physically. Trying to lift heavy weight right now. It takes me like, like before calms down, it's filming. I was doing fucking band-shit rude doubts, pull down, fucking push-ups, everything just like, it did some stairs. Just get my heart going, can I have so tired? My body, my heart rate drops down like 55-60 and it's just so hard to get it up to get my energy going. So fucking picking up weights right now, just like part of the battle, just waking myself up empty already for a heavy set, like each fucking temp on increment feels like it's getting 40 pounds heavier, but I still got some strength in me, so this is the time where you've got to go. This is more mentally, you feel like you're stuck dry and you should be weaker. And everyone's like, I should be weaker, I'm depleted. So they start cutting back their weight, do a more volume, and that's when you start to lose size. And this is where mentally you have to battle through that bullshit. And still actually lift heavy weight, so force yourself to get up to the heavier weights. So you keep that muscle math even throughout your prep. Too many people cut it down just because they feel tired. None of that bullshit here. You know the prime example, when I did the one tense, it literally felt heavier than you in the 140s. And if I let that get my head about, fuck, I'm weak today, I'm going to do the 120s. Make sure I get enough breath, but I'm like fuck that. I'm going to keep going until I get the 140s. By then, suck it up a little bit, put your whole bit, think you're got 10 reps there. So perfect. You're going to break my foot there. Damn. I'm going to break my foot there. Whew. It feels really good. It's a brand new machine. Literally, this is one of the pure muscle and helped me build this gym and they're starting to line with the metal fabricator and the machine fabricator. And this is one of the pure iron pieces. We got the swing squat, a new hip press, and now this incline converging press. Like I told you the reason I like this one, and the problem with a lot of the new machines is they like press out or straight. When the point of the pack that's come across the body, bring the elbow across the body. And it's actually like the pressing movement is like incline and in a little bit. I feel really good. I know I just didn't clean, but incline is the goat. So I'm going to try this new machine out. This thing is fucking heavy, but beauty thing is I completely forgot. They were telling me about this when they made it. This little lever right here makes it unilateral or bilateral. So if you have like a stronger shoulder, stronger pecked in the other little lopsided it. And it forces you to push on something with a barbell. And it takes over. On this one you can make it unilateral, just like a fucking dumbbell. And that way you actually have full control in each arm. So you're not favoring one over the other with the weight. So probably we'll all week or like that, but I'm going to try it like that because symmetry, you know. I really like that machine. One of the best inclines I've ever used. It forces you to up and in. I really feel that squeeze in my upper inner pecked. Feels good. Alright, get him move on. Some flies start. Let's fly, do flies in the middle. Do lots of flies. But I'm going to superset these machines. Why the fuck not? I don't know what weight I'm going to do. I think I'm going to start with this one because it's one's really hard to get into without a partner. You need to like wedge yourself in. And then this one you can pop in easier. So typically do 110 on here. So I'm going to put it to like 90. And then I don't know what to fuck to do on this one. There's no numbers on the set of the machine. So I can never remember. Or a bat. Probably right there. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh shit. Okay, that was too heavy. First set was good. Fifth one is too heavy. So I'm going to drop it down a bit. I want to be able to actually like contract on the superset of this on the second set here. Like focus on really squeezing my chest tight. That's so heavy. I'll really just get in the stretch part of the motion. So I'm going to drop it. Try that again. I'm going to drop it. Fuck you microphone. Ah. Ecline. The lot of incline today. It didn't clean his life. Like I'm using decline. I use that. I do dips. Like body weight dips at the very end. Or this specific decline machine could mostly climb the machine hurt my shoulder, but this one doesn't. So I'm moving a neutral grip. Just to kind of hit the peck from a different angle. Keep my elbows locked and close to my body. Slightly flared just from my last squeeze down. And it's probably going to last pressing movement. Probably last main chest movement. I'll do like a little stretch. I'm going to try to lift the hips down. Maybe open it my chest and then probably call it a day. Maybe use the abs. Oh wow Think I only normally do three plates without fucking heavy, but it's like eight so I'm gonna do a top set drop set down ah Alright, this is the chance to finish here today. The flies are meant to be like a perfect fly. Obviously, I'm kind of like just trying to finish the wrap. There's no tension on a dumbbell at the top of our wraps where you want the most queues you lose it on a dumbbell, but that's why I'm just doing them at the end just to focus on the stretch. Just trying to open my pecks up and get like a awaited contraction in a stretch. She can be better posture, stand up straight, the shoulders back. And yeah, and then I'm just going to burn out with some push-ups at the end here, just to kind of really fatigue the chest and call it a day. So finish it up with this. OK. Take yourania back up your assignment. My rap? Back at the trigger game. I think last time, I said just like that, about looking forward the chagrin, not in prep and here we are deeper in prep, chagrin. So I still have to just ration myself about what I can eat. But still nice to enjoy your food, because my last meal is nothing but salmon or steak. So myes will have a taste of the dishes. So Calvin's back in action and fucking busting out the chagrin. We leave it at my back here because I don't know. I get to torture this mouth. And now the benefit of eating much of them won't. So we're going down some sticks. We need some tea going, some feles and some salmon. Fuck it up. All right, can I? I don't know how that actually is for you. But I got hit with a wall and I'm tired now. 9, 23, 7 minutes away from my bedtime. So for that being said, I still love you stir, bun-n-we, hair-dement. We still have many things like labor. Thank you for coming to see me to someAM.

Armday was just getting a little bit and fun. I said and fun. I said and yeah, it's so quick to react to your life, everybody. I said this getting a little bit and fun. I'm gonna say that's like two rows in that line in a minute. What is up? You're welcome to Armday with Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Seabun. Beech ring. Bahn. Walker. A case. Getting a little bitch. I can only say that because I'm a skinny little bitch. But anyways, we have a fun little thing that I'm gonna share with you guys finally after a lot of work. A lot of hiccups. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you what went wrong with it yet. So I'll tell you that maybe that story to later time. But you guys want to hear about the insights and outs of my perhaps and all the secrets and everything. So we compiled all of them into this beautiful bottle of pre-workout. I think you fucked up before the gym. This is gonna be what's getting me through prep this year. Give me to my work and I thought, I just lay down and fell asleep and on the fuck I'm tired. And we moved, we removed our office and we just grabbed my couch, I'm rug and some chair and shit and I was like, be tired. I'm a cool little bitch. So today we're gonna be putting Christmas secrets stuff, Come on, we'll all together and of course, six and two scoops. As all pre-workouts are meant to be taken. And obviously, after you take this, you just only have a little bit samples. But this is something I think we've had this in the books for four months. Mainly able to have to change it. Like I said, I don't know if I'm not telling you why we had to change the yet, but it looks beautiful now. It is like a soft little touch, little chalkboard. And we got some like hidden little messages in there. That you'll have to read if you get it. But it takes a lot of shit so it takes just like winning. It's your favorite one. It's so hard for me to everyone though with a quarter of your favorite flavor. And when we checked this every day, we see how many new ones all the time. So my favorite one's usually always the newest one. But three peaked came back, but this better than three peaked right now. So, apparently my favorite, but like I said, if I take this for the next eight weeks, I probably want something new. And it's very limited edition. This is not ever coming back again. We made one run of this. This is Christopher's secret stuff to winning four hell in a pit. And it will not be coming back ever again. So it's very exclusive. The one run in the weird. Completely done with it. And you won't see it again. And we will not be coming out with the flavor in a different label either. It's just RIP to Christopher's secret stuff. So get it what he can. What is the drop? One day. One day. That's 12. What day is that? What month is it? So October. October says November 2nd. Yeah. November 2nd. Also got a bombaw since mainly for Calvin. Because I can't eat all the meals in it. The monitor's so specific for perhaps. But, I'm curious to eat the whole thing. And the duration. Come, Vulking Ray now. We're getting fucking jacked up. This is how we do it. You took the ice out. What are you doing, man? I melted it. Oh really? Yeah, it was about ice packs in it. It's fine. It's still going to put it in the fridge. There you go. But anyways, we did a big update to the bumbox. Turkey, rice, vegetables, simple thing. But we have a chicken stir fry, which Calvin ate. Everything will want to go. We've got the fucking delicious. And we have bombana, nap muffins in here. Let me just look at some of the ingredients for you guys. Banana, organic, o-flour, maple syrup, walnuts, egg, extra virgin olive oil. I want to know if it's cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla extract, sea salt. Not make natural ingredients. And they taste delicious. You don't know how much I wish I could have some muslim before the gym. Honey, please give me a muffin. I would love some. hungry and very hungry. But yeah, so there's that. There's the bum bowl, which is the past of meal. But you have to customize it now to what meals you want to be in it. So, however, make it for meals.com. You can use co-team for a little discount and be sure to check it out. But others in that, we got to get some gym because as always, I'm laid as fucking buns. I'm going to be able to cook when you're always laid. Everywhere I go, people will have to cook your own sleep. I ran on my own time in prep. Sorry, I'm sorry. So, that's all we got going on. I got you guys to gym. Yeah. I know my bad, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to leave. I'm like, $25. $40. $40.25 minutes. Yeah, I'm a little bit. I'm basic and boring.

I'm like holding it all the... You're gonna do it. I think my butt's just gonna rip when I do this. I love spider curls, but you need a partner. To get that last like durefs, that's a little extra squeeze. It's like everything. So we start with preacher, mooner spider curls. I'm saying I like doing this, but he got a crazy pop. He's getting. He's got this getting what? He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. There are too much blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little bit. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. I'm just gonna do this. He got a crazy pop and it's hard to curl. It's done. I've just got a little bit of blood in it. So the spider curl makes your arms hang a little farther away from your body. They're below your heart. Before whatever reason, whenever I do these, not a lot of people, you would kind of almost lose a pump. But it's a good contraction. So we're getting a little blood out of the arms. And we have a training part and they can help you squeeze a little bit. It's good. Plus, it's a very different curl motion from the preacher curl here. So we're doing these secondary and then half of this. These are dumbbell curls and then we'll superset it all over the day. There. Fall down. Give this a show. Ooh. Your knees. you oah ah Wh By oh another high That's the C7 back and forth. Talking to go for them. You like to fly to McQueen? I'm not. Can it be end? Yeah. But, could it be two of us? We'll just bounce back to the first. That seems like that will sound like a unmute. All right. That's 1 맛. Let's go grab your food I don't care. I'm gonna do it. But shorter pasta is like a bunch. One more. That's that was the start of the game. Just a minute. Alright the wrap on today. Our videos Mr. Bon Walker. Dude, our name is just at the company immediately. So I cannot at least film skinny because we got bigger. I'm just a man. But wrap on today's workout. Oh my god. This is sexy. This is sexy. It might be too scuba. I come back in and steal all the jokes. So I cannot miss my animal. But that's the wrap on today's video. I like that. I'm losing my money. I did some things. I'm focusing on the time. I can't focus. Alright so I don't know what I'm saying anyway. So I mean get some 13 set of me to get huge. Go home. Get more huge. Get skinny. And that's it. So see you soon.

How to be confident, see you on a great question, horrible wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, that I was like, witness to hear that was very different. And it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just to think that's here with you. If you're someone nervous, pick something small, this here is you and do it. It's just like fixing the help, keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confidence. The possible not to. Come on, come on Chris! Come on, you're one, two, Oh, come on, come on, you're one for you guys! Come on, come on! What's that? Sorry, last Friday. You told me what you're doing. Two scanning. Yeah. Scan your bed. I want the middle�. Oh my god! I think it's actually really good though. You don't count. Apparently I don't count because I don't eat this stuff. Yeah. What's the milk from cookies when it was really good? This is better, my opinion. That's right. Ready, go, Chris likes it. What's up, YouTube? I'm tired today. I'm very tired. I'm sick and fucking tired. I'm driving for an hour to this goddamn gym. I'm serving at the office. So I need my gym to be open. But today was really good. I got blood work that's what I'm trying to say. Perhaps starting soon, some of the blood work makes sure I'm healthy. Body's ready to rock. Create a fuck-shick, fuck-shit. Up this one, be up to 13 speed grain now. But good blood work. Get back to five days, Hunter are going to review. And then lock him low and fully into this prep. And get spying right now after he came down. So feeling good. I'd take two days off before. First thing like three days off for blood work through your results aren't too good. But I took two days off and want to take them to shem off. And then... Here I am. I don't know if you're fucking going to go on this. So yeah, the shoulders and by a set of stay-framing, I'm catching up for a missed day. So to mining, we're getting a hat. Doing this this week, oh my foot. Five steps a week in my delts. So putting vices at the beginning of this workout, mixing themselves, finished with delts. But I'm actually pushing my vices up there that they need to be. But this isn't normal program, it just has to take you through days off and I don't want to not change arms for like nine days or one, eight days or whatever. It would be a smooth sweat. So hi, tell me now. Put them in the beginning of the workout. Warm up delts and shoulders. And then finish with like three delts and normal. So your number one foot's weight is Alright. I don't really recommend warming up the biceps for shoulder best. Probably should done this first, but it's still feel good. Doing that little pives, curls with one arm, pives curls the other for biceps, like my cheek curls for getting like a crazy bicep pump. And like pounding some mind-must connection at the beginning of the bicep workout. It's been helping me a lot. It's too much. The man is a hell of pump that turns your shoulder press, but we'll take what I do. This is a good machine. What? That's a good machine. That's a pure delved tree overhead. I mean, you know a brand new thing you could have used this. Some of the things are like thirst for, so I don't have that brand. Well, there's a few others like this, but they don't have a brand like that. I have the max book. I don't like that one. That's too short man. That's short you're it. Are you the short king? Alright, so just a percent cross lateral raise with front raises. Just trying to pump the hell out of my shoulders. It sounds a lot of volume like 10 reps of each super set. What about good to do like a. Kill your front delved, your side delved, and then move into a front delved. And because my lateral delved with fatigue, force me to use my whole hand-sharier delved, and it really may be burn out weight quicker, such as the way I played that, and make sure you have a round shoulders, rather than off-lighter ones. So, finish with the re-delveds of the same reason. The vice steps, we're gonna go home and follow it today. Alright, so let's get me around on today's shoulder by Seperke at a random workout that I don't normally do, but yeah. Hopefully we have enough footage right now, but Calvin's gonna be heading out of the vicinity of the Ming for a while, so we're gonna be back in about 12 days. I don't have my camera. But I'm gonna vlog a bit maybe, and if my gym's at him, I'll definitely be vlogging. I also want to vlog more of this crap. So I'm gonna be stealing Calvin's camera, I'm gonna commit to the YouTube Grand and buy another one of his cameras, and then vlogging the morning, film a Super Junior Day workout, and make a little bit more entertaining content. But, kill I said I was gonna answer some of the big questions in the last few videos, and I didn't, I have some save now, I'm gonna quickly run through them, wrap up the video, and just gonna run into it. This is from YouTube. So if you have leave questions in YouTube, I'll try and screen-chop them and save the man to the money where I feel like it. First question is, says, do you have a protein with that sucre loss? So the raw protein that actually speeds in the stevia? The sea bump proteins are sweet, it was super low. So if you look at the raw ones, they are grass fed, New Zealand way, with stevia. Sea bump is not, that's why the flavors are a little bit more like me and chocolate chip and stuff like that, and similar to a cereal, they're a little bit more playful. I guess you could say in the sea bump line because there's a question, do you ever feel that traveling, cuts into your workout time? And also that others are hungry, and then the gym every minute of the day, that is concerning you. So I guess it's saying it's my life to track me too much into the worry me. I'm not sure if now, I think I've found pretty well to travel up the beginning of the year, and when you compete once a year, I'm like others, so that's my advantage. And I honestly wouldn't feel fulfilled living a life at 28 now, which I did this for a few years, that you're sleeping, training, eating and sleeping, eating and training, doing nothing else. I really love the fit, this is rebuilding everything I get to do during the day. The travel I get to do for the business is, and then everything like that, it really feels me gets me excited, and if I ever feel like I'm like behind or something, you just kind of give me a little chip of my shoulder to kick myself in the ass when I got home. And training even harder. So I don't feel like it's putting me back at all. Regardless, it's making me a lot happier and setting me up long term for my future, so I'm just enjoying life and doing the best I can with what I got. Thanks, Juan. I'm always at the gym training for three hours. Is that too long? So the pump I get, then it's amazing. I mean, if you're feeling fully energized and sick of it, three hours, I mean, it's not horrible. And I don't tell people to do what I do now, because when I was younger, and I could train for three hours, I used to do it with different three hours every single day, almost, probably six days a week, one day I was too hung over. And I felt great. I was getting strong, I was progressing about 20 years old, and nothing to beat me up. So I was just enjoying the talent with my friend, you're a gym, you can still show, I could have sped it out better. But if it's not taking away from the rest of your life and you're truly training hard, and you're making progress, you're getting stronger, getting bigger, whatever your goals are. Who's this luck here? But I promise you both time you're like 28 miles or even younger, you're about to catch up to and you're not going to train that long. So enjoy it while I last. And if you have a busy life and you feel like taking out of it, we're going to be more efficient with your work. All right, last question. How to be confident, see you, Bob. Great question. Corporal wording. But I'm going to speak once, specifically, saying that I was like, witnessed this here, that was very different, and it's kind of obvious, but doing things that scare you, build confidence in every aspect of your life, not just the thing that scares you. I learned this this year when I was doing a bunch of public TV events. If you're keen to, they either keep steps, you're seven hours, and a bunch of stuff that I would never do. And every time they were coming up, I was trying to find a thesis about government, because I did want to do them because I was scared to me. Every time I did them, I would anxious my heart was racing, and felt like I was going to suck them up. And I went through with it, I did okay, and after I'd settled a little bit more confident. And I kept doing it, and I realized after a while, my day-to-day life and other decisions that I was making stuff I was doing, I just felt more confident. Because something that once scared me, where I thought I was going to fail, and I'm not being about it, I thought, not mine. I got through it, proved to myself that I'm more resilient, and I thought, and then I'm that's not an aspect that your body is more, or your mind is more resilient in every aspect, not just public speaking, but just full, like, aptitude of life. So I think that's one of the best ways. If you're fucking someone nervous, pick some of the smallest gears you and do it. It's just something that you can keep doing, keep doing it, and you're going to build confident, the possible not to. This is a help for me and it's useful. But yeah, that's it. So like, as watching, we will see you guys soon. Hopefully, the gym will be ready, and next video I'll be going to try and up again. Up, thank you guys for where my gym is at, so this should be done in that like, 10 days I am fingers crossed, a hate drive. Yeah, see you soon. Love you guys, catch you later.

Oh, I thought you meant that one. There's a yellow bench over there. I don't know. I don't like the most. All right, so here today, in Tampa Bay, we sent stuff by daily each first, a beautiful breakfast. And I'm not sure how to build by it yet, but if you'd always for all those, we got a sandwich. This looks like shit. We got a lot of stuff to do. They didn't even try. I was like, can I build my own sandwich? Yeah, I'm like, okay, so egg. How do you want them? It's scrambled. She's like, okay, do you want anything else? I'm like, like, she meant that you want anything else. I'm like, can I put more stuff on the sandwich? Oh, yeah, I'm like, can I put turkey on it? She's like, yeah, sure, I'm like, okay, what do you want? To Calvin, I'm like, I guess it's all I get on my sandwich. So I left it at that, but the bowl actually looks pretty fire.

So the thing before is always the thing. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Like, didn't you start playing? Yeah. And that will make my wish look bigger because it could end like this. I think it was in the sit like, right there. So you don't have to stretch it. And then I'll add that elastic in the crotch. Yeah. Just to give it the ease. And then I think the waist is tight enough. I don't want you to block them, but I mean, you must have the heel. Yeah. And we want you to drop any of this. What do you think about the hip-hop? Yeah. It's like, go up the track. Wait a moment.

Alright, so Saturday morning with a bit of a shit show. Um, pretty much every night. Let me have a little bit of a 6 to 7 to 8 pounds of water and what he and put me really dry and really good. And then near Friday night Saturday morning, I just stopped flushing water. My body was just like, oh, we're going to hold on to it now. And then I had also a lighter two hours already. But he had to do a good cup water to be lower by Friday morning. We started. So I had less water to flush. And then I'm eating a lot and I woke up on that Saturday morning, showed it all days to look my worst. I had locked in a morning in a very long time and I normally wake up like peel, shredded dry and like ready to rock. Build my confidence, get off stage. I didn't mind doing my thing. This time I wake up and I'm like, oh boy, like, I lost like a pound and a half, two pound, maybe not five or six or seven. And I didn't look like I should have. And then honey, like, technically, that you up, I'm like, yeah, I'm up now. And he was already hick waiting outside my door just sitting there. He knocks. I'm like, oh boy, here we go. And then he comes in and has me hit some poses and we're in a hotel room at like, five thirty in the morning. No sun can be in so the lighting is horrible. And the old hotel rooms are just like a little orange like coming down on me. I have no mirror. I don't know what I look like fully, but I can just stress in it. I see like, what the fuck? He literally is like, what the fuck happened? I have like, but I don't know what do you mean? And I could tell that I was not where I need to be at that point. So that's when it was kind of like, little stress, little panic. You know, it didn't really good peak peak. You know, everything was going really smooth. So, you know, you never gonna have a time where everything perfect. Obviously, this was like, a little moment of like, yeah, good. He's a little bit less stress just to throw out you. And it was one of the moments where I was like, you know, I had set a fighting to like, it shouldn't be stress. It shouldn't be the shouldn't be that big. This is just part of this journey right now as president's fans. But I was stressed. I was worried. I like, fuck my heart sank. I went shut down on. I was just like sitting down like, what do we need to do? And he kind of is pacing thinking like, what does the body need right now? What's missing right now? And he eventually, the wizard honey just like, what can I be thinking? This is why like a good coach can help so much because, you know, to problem solve like that. And understand after his years of experience, what like causes the body to look like this and need this, you might think it's too much water to little, too much food to this, who knows? You know, but he was like, you know what, you look at his flat, your body's been burning through food like absolutely crazy. I think he need more food. Maddie had bought me a burger the night before, which it didn't eat today. We didn't think I needed to have a super clean up until this point. He's like, eat that burger right now. Hey, it's that burger. He's like, have some rice cakes with almond butter and jam. The corn you made before, rice cakes covered it on the butter and jam like a shit ton of almond butter to get more fat to me. And then I started posing and I started to look a little bit that and he's like, all right, human rights actually need more food. So then I had like three whole like 200 grams of sweet potato, 200 grams of y'all of potato, 250 grams of rice, 150 grams of steak like fillet and covering ketchup and some salt. And just mash that down and it was so much food and this is like 530 in the morning to like 630 in the morning. It's 635, I had eaten like a 3, 4,000 calories. I don't know how much food, but a lot of food now. It's like, which is so waking up, still stressed. It'll be like, it might body just like, that just like lose everything over. And I used to have to panic when it showed it and you don't look like you should look. It's like, what's going on right now? But honey's been here before. We've been through it. You know, we've been competing a tilin' peer for me seven years. I don't even know how many years. My fifth one on a pitaid off. You got to keep calm. It's just gonna happen. And it's not gonna be perfect. Don't expect perfection. Expect chaos. Expect whatever happens happened and when it happens, it just take it as it is. So that's what we were doing. And then after eating all that food, I started eating some poses and I slowly started to look better. And I was like, I could see just a little relief in them. And then all of a sudden, it's like, you're pretty motherfucker, you get, you're gonna pull this together like we're good. And I didn't look like shit at the beginning, but I mean, we're trying to win a fifth one pitaid off who would be the best in the world that we're looking for, a very high caliber of look. I still would have looked good, but we're looking for a very specific, very high level look. So once I started to come back, when I sit with poses, the salt, sodium, food, all started coming to my muscle. Water started coming out of the skin into the muscle, looking a little bit better. And my physique started to come together and I started to look jire. Cuts were getting deeper in my glutes, my abs were starting to jire. And again, whenever I have like soft lower abs, that's just why I'm not looking good. And yeah, so it all started to come together and he looked at me and he laughed at her. Yeah, we're gonna be able to just gain that confident look. You like, all right, we got this like, we're pulling it together, you got this like you look good. We're gonna do it. And I would like I started crying. It's like there. We should have that a little bit of stress. You know, I've been, I put so much like subtle expectation and pressure on myself to like be so fucking perfect. Sometimes, and then when something goes wrong, that's when it shows me how much pressure and I expect to show how my self, and I'm like, it's not going the way it needs to be right now and then I'm just like locked up and tense. And then when it started to come together again, it was like a little tear relief, I was like, all right. You know what, let's laugh at that now. You know, I literally laughed, I was like fuck, all right. It's just part of this experience. This is gonna be part of what's gonna make it so sweet again when I step on stage. And I look good and I feel good. This is gonna be one of those little stressors. It's low moment, like the high feels so much better. It's spoken about my main little and peace beaches. But the lower parts make through better. The lower parts make the higher parts feel better. So this is just one of those moments set of fighting it, not wanting to be there, not wanting to have happened, accepting it for what it is, moving through it, and taking it as it is. So that's what we did, got it together and let it a little bit of relief. I had a little laugh, I have stress we were for about an hour and a half. I had a laugh about how much fucking food I ate in an hour and a half, just like whatever I could fit in my belly was so much food. And then yeah, that's what happened on Saturday morning when the cameras were shot because it was a bit of a chaos. Even that it's just a, it's hard to put chaos into hard to put words into the chaos I was experiencing that morning. But it's all part of the fun of body building, going part of the fun is repeating that you never know. It's gonna happen. The body does not seriously change and it doesn't list its science or biology. It just does whatever happens in that moment. Then you have to take it for what it is. Thankfully, honey's experience, you know what to do. We pulled it together and that's where we're at now. So remember all of the rest of the videos we want to give you guys a update on what happened on that Saturday morning. So hopefully you guys enjoy the rest of this video.

Well, Bums in the my cabin this morning, I was like walking along and I went like right in whatever the fuck this little thing is I'm comparing it now it's a bruised I'm injured This is the kind of shit I'm talking about right I'm doing it in the right now and I'm injured people make fun of me that I made it in glass I literally broke my toe with the fucking blanket on the ground I chipped over and stepped on my toe and it went black and purple I can step on it for a week It's just my life so I got to grab myself and bubble around What am I protective helmet? Can I kill myself and then I can fucking five weeks? What is up YouTube? I'm a training partner Puts in the doggo here today At the bringing over here having a panic attack on the car because she thinks she's going to the vet But just bringing her to the good old gym She loves it here, but as you get so fucking hot we have to lock her up in the air conditioned spot But they throw it to get over her. She got a fucked up little arm She's going to walk on my tail and shit so she likes the rubber flooring Yeah, it's a nice little getaway for the wet but on tour we're doing here today training chats today Good old bum lifting club Um, that's all it's going on It's Saturday it's early in the normal training a little bit but I've been having a trainer earlier in the day because Post like three four PM I got fucking no energy talk to not here by like one or two I'm fucked so If he hits a chest today, I'm not going to create a heavy Shandar really control everything so move good weight A focusy on controlling the traction so turn off some cables warm up and get going You Just to give that instead up these cables however the fucker won't hide with whatever I've ever really joined putting them in the middle of like Cross fly and then I start with the press Hit my shoulder so it will fucked up if I go like heavy to failure on a fly so I like to some depth of earth So I'll go right before failure and then I break it in a bull super close to body and I press I'm gonna finish up my pack there and it's got like no tension on my shoulders so Good way to get a stretch and I should finish this set so I You They're lucky I like you are normally in here fucking blasting old school M&M or something better than Epidemic sounds for this copyright bullshit YouTube music but it is what it is You guys were like called me a psychopath training with no music and I'm like I can't play music on YouTube So Comey psychopath but you guys would have different YouTube videos without it But I'm gonna move on to some dumbbell press. I went up to the one 50s last week So good. I got like either nine or something I'm not gonna go that heavy today because like I said I'm really trying to have really good My most connection right now and I'm getting leaner a little bit drier I bought it's getting tighter Especially my chest really tight. I just had Dr. Marlin Works for my whole chest yesterday so I don't want to like fucking the apps. I'm gonna do like 140s You're trolling a bit more still trying to get like eight to nine reps and then Go back up to that so You Bums into my fucking Cabin this morning. I was like walking along and when like right in Whatever the fuck this little thing is under my tricep Fucking hurt now. It's a bruise I'm injured This is the kind of shit I'm talking about where I fucking do anything right now And I'm injured people make fun of me that I made a fucking glass I literally broke my toe with the fucking blanket on the ground. I chipped over Sceptone my toe and it went black and purple like in step on it for a week. It's just my life so I got a fucking wrap myself and bubble around Put in my protective helmet And now I'll kill myself and next fucking five weeks You You You Either I guess really correctly that I was gonna need a nine reps Or put itself limiting belief on myself my body limit me a nine reps, but I got a nine rep Good, I was still super controlled I never wrap even the last one Locked it in just like I wanted It's not really good my Chess was taking over everything arm the chicep stuck it not too activated Exactly what I wanted we try to get the exact same amount of reps with 10 pounds later now My muscular endurance Strength endurance, but it was fucking one call it The start of the decline solve a good amount of strength right now My ability to sustain it's really what yeah was fucking dropping so I'm just gonna keep pushing what I can Trying new things 130 next I do drop that and watch it You You I don't think I've shown this piece on my youtube yet. I'm only a powerful chest out here But we just got this piece in like a few weeks ago I love it because a lot of the new pieces don't have converging They're honestly like self-sip converging non converging But the point of the Tach is to bring the elbow across the body so the direction drive you're gonna a little bit closer My favorite machine is a flex leverage played low to machine. I'd never even heard of this one I think it's not a list which is like the same ship pretty much, but it feels amazing so I'm super happy we got this For crap because the one that we're buying is very similar but it feels weird to Hear muscle literally just but like we gotta find you something today to use a flat press That was a good hurt my shoulder So I'm gonna be moving on to this That's pretty fucking heavy to a mic just replace drop it down just more volume but this is even number three Kid Like Oil She's hard to get in, narrow, but I feel so damn good. This is like the cheat code tech fly. So we didn't do any blind one and this one I think we should do if you set them the flat. It feels like it's sitting a little bit more full. But my chest a little bit less front doubt. Maybe it's going to tighten or whatever. So I'm going to pump out three or four sets of these, get some nice volume in and move on. Also, I never wear fucking this shit anymore, but we have no my boy David laid. I love me some David laid some magic tricks together. Remember the OG YouTube days. You should be magic tricks and she set me so with this club with Jim Shark so try it on. We love and these tight tank tops in this Florida heat just feeling like there's not like sweaty, but moving on you. So we're giving shot. It feels good. It's good to be polite. So we should have David hopefully get him out to the Jim soon and we can get it working. We should have taken a beer and some show me some more magic tricks. He's taking it now, he's taking some here. This shop is so cool. He's having a drink. We can put his drink easily on the grill. So did the deep butter full of spice. He didn't stretch after his Cola Beer. He lifted someone out of the bowl and started the boxing camp. After two Mini Stars for Vietnamese living performances. I gave him a massage. Because they get tired and lazy and I have that much of a beginner. I got a long neck of the long spine. I've been long neck over here like the late before time. So I always get stuck like this and make chest and really tight. I sleep on my side, I'll just fuck. So now I'm gonna finish off my chest. Workouts with some of the last few sets holding in a stretch. So I'm gonna do like dips now, like two sets, body weight. There's one more thing and at the end of each set like that I'm gonna hold it in the stretch. I'm really just trying to make sure at the end of my chest, we'll get my stretch by the chest that's open and wide. It's stretched out rather than a hunched over and tight. So let me try to do that more, stretching more, all the bullshit that. We all know we need to do that we don't do it. So maybe I'll actually do it five weeks and then never do it again till next prep. So I was Calvin pointed out I'm not an idiot doing dips in the middle of the machine. It's just the newer version of the dip attachment with the older squat. I can't talk cage. I was fucked up in the style that you can see by 10 feet tall too. Sadly the bars don't fit the other way so I have to move everything, put them in the middle, trying to smash my face on the middle of the bar. But we're now doing decline pass with the put on a machine over there. We're just at the end of everything with chest work, get a little chryse up a little bit of peck minor and scoop that up there. So this is gonna be probably second life thing. Do a fly stretch and then call it a day, probably with dips and abs, hopefully. I'm not trying to actually do a working set there in just Marlin with Caprax with some struggles to like stretch my peck. A lot of times like I just have muscle that's fucking tight and it's pulling my biceps up where my daltre something. So he said she's going to a really deep stretch with a lighter weight than you normally do like a fly and then just like move through that with a deep stretch and normally you do it because normally if I'm doing flies with like 60 plus or whatever I'm a lot more cautious of how low I'm going because I don't want to hurt myself but if I take 30s, 40s just let it stretch as far as I can and you can track the muscle in that stretch position. I'm actually training that muscle to work in that stretch position rather than just sitting in stretch therefore also helping your mobility even better. Trying to give me a fucking open up a little bit more so we're trying it out. Ryan Terry told me that his best ab exercise hanging leg raises in knee raises. So all I do is hanging leg raises in knee raises maybe my abs will look like Ryan Terry. That's how it works. Very true. I mean ship when you see like all the guys from the 90s that have like the sick abs it would just be hanging to fucking hang leg raises like all the time. Yeah yeah. Mealow swears by him like I think that's the thing. A big lot of him did is because he just looked sick. Yes, he didn't pull her she's like, he's like, yeah like that. Yeah, he's such a good photo. Yeah they look good or it works. Either way you're winning. It's funny like from doing a lot of those I thought my like abs strength was good like doing lots of like rope crunches like machine crunches. The cable rope crunches like like racing stuff. Now I'm trying to do like bodyweight shit. It's like my bodyweight which is lighter but it's like impossible. You know the friend. Yeah like mechanic for everything just blown a lot of the lower work shit that's like on the floor like you just use my bodyweight and so much harder fucking completely different. You go and you like, but men's with you guys who like when they're on stage fucking fully like yeah that's hard for that long. All right it's gonna be wrap on the today's chest day. The little abs did a little stretching on my inversion table and we had to run over to the warehouse which is so far away from my gym it's like in a different city so it sucks. But we had to come over here because Ian had a package ship too. He's even Mario this one chip challenge shift over here because he's a fucking psycho pass and he's gonna eat the world's hottest chip on the weekend and he's not doing it here because I'm not fucking even you know breathe that shit in. This Calvin looked one when we were in Dallas and he should have passed the next day and it was fucking burning but so that's that. But I also had to come over here because we were launching this is kind of the small thing but so school updated Bumbox for mega-fit meals. It's going to make a signature on there switch it up a little bit, a little bit cleaner. I like simplicity so we get the simple. But we're gonna be running a little bit of a promo. They're gonna be launching some new meals. It's gonna be salmon and rice of Apache steak meal which is fucking fire and a new peanut butter and jelly in the Bumbox. So you guys can add some different types of meals there if you want. But when we launched the new box and the new meals and shit inside there we're gonna be giving away the first 150 orders they're gonna get signed signature of a signature thing. Post there whatever the fuck you want to call anything. So I gotta sign fucking all of these. That'll be fun. This is where I signature become the C.B. instead of a C-bomb. Say half the time. Well yeah so that's gonna be wrap on today's video. Oh yeah. I don't know. That's all that's going on. I just checked down a shake. Get it going home. Some food and I'll see you guys in the next video. So peace.

What the fuck man? I didn't have it in me. So you were tiring? Yes. You throw over him. Come on, Chris! Come on, you moron! We come on, let me in, Jim. Come on. Let's go, Jim. You're so sick! It's not really bad. Really? Really? It smells like... You know like that smell? Like there's sweat on like a rubber like mat? Like that's what you smell like. I mean, I think the fuck did Chad move too. You fucking asshole. I could tell a lot of things are here feeling too, but I can hold those in to be nice. I'm trying to make people know what it's like right now. What is up YouTube? They've one of those days where I missed a month or two months of time to have too many appointments and I slept like shit and people are meeting me in the parking line. I'm talking about business when I come to the gym and it's just like, I'm tired of this bullshit today. I kind of like that, so I'm trying to fucking tune it out. If you're who you're like, I'm building my energy back up. Because I was fucking about to fall asleep, but now we go back up. I'm like, I don't have five left, five quad days left until the last day. So I know time the bitch out, I've got to gather my shit. Not be skinny bitch. Don't be so skinny. Put that in my mind. But it's like day four and a half, if I have five and a half weeks, I don't even know anymore, but it's getting close. It's great. I'm turning off the Clarkson Shins, I was on the treadmill walking backwards. Four of them and warm up my knees. That helps me so much. When I start exercising, it just hurt way less. So, if any of you do do that for like five minutes, a little warm up, if you're a blood flow and high-resistant, I'm going to run up the knees and then I come on here. Creek's off a little bit on the quad extension. And then we'll do a few presses. Call it a day. And let's see. I took a lot of bruer ke with a lot of bait out in today. And itching, sweaty. I was cold now, I'm hot. I'm hot. I'm going to take the hoodie off. I'll be a merch coming soon. What was a very subtle ray on black, this paint fit is pretty. I really like subtle monochromatic shit right now. So, that's a pity. Got a good pick that off. This is a shirt, champion mentality, a lot of bigas on the back. Pressure the pretty much. Can't even tell me. She put the mindset together for the final drop before they won't be up. This is a good final drop for a while of things. It's a pretty much a lot after. So, we're doing a cool one hoodie for the crew neck. Here are the t-shirts. Another piece that we've never dropped before. So, I'm pumped about that. We're finally getting it all in today and tomorrow. I'm going to shoot it. So, you guys, I don't know what I'm taking. But the merch shop we were saying. We're shooting it tonight. Shooting it tonight. Yeah. Shooting it tonight. This is a day to the, so you guys will see everything soon. But, yeah. So. I'm here with the people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you have to say about all the people I think you're going to retire now? I've figured it out. I've figured it out. I've figured it out. I've got a lot to say about that. But I don't know if I can get into it already now. I'm going to start as a random video with that. But it's like, I thought I'd have to. I don't really want to get into it. I couldn't even let the leg work out. So. I don't know what I think actually. I'm saying it's going to be the yellow in the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. s I started doing these in a much different light position. You threw higher, narrow of wide and move around. But now I've brought my feet a lot lower on the pad. And pretty wide. And it's kind of forces my full back to stay on the pad here before you get a bit of a bit of a bit of a big none here. Fuck my little back when I pushed you hard. That left me keep my back on the pad. And it dropped me onto like a hip press. So I can push from like my upper quad and upper quad here. So I'm kind of building that quad sweep, rather than like getting glue very easily. So I don't know, works for my quad. I'm trying to slow down a little bit at the bottom of the wrap. I've got a bouncing, but I still like the bounces, like jumps. So that's the both worlds. I'm going to get a lot harder. I'm not sure if we're going to be really moving today. Like seven a.m. or just seven a.m. work. I'm going to keep my balance. I'm going to get a lot harder. I'm going to start working out early in the day. Like seven a.m. work. Just. I'm going to keep my balance. I can't keep going. I can't keep going. You're fine. Three go. Two go. I'm going to really like this. I think it's like it's like it's a different thing right now, but they love me to really like, open my hips and go deep. I don't like how I'm trying to do that, but I'm going to keep it a little bit lower on the. Hacks why? I'm going to get it from like, the a great emotion right now. So I'm not like getting tight to spot, especially then like getting leaner and tighter. I'm going to keep like stretching and contracting my muscles fully. Especially my legs keep that like size and you start to get that like separation. Up into my hips and everything. Keep kind of pressed like this, help with that a little bit. So we're doing that. It's a bit too much machine putting plates on and off. Especially when it's not around that's what. It's all part of the game. Burning calories. So probably feel like templates on here and then give her a whirl. We're having a fucking plate there. But I don't think. Oh, I thought it'd be worth it. Committed now. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to go with 10 reps right now. I think my head's been, I got 10 reps. I think he's counting the weights. I thought I got a score. Who did that then? Five. I thought I'd do this one. I'm not going to lie. I've been stretching. And foam rolling. Six out of every day of the week. Six out of seven days a week. I feel so much better. This is the first prep I've done that consistently at this point. And doing shit like this right now. I'm fucking exhausted. But normally I stick my fucking quad. They're still tight. They're going to rip off the bone. So if you're good right now. And I'm getting deeper separation. Earlier out then I normally get my quad. So who would have done that? I've only cut it a thousand times on my channel and heard it a million times. They're stretching it beneficial. And you train hard, but who would have thought it actually can't help? It's really not iron. What the fuck man? I didn't have it in me. I thought you'd have good hip mobility. Otherwise I would have hurt myself. And you have to have a little big lift to camera man who's quick on his feet to come help. Oh, almost a deficit above my dead gas. I don't have to retire yet. Don't worry. I was recording a whole clip too. Did you? Fuck. I just shot that with no clue. This is not happening. My life flash before my eyes. I'm feeling a little bit sadistic. That's the right word. What you're doing when you like to hurt yourself? To just stick or massage messages. It doesn't matter. I felt like getting myself some little gerions now. I thought you just didn't feel like loading anything up with any more questions. I just wanted to say that. But I was just a little bit sadistic. I thought you were just a little bit sadistic. I just wanted to say that. I just wanted to say that. I just wanted to say that. I felt like getting myself some little gerions now. I thought you just didn't feel like loading anything up with any more plates. Too much movement. So dumbbells are dead, Bulgarians. Flash press moving it like that. Then move on to some doctorate. Get some good girls. Get some good girls. All right. Bulgarians completely. Three sets there. Everything else I did to two sets. They were a little bit heavier and more like intense. Bulgarians, because of that, the end of my workout. I can definitely do 140, 115y. It's 120. Three sets, a little bit more volume. And that's it for the heart heavy shit. I'm finishing off a little bit of calves. And the doctor is ringing. I'm going to do a little bit of workout. I'm going to do a little bit more volume. And that's it for the heart heavy shit. I'm finishing off a little bit of calves. And the doctor is ringing out. So they just both make my doctor like pop. How they get leaner. So, you know, I'll bring it over to find details of my legs. I think I should have done a triple away. Special with all the cardio and everything I'm doing. He's like these are very important. That my legs don't just turn into like little quick. They've got to make a weight too. So balancing all that out of the leg. I think they're coming along. My legs look better than they've looked in a few years. So they're excited to see the final product from my stage. So they're excited to see the final product from my stage. You don't have to get that angle. Yep. So. So you're retiring? Yes. You're so over here. I'm done. I'm done. I find it actually very funny. I'm resting now on calves. So how is that? We're flutting on everything in my life forever. Everyone's like, because my mindset is different than most people of my stage. I'm not going to get into what they think it means to win. People think I'm like done. Our last message. I don't care anymore. I've all the other interests and I don't have it in me anymore. But like the true secret to winning. That the all you have to do is win. Doesn't matter if you're fucking Michael Jordan and you. You're covering heads off and think you're better than everyone else. I think people hate that I don't have that mindset of like the typical like a aggressive fucking cocky arrogant winner. And I'm very realistic. And I think I don't like losing the word, but I think in a spiritual way. Not many people in my level are like kind of spiritual in the sense of being like, I truly understand that I have no control. I have any help from. Can't even hear myself in the gym. But I have no control of any outcome. I can control what I work. But you know what I really hard to have no control put in my mind. Probably I'm going to put a muscle, but it's not. It's no matter how hard I do that and die and everything. I have a chance of winning me. If you're not guaranteed to win, I have all of those. I don't really have bodybuilding. I never have a bodybuilding. I don't need anything in my life except fucking like the basic accessories. Doesn't mean I don't love it. Doesn't mean I don't have a fire inside and you'll give it back to me in the world. And the fucking continued to be the best in the world. But because I don't talk like that people are like, oh, he blocks his head. He doesn't want to run away from me anymore. Mother fuck, I guess what I've done three would get mindset. And I used to think I had to act like this tough guy who fucking, I'm depressed, but I want to channel up here. I mean, if everyone's asking all this shit, they wouldn't do I am. Now I just know who I am. I know what drives me. I know what I want. And I'm going to make them more at peace with life. It's funny that now I'm going to compete for a hell of a longer. Because I'm authentically being myself in the way I act. And thinking my own brains grow. And you'll go for ten. Maybe you'll retire before this year's one. Maybe you wouldn't even get on stage. Who the fuck knows? But today's leg day, and I'm going to get some huge caps today. So I mean, I don't know that. And the train heart might not even get big cause probably not. I don't know. Alright, come on, go to go. Because he's a busy man. And he's got a run of shit that we're going to do. So I'm going to meet him there a little bit. I'm going to finish a few more sets of the calves. And I actually have to do stairs now. So RIP to my legs. You do a little bit on the step mill. Stair separate of fucking one call it. I'm going to let him eat and me tell him for the shoot. Are we filming that at all? Yep. That's a bit. So I guess I'll see you guys in like, take watch or clock in an hour. Check for ten things. You're like, not trying to do this like. Oh, oh. So maybe I put your spell on the ground and then you turn it over. Like that thing. So you're going to start. You're finally learning how to use the canvas of action. Yes, I do. Can we get a live physique update? Yeah, for sure. I'll do it in the pool and spread everyone. Exactly what I'm going to do. How's it look? It looks like you're the looks that you're holding a light saber. It's not like a blind date. Like the coach yelling from the sidelines. Angry dad who failed. That's a sport high school quarterback who's yelling at his. Used to bench for a five. Used to back in the day. Back in the day. Back in the day. No. Now I'm nothing. So we are at the official Steven Fitton shoot. Calvin went a little bit overboard and brought like 20 people. I just let him take over. I'm seven or eight. Calvin's a director of a vision now for a photo shoot. So we have a lot of people here. But we actually have like a full crew of men and women. I was the last time. She'll have a woman. I want to see guys in the picture. The right final. Poor guys in the picture. So we have all different types of men and women. And I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. Because they're shooting here. Two in the back yard of Dom's beautiful home. They get a nice whole aesthetic. Sadly, one of the most crucial parts didn't come in. We had pants. We had sweatpants. I don't know why I'm looking at. We had sweatpants coming in. And they got delayed in the UPS. But everyone was here and the shoot was planned. So we went ahead and we're going to have to add those in a little bit after. But we're going to get all this stuff out. And show you guys everything that's coming. I'm wearing the go to church right now. Let me see that. Yeah. This is going to be the best shirt I've ever. Make this to a stick here in a bottle. No hat. Everything. The model to live by don't be a skinny bitch. So stay tuned. We'll show you guys everything in the upcoming.

What is up YouTube? We are just about almost two weeks out the Olympia which is crazy. Time is flying by right now actually kind of scary but yeah it's like it's kind of hamstring back date not really quad day but it's gonna be a good day and I've been making this delicious pre-workout concoction so I'm gonna share that and give you guys a little update what's going on. I'm gonna hit the gym axle still here so we're gonna hit that workout I think he's leaving me in a few days but I told him if he wants to say longer and keep training he's been helping me push a lot so I'm always welcome to push and the positive energy so yeah I got a corny cleaned up this house a little bit and moved everything so I'm gonna have to search for this pre-workout and once that's I'll be right back. Alright so here we go I got a meal ready with me ready to rock and roll putting it eat a whole throw kill but pre-workout this has been what I've been combining lately I've been doing essential pre-blue raspberry with raw pump lemonade flavor and then some pumpscores to just bless her all but this combo makes I mean prep-rated yes I know but this combo makes like a blue raspberry lemonade flavor and it tastes unbelievable and two would make the caffeine right now it's good enough to get me going and then it gives me like fucking tanker and the citrillion good old bunch of bit out and you need to get my face scratching off and some nice focus and everything so great pump good energy good focus and I've been loving the flavor but that's what's going on yeah I also had a high carb day yes today and then it was funny I just was like reflecting on like the way my mind processed and changes so much when I'm really tired I'm like carb depleted my brain like doesn't function and I don't think I don't check my phone just like not doing anything and then yesterday I had a bunch of carbs I had a bunch of energy I went into the office and there are a bunch of like changes were doing but stuff went off a Ross new employee we were interviewing that was coming through out of him down on Sarah at the same time when we were talking to her and just a bunch of stuff going on and then night comes and I'm like my brain is just spinning of everything now I'm like I used to go to bed just so tired so brain dead now my brain just spinning and it just made me think of like processes of my mind how it changes and how at the beginning of my practice here I was stressing about all these like tiny little things that everything was gonna be like fucking falling apart and it was just like a difficult beginning of prep and then it went to like kind of brain dead shut everything out to this and now all the stuff sparring back in and it's like good stuff it's business and it's busy but it's just so fascinating how we get caught in these waves of thoughts and feelings and thinking that there are everything and it's like our reality but it's just our current perception of where we're at in that part of our life or that's whatever it's going on and how quickly they change and the more you can be aware of this change and understand that it comes and then it goes and these thoughts and these feelings that come and they go the ups and downs that come and they go and not getting stuck in it and letting yourself make rash big decisions are just living in that kind of mode is something that's like super helpful and I saw this quote that was a wrote down a while ago and it pulled up on my phone I saw it today it kind of related to that and it says you are going to suffer if you believe that the way things are shouldn't be that the way holy shit my brain cut that Calvin restart you are going to suffer if you believe that the way things are shouldn't be the way that they are and it's essentially just being like things are it things happen as they happen that can't happen either way except it as they are and as they come except it and as they go except it when I was in the mode of like shit was feeling really tough and I was like he was the one to be a prop is like taking too much other than me and now I'm in a great play and I was kind of fighting and I was like he's meant to be shall be doing this ballad on all this like stuff kind of in my head like just kind of doubt and force me to bust out the no equipmentality because I needed it then and now I've been in a really good groove I've been putting my energy and focus on this and I'm like I could do this I feel good right now I could keep going I could go for 10 of these probably not 10 but it's just fascinating how you kind of fight things when they're bad and then when they're good you almost don't remember but they're like when they're bad and you just think it's expected to be good all the time but it will never be good all the time you kind of got to ride through those tough spots understand that one last forever and when you are in a good groove like I am right now choosing to consciously be present and be grateful for where I am at right now because these good streaks don't last forever it's just really important otherwise you just get stuck hopefully on the negative all the time and you feel like life is miserable so that would make cardio or flushing this morning and then party I try not to go on my phone the morning and I just like think and reflect and that's kind of what was going through my head just I felt good when I woke up before I taste the meat as you guys can see I've brought more energy right now too herbs are an amazing thing but I want to show you this good it's actually funny I don't know how much you guys give a shit about my life outside of I don't know what I'm doing but this is some funny shit like I got in the mail I was trying to find like a dope black day boutique surgery and I ordered this and I realized it with a fake account it was like shop MLB.com's of MLB shop.com and I panic like cancel my credit cards that I was gonna get at and this is just like the cheapest like that's what was being embroidered patch and it's just printed on like that and it's just the cheapest shittyest thing from China and at least I didn't get my credit card hack but I ordered this like dope chemo one two and it just came in like gray and just so fake so that was pretty comical in my opinion don't order a shit off fucking fake website that's a cancel like credit card two and you'll be brutal but I also got this back to June from good old Johnny Mac and impossible kicks these guys always make me up a shoes and the one piece coming up so he needs to get a price pair of kicks to get it now big old sneaker headed almost shoes are in surgery now because we are in our rental so already gets up there he's already last low Travis Scott turned one that I did not have so huge tanks who impossible kicks for seven knees up they're an old shoe but they're beautiful and I just loved the lows because I have small ankles and when we're high socks just part of the way my style is and I love the color blue cream blue can't be beat so huge tanks who possible kicks for that maybe rock the hits to the gym today don't know how many color my outfits so I can wear blue shoes but yeah that's what's going on if you guys can hear I got some Assassin's Creed in the background I told you I said it my PS5 is a gym but it wouldn't connect to the internet and I heard that the new Assassin's Creed was apparently like the old one I haven't gained it a really long time so I brought it here and I've been gaming a little bit of Assassin's Creed on the PS5 here and I fell in love with this game for Assassin's Creed 2 in like 2008 or when I was at that came out and since then the game's got kind of two intense and two long and they're like this huge open world games that take like I don't know it would take me 10 years to finish and I just don't have 10 years to play with your game to have three weeks of prep left so I downloaded this one and it's been fun so far and it does great to kill time in between meals so that's a little update on my life with going on right now it is already one o'clock so I'm gonna head to the gym meet Axel, crush him legs and yeah I thought it's going on so peace for my shoulders I actually have to hammer strength press you know what that means one o'clock he said eight 10 reps in reserve zero the joy to fail I just guess exactly that I remember I googled it all right so I introed this video yesterday but then we didn't film so kept the what is up YouTube and played the intro that Calvin already had but uh yesterday was hamstrings it was a nice little workout like it's a nice and sorted a little bit of back too honestly just super fucking grateful that's weathered been so nice it's like 57 60 degrees in the morning and then like 80 during the day and beautiful here instead of like 110 so definitely helping me train a lot but sadly this is Axel's last day here so we're finishing with the good old shoulder workout some of the heat needs to work on his coach says apparently so yeah we're gonna try and get some new shoulders and have a good old day these guys must love the weather again imagine

I feel so elegant with my legs crossing this chair. But me and Calvin are just filming some YouTube shorts. A little bit of a Q&A. Those are going to be going up on YouTube. Sorry. I'm going to be going up on YouTube in the YouTube shorts section. Maybe they'd like 19 questions or something. Enough to get us every day up to the one. If you have to leave us a plan, maybe one after. But yeah, that's what's going on. We just finished up a back workout. Eat some fish and rice. Kim rate over here. And film that. And then sadly, oxles heading in a town tonight. So maybe we're going to have some steak and a spare guess for something tonight. Take a bite. But it's been really good having him working out with him. It reminds me of like the good old bullshit days of just fucking getting the gym fucking shit up. You know, he's not. He's just a good positive dude and one of my best friends and Transired strong and he's not really involved in any of the business stuff we have going on. So I can like separate the two and go into bodybuilder mode and it's just really nice to have that. Like I talked about before, just like this simple bodybuilding sometimes is just going in. Fucking up a workout eating your chicken rice. Taking an app. It's just definitely to get too complicated. You just got to fuck shit up and enjoy it. So it was really good to train with them. It kind of put me in a great mindset and at three weeks out was kind of my last week of pushing heavy weight and heavy workouts. So I started to delete really hard and just trying to get through it. So it's perfect timing. And yeah, that's all it's going on. So peace out. We'll catch you guys later. Thanks for watching.

All right here with the new classic LLB team, who is two times lancing to the B and champ Chris Bumstein. Here by three times I'll let the champion Chris Bumstein Chris get into the end buddy. Four times I'll let the champion Chris. Four times here we are Chris. Talk about it last year we talked about it this year we've done many many interviews throughout the entire series of the striker five is finally done by Fred five time on the B and champ you folks. I was gonna sell brother. Yeah, I think we'll die if we. It's hard to say sweeter than their old special but this one really really special there. Anyone close to me knows how special this one is. You know, I'll get that out of the way. The lot they went into the last few years we completely honest. Some physical girls but it's been a lot of mental emotional girls. I know not only one who faces some trial and tribulation, nobody believes given me so much. It's a road full of ups and downs as of the every single life. I was learning to really enjoy the moment and the journey you guys have been into. A lot of people don't have the opportunity to enjoy the moments so they look back and be like they're going to go through and they're like, that was like I wish I'd been a little more present and draw that over. I think this year I wanted to add to my champion mentality concept and it told myself that I wasn't going to nominate my emotions, suppress everything I felt you still wouldn't know. I'd rather experience this whole process and do that. Life really tested me when I said that. I just share this because I want people to know that life's up and down. It's going to have you know quit but not giving up on yourself. I feel leaning on the people you love enjoying the goddamn journey. 3. We'll get a little closer. We'll be the burger. I just need to try to find out what time they get on stage. Andrew. And... Salt calculation. On the crack scale. That's good. Yeah. And just burger or whatever. Here comes the burger. Okay, so 7.45. That's a pretty bad one. A lot of things. You can do that. You know, backstage. Great. Don't keep it. Can you lift it? What? Great. This is different. It's very quiet. I just can't go to turn off the food. Everything's pillow. You don't get it. Perfect. Sweet. Okay. Nice. You got me. There's one in here. I have it. Just like watching a drink these things. Yeah. It's right. Refresh. You're going to be showing it. Hold on. There you go. Ready to go. Ready to go. You're going to bring out the spin. I'm going to bring all the food burgers. You're going to push it. Yep. You good? You're not going to. Yeah. And your suit. Good. Good. Excuse me. Please. I'm over in the page. Good. To all figure out what's up. Yeah. Good. Just put a check in here. Check out the places. John, off. Yeah. Check out the gear. Okay, guys. I'm going to do it up. Love you. Bye. I'll see you tonight. Okay. I'm going to look at you. You're going to be driving out. I can hear a bit of thank you. I'm just going to put that on. You're going to go in pretty good again. You're going to go in. Go in. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go in. Go. Go out. Go. Go out. Go out. Go out. Go. Go. Go. Come on, get in there. There you go. Everything. Good. Nice. You know there's a lot of change from the aspect. When you first met him to now. Yeah, his mindset completely changed. You saw that he became more mature in terms of knowing that he is the champ and that he has to do what the champ has to do. So everything changed at this point. The second, he won the Olympia. Then people who are unsure that he was actually the winner. So he had something to prove and then he understood that he is the champ. Chris at its best. He's the best in the world and he understood that the mindset has to come with that and he started grow mentally. His physique just went along and that was really inspiring to watch us somebody going from you know Ottawa little place going from being just a normal guy to Mr. Olympia. Still being a normal guy just has humble as it gets. Have a lot of humility and just rose with that and without changing who he actually is in the circle. Beautiful. Every time we get on prep or training together the goal is to be mindful. You have to be present with me or I don't want to train with you. So Chris had to be present in every workout. And if you're present we are only in a gym, only you and me and the weights. If he's good we're here we're now so life is amazing. Just focus on me, focus on your set. And that's what everything just happened. Every time we trained together it was just locked in. It's not in his mind, he's in the present state and that's what really changed. And you know now he's just he's doing that without the gym and you can see that he's growing as a person and 24 seven now. Really bad. See you tonight. Another battle. Are you? What's your intimate step? I don't know where I am. I'm going to keep that to your ground. That's fine. I'm going to do it. See you tonight. What? I'm going to do it. What? I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Which is better. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh, I wrote this whole fucking thing and you put some new touch on the back. I can't even do it. Maybe get in your hand? Got it. Go get the best ones you have. I want to help you. Don't иде yourself. Maybe get behind the door. From Tuesday. Going to hell. Ive thought that the woman went. There's it. I have deeper point of view,points and roads are all in between. I almost want to work with honey just to find out what to talk to itself with the potatoes. I don't know what to do with the potatoes. I don't know. Is it one day maybe when we're all the type of secret about them? I got sure of it. There's literally a problem. I mean, there's a secret now. I'll make that maybe. I'll make it up by the way. This is just my grave as you may know. There's not. There's not. Sorry, cold murder it is. There was no water. Oh, we got ice chips. All he wants is water. He said fucking food. Yeah, like so hungry, I'll prep. And all cravings are deleted from eating 15 pounds of potatoes. And like, well, I enjoy burger. I'm like, okay, we'll eat a cold, hard burger. But nothing on it. I'm like, sorry. You can't miss my steams. I think over the years, the biggest thing I've ever eaten. I think over the years, the biggest thing I've seen him do is the ability to stay really present and really grounded throughout hardship. Because it seems like every year there has been something that's happened, whether he's torn his hamstring, torn his bicep, torn his lat, family, you know, personal relationship shit. Just a bunch of things. And this year, even like, ah, she was a 10 weeks out, nine, even when he tore his lat, of course he's human. He had his moment of being like, fuck, what am I going to do? I tore my lat, like, how I came and trained with a torn lat. And he was able to not not focus on that and keep pushing forward and persevering. And it was, it wasn't like fake. It wasn't like, oh, fake until you make it. I'm just going to keep trying to put a smile on and enjoy this. Like, he felt, he felt his pain physically emotionally, but he was still able to be like, I'm going to do this head down. So he was very present, even during the pain. It made it like, it made his journey, I feel so much more special and being able to soak up all the good, all the bad, everything. Oh, yeah, oh my god, you look like those faggabs are so hard. She's this. Yeah. Your chest looks full, I too. Yeah. Yeah, hold that, just don't drink water. It looks like you're not drinkin' water. Okay. I just want to sit down. I'm going to go. I'm going down. Now the cookie, the rest. Oh God, that was good. let's go I don't know what the weather is. I'm just... Yeah. I just had to pass the road. I don't know what to do. I know a lot. I have plenty to do. I can't hold the weather. Yeah. When you make songs, like, you're walking, like, you're walking, like, you're walking, like, shutting your mouth, all in the water. I can't hold the weather. I can't hold the weather. I'm just going to go to the park. So, I'm just going to go to the park. I'm just going to go to the park. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. No. My dreams. Just stop it, don't go out. I haven't felt this excited since the first Olympia that I ever competed at, you know? When I qualified the first time for myself in 2018, I was like, it's that big shiny new fucking Olympia, it's like, man, I'm so excited to be there. That's that feeling I'm having again, and I'm just like, it feels like a whole new show. When you're competing there, it's one thing, it's exciting to be there, especially when you're really competing at the top of the sport, there's an excitement to it. But over time, your priorities change. Your priorities of what, and I kept using this war room during the podcast, I've filled changes over time. And right now, that shift is more into being there as a fan, as a friend and a supporter, a supporter for Chris, like for family like that, or for other friends that I have in the show. And like you said, I haven't seen Chris on stage, it's 2019. It's either I've been watching him on the live stream, which I could be the same as I was at a 6,000 miles away, even on the five last of the road. So with the conflicting schedules, I never really got to see that. So I'm really excited to see him kill out up there, and just to be there in a different capacity this year. Because the years that we were working together is when I was coaching him, obviously this is a different dynamic, in different levels of pressure, and different levels of how it affects you from a personal impact, and then you're trying to compete yourself. And then this few last year he was with Hawny, and I was there myself, and I never even saw him. So just to be there and just to like enjoy that full process and watch him and Hawny do their thing and just to be there in any way that I can to help or support and just watch him on stage. And it's very, very exciting for me for sure. It was a bit like watching him kind of like prep with Hawny and stuff like that. It's been awesome. I mean, you know, you can tell when something's like two people jailed. You can see it anyone who has watched their videos together, see their little fucking banter back and forth. And like you can see there's a good rapport, a good relationship built there. You know, and me being someone that's been in the sport as long as I have, even not having work with them, like I have an immense trust in Hawny for sure. Like I don't think Chris could be in any better hands. You know, so obviously just caring about him as family, you know, you obviously want to make sure that there's someone that's like doing them the best and I never doubt that for a second with it being Hawny. You know, and obviously last year, you know, was indicative even just from not even the best hand standpoint, but best hand standpoint from like just a peak in physique look, you know, was definitely as one of his best or definitely as best look, you know, conditioning fullness, like just Christmas, like, you know, so to see that, it's like it was honestly like a not a sigh of relief because I had no doubts in Hawny, but it's like, fuck, we, I made, like we both made the right call and that, you know, one in terms of, you know, the impact that it could potentially have on our relationship with then also knowing that he keys in the best hands possible and he's up there fucking killing it at a whole new level, which, you know, look, I'm confident my coaching to a point, but when you're trying to like win multiple Olympias and not even just win multiple Olympias, be better every Olympia. You know, there's one thing to just show up every year the exact fucking same and win Olympias, but when you get to that point, like when you're already winning, what's next up to be better, to be better, to be better in your competing against yourself, you're chasing your own self, you know. So, to see that he was able to achieve that with Hawny last year was very gratifying feeling for me for sure. That's one. Yeah, there we go. No, no, I was telling him to get out of your way, brother. Tell me up here. Yes, sir. One, two, three, six, twenty, two, twenty-seven, play eight and thirty-one. Hold a turn to the right. Hold a turn to the right. And face through. Side check. Back double mindset. That's it, Chris. Hold it. That's it. There you go, Chris. Thank you, gentlemen. Back in line. Back to you, Bob. All right, take a big spin. Yeah, boy, I was saying that. Here we are, Chris. We talked about it last year. We talked about it this year. We've done many, many interviews throughout the entire season. The strive for five is finally done by friend. I'm really special. I've had a mantra every prep I've gone through. I wanted to add to my champion mentality concept. I was going to know my emotions. I was going through some shifts and I started to shut down. I was going to feel it. I was going to lean on the people I love. I felt honey. I was like, I don't know if I can do this. I will love you no matter what you do, what we believe in you. I felt me up as courage to keep going. I remember it was probably four weeks after that. I had a good work. I'm going to cry again in this time of the gratitude. I had quit, but I had none. I don't share this for pity or to make it seem like a hard prep. I just share this because I want people to know that. Life's up and down. I'm going to have you know quit, but not giving up on yourself. I'm leaning on the people you love and enjoying the goddamn journey. I'm just being long for the experience. Thank you guys so much for six years. The past five years of my life has taken years of the community. I've been so integrated. It made some of the greatest ways. It's just like an imagine in this sport. You guys have been loving the league. It's my life and there. Jim, Debbie, everyone's dance all in there here. I just thank you guys so much for this beautiful thing. My team, honey. I couldn't do this. I'm currently my fiance. I love you so much. You're the strength behind me. My mom, my dad, Matti, Calvin, boys, everybody. I think love you guys so much. And I'm so grateful to be up here. So thank you guys so much for everything. Let's enjoy the night. Have a fun weekend. So thank you. Chris, I got nothing to add. That's one of the two champion ones. I gave you no strangers in a winter circle. No signs of slowing down. Anytime soon, people keep basting. If you hit one more year and you're Chris, you're going to keep going. If you want you to go to the open. Probably isn't a bad idea. Maybe it's some point. 400 thousand good reasons to do that, right? Jake's thumbs up. That's all for it. But I'm just going to let you enjoy this moment, my friend. So no questions about the future. No questions about the C-pop standard. Just enjoy being in your fine time. I'll let you a champion by the front. I'll pop your hair on the plate and post it. I'm so glad you're late. C-pop, fine time champion. We're going to get first interviews right here. Thank you. I got to know you said you know. I love you. I love you. I love you. No questions. Thank you. You're a great one. You're a great one. I'm just going to go. You're a lot to mind. I think you're going to be okay. You're a great one. You're a great one. Thanks. You said I might have said you speak to a foreigner? Brospeed? Fine, fine. We're both in this funny battle, I think. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? I don't know. What? What? There you go. What? What? What? God's name. God's name. Yeah. Where's the station? Oh, there's something. I didn't know that angle you. You probably did. I probably looked like I'm short of the... Yeah. There's so many photos of me out there. I'm just like stepping in. And I'm always on the map. Yeah. Yeah. That's where I learned it up there. But edging up there. Yeah. Like my arms. Like lean in like that. Looks so skinny. I can't imagine that. I got to get one. I got to get one. I'm just going to be there every set of the way. Whatever you want to do, I'll be there. Because like that was that. That's what I like. I like that. Maybe so much. I'm not sure. This is the... I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It's blue. Oh, what are you guys doing? Wow. You need a train. Oh, he is the... Honestly. That is the classiest thing I've ever heard of in my life. I don't have. There you go. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. I'm looking for a 24-minute. Oh, where you going? Oh, my gosh. He's heavy, don't tear it. That's heavy. He's big about it. He's a mega fat. Oh, my gosh. I'm just feeling it, babe. The plus is pregnant, the bind is dead. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. I'm just feeling it, babe. The plus is pregnant, the bind is dead. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. Mine is not pregnant, but I feel it. There's a plus sign through it, but it's really faint, babe. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, what do you think? Oh, my gosh. Oh, what do you think? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. You're pregnant. Are you kidding me? What? What? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I'm already getting up to work, so. Did you just hold a hold time? This is where I was pretty sure. I was really quick. I don't know. I'm going to keep you. Being able to watch Chris become a dad is really something I'm so forever looking forward to, and I'm so grateful for, and just something that I'm also so excited to witness, like our life together, and him becoming the father to our child, and watching him take that role on, because I know he's just going to be so amazing at it, and it's just like a part of his DNA, and who he is as a person. That's who Chris is just his essence, his heart. Minus, what you guys see on the external is truly the best thing about Chris, and watching him like be that person to a little baby, and to a little human is like the coolest thing ever. The coolest thing ever. Courtney, where's your phone? Yeah, she really is. Okay, three, one, one, two, three! All right, so here we are. Back in the gym where it all began, I guess. We wrapped up the Olympic Olympic end, and we're experiencing it. So doing the Ocho now and surprised having a baby. Baby bum is along the way. It was the most beautiful blessing I've ever received, and the midst of this prep when a lot of shit was going down. I mentioned in my acceptance speech, I tore my lap at about 10 weeks out. My body wasn't responding at that point. My mental state wasn't there. I was going through all this shit I was traveling too much. I had lost 12 pounds in a week randomly. I literally went from like 262 to 250, and 10 weeks that I've never been that light. I didn't know what was going on with my body. I was stressed out, there was some personal stuff going on on the back end, and then I found out Courtney was pregnant, and it was like the best news I could have ever gotten. I was so happy, and then there was all this other shit pulling me in other directions and stressing me out. Then that's when I tore my lap. I went to the gym one day, and I was doing dead lifts 405, and I just was letting the bar down and just hop. And my lap just like yanked, and this throbbing pain went through me. And it's how I tore my hamstring back in 2019, doing dead lifts and it was the same feeling. I was in the gym, and I was just so defeated at this point. I felt like this prop wasn't going to get the week prior, the two weeks prior, the year prior, and I was already feeling so defeated. And that really took the window to me. That took everything out of me. I'm never being at the gym, I was in Canada, I walked outside, and I just heard fucking bawling my zip on myself. I called Courtney, and she's like, hey, man, what's going on? I just was sobbing, she's like, what's wrong? I'm like, I can't fucking do this. Like, I just everything falling apart, my body's not here. My mind's out in the right place, I just tore my lap. Like everything's literally crumbling. Then I called, honey after that, and if somebody else is going, and I start crying, you think, what the fuck's going on then? Then I went home, tried to my sister and E in my parents, and I was just fulfilling so defeated. It was all I could really say, and that's when I kind of went in my A for a little bit of social and YouTube. We didn't really film anything. Blue back home, and I couldn't train back for like three weeks. Couldn't train my body for about 10 days. Luckily in Canada, I was got to see Dr. Kahn, I had an appointment with some prior, which was super lucky, and then I went in, and he was able to do some stuff for me. So shout out to him that was very helpful, and there's lucky that I already had that appointment set up, while I was in Canada. But it was a mental battle, and as I said, this year was a huge focus on not just having no quit, so I know I could not quit that ship, but sometimes what it takes to be the best champion, you can be, if you want to take to be the best man you can be, that's partner you can be best. Has been dad, soon to be dad, that person you can be, and I didn't want to shut out all my emotion and become a more lesser version of myself, because I'm not just bodybuilding to be a big jack to do, I want to be a better version of myself. So, didn't want to just not quit, I wanted to experience all this, and that was the theme I wanted to feel the good and the bad this year, because when in the past when I've had the numbness, the press all the shit I was going through, and fear and anxiety and doubt and everything, all the positive things are to dim the light too, because when you numb the good, when you numb the bad, you numb the good. And so, I leaned into it, I knew my therapist Jordan helped me a lot through this process, I had a session with her a week after, and I was like the feeds and telling, she was just part of your story. You know, I said in my speech again to my family, they're all like, look, you don't have to do this, you can't quit, you do it every one, what love you either way, but we know you can do this if you want to, and that really put a lot of strength in me, I guess, you know, time when you doubt yourself if you have a team of people who love you who support you, you can lift you up and carry the load that feels too heavy for you to burden. It really helps a lot, so I can't express how grateful I am for the people in my life. And I just started getting through it, you know, I was stressed out, and instead of trying to not be stressed about it, I just was like, no shit, you're going to be stressed out right now, you know, you're now going to be a dad, huge deal, super important, your health is also very important, even more important of you now. And there's all this other shit going on, so just try and feel whatever is going on, you're not meant to feel just excited and perfect all the time, so accept that where you are right now, just where you are meant to be, because as soon as you start fighting, you start to think where you are and how you feel is and how you're meant to feel, and where you're meant to be, everything feels way worse than it should be. So I accepted it, and I felt it, and I leaned into it, and I got back to the gym, and I did what little I could, what could I do, I could train legs, I could train some light arms, I could do specific movements that weren't engaging my lat, very minimal things for a while, and I got through it day by day, and then I think it was four weeks after all this, I was in the gym, it was a, I believe it was a back workout. I remember flying on the ground after a workout and being like, just not, didn't even realize I had just gone through day by day by day by day, I just did what I needed to do, not quitting, trying to feel the ups and the downs of it all, and then I also said one day I had a fucking great workout, I just crushed my workout, and I was still like six weeks out, and I was like, fuck, I can do this, like I started to build that belief back in myself, sitting here, this is like where I was sitting, when it happened to, and I was like, fuck, like you can do this, and I started crying in the gym, and this time, instead of those tears I had had weeks before of crying about feeling defeated, it was feeling the belief arising back up with myself, and like I could win another Olympian, or even get to the end of it and be proud of how I look. So that was pretty beautiful moment of gratitude and experience of life, of the feeling the ups and the downs, the feeling of being alive as a human is really why we're here, you know, we're not meant to win titles and be rich and do all these things, we're just meant to have a human experience of love and highs and lows, and feelings and emotions, and be there for it also, it was pretty cool to have experienced such a fucking low, and then back up into a high, and then it was game time, you know, I was like, fuck it, we're locking it in now. Corny and Tomi and I were the book called The One Thing, and it's just talking about how like if you want to be, the belief that something you need to focus on one thing and the time and that spread your thoughts too far across too many things, and I was like, fuck it. If I'm going to win this Olympia, this is all I had to focus on, this is all I can put my attention on to. And so that's what I did. It's up to one of the office, it's up to you, and but we're up to one email, text, I'll do anything. I just showed up and I did the fucking work in the gym every single day, and I was in bed at 9 o'clock every day, I was up at 7, every single day, and I did the same meals at the same time, every single day. I crush every workout every single day, and I did the damn work, and it pulled together, and I was a fucking robot. Not emotionally, physically, and it was fun. You know, I was able to experience it, and the axle came down, and eating came down. There was all these fun things going on, and one of the doctors was Courtney, and Ultra Sound, checking out her new baby on the way, and I started to build more and more excitement for that, and this just became this beautiful journey within a journey, and it was amazing. And one of the probably one of my favorite preps today, great movie, I have to finish with this splash. And that was kind of, I know it's isn't out of show to show to you, but that was all the emotion that was going through me, while I was competing. When I had a few moments on stage where one of the things I built, worked on very hard as last few years, is my mental ability to be present and enjoy the damn journey, and that's the experience I have at the five-time, Mr. Olympia now. You know, I was on stage instead of thinking of getting poses, they're doing this, and I'm like, I'm standing there looking around looking for my family in the crowd, hitting my poses, thinking to myself, like, fuck, you just tore a lot. You're having a baby, you're praying to life as if they're watching you, there's a truck outside right now, very loud. And I was able to just like think of this on stage and enjoy all that, and have all these moments, which is so beautiful, and that's what I've worked on to be able to be present, and not be stuck in my head and stuck in stress and stuck in chaos, while in this huge moment of... I could potential stress on stage, so I was up there enjoying it, and you guys could see it from a lot of the pictures this year. My smile was brighter, I felt like I was enjoying it a lot more, and that's all I've ever wanted, so it was a really good experience on stage. You know, I did everything I could, and I was able to just enjoy it on there. And at the night show, I remember being backstage and just like, closing my eyes and thinking of all that stuff that had gone through, and all the pressure I put on myself, all the stress that I feel, all the time, and a lot of the work I've been doing there, B2 was kind of like, talking to a healing like a past self, and I remember being backstage and both the picture of a young version of myself, and this is something I've been doing there B, and being like, fuck man, we were doing it, like you did it, like, I love you for, I was like talking to myself, and I remember like crying again, and being like, on stage again, they were calling your name to have the same thought, I looked up at the Olympia where it's felt on stage, I looked up in the crowd, the lights, and I'm just like, fuck you're here. This is the moment, like you're in it right now. These are what you're gonna look back on, and you're just experiencing it right now, and you're here. And I can't really put into words the kind of feelings I have. I went near up there, but it was amazing. And you know, I was pretty confident, and I had won this Olympia after pre-judging. I knew the package I had brought, and the work I had done, and saw the pictures, and I was like, I got this. And I was just chilling, I was enjoying it. So when they call my name, and I have five years of just clothing, my eyes in listening for Bob Chickel, of the voice being like, and new, and still, and still, and still, and still, you're a five-time Mr. Olympia champion, and just hearing him say that, and me just waiting for it, and being like, you should enjoy this moment, never forget this moment. It was cool. It was a lot of fun, and something I will never forget. And then I get to go backstage, see my pregnant wife, fiance, whatever, close enough, and my family and friends were all back there, and we were able to hug and enjoy. Celebrations and everything, and it was a lot of fun. So it was a beautiful journey. Lots of lessons learned, you know, pretty cool how I'd been a person who surprises everything, and now, at this peak moment of my life, I was like, no, I'm gonna fucking feel it all, and it was the best experience I've ever had, and the biggest lesson I learned is just when you're in those low moments, and you're having those hard times, and you feel so stressful, you can't keep going, or it's this shit, instead of trying to feel like you shouldn't be in that moment embrace that moment, because all of the moments, all that hell of a moment, so you want to quit the moment you want to shut down, those moments that you're at the beginning, or anywhere in your journey, those are the moments that make the victories, or the workouts where you're just like, wow, I feel good today, those are what makes us so sweet, and I wouldn't have experienced those moments of gratitude and joy if it weren't for those lows. So don't fight those moments, so try and get rid of them, just sit in there and feel them, and accept them for what they are in the moment, because it's just part of the human experience. Yeah, that's a wrap on this, 2023, 5P journey. It was a fun one, for sure. I focused on not putting it on social media, kept a lot of the stuff to myself, because I was just enjoying the processing and going through the journey in my own mind, into my own ways. So it was a lot of fun, you know, I have the greatest support team. Juan, he got me through a lot of shit, Courtney got me through a lot of shit, Calvals got my back through it on Maddie. Domin Mad, making sure it don't have to go to the fucking office or any roster for a week, set a time, and you know, it takes an army to pull it all together, and we did it. And it was super cool, at a few moments posing with honey and Ian doing check-ins with them. That was cool to see them kind of come together and collaborate, and kind of create a game plan for myself, with a lot of fun to experience that. And yeah, that's what's, it's what happened I guess. So thank you guys, that's always for joining me along this journey, chasing after something I love, and trying to share with you guys every little bit of it. That's as I can, because I might do it in a cool, on PS Stage, but everyone's going through their ups and downs in life, and it's all just part of what we're doing here. So I'm just grateful that you guys care to watch, care to support me, means a lot. When I talk about support, I have for my family and friends that help me be stronger, you guys are the same, you know, you get a lot of love, and there's this like folk, like the longer successful people up to watch you fall, and I haven't really experienced that, and I'm super honored and grateful for the support I have for people, because you know, it's rare sometimes people like to start to hate and want to bring people down, when they're doing well, but, you know, I haven't really received a lot of that, so I'm very grateful and honored that people want to support me on this journey. And now, we're going to be fucking dead. No more dead, he's evil, it's father's evil now. Dad mode, so super excited about that, being Courtney will discuss more of what's coming along with the baby, but you guys have heard me talk about before it's the thing I've looked forward to the most of my life. I did know what happened, but I'm so excited. So we're going to get into that a little bit deeper with Courtney. Talk about what's coming with the baby bump, but, until then, it's a wrap on this one, so I thank you guys for watching. And until next time.

I'm going to make a really slow right now. But I made way to try to do it my pants on. I'm going to go one by five or something. So, it took about half a stop at a 240-1.2. So, not bad, right? That two pounds came in handy this year. Probably could have pushed a little harder. But it's still great for the two pounds. Got the heat. It came in. It had either not very delicious. But we'll call it delicious. Fish and pulp. It did a lot of good. Food is great. I'll leave it to the press conference. Never know. It's expected these things. We have more people in here. We got a right to make up. We got a press conference. You're not picking publish. I'm not saying that we can make this like this. I don't know how much. I'm not doing this. What's wrong?

Chris Mumsman. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. You are here to do what you have done before. Is it just another day at the office? I see that you have gentlemen next day that you train or services over there, you are allowed. Those moments in the gym, someone is like you are lowering your man. Young lions and all that stuff. What I want to know is, are you here to just win this thing or you here to actually dominate this thing? Because there is a lot of people that believe that you can do it. Of course there is people next to you that think you can't. I'm here for a few reasons. I've said, I'm absolutely welcome home. Was I trophy? But that's not the only reason why I'm here this year. This is my fifth time chasing after title. I've been on the on the stage. I'm competing for 10 years. If I've learned anything, it's that in the past. I felt I'd have to just shut down a lot. I've pressed a lot and just go into this performance mode to win. I'm just pushing everything aside. And this year what I want, I will be with you. I want to be different. I want to feel the whole journey. I want to have fun training. I want to enjoy the process. Feel the outspiel the downs. Not just not the wallet. I'm not the one who's going to be here. I'm excited to be here. I'm smiling. I'm showing my family and they're all here. I'm just having a good time. I'm putting the work. I know these guys are fighting for second place. And I'm just here to win. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. No, yeah. What's the week? I don't want you to get better there's zero. I don't want to be. I want to be no. Great good brother. I'm going to give Chris a good run for his buddy. And he's going to have a success week. We got a great competition every time he's back. But I mean, just take with Chris. Chris. Sean Ray says, you're in the wrong division. You should be in the open. Your eyes should be on that stand out. You should be in that open. He thinks you got a legitimate shot. Sean's there, right? Chris knows. I told him two or three years ago. He's in the wrong division. But he's always got to do. I'm right wherever. I'm going to get back to the end. Now, you're where you're going right now. But let's just say, technically say, you do win five. And you said, many times, you're about any years. You got a lot, but you still got some gas. But then, would you consider, if you were to win five, would you consider hand in a month? I need to let me a stage. But only temporarily, you're going to grab it for a pair of trunks and get that sand out of shot. Sorry, can't point out. Like, some tons of air. Do you want to do it? No, no, no. I'm not going to say, read your Chris. I'll do it this weekend. I mean, listen, I know you're an over-ish. So if I could be a little bit much, I'll be cool, though. But no, I'm not going to, like, just say, you say, okay, five's enough. I'm returning from class. I'll be back next year. And I'll go over that. I don't know if you're trying to exit the crowd or get these gas hopes up. I don't like Joe. Well, the first tell us it's key. So as if you're eating in a good five, you're going to put it in to that right here right now. This year, the junior four, I know you want you to like it, brother. But it's time to move on. The Earth is a miracle, bearer. Can it happen? Will it happen? We all know everything can happen in this world, especially nowadays. But we're going to find an hour, set it a evening, man. You got to get to the speed, no, before you get to the ship up. I know he's not understanding when I say the English, so I said it in Puerto Mish, Cuitado, Dosicando. Who are you? Who are you? You got a whole bunch of followups. You're dead head right now. No, I say you guys, the question I can ask is, Earth said that he put on 15 hours since his last attempt at beating Chris. Chris says it's going to kind of be a sound like a saying it's going to be a walk in the park. So I don't know. You train with him to see anything when you were training with him that gave me an idea that you could surpass him this year. Yeah, so definitely that he's getting old of. So I knew I invested a lot last year, I trained my ass off over there and coldest journey in the bunker. And he has a great journey, sunny winter, so I knew I won my ass off. No, but decide that. It's always good to always go to training and with those others, to come out of competitors, it's always the reason why flying the US, literally on the, yeah, I'm into those guys. I also came all the way to Brazil and trained with Ramon. So I think it's good to push each other in a certain way and also don't forget the fun. Yeah, and it's also fun at this level of bodybuilding, trust me. So it's a great spot of a great time, everybody should join in and follow it. All right, thank you, Eric Bell, you can't stop flying anybody from Brazil. Ramon is a superstar in Brazil. I'm going to ask this question real quick and Portuguese and then I'll translate when you respond to the audience. Ramon, you're in the middle of Brazil, but you're a Brazilian. So you're not going to be able to do that. So I'm going to ask you to come out of your preparation. So what's the question? I asked him, he's in here in Brazil, but a lot of people are being critical that he didn't show any pictures and that he maybe doesn't pose as aggressively. Wouldn't he have to say about this? So, if you're going to, don't you just come out of your strategy? I think that's a good thing that I'm going to do the same. Most of all, I'm going to do a different thing that I can do because I'm not going to do anything. And that's what I'm going to do, and that's what I'm going to do. I think that's a good thing. He said, it doesn't matter when the picture show, it's not a strategy. I'm only concerned about what I'm going to show on stage. How about that? Thank you very much. Well, I have a question because a lot of these guys, they seem to be fans of the Chris Bumstedt. They make hard signs to Chris Bumstedt. They invite Chris Bumstedt to dinner. But, pre-on is the kind that actually challenges Chris Bumstedt. Pre-on is this year that you're going to do some of these young guys to finally challenge Chris Bumstedt. Chris, you trained for your first floor, Linda Bowins. I want to say the most popular by the law in Instagram, 1920, million-bought, 20, wait, it's 21 now, 21 now. But you have so many people coming up to you in the gym, when you're trying to drink for the Linda, it's a picture, it's a talk. And you're a nice guy and you've always accommodated everyone. But this year, you built your own gym. You've trained in private, you've noticed directions. What difference did that make in your training and your focus for this year? I'm focused for this one. Me and it was the very selfish and you're focusing. I had this year to have that private gym and it was a lot of fun. I got to teach a trans-my friend and focus and do what I do. And I think for guys who are aware of that, I could be able to gym with the barbell or receipts with some dumbbells. I'm going to get the work done and do what I do. But I mean every age I could get, I'm going to take it. I built that type of gym, I got to work. I didn't really help me focus my mind. I was going to say before, just enjoy the journey. I could go in there. I could be quiet, I could play my music. I could be present. I could enjoy every single workout. I remember getting into the barbell squatting, doing this and being like, I got two more things, just like, feel this and enjoy this. This is so fine right now. It'd be this strong with lean to be working so much such a difficult, beautiful goal. I just, they both allowed me to ski more in my presence and everything I was doing. I trained my ass off and go off and I'm going to provide so hopefully it helps. I just need it, but then we'll have one final. All right, I'm going to work. I have to do it. You're going to get so happy to play out. I'm going to do those. Let's go up and go up. Do you want to go up? Yes. I'm going to do that. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. I'm going to go up and go up and go up. Right. Right. I know. Just like, I never thought. You know, like, these old guy. No, no. That wasn't that. He's got his food. You ready? Yeah. It's a skyrocket. Is this like, you know, that's different? No, but it also doesn't look like it. Yeah, hi, anyway. No, no. No, no. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. No, no. He's wearing up for it when he can. We have. All right. So. Williams. Check. First conference. Check. Thursday. Chaos is half over. We are home. We're going to eat some food now. We need two meals today. This is November 3. The press conference sometimes. I mean, people like it. I get it sitting there when I'm this tired and the chair. My next Saturday at headache and just every two hours. Just beaming lights on you. And I'm like, all right. I got to go eat. I got to go to the trip's water and chill. So finish that up. I found Van turn was the boys and no, Brionne's back this year. We had a, it's funny. I spoke last year. We had like a. Like a genuine rivalry. He was the one who beat me at the end. And it was like that. And he retired last year. And it was like this. Like moment of friendship that we had those genuine. Like that. And he comes back and I was like. Back in the tack. So fun being out there was them. Been turning a little bit. Yeah, I'm just enjoying it. You know what's fucking on all of this here. We've got some jokes chilling out there. And now we get to eat.

Understanding these sources of microplastic exposure, again, is really important because it helps us develop strategies to mitigate our exposure. And we are going to discuss those mitigation strategies later in this episode. But first, it's essential to address a pressing issue that often goes unnoticed. Microplastics don't just pass through our bodies. They bio-accumulate. So every breath we take, every bite we eat, every simply drink, introduces these tiny microplastic particles into our system. And they don't just vanish. They're settling into our lungs, into our liver, our kidney, our bloodstream, and even into our brains. And along with them, they're carrying these harmful chemicals like BPA and phallates, right? These might be altering our health in ways we're only beginning to understand. So let's start with the lungs. There was a study published in 2022 that examined lung tissues from surgical patients and found microplastics in every single sample. And what's striking is that these patients had no significant environmental exposures beyond just daily life. Researchers identified various types of microplastics, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and PET. The same plastics that are found in everyday items like bags, bottles, clothing fibers. In the lungs, microplastics can cause inflammation and oxidative stress and they can contribute to respiratory issues like asthma and COPD. And study found that microplastics could reach the lower regions of the lungs, which was previously thought to be unlikely due to the body's natural filtration mechanisms. This discovery suggests that inhalation is a more significant route to of microplastic exposure than we previously understood. But the lungs are just the beginning. The liver, our body's primary detoxifying organ, is another critical site where microplastics accumulate. Research has shown that liver cells expose to microplastics exhibit significant disruptions in functions. So specifically they have mitochondrial damage and increased oxidative stress, both key drivers of conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A study compared liver tissue samples from individuals with liver cirrhosis compared to those who had healthy liver. The serotic liver contains significantly higher levels of microplastics compared to normal healthy liver. Suggesting these microplastic particles could play a role in liver disease progression. This is alarming because it implies that microplastics aren't just innocent bystanders accumulating our organs. They may be playing an active role in damaging our organs. But what's most concerning is the brain. In both animal studies and also preliminary human studies, microplastics have been found to cross the blood-brain barrier. This is a highly selective membrane designed to protect the brain from harmful substances like microplastics. Once microplastics are inside, they can activate microglial cells. These are the brain's resident immune cells. Activated microglia can trigger neuroinflammatory responses which over time may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, like Parkinson's disease. In fact, a study using mice expose the mice to microplastics and it found that increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the brain along with behavioral changes that were indicative of neurological impairment. While more research is needed to fully understand the implications for humans, I do think these findings are a significant cause for concern. And the reproductive system isn't spared either. A study discovered microplastics in human placenta's collected after birth. The microplastic particles were found on both the maternal and fetal sides of the placenta as well as within the amniotic membranes. So this suggests that microplastics can cross the placental barrier potentially exposing the developing fetus to these particles during critical periods of growth. And in males, the situation is equally troubling. Human studies have detected microplastics in testicular tissue, in sperm, and even in the blood testies barrier. This is a protective layer that shields the developing sperm cells from harmful substances. In animal studies, exposure to microplastics led to decreased sperm count, reduced motility, and alterations in sperm morphology. These changes raise serious questions about fertility and reproductive health in humans. One of the most significant and efficient transport systems for microplastics to reach our organs like the brain, like the sperm, is our bloodstream. So one study published in 2022 was the first to detect microplastics in human blood samples. Researchers found that 80% of the participants had measurable levels of microplastics in their blood with an average concentration of about 1.6 micrograms per milliliter. This finding confirms that once the microplastics enter our bodies, whether through inhalation or ingestion or even dermal contact, they can circulate in our bloodstream and then deposit in various tissues and organs. What I'm getting at here is that every time we drink from a plastic bottle or drink tap water contaminated with microplastics or eat food packaged in plastic or breathe air contaminated with microplastic fibers from synthetic clothing or tyroware. We are potentially introducing these particles into our bloodstream. The blood then acts as a highway delivering microplastics to organs where they not only take up residents, but they accumulate over time. And this is the concern. Biowacumulation. Microplastics don't do great easily within the body. A study involving cardiac surgery patients found that the number of microplastics in their blood increased after surgery compared to before surgery. This suggests that microplastics persist in the body and are not readily eliminated, leading to bio-ocumulation. This could have potential long-term health implications. But it's not just the plastics themselves that we need to worry about, right? It's also the chemicals they carry. Many microplastics act as vectors for endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA, BPS, Thalate and the PFAS. These are substances that can lead you out and accumulate alongside microplastics in the body. We're going to discuss some of these health consequences in just a minute. But I want to drive home. How important is to understand this concept of bio-ocumulation of microplastics? So far, it does not seem like microplastics have a way out once they make their way into our organs. This is key to understanding and grasping the health risk associated with them. Now let's discuss how microplastics in their associated chemicals like BPA, BPS, Thalates, are impacting our endocrine system. This is not just a minor concern. It's a significant area of research because endocrine disruption means that these substances are interfering with hormone signaling in our bodies. And hormones, as many of you know, regulate everything from metabolism to reproduction to brain function. So let's start with BPA and BPS, which are classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals because they can mimic the body's natural hormones. Specifically, they act as xenostrogens. These are foreign compounds that imitate estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors. When BPA or BPS binds to these receptors, they can either activate or block normal estrogen activity. This miscommunication leads to abnormal hormone signaling affecting reproductive health, brain development, and so much more. For instance, one study found that adults and adolescents with higher urinary BPA levels had lower testosterone levels and altered estrogen metabolism. This suggests BPA isn't just mimicking estrogen, but also disrupting normal hormonal pathways throwing off this delicate balance of our endocrine system. Thalates are another group of endocrine disruptors and a certain metabolite of thalates called D-E-H-P in particular interferes with the HPG access. This is essentially the command center for hormone production and regulation. By disrupting this access, thalates can then lead to reduced levels of critical hormones, like testosterone and estrodial, and this doesn't just impact reproductive health, it has downstream effects, muscle mass, bone density, even mood. On the thyroid front, BPA and thalates can interfere with thyroid hormone receptors. This disrupts the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate T3 and T4 thyroid hormone levels. These hormones are vital for metabolism for energy levels and cognitive function. Destruction here can lead to symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, cognitive impairments. Human observational studies have provided some evidence of these effects. So data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey says, Enhane's data has repeatedly shown that higher urinary levels of BPA correlate with disruptions in sex hormone levels and thyroid function. In one study, pregnant women with higher BPA levels, they had children with altered hormone levels, particularly affecting thyroid function. Since thyroid hormones are critical for brain development, both in-neutero and throughout life, this finding does raise significant concerns. Now conducting long-term randomized control trials and humans to assess the impact of these chemicals is ethically problematic. We can't knowingly expose people to potentially harmful substances. However, some short-term intervention studies have been insightful. For example, one study had participants consumed canned soup daily for five days, which led to a 1,200 increase in urinary BPA levels compared to those who consumed fresh soup. This acute exposure of BPA led to measurable changes in their hormone levels, including decreased testosterone and altered thyroid function. When we turn to animal studies, the data becomes more supportive. Chronic exposure to BPA and salates in mice has shown not to just disrupt hormones, but also leads to physical changes. Male rodents exposed to BPA exhibited reduced sperm count, impaired sperm quality, and alterations in testosterone synthesis. And female rodents showed disrupted ovarian function, earlier onset of puberty and irregular estrus cycles. A particularly interesting study involved exposing pregnant mice to BPA. The offspring of these mice showed behavioral changes such as increasing anxiety and altered social interactions, suggesting that BPA exposure can have transgenerational effects impacting brain development and behavior. In terms of thyroid function, animal studies demonstrated that microplastics like polystyrene and chemicals like BPA disrupt thyroid hormone signaling. This leads to reduced levels of TSHT3T4. These hormones are critical for regulating metabolism. What was the result? Well, animals exhibited signs of hypothyroidism, including weight gain and lithology. So what does this mean for us? The cumulative evidence suggests that even low dose chronic exposure to these endocrine disruptors could impact our hormonal health in meaningful ways. The endocrine system doesn't just operate in isolation. It's interconnected with virtually every system in our body. So disruptions here can contribute to a cascade of health issues from infertility to metabolic disorders to cognitive impairments, to increase cancer risk. I want to take a moment now to shift gears and talk about BPA and reproductive health, starting with how it affects pregnant women and their developing babies. A steady publish in 2022 looked at BPA exposure in pregnant women and found that those with higher levels of BPA in their urine were more likely to give birth to boys who had slower growth rates during their early years. So what's happening here? Well, BPA is an endocrine disruptor. It's messing around with our hormones and during pregnancy hormones are very important for keeping everything on track for fetal development. BPA, which mimics estrogen, can throw off that balance. And so the study actually did find that BPA exposure disrupts estrogen signaling in the placenta. This interference might explain why boys had the lead growth. I think it's pretty unsettling when you think about how something as ubiquitous a BPA is found in everything, all these plastic food containers in or drinking water, everything. How it could have such a profound impact on early early development. And it's not just BPA that's causing concern. Thalates, another class of chemicals that are everywhere in plastic bottles, food packaging, personal care products on and on and on. What's troubling is how consistently Thalates interfere with male reproductive development. And it's really getting worse as our exposure to plastics increases. Multiple studies have now shown that higher Thalate levels during pregnancy are linked to a significant shortening of the ano genital distance in male boys. This is a key marker for reproductive health. So shorter ano genital distance in boys has been linked to a higher risk of birth defects like hypospadias. This is where the urethra doesn't develop property and also undecended testicles. And these aren't just cosmetic issues. They can lead to serious complications later in life, including infertility, hormonal abalances, and even increased risk of testicular cancer. And it's not just high levels. Thalate exposure even at low concentrations can disrupt the development of male reproductive organs. So what's the reason? Thalates act as anti-androgens, meaning they block the action of testosterone, which is critical for male development. Studies have shown that Thalates disrupt hormonal signals during these crucial windows of fetal development. Essentially hijacking the very process that shapes the male reproductive health. So the result is there's long-term impacts that can persist into adulthood. Fast forward and you see similar issues in men exposed to higher levels of Thalates. Research has shown that men with elevated Thalate levels have lower sperm quality and reduced testosterone levels, directly impacting fertility and overall hormone balance. And it's not just boys and men who are affected in women exposure to higher Thalate levels is associated with irregular menstrual cycles and a higher risk of endometriosis, which is a painful condition that can lead to fertility issues. The mechanism here is similar. Thalates disrupt estrogen pathways, which are crucial for regulating the menstrual cycle and maintaining reproductive health. We're talking about chemicals that have made their way into our bodies through the products we use every day, through the water we drink every day, through the air we breathe every day. And Thalates don't need to be at high concentrations to wreak havoc. They're quietly causing this insidious damage to our hormonal systems that's building up over days and days and years and years and decades and decades and they're affecting everything from development including neurodevelopment. And I want to talk about this now. So there's a potential link between BPA and autism spectrum disorder. There are multiple human observational studies that suggest a connection between maternal BPA levels and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder. For example, one study from Harvard School of Public Health found that higher BPA levels and pregnant women were associated with behavioral problems in their children particularly boys. So these included issues like anxiety, aggression, impaired social functioning, these are traits that overlap with autism spectrum disorder symptoms. Another large cohorts study followed pregnant women and their children over several years and found that higher maternal BPA exposure during pregnancy was associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and children including several behavioral problems and again, these effects were more pronounced in boys. While the study didn't specifically diagnose autism, the behavioral impacts they observed align again with traits that are seen in autism spectrum disorder. There's also a meta-analysis that reviewed several studies on maternal BPA exposure and neurodevelopment and although it didn't conclusively prove a direct link to autism, it did find consistent evidence that prenatal BPA exposure increased the risk of behavioral issues like hyperactivity and inattention, which are common in children with autism spectrum disorder and also other neurodevelopmental disorders. And when you pair that with the animal data, it becomes harder to ignore this potential animal studies have consistently shown that BPA exposure during pregnancy causes offspring to have deficits in social behaviors, increased anxiety and altered brain structure in key areas, like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, the same brain areas that affected humans with autism. And it's not just about BPA exposure during pregnancy, there's actually another layer to this. So one study found that children with autism spectrum disorder actually struggle to metabolize BPA. So their bodies aren't detoxifying the chemical as efficiently so it builds up, especially in its active form free BPA, which means it's circulating in their systems longer and potentially affecting brain development throughout childhood and adolescents. This is important because estrogen receptors in the brain play a key role in things like cognition, memory, social behavior areas that are often impacted in autism. Some research actually suspect that this impaired metabolism of BPA in kids with autism spectrum disorder could be disrupting those key neural pathways which could explain some of the cognitive and behavioral challenges that are seen in autism. It's almost like this one-two punch. First, you've got maternal exposure during pregnancy, which affects the structure and development of the brain. Then if that child is less able to metabolize BPA efficiently, it sets up this prolonged exposure to a chemical that's known to interfere with brain development. So animal studies consistently show that early life exposure to BPA disrupts neural circuits responsible for learning, attention, behavior, and this could explain some of the cognitive and social deficits seen in children with autism spectrum disorder. But the effects of BPA on the developing brain don't end with autism. There's also evidence that prenatal exposure to BPA is linked to a higher risk of behavioral problems like anxiety, attention disorders, and even ADHD. So a study published in 2017 found that kids who were exposed to higher levels of BPA during pregnancy were more likely to develop ADHD along with anxiety and depression later in childhood. So how does BPA do all this damage? Well, it seems like it interferes with the key neuro-transminar system, specifically dopamine and serotonin, that affect brain function. So these chemicals are crucial for regulating mood, attention, cognitive function, and during development, serotonin actually pays a key role in shaping the structure and function of the brain. It's actually called a brain morphogen during development, so it's shaping the growth and differentiation of neurons during early life. It acts as a growth factor during embryonic development, influencing the development of key brain regions like the cerebellum by promoting dendritic growth in synapse formation and stabilization. These are critical processes for proper neural circuit formation and coordination between brain regions. Disruption of the serotonin system during this very critical period could absolutely affect brain development. In fact, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may also disrupt serotonin production, which could affect autism risk. I actually published two studies on this very topic a few years ago. So the fact that BPA is linked to autism and it disrupts serotonin system and vitamin D deficiency also is linked to autism during pregnancy and also disrupts a serotonin system. To me, strengthens the connection because when you start to see different environmental factors that are all sort of aligning and converging on a similar mechanism, it's really hard to ignore. So on top of that, BPA also induces oxidative stress in the brain. So this means it's generating harmful free radicals that damage brain cells. It impairs their ability to communicate and to adapt. This is what we call synaptic plasticity. That oxidative stress can also trigger inflammation which just sort of amplifies the damage, especially in developing neurons. Now I want to get on to something that we touched on earlier in the podcast that also is pretty concerning. It's the idea that microplastics could actually be making their way into the adult brain. So when we think about how the body protects the brain, we usually think of the blood brain barrier. This is a highly selective shield that's supposed to keep harmful substances out of the brain. But there's emerging evidence suggesting that microplastics, especially the smaller nanoplastics. So these are less than one micrometer, can actually cross the blood-brain barrier. And once they're in, they could cause some real damage. For example, one study found that polystyrene microplastics were accumulating in critical brain regions like the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. These are areas responsible for memory, for learning, for emotional regulation. When these microplastics settle into brain tissue, they can trigger an inflammatory response. They spike levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like Tien of Alpha, IL-6. These are markers that are associated with chronic brain inflammation. And we know chronic brain inflammation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, like Parkinson's disease, and even just normal cognitive decline. If you want to learn more on how neuroinflammation plays a major role in the development of neurodegenerative disease, please check out my previous episode, episode number 79, with Dr. Axel Montaine on the blood-brain barrier and Alzheimer's disease. And it's not just animal studies that's showing this connection. There's emerging human data showing accumulation of microplastics in brain samples taken from human autopsies. In one study research exam and tissues from liver, kidneys, and brains of autopsied individuals. While all organs contained microplastics, that's concerning. The brain samples alone were particularly concerning because on average of the 91 brain samples studied, they contain 10 to 20 times more plastic in the brains than other organs. And these findings are even more disturbing when you consider their implications for neurodegenerative diseases. Among the brain sample study, 12 were from individuals who had died with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. These samples contained up to 10 times more plastic by weight compared to those people who had plastics in their brains without dementia. While this doesn't yet prove causation, I think the correlation is enough to race serious concerns about the role of microplastics in cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer's disease. What's also striking is the increase in microplastic concentrations over time. So human brain samples from 2024 had about 50 percent more plastic than similar samples dating back to 2016. This trend mirrors the rising level of microplastics found in the environment, suggesting that as our environmental plastic pollution increases, so does the plastic accumulation in human tissues like the brain. So the question becomes, what does long-term, low dose exposure look like for humans, especially in urban environments where microplastic air pollution is high? And what about kids? So we already discussed this somewhat during early development, the blood-brain barrier is even more permeable, which means that pregnant women and young children could be at a greater risk for neurodegenerative mental issues like autism or ADHD if exposed to microplastics. An observational evidence seems to suggest that this is the case for chemicals associated with them as well, like BPA. So the implications are that we can be looking at higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive impairments, and even neurodabellimental issues if exposure starts early in life. This is something we absolutely need more research on, but the early signs are not good. Let's shift gears and talk about fertility. BPA is something I really want to emphasize here because it's impact on fertility is pretty alarming. There's a lot of research out there that shows just how much BPA exposure can interfere with women's reproductive health. Let's start with egg quality. So there's a study that looked at women going through IVF and what was found was kind of shocking. Women with higher levels of BPA in their urine had half as many viable eggs as women with lower BPA levels. And that's huge. Imagine your chances of a successful pregnancy being cut in half just because of your exposure to a chemical found in everyday plastics. But it doesn't stop BPA also messes with ovarian function by disrupting the hormonal balance that's crucial for regular ovulation. It interferes with estrogen and progesterone, which are basically the key players in regulating our menstrual cycle. This means even if you're not trying to conceive right now, BPA could be impacting your ability to ovulate consistently and prepare your body for pregnancy when you're ready. And then there's implantation. This is the process where the fertilize egg attaches to the uterine wall. Even if everything else is in order, BPA can affect the uterine lining and make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant. One study showed that women with higher BPA levels had lower implantation success during IVF, which makes it clear that this isn't just a hypothetical concern. BPA is affecting the body's natural ability to support early pregnancy. And BPA may also play a role in puberty as well because of its ability to mimic estrogen. So studies have shown that exposure to BPA at critical stages of development such as early fetal life, impency or even early childhood, is linked to early onset of puberty and girls. A study published in 2016 found that girls with higher prenatal BPA exposure had earlier breast development and monarchy, which is the first menstrual period, which can have long-term health consequences, including increased risk for breast cancer later in life, earlier mental pause later in life, etc. And for men, BPA exposure is also a concern when it comes to fertility. Now, we've known for a while, again, BPA can act like estrogen in the body, which can disrupt hormone balance, but it's effects on sperm are really alarming. So a study published in 2020 found that men with higher levels of BPA in their systems had lower testosterone levels and, unsurprisingly, their sperm quality was also significantly reduced. So think about this, they had lower sperm count, reduced mortality, and even structural abnormalities that were found in their sperm. And these are men who otherwise would seem healthy. Testosterone, as we know, is crucial not just for reproductive health, but for overall health. And when BPA gets into the body, it can start to mess around with the endocrine system in ways that affect all these areas of male fertility. What was also interesting about this study is that researchers found that this decline in sperm quality was found at relatively moderate levels of BPA exposure, which really highlights, again, how pervasive this issue is. BPA is everywhere. Plastics, food containers, canned goods, receipts. So this exposure adds up quickly, and this is where we start to see these systemic effects that have very real consequences on health and fertility. But honestly, BPA is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what's going on here. Microplastics are also playing a pretty significant role, and this is where it can get even more concerning. There was a study that looked at semen samples from 40 healthy young men, men who should be in their prime reproductive years, and get this. Every single sample had microplastics in it. On average, there were two particles per sample, and these weren't just harmless specs. We're talking about plastic particles ranging in size from 0.7 micrometers to 7 micrometers. So there's small, but they're definitely there. And the most common type that was found was polystyrene. This is this stuff that's found in packaging. It's in containers. That made up around 31% of the total. But what's really troubling is that what is this doing to sperm? These microplastics were linked to abnormal sperm shape and impaired motility, meaning their sperm couldn't move as efficiently. And one of the worst culprits was PVC. This is the same plastic used in things like water pipes. This is where our tap water is coming from. So a small particles from PVC can break down and leach into our water supply over time. So tap water is a huge source of microplastics. So here we are. Microplastics aren't just in an environmental issue. They are a human health issue. We've got them inside our bodies, even affecting fertility, which is something that feels so fundamental. And it raises the question, if microplastics are doing this to healthy young men, what else are they doing to our overall health? It's something we really need to pay attention to. Okay, now let's discuss how microplastics and their associated chemicals like BPA, falades could play a role in cardiovascular disease. Much of the focus has been on how these substances affect hormones and metabolism, but there is some growing evidence that they could have an impact on the heart and also on blood vessels. So BPA doesn't just mess with our hormones. It actually directly affects our heart's ability to function properly. One of the key mechanisms here is how BPA disrupts calcium signaling and heart cells. So calcium is essential for the electrical activity of the heart. It helps regulate things like heart rate, contractile function, and even how blood vessels dilate. Studies have shown that acute exposure to BPA can inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels, which impairs how cardio myocytes, these are the cells in our heart, handle calcium, and this disruption can affect how the heart can track and it can trigger abnormal activities in the heart muscle. What's interesting is that these effects seem to hit men and women differently, likely due to BPA's interaction with estrogen, which is a hormone that plays a key role and regulating heart function in women. Another set of chemicals that we've been discussing falades can act as cardio depressants, meaning they slow down the heart rate, and they interfere with the way electrical signals move through the heart. This not only weakens our heart's ability to contract, but also slows blood flow down, and makes it harder for our hearts to do its job efficiently. And these effects can build up over time. They can contribute to chronic heart problems. In rodent studies, exposure to a metabolite of falate called DEHP has been shown to decrease coronary flow and reduce the heart's ability to contract properly. Falades slow down heart rate and the speed at which electrical signals travel across the heart muscle. So this means falades are directly suppressing cardiac function. Now let's talk about microplastics themselves. Microplastics have been found embedded in arterial plaques, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that patients with microplastics lodged in their arterial walls were 4.5 times more likely to experience a major cardiovascular event like a heart attack or stroke within three years compared to patients that did not have microplastics in their arterial walls. Microplastics were detected in 58.4% of patients undergoing surgery for heart disease. This suggests that chronic exposure to these particles could be playing a significant role in cardiovascular events. What's happening here is likely to fold. First, microplastics can promote chronic inflammation, which is a key driver of atherosclerosis or the build above plaque in the arteries. Second, these particles carry harmful chemicals like PPA and falades directly into the arterial walls. So these chemicals may further contribute to the formation of plaque and may also increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Another concern is the link between BPA exposure and hypertension. In a randomized controlled trial, researchers found that participants who drank from BPA line can't experience a significant spike in blood pressure about 4.5 millimeters of mercury increase in systolic blood pressure within hours. So the lead researcher of this study warned that repeated exposure to BPA could be contributing to chronic hypertension. This is a condition that's already affecting nearly a third of the global population. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. So this connection adds another layer of concern regarding everyday BPA exposure. But what's even more concerning is how chronic exposure to BPA may drive cardiovascular mortality over time. A study that analyzed enhanced data from over 9,000 participants followed people for about 9 years and found that those people with the highest urinary BPA levels were 1.76 times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, these effects were far more pronounced in women. So women in the highest exposure group had about a 2.8 times higher risk of a cardiovascular death compared to women in the lowest group for BPA levels. For men, there was still an elevated risk but it was not as extreme. So this isn't just about BPA raising our blood pressure in the short term. We're talking about a serious long term risk of dying from heart disease and it appears that women are especially vulnerable. And again, it's not just BPA, but also the microplastics themselves accumulating in the arterial walls and possibly increasing heart attack risk. This really highlights the critical importance of reducing microplastic exposure, of reducing our exposure to BPA in everyday life. Whether that means we're making more informed choices about choosing glass over plastic or avoiding canned foods, which are lined with BPA, or even just filtering our tap water. We'll get to more on that in just a minute. But first, I want to shift gears and talk a little bit about what we know about microplastics and there are associated chemicals when it comes to cancer risk. So this is a topic that's gaining more attention as new data emerges. As we've been discussing one of the key concerns with microplastics is not just the particles themselves, but the chemicals they carry, including salates and BPA, both, which are endocrine disruptors. Because these substances interfere with our hormonal systems, there could be an effect on cancer risk. Let's start with salates. So a study published in 2022 looked at about 1.3 million children in Denmark over a 20-year period. The study found that childhood exposure to salates was associated with a 20% higher overall risk of childhood cancer. But it didn't stop there. The study highlighted specific cancers showing that children exposed to salates had nearly a three-fold higher rate of osteo-starcoma. This is a rare bone cancer, and they had a two-fold higher rate of lymphoma. So this is a blood cancer. What makes this study particularly robust is the data set. So Denmark has a universal healthcare system that provides very detailed records, allowing researchers to track medication-associated valley exposure with more precision. So the findings are very significant because the valid exposure here wasn't just environmental or dietary. It was actually tracked through medication fills containing thallates. So it represented a higher exposure than normal typical environmental levels. But still, I think these results should make us question what background exposure from our everyday environment could be doing especially over time. The connection between thallates and breast cancer is also emerging. A meta-analysis pulled data from nine case controlled studies involving over 7,800 participants across multiple countries. And it found that specific thallate metabolites were positively associated with breast cancer risk. These are the kind of details that matter. We're not just talking about vagas associations here. These are metabolites from specific thallates showing a clear connection to cancer risk. So the question becomes how much cumulative exposure are we really getting? And more importantly, how does this cumulative exposure build up over years or even decades to affect our cancer risk? Because cancer really does take decades to develop. There's also a growing body of research linking BPA exposure to breast cancer. So BPA acts by mimicking estrogen, which plays a central role in the development of breast cancer. Studies have shown that even low dose exposure to BPA can promote the growth of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells in laboratory settings. And we know from population level studies that chronic low dose exposure, the kind we're getting from everyday contact with BPA in plastics or canned food linings, even receipts, can accumulate. And so the question is, is it possible this cumulative exposure over decades can increase breast cancer risk? Particularly in women that may already have a higher risk for genetic or other lifestyle factors? One of the reasons my proplastics are so concerning is they act as a carrier for these chemicals. The plastics themselves can accumulate harmful chemicals like BPA, thallates, and even heavy metals transporting them into our bodies. Again, via the air we breathe, the water re-drink and the food we eat. And once they're in the body, microplastics can be bi-o-accumative, meaning they're building up in our tissues over time. Microplastics have also been found in human tumor samples. In a study that was conducted on patients with lung cancer, researchers found microplastic particles in tumor tissue, suggesting that these foreign particles might play a role in cancer development or progression. The presence of microplastics in tumor tissue is alarming because of their ability to cause chronic inflammation and potentially carry these harmful chemicals like BPA and thallates directly into the tumor microenvironment. Well, it's not yet clear whether these particles are directly playing a role in causing cancer. The fact that they can infiltrate tumor tissue highlights their potential to influence tumor biology, possibly legs aspirating inflammation, or even interfering with immune responses. There's obviously a lot to be learned here, but I do think the preliminary data is caused for concern and more research needs to be done in this area. Now, I want to talk about practical strategies for reducing our exposure to microplastics and their associated chemicals. And let's start with water. The most straightforward action is to minimize drinking water from plastic bottles and cans. Plastic bottles can reach microplastic and chemicals like BPA and BPS into water, and cans are often lined with plastic coatings containing these substances. But even if you're opting for water in glass bottles, there's another layer to consider. And that is the quality of the water itself, especially when it comes to carbonated water. This is where the forever chemicals enter. These are the per and polyfluoral alkyl substances, PFAS. As we discussed earlier, they are referred to forever chemicals. They are particularly troubling because they have half-lives that are several years long, meaning they persist in the body and accumulate over time. So PFAS have been linked to a range of health issues, including hormonal disruptions, immune system effects, even certain cancers. In 2020, consumer reports conducted third-party testing, and they published data on several popular brands of sparkling water to measure PFAS levels. The findings were eye-opening. Togo Chico top the list with PFAS levels at 9.76 parts per trillion. To put that into perspective, periae registered at about 1.1 part per trillion and San Pelagrino, which was even lower at 0.31 part per trillion. Both periae and San Pelagrino are often available in glass bottles, which is an added advantage for reducing plastic exposure. And I do think it's encouraging that multiple brands did achieve PFAS levels below one part per trillion, which demonstrates that it's entirely feasible to provide safer options. But this raises a critical question. Why do some brands like Togo Chico have such high levels of PFAS? In 2023, Coca-Cola, which is the parent company of Togo Chico claimed, they had reduced their PFAS levels by about half. However, without any actual transparent empirical data to confirm this, and even if it was accurate, that would still leave their PFAS levels at around 4.88 parts per trillion, which is significantly higher than many other brands that have less than one part per trillion of PFAS levels in their sparkling waters. So I think this situation does underscore a very important point, which is that we can't always rely on bottled or can water even from brands we trust to be free of contaminants. So how do we ensure that the water we're consuming is safe? I think the answer lies in taking control of our water quality at home, and one of the most effective ways to do this is by installing a reverse osmosis filtration system. So reverse osmosis filters can remove up to 99.9% of microplastic particles from water. It's really one of the best solutions for obtaining clean drinking water. Beyond microplastics, these systems also filter out a wide range of contaminants, everything from heavy metals to bacteria, and even chemicals like BPA in the PFAS forever chemicals. Now, it is important to note that reverse osmosis filters don't just remove the bad. They also strip away beneficial minerals and trace elements. So this is everything from calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, a variety of other zinc iron copper and selenium, iodine, magnees, and on, and on. There's more. These minerals are essential for various functions in the body, obviously everything from bone health to nerve-siddling, but there are practical solutions to this issue. Many reverse osmosis systems now come with a remineralization filter option that can add back these essential minerals and trace elements back to the water after they're purified. Alternatively, there's high quality mineral drops that can be added back to the filtered water or people can just supplement with mineral supplements. I do think that an added benefit of having a reverse osmosis home filtration system is its first mentality because not only can you use this water for drinking, but you can use the purified water to wash fruits and vegetables in a variety of produce, which can be contaminated with microplastics on their surface from soil, from contaminated water, from air exposure, where these particles settle on the surface of the produce. So washing produce with filtered water can help remove some of these microplastic particles that cling to surfaces, particularly waxing surfaces on certain produce. When it comes to food, opting for fresh over packaged food is another obvious impactful choice. So packaged foods often come wrapped in plastic. Those can shed microplastic and leach chemicals like BPA into our food. So by choosing fresh produce, fresh meats, bulk items, we can minimize exposure which is good for our own health but also promotes environmental health as well. Similarly, we should consider reducing our consumption of canned foods and canned beverages. So many aluminum cans are lined with plastic coatings. These coatings contain BPA or they have alternatives like BPS which carry similar health risks. So whenever possible, it's better to select products that are packaged in glass versus cans. We can also re-evaluate our food storage habits so opting for glass or stainless steel or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones. Avoid heating food and plastic containers. Remember heat can accelerate the leaching of chemicals like BPA into our food, into our beverages. It also accelerates the oxidation process which then causes more microplastics to be shed from the larger plastic itself. And remember, microwave safe simply means the plastic won't melt. It doesn't guarantee that it's free from chemical leaching. Also, try to avoid cooking with nonstick pans which are coated with some of these chemicals like the forever chemicals. So try to opt for options like titanium, ceramic, cast iron, these are all other options that we should be using for cooking our foods because again, heat is causing these chemicals to be leached into our foods at an even higher and accelerated rate. Which brings me to another crucial point and I want to talk about this myth of BPA free products. There's a lot of these BPA free products which sound like they're safer alternatives but they're not manufacturers frequently replace BPA with chemicals like BPS which also can disrupt hormonal activity in much the same way. And studies have shown that BPS may not be a safer option than BPA and potentially causing adverse health effects on fetal development, brain health, cardiovascular function, some BPA free plastics even contain thalates or other harmful plasticizers. So the term BPA free merely means the product lacks BPA and not that it's free from all other toxic chemicals. I also want to again highlight and bring your attention to a common daily exposure to microplastics and their associated chemicals and that is disposable paper, coffee and tea cups. These convenient paper cups are typically lined with plastic to prevent leaks. Here's the issue. When you pour that hot beverage into them, the heat causes the plastic lining to break down. You're getting microplastics into the beverage. You're leaching chemicals like BPA into your beverage at a much higher level. I already talked about a study where heat can cause the leaching of BPA up to 55 times higher compared to cold liquids. So a simple solution really is just to bring your own reusable to go mug to a coffee shop. If you're enjoying a drink at the cafe, ask for a ceramic cup if you're on the go, just bring your own mug and most briefs, does they're actually happy to fill your own travel mug? Some shops actually even offer a discount for doing so. When it comes to oral consumption of microplastics and their associated chemicals, I want to address another hidden source of microplastics and that is salt. It may or may not surprise you, but salt can significantly contribute to our microplastic intake. Estimates suggest that consuming salt can add around 7,000 microplastic particles to our diet each year. And that's a conservative figure. So sea salt generally has the highest levels of microplastic contamination due to the ocean pollution. One study found that sea salt's contained anywhere from 550 to 681 microplastic particles per kilogram, making them some of the most contaminated sources of salt. Lake salt's come next followed by rock salt, which have the least amount of microplastic contamination. So rock salts include commonly used varieties like Morton's iodized salt or pink chamelayan salt. So these salt do still contain some microplastics, but the levels are significantly lower than what's found in sea salt. So whenever possible, opting for rock or mine salts can reduce microplastic intake. Okay, now let's turn our attention to the air we breathe. This is another significant yet often overlooked source of microplastic exposure. Reducing the amount of microplastics we inhale is crucial. And fortunately there are a few practical steps that we can take to minimize this risk. First and foremost, let's consider our indoor environments. This is where we spend the majority of our time. One effective strategy is to use a hepe of filter. This is a high efficiency, particulate air filter. Using these in our homes can be highly efficient at trapping airborne microplastic particles. They can capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, making them pretty suitable for removing the vast majority of microplastics found in indoor air. Many of which range from 10 to 800 microns in size. A significant portion of airborne microplastics originates from synthetic textiles from carpets and other household materials. Every time we walk across a synthetic carpet or we sit on a polyester couch, tiny plastic fibers can become airborne. By using a hepe of filter, especially in areas where synthetic materials are prevalent, we can significantly reduce the number of microplastics floating around in our indoor air. Moreover, many modern vacuum cleaners actually now come equipped with a hepe of filter. So this feature allows them to trap microplastics effectively when they're cleaning floors or carpets and it prevents these particles from being redistributed back into the air. So regular vacuuming with hepe of filters can also make a substantial difference in indoor air quality as well. Now let's address the source of many of these airborne microplastics are clothing. Synthetic fibers like polyester nylon and acrylic are ubiquitous in today's fashion. These materials offer benefits like durability and affordability, but they also shed microplastics into the environment both into the air and also through washing. One impactful change is to opt for clothing made from 100% natural fibers. So this is cotton bamboo, linen, hemp wool or silk. These materials do not shed microplastics, but it is important to note that even blends containing synthetic fibers can still release microplastics. So aiming for pure natural fibers is really key here. I understand this might be challenging especially for people that have specific fashion preferences or budget considerations, but even gradual shifts in our wardrobe can make a significant difference over time. For those of us not ready to 100 percent part with our synthetic garments, there are ways we can also still mitigate the impact. Installing a microfiber filter on our washing machine is an effective method. So washing synthetic closes a major major source of microplastic pollution in the ocean in our waters. And so installing a microplastic filter can actually trap microplastic fibers released during washing of our laundry and prevent them from entering our waterways. There's also brands like guppy friend that offer these laundry bags that are designed to catch micro fibers during washing. So these bags really offer a straightforward and cost effective solution for people that are not really ready to install a micro fiber filter on their washing machine just yet. I also want to highlight another pathway through which microplastics and their associated chemicals like BPA can enter our bodies and that is through the skin. So dermal absorption isn't as significant as ingesting contaminated food or water or inhaling polluted air, but it is still a root worth paying attention to, especially because it involves everyday items we might not suspect. So consider thermal paper receipts. These are things that we're getting from the supermarket, gas stations, ATMs. These receipts often contain BPA, which is used as a color developer in the thermal printing process. So when we handle receipts, BPA can transfer into our skin and potentially enter our bloodstream. Now here's where it gets more interesting and concerning is that the use of lotions or sunscreens or hand sanitizers can dramatically increase the absorption of BPA through the skin. These products can enhance our skin's permeability, which allows BPA to pass through this skin more so than it normally would. In fact, studies have shown that using hand sanitizer before handling receipts can significantly boost BPA absorption into our bloodstream. So what can we do about this? When possible, opt to decline paper receipts or request a digital version, have it sent to your email or phone, many retailers offer this option and it reduces BPA exposure to ourselves, but it also reduces paper waste with a win-win. If your job requires you handling receipts frequently, such as if you're in a retailer food service, consider wearing nitrile gloves. So nitro gloves are effective barriers against chemicals like BPA. Unlike some latex glove, which may not offer the same level of protection. Okay, lastly, I want to cover some excretion methods. I want to talk about how our bodies handle the influx of microplastics and the chemicals associated with them, including BPA, BPS, Thalates, and the forever chemicals, the PFAS. So once these chemicals enter the body, whether it's through ingestion or inhalation or through skin contact, they are quickly absorbed and processed primarily by the liver. The liver is equipped with the variety of enzymes. Part of these enzymes are called phase two detoxification enzymes. These are enzymes that convert these chemicals into more water-soluble forms, making them easier for our body to excrete them mostly through urine. For example, BPA is cleared relatively fast within about six hours under normal conditions. Thalates take a bit longer, ranging between 12 to 24 hours, depending on the specific compound, while that might sound reassuring, the problem is we are exposed to these chemicals almost constantly. So our bodies are in a near continuous state of processing them. But this is where it gets even more complicated. So PFAS, again, these are forever chemicals, do not break down easily. So unlike BPA or Thalates, the PFAS have a half life of two to five years, meaning they accumulate in our organs like the liver and the kidneys, and their persistence in the body makes them much harder to eliminate. They stick around and they build up over time. Then there's microplastics themselves, microplastics do vary in size. Larger particles could pass through the gut and be excreted in feces, but the smaller nanoplastics. These are really, really tiny particles. These are crossing biological barriers and they're entering the bloodstream. Once they get into circulation systemically, we don't really fully understand how or if they're ever excreted efficiently. What we do know is that they are accumulating in our organs, in our tissues, and this is a growing concern when we talk about long-term health implications. So how do we help our bodies clear out chemicals like BPA, BPS, and Thalates more efficiently? One promising strategy revolves around tapping into our bodies' natural detoxification systems. And we can do that through dietary and lifestyle interventions. One compound that really stands out here is so fur-faint. You probably heard me talk about this before. It's a powerful molecule found in broccoli sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables. So fur-faint activates a key pathway called NRF2. Think of NRF2 as they master regulator of detoxification. It controls the production of enzymes that helps our body clear out many, many toxins. It boosts the phase two detoxification enzymes. These are enzymes that bind to harmful chemicals and make them more water soluble so we can excrete them through our urine. Animal studies have shown that when rodents are exposed to BPA and given so fur-faint, their phase two detoxification enzymes go into overdrive and they experience less overall BPA related toxicity. Now, well, there's not a lot of direct evidence on so fur-faint's ability to clear BPA and fallates specifically. I think the mechanism here is very solid and we do have compelling human data and other areas for instance. Studies show that so fur-faint can increase the excretion of toxins like benzene and acroline, which we get exposed through through air pollution and food by up to 60%. So in my view, incorporating so fur-faint rich foods into our diet, like broccoli sprouts, which contain up to a hundred times more sulfur-faint than mature broccoli, or considering a high-quality supplement of stabilized sulfur-faint or its precursor, glucoraphone, could be a viable strategy for helping detoxify BPA, BPS, and fallates. And by doing so, we do boost our body's natural detoxification pathways that has been shown in human studies that could help us more effectively eliminate some of these microplastic associated chemicals. Another avenue worth exploring is the role of dietary fiber in helping our bodies eliminate chemicals associated with plastics and perhaps even some microplastics themselves. Consuming fiber-rich foods can bind to lipophilic chemicals like BPA and fallates in the GI tract and reduce their absorption into the bloodstream, promoting their excretion via feces. So feces is another way our bodies detoxify BPA, fallates, and even microplastics. Some animal studies support this mechanism indicating that higher fiber intake leads to increased fecal excretion of these compounds. But what about microplastics themselves? While research is still emerging here, I think there's a reason to believe that dietary fiber could aid in the excretion of some larger microplastics. So since microplastics can be trapped within the gut loomin, a fiber-rich diet could potentially help encapsulate these particles and facilitate their removal through regular bowel movements. Essentially, fiber might help sweep the gut clean and reduce the residents' time of microplastics, therefore limiting their chances of causing harm and getting into bloodstream. This means incorporating foods that are high in fiber likely, dehumed, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, could serve a dual purpose, not only do they provide essential nutrients and micronutrients and phytochemicals and fermentable fiber that supports overall health and gut health, but they also could enhance the elimination of both harmful chemicals and microplastic particles. Let's talk about another powerful tool for eliminating some of these microplastic associated chemicals, physical activity and practices that induce sweating. So exercise, things like sauna, hot tubs, even hot yoga, sweat, it's not just about cooling down the body, it's also a way to eliminate harmful chemicals and compounds from the body. So sweat does can trace trace amounts of BPA and phallate metabolites. Now while most of these chemicals are excluded through urine, studies have shown that sweat can help too. One study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health found measurable levels of thallates in sweat of participants. I think this tells us that regular sweating, whether through exercise or sauna or hot yoga can be a viable route for excreting some of these harmful substances. So while the amounts of BPA and BPS and thallates that are excreting in sweat are smaller compared to urine, I think consistent sweating could really still play a meaningful role in lightening the toxic burden load on our body. And lastly, I do want to make one last mention that these excreation strategies that we've been discussing are less effective for the forever chemicals, the PFAS because of their resistance to metabolic breakdown because they are half life in the body is two to five years. So really the best way to avoid PFAS is to avoid the exposure in the first place and reducing our exposure to plastics does remain the most effective way to reducing our burden of PFAS chemicals. So this means avoiding plastic chemicals, avoiding mineral waters with high concentrations of PFAS and really just trying hard to reduce our use of plastics. So this wraps up our deep dive into the pervasive issue of microplastics and their associated chemicals. So I want to leave you with this. Microplastics and their associated chemicals are not just an environmental concern. They're posing a significant human health challenge that's impacting us at multiple biological levels. These microplastic particles infiltrate our bodies. They're accumulating in vital organs like our brain. They're disrupting hormonal balance. They're impairing fertility. They're posing substantial risk to our neurological and cardiovascular systems. But there is a constructive path forward by educating ourselves and making deliberate and form choices such as implementing effective water filtration systems to reduce our microplastic intake, opting for fresh foods over package ones, choosing clothing made from natural fibers instead of synthetic ones when possible. Supporting our bodies natural to doxification processes through proper nutrition and things like cruciferous vegetables and broccoli sprouts, sweating, exercising, using the sauna. These are all ways that we can actively reduce our microplastic exposure and their associated chemicals. I also hope that by raising awareness and advocating for systemic changes, we can contribute to a global effort for policy changes aimed at reducing plastic pollution. Remember, our individual actions when they're multiplied across communities, they can lead to a significant impact. I do think that if we work together, we can have the capacity to not only protect our own health, but that of future generations as well.

if you're a below normal VO2 max and you go just to normal, you're getting about a 2.1 increase in life expectancy. If you go below normal to high normal, which is about where half the population lies, then you're getting a almost three year increase in life expectancy. And then if you go to more of an elite level, so you're getting into above the upper limit, that's a five year increase in life expectancy, compared to where you were when you were below normal. And so lactate is feeling that, your brain function during exercise, but it's also increasing things like neuropinephrine, which is involved in focus and attention, serotonin and there have been studies showing that even 10 minutes of a high intensity interval training workout can improve cognition and improve mood. I mean, it's just really easy to get those improvements in just a short amount of time by like, you know, just getting after it pretty hard. Hi CrossFit. Yeah, so today we're going to be talking about how to maximize your health span. And I'm going to focus on three really important lifestyle behaviors. We're going to talk about exercise. We're going to talk about the strength of resistance training and the power of deliberate heat exposure. That's my disclosure. So focusing on exercise, it's going to be really vigorous exercise. We're going to talk about the importance of vigorous intensity exercise, going like 80% max heart rate or more. We're going to talk about the brain benefits. We're going to talk about cardiovascular benefits, cancer a little bit, exercise snacks, and we're going to get into some muscle biology a little bit, the importance of protein resistance training, and then into deliberate heat exposure and sauna, and how that can synergize with both exercise and also with resistance training. So let's start with the vigorous exercise. So cardiovascular respiratory fitness is probably one of the most important biomarkers that we can measure via VO2 max. So maximum oxygen uptake during maximal exercise, that really indicates our fitness levels. But it also is probably one of the most important indicators of longevity. And there's been studies that have shown. Probably the most important, I would say, the maximal benefits you get from improving your cardiovascular respiratory fitness go from, if you're below normal, and you go anywhere above that. So if you're below normal VO2 max, and you go just to normal, you're getting about a 2.1 increase in life expectancy. If you go below normal to high normal, which is about where half the population lies, then you're getting a almost three year increase in life expectancy. And then if you go to more of an elite level, so you're getting into above the upper limit, that's a five year increase in life expectancy compared to where you were when you were below normal. And about each unit increase in your VO2 max is associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy. And there was a really important study published in Jama Journal, this was like in 2018, and there's now been a couple of papers since then. But I really liked this study because it really sort of showed that there wasn't an upper limit on the longevity benefit of improving your VO2 max. And so people that were in the elite group of VO2 max, so this is, we're talking like the top two point one percent. Those people had a 80% lower all cause mortality compared to people that were in the lower 20% or so VO2 max. If you were not the elite, but like just you still are really fit, you had a high VO2 max, you had great cardiovascular fitness. You still had a 20% increase in all cause mortality compared to the elite athletes, like the people that had the really good VO2 max. So there seemed to really be a benefit at every level. But what was so interesting about this study was that people in that low fitness group, they had a low VO2 max. Their risk of death and all cause mortality was similar to having diseases like type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, it was similar to smoking. I mean, these things that everyone focuses on, these disease states that everyone focuses on, we know they're bad, we know they decrease life quality, they decrease life span. But what people don't focus on is how not having, not being physically fit, not having a good cardiovascular respiratory fitness is almost like having one of those diseases. And I really think that puts it into perspective. How important VO2 max is for longevity. So how do you improve your VO2 max? How do you improve your cardiovascular fitness? Well, aerobic exercise is definitely one of the best ways to do that. What type of aerobic exercise, I think it's pretty clear that high intensity interval training is one of the best ways to improve your VO2 max. And particularly when you do longer intervals, yes, you can improve your cardiovascular respiratory fitness with any type of aerobic exercise, particularly if you're starting from being sedentary and then going up, right? But there was a really important study that was published, a large, large population of people that showed people that are doing moderate intensity, sort of zone two training. And if this is the kind of exercise that is more enjoyable, you can go for run and you can still have somewhat of a conversation, your breathy. Those people are doing two and a half hours per week. They're meeting the guidelines. And yet they couldn't improve their VO2 max. About 40% of those people. So you're talking like half the population here. Until they add it in some high intensity interval training. And once they add it in some high intensity interval training, they were able to improve their VO2 max. And so I really think, again, this highlights the importance of really trying to get your heart rate up to at least 80% max. Heart rate or more. The question is, well, what kind of protocols are best for improving VO2 max? I mentioned longer intervals. I think probably, so Dr. Martin Cabalad does a lot of this research at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. And he has talked about one minute being sort of like, probably the minimal effective dose for improving VO2 max. Like at least getting on one, doing some one minute intervals and repeating that four or five times. But I think one of the most evidence-based protocols, if you look in the literature out there for improving cardiovascular rate fitness, is the Norwegian 4x4 protocol. And this is where you do four minutes of the most, you maintain the intensity that you can for that entire 4 minutes. So you don't want to go out all out in the first minute. So you want to be able to like pace yourself. It's four minutes of high intensity exercise followed by three minutes of recovery. And you do that four times. So it's a pretty brutal workout. But they're Norwegian 4x4 and it's one of the best ways to improve cardiovascular fitness as measured by VO2 max. If you are interested in measuring your VO2 max, the best way to do it obviously would be directly to measure it go to a lab that measures the VO2 max. If you don't have access to one of those, you don't want to pay or whatever. There's a good evidence-based way of estimating VO2 max. And that's really the 12 minute run test or walk test depending on your fitness level. And essentially all you need is a wearable device that tracks your distance. And you need a flat surface because anything hilly will obviously you won't run as far because it's more challenging. So you need a flat surface like a track field. And you run for 12 minutes and you pace yourself. You want to go hard, but you want to be able to do it the entire time. And then there's an equation you can look up, 12 minute run test equation, VO2 max. And the distance and this whole equation will give you a really good estimate of your VO2 max. For anyone that's interested in sort of seeing how they're training effects there, there are VO2 max. But I think one of the most convincing studies that I've seen for vigorous intensity exercise has to do with structural changes in the aging heart. So as we age, our heart undergo structural changes. It gets smaller in size and it gets stiffer. And this translates to functional deficiencies like exercise capacity goes down. But also it increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. A lot of different changes start to happen in the cardiovascular system when that occurs. And so there was a study done at UT Southwest and Dallas by Ben Levine's group where they took 50 year olds that were, they were disease-free, but they were sedentary. So they didn't have type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, but they weren't physically active. And they put them on two different exercise protocols. One that was the control group, which was more like stretching a little bit of a body weight training. It wasn't high intensity. They weren't really getting the heart rate up. A little more like yoga, ish type of workout. And the other group did that, but they also had a high intensity, like vigorous exercise workout program. And this was a two year intervention study. And so the first six months was like a progressive building up there in Jerns. And once they got to the sixth month part, Mark, most of these people were doing about four to five hours a week of training and a good portion of that time was spent in what's called maximal, your maximal state exercise state where they were doing like 20 to 30 minutes, a day of maximal intensity exercise. And not maximal intensity, but steady state. So they were able to basically maintain the maximal amount of intensity they could for 20 or 30 minutes. So it was vigorous. They were going 75, 80% max-harrate. They also did the Norwegian 4x4 protocol once a week. And after those two years, the structural changes and their heart were reverted back almost 20 years. So their hearts got more malleable and they got larger. And it was like looking at a 30 year old heart. And these were 50 year olds. And so I mean to me, it was just so astounding that you could get structural changes in the heart, essentially it's reversing the aging heart by just about 20 years from doing this vigorous intensity exercise protocol in 50 year olds. That were sedentary. And there's also drug size blood pressure improvements in with blood pressure with vigorous intensity exercise. So there's been a variety of randomized control trials and meta-analysis of these trials that have found. People that work out and do more vigorous intensity exercise three to four days a week, about 20 to 60 minutes, of vigorous intensity exercise, can improve their blood pressure similar to medications like anti-hypertensive medications. And blood pressure is not high blood pressure, not just a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It's now been established that it's one of the most important early risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. So the fact that you can comparably get these improvements in blood pressure like you would get with a pharmaceutical drug is also, I think, it's extremely encouraging, right? So when I shift gears just for a minute and get into some of the brain benefits, I think probably one of the most convincing reasons to get your heart rate up high. When I say, hi, I mean, 75, 80% in max heart rate. To do that is from brain benefits. And that largely has to deal with something called lactate, which probably many of you are familiar with. So when you force your muscles to work, so hard that you can't get oxygen to them fast enough to make energy, they have to adapt, right? And they use glucose as energy without the mitochondria, which is generally how you're making energy. And as a byproduct of that, you're turning out lactate, which was thought to be this sort of metabolic byproduct. It turns out it's much more than that. And so lactate gets into circulation and it's taken up by other tissues, including the muscle, the brain, the heart, liver, and it's used as energy in those tissues. So it's a very energetically favorable source of energy. It's actually easier to make energy from lactate than from glucose. So it takes less energy to make energy from lactate than glucose. But also it acts as a signaling molecule. It's a way for your muscles to communicate with other parts of your body. Because when you're exercising, it is a stress on the body. And so adaptations happen, right? When you're working your muscles hard, you can increase muscle hypertrophy. These adaptations happen. Cardiovascular improvements, you're getting increases in stroke volume, cardiovascular refitness improvements, will the brain also works really hard during exercise. And so lactate is communicating with the brain. And there's many benefits to having lactate go into the brain. And one of those is that it signals to the brain to make something called brain-drive neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. And what this is is a growth factor that is involved in increasing neurons inside the hippocampus, and other regions in the brain. But most of the hippocampus, which is important for learning and memory. And there's been intervention studies showing that aerobic exercise after older adults had to do it for two years, increase their hippocampal volume by like 2%. So it increases neurogenesis, but it also is important for neuroplasticity. This is the way your brain adapts. And is able to adapt to the changing environment. And still function. It plays a big role in depression. People that are depressed have a very low level of neuroplasticity. And so they have a hard time adapting to the changing environment. Causes depressive symptoms. So brain-drive neurotrophic factor is amazing for your brain. You want more of it. And high intensity, you know, exercise is the way to get more of it. It all lactate also signals to the brain to make neurotransmitters, like neuropronapherin and serotonin. These studies have been done in humans. Lactate, again, made from muscles when you're forcing your muscles to work hard. When you're going high intensity, cross is over the blood-brain barrier. And your brain is working hard during exercise. And so lactate is feeling that your brain function during exercise. But it's also increasing things like neuropronapherin, which is involved in focus and attention. Serotonin and there have been studies showing that even 10 minutes of a high intensity interval training workout can improve cognition and improve mood. I mean, it's just really easy to get those improvements in just a short amount of time by, like, you know, just getting after it pretty hard. Some of the protocols that have shown improvements in maximizing BDNF really are intensity and duration dependent. So the harder you go, 80% max heart rate for 30 to 40 minutes is one of the most robust ways. There's also another really good protocol. So there's going to be six minutes of high intensity and we'll training where you do about 40 seconds all out intervals separated by some recovery periods that also has been shown to pretty robustly increase brand-der-after-trophic factor as well. So I just wanted to spend just a second talking about some of the anti-medistatic effects of a vigorous intensity exercise. Most of us here know that exercise is one of the best things you can do to prevent cancer, but also as an adjunct cancer treatment. Many different ways that's occurring, but one interesting way that most people don't know about is through the shearing forces of your blood flow. So just getting that blood flow to go faster by exercising, by getting that exercise, kills what are called circulating tumor cells. These are tumor cells that have escaped a primary side of the tumor, get into circulation, and they go and try to travel to other tissues and take camp there and metastasize. Well circulating tumor cells are very sensitive to the mechanical forces, the shearing forces of blood flow. And they can't handle the stress like our normal cells can and they die. And so I think it's a really interesting way to think about it because it's like, oh yeah, I need to get my blood flow up. I need to get my heart rate going and my blood flow up. And that is something that has an antimicy static effect. And there's studies that have shown, obviously a rubric exercise and the higher the intensity of the exercise, it can reduce the amount of circulating tumor cells and people with cancer, like colon cancer, circulating tumor cells in people with cancer, it's an indicator of bad outcomes so they have four times higher mortality risk than people with out them. And people that engage in a rubric exercise have improved outcomes, they have better reduction in disease recurrence and also in mortality. So an issue of gears for a minute and talk about exercise snacks. So we're gonna talk about improving metabolic health but also longevity and exercise snacks. It's kind of a broader term, but it really can refer to either a deliberate type of exercise that you do for one minute, two minutes, three minutes and this is anything from burpees to squads. You can do hi-nees, you can do, there's a variety of different things that you can do to get your heart rate up really high in a short period of time. And we're talking at least 75% max heart rate. And there's studies showing that it really, there's a real metabolic benefit to even doing a minute or two of this exercise snack type of exercise and not again comes down to lactate. You're forcing your muscles to work with a heart. Lactate gets into circulation, gets taken back up by the muscle and it causes glucose transporters to come up to the muscle and sort of open the gates so that glucose can come in. And so this really improves blood glucose levels and there's been a lot of studies looking at this particularly in people with type 2 diabetes doing exercise snacks around meal time. So anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour before after a meal can really dramatically decrease the post-prandial glucose response. And improve blood glucose levels. Now, sure that's important for people that are metabolically dysregulated people with type 2 diabetes. But like who doesn't want to improve their post-prandial glucose response? I mean, that's part of what makes you feel sleepy and your reduces mental clarity after a meal. So doing timing these exercise snacks around meals as a great, is a great and sort of easy way to improve your blood glucose levels as well. And it's pretty easy to do. The other way it improves metabolic health is these exercise snacks when you're doing a high intensity interval training sort of thing, even one or two minutes. But mostly when you're going higher than that, like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, it's a very potent stimulus to increase the number of mitochondria in your muscle tissue. Again, it's an adaptation. You are forcing your muscles to work so hard that they can't use their mitochondria because, again, oxygen can't get their fast enough and so they're forced to make energy another way. But your muscle smart and it's like, oh, I need to adapt. So that the next time I'm working hard, I can use my mitochondria. And the way that adapts is by making new mitochondria. It's called mitochondrial biogenesis. And high intensity interval training is one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Again, lactate plays a role on that because lactate is that signaling molecule. It increases the protein called PGC1 alpha that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis. Exercise snacks have also been associated with improved longevity. So there's another type of exercise snack that's a little bit more of taking advantage of everyday situations. It's called bigger, bigger, instrument and lifestyle activity. And these types of exercises are like, let's say you work on the fourth floor of some office building. So rather than just walking up the stairs every day, which is better than taking the elevator, you sprint. Or let's say you walk to your office. Well, rather than just walking you interval walk or you sprint there, you do some sort of interval. We were getting your heart rate up. So there have been multiple studies showing that doing one to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise. So these large studies, people are wearing wearable devices. And so researchers are getting their data, their heart rate data, and able to measure something and identify people that are getting their heart rate up. And so people that do one to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise a day, sorry, three times a day, had about a 40% reduction in all cosmortality. So that's dying from all non-accidental causes of death. And a 50% reduction in cardiovascular-related mortality, which is like the number one killer in most develop nation. So this is again, just one to two minutes, three times a day, where you're doing those exercise snacks. It adds up. It's beneficial. And clearly it's making, in effect, in people's lives. And these benefits were also found in people that identified themselves as non-exercisers. In other words, they don't go to the gym. They're not taking time to deliberately engage in as sort of exercise routine, and they still have these benefits. So how do you implement exercise snacks in your day? Why would you want to? Well, there's evidence out there that just being sedentary. So right now, we're all sedentary. You're sitting with you guys. Yeah, you're sitting in your chair. You've been in here for about what an hour or so. That is sedentary time. When you're sitting at your desk at your computer for six hours or whatever, fill in the blank time, even though you're going to go to the gym later, or maybe you went earlier, that time that you're sitting is sedentary. And being sedentary is an independent risk factor for cancer. So there is reason to break up your sedentary time with exercise snacks. And again, these would be like a deliberate sort of thing that you can do. So I think- All you need to do is some hi-meas. No. So finding something that you're going to do consistently, that's really important. I'm talking a lot about bigger exercise. But it needs to be something that you're going to do consistently. Whatever it is, in a region for by four, if that's your thing, I definitely like your amazing. So the thing is to just measure your heart rate, that's the easiest thing. Make a consistent do something you like. All right, we're going to shift gears just for a minute and talk a little bit about muscle preservation. This energy are protein intake, lifting, resistance training, and heat exposure. Pink muscle mass happens around training ages of 20 and 30. And then after that, as you start to get in your 40s and 50s, you lose about 8% of muscle mass per decade. Once you get into your 70s, 15% of muscle mass per decade. So most people, by the time they're 70 or 80 years old, only have about 60 to 80% of the muscle mass they had when they were 30. Skeleton muscle is a reservoir for amino acids. So like our restore, we start glucose as glycogen in our liver and our muscle, we store fat, as triglycerides. We don't really have a good way that we store amino acids, but we need amino acids every day. amino acids make up proteins. And proteins are doing everything in our body from making neurotransmitters to making your heart beat, everything. So unfortunately, if you don't get those amino acids from protein, you're going to pull from that amazing reservoir, your muscle, your skeletal muscle. And so you really need to be constantly giving yourself protein to not do that. And so the question is, well, how much protein do you need to give yourself to not do that? And that's a pretty contentious, I would say. Question that people have differing answers on. So the recommended daily allowance, the RDA, was this is set by these committees, and there's lots of things involved in that, but to simplify about 40 years ago, this RDA was set. And it was set to be 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And that was thought to be the amount that you needed to take in every day to minimize the amino acid losses from muscle, right? To replace all your amino acids, to be able to get enough protein, right? Well, turns out, so studies that have been done by experts like Dr. Stewart Phillips, at McMaster University, and others have shown. So the way that RDA was 40 years ago, set was, it was not flawed. In terms of the techniques that they used, they're called nitrogen-balanced studies, they underestimated the amino acid losses. And so here we are, 40 years later, scientists have more sensitive tools. We have a lot more under disposal, and they're saying, no, actually we did these studies. And we found it's more like 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight as the bare minimum to just basically would be able to not be pulling amino acids from our muscle, right? And then that number goes up if you're physically active, it goes up to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight. And then there's a, you know, the elite level, you can go up even further than that. But I think the bottom line here is that the RDA is too low, and there's a lot of scientific consensus in terms of, you know, people that are experts in that field that are saying, no, we need to boost that up. And another problem with that is that the RDA 40 years ago, they did these nitrogen-balanced studies in young adults, not older adults. And we know that older adults, again, this is data from Stu Philips Lab, he's a real leader in this field, that older adults experience something called anabolic resistance. So their skeletal muscle is not as sensitive to amino acids to make, so to increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis. So, you know, he's done studies where he's found that actually older adults, you can, they can prevent their atrophy by taking in 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight versus the RDA, which is 0.8. So all the more reason to increase that RDA to 1.2 grams per kilogram body weight, you know, obviously the less muscle mass you lose, the less frail you're going to be, and those studies have also been done, the more muscle mass, less frail, less likely to fall and break something fracture risk and all that. So, important to improve and increase that RDA, just as a quick aside, because we're talking about anabolic resistance, I was going to bring Omega 3 in there, so Chris McGloray, he's a Queenslander-versity, trained with Stu Phillips, and when he was training with Stu, he found that high dose Omega 3, so anywhere between four to five grams, could basically blunt the disused atrophy that occurs by like 50%. And this was in, this was in younger adults, non-older adults, but it's just really, so there's been some subsequent studies since then, this is really a growing field that's really in its infancy, but Chris and some other people believe that partly what's happening is Omega 3s are sensitizing skeletal muscle to amino acids, so this is independent of its anti-inflammatory effects. And that's also, it's important to note here that the studies that they're doing, they pre-load people with high dose Omega 3 for about one month, because it takes about one month for Omega 3s to accumulate and cell membranes, including in cell-beer, your skeletal muscle cell membranes. So that, I think, is also really an interesting thing, it's a growing field, like I said, there have been meta-analysis looking at muscle mass and older adults taking Omega 3 supplements, and if the doses are high enough, so at least two grams, so there's a meta-analysis of multiple randomized control trials. There is an improvement in muscle mass and also in some functional improvements as well, but the dose had to be at least two grams. For doses less than that, there was really no effect. Again, you'll find conflicting data and literature, so it really depends on the protocol that's used. So we're talking about muscle mass, but strength actually fades faster with age. Reductions in muscle strength can happen, so in men they start to lose three to four percent in strength as they get older, women are about 2.5 to 3 percent, and this can lead to functional issues, slow walking, you start to lose independence, and you get increased, fracture risk, frailty, and then all those things sort of add up to a higher risk of death. So resistance training is one of the best ways to not only increase muscle mass, but also muscle strength. And there have been a lot of meta-analysis of study, so there's 21 different randomized controlled trials that were analyzed, and they found that older adults that engaged in resistance training one to three times a week for about eight to 18 weeks could recover strength that was basically lost over years of just being inactive. So now there was just doing eight weeks of resistance training, one to three days, one to three days, they could recover losses in strength like from years of being inactive and cemetery. And strength is a lot easier for older adults to get those gains. They still can get gains in muscle mass as well, but the strength is something that's very encouraging as well, because the functional decline is something that's very important. And so if they can gain those strength, get those strength gains back, it's also gonna improve their quality of life, and also reduce their mortality risk. So how much do you have to lift? Well, this is also very encouraging for older adults. Again, Stu Phillips pioneered these studies, first an untrained individuals where he showed that people could lift lighter weights and get the same gains in muscle mass and strength as people lifting heavier. As long as the volume was enough, the longer the effort was put in and there's, they're basically getting fatigued. And then Brad shown filled one on to show this also in training people, so it wasn't just a newbie effect. And now it's, I think, becoming a little bit more clear that you don't have to lift heavy and to get gains in muscle mass and muscle strength. You can lift lighter, but as long as you're putting in that effort and still get improvements in muscle mass and strength. And I think that has a lot of relevance for a broader population of people, and not just people that are really, the elite sort of bodybuilder type or talking are parents, right? Are grandparents, maybe people like that don't really know how to do resistance training. I want to injure themselves. So I think this has a lot of application and it's a really important thing to point out. Okay, for the last part of my talk, I just want to talk about deliberate heat exposure and how we're just going to focus on a couple parts of this. We're going to talk about how I can synergize with what we've been talking about today, cardiovascular, respiratory fitness, muscle mass. So engaging in deliberate heat exposure from something like a sauna or even hot tub, hot bath. There's a lot of physiological adaptations and effects that happen that are very similar to aerobic exercise. And those things are like increased heart rate. You're getting increased plasma volume, you're getting increased stroke volume, you are getting hot, your core body temperature is elevating. So you sweat, it's kind of clear yourself down. There's a lot of similarities between deliberate heat exposure from the sauna and more like moderate intensity exercise, I would say. Your heart rate can go up to about 120 beats per minute. Some people can get it up a little bit higher, particularly if they go in right after a workout. But there's been head to head comparisons of moderate intensity exercise and sauna use. And it's really like the studies have shown, they're pretty comparable. So like when you're doing the activity, heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up while you're doing the activity, but then after the activity, whether it's exercise or sauna, you're getting blood pressure improvements, you're resting heart rate is improved, and these things are comparable. So really in some way, I would say, engaging in deliberate heat exposure from the sauna is mimicking the moderate intensity at aerobic exercise. And there have been observational studies and some intervention studies. We'll talk about it in a second, but observational studies, looking at people that are, and this isn't Finland, where sauna's are pretty ubiquitous, and most people are using them. So people in Finland that have sauna or using sauna, and they exercise have a better cardiovascular fitness than people that exercise alone. And we're talking about the in a same volume of exercise. And these people, the ones that do that, but also sauna, had a better cardiovascular fitness than people that only engaged in exercise. And then there's been intervention studies by Dr. Yary Lappkin in that have shown. So he's taken untrained people and put them on an exercise protocol. It was a stationary bike. And then he had two groups, one that just did a stationary bike with passive recovery, and the other ones that did the stationary bike, but then they went right into the sauna for 15 minutes. And he looked at a variety of parameters, one of them being VO2 max. So what he found was that those people that did the exorcary exercise bike and the sauna had a better VO2 max than the ones that only did the exercise bike. And to me that makes sense, because again, it's almost like extending the workout. You're extending it just a little bit more. There were also better improvements in blood pressure and other lipid parameters as well in the group that also added a sauna plus the exercise. So I think there's benefits to deliberate heat exposure for people that are physically active, but also people that are not, people that are disabled, people that can't get on a bike, people that can't go for a run, people that can't do a burpee. But they can get into a sauna and get somewhat of that cardiovascular benefit. And there's all sorts of observational data out there looking at people that use the sauna, 47 times a week. They have a 50% lower cardiovascular immortality, 40% lower all-cosm mortality. And it goes on and on. So I think there's a lot of utility there for people that really just can't go and workout as well. So another really important adaptation that happens when you are engaging in deliberate heat exposure for something like the sauna, also a hot bath, is the increase in something called heat shock proteins. And this is an adaptive response. So as you're elevating your core body temperature, you're getting hotter. These heat shock proteins are activated. And they are the main role that the main function they serve is to prevent proteins from aggregating and forming plaques in your cardiovascular system, in your brain. In fact, there's been multiple animal studies showing that if you give a mouse, like a amuloid beta plaque, we get with humans and Alzheimer's disease, and you express the heat shock proteins, make them highly expressed that they don't get the Alzheimer's like symptoms, and it helps with the plaque aggregates and stuff. So heat shock proteins play an important role in preventing protein aggregation. They have somewhat of an anti-oxidin effect. They're also very important for slowing muscle atrophy. And this is, again, it has to do with a variety of mechanisms. There's been a lot of animal studies on this. But there's now been some human data where people, there's intervention trials where they're basically immobilized one of their limbs for a period of weeks, and then did some local heat exposure. And the local heat exposure prevented and disused atrophy by 40%. So I think that's a very relevant way for people that are injured, or again, people that are older, and they're experiencing a lot of muscle atrophy as well. But there was also a very recent study, and this is small, so it needs to be repeated. But people that were engaging in resistance training, either just alone, or then went into the sauna right after their resistance training, they had greater gains in muscle mass, if they went to the sauna right after the resistance training compared to resistance training. Well, they actually, it was biomarkers of it. So I then indirectly measure muscle mass, it was biomarkers of it. But anyways, I think it's an encouraging and promising area that of course I'm excited about and glad people are out there researching, but it's another possibility for a synergy between resistance training, between the bigger intensity exercise, your exercise program, and then engaging in deliberate heat exposure, as well. So what are the parameters and a lot of these studies? Well, a lot of the parameters in many of these studies are coming out of Finland. The temperature is about 170 for degrees Fahrenheit, and the duration spent in the sauna is about 20 minutes, and that's important because people that spent less than 20 minutes, like let's say they were in there for 11 minutes, they didn't have the robust effects. So it really is a temperature dependent duration dependent, but also frequency. So how many times a week, people are getting in the sauna, for anything to occur two times a week was like the minimum effect of dose. So people did something twice a week, it was more beneficial than once a week. But people that did four times a week, four to seven was really the most robust effects. So if you're looking for the most robust effect, the minimum time would be four times a week, compared to one time a week. The humidity is usually around 10 to 20%. And the question a lot of people ask is, well, what kind of sauna, what if you don't have 175 to re-sana? What if you have an infrared sauna that goes up to 145? Like, is that can you get comparable effects? Again, temperature, duration, dependent, right? So you're not going to get the same effect in 20 minutes in a 145 degrees sauna in terms of the heart rate and the cardiovascular adaptations as you're going to get a 180 degree Fahrenheit sauna, right? So you might have to stay in there twice as long. You might have to stay in there 45 minutes to an hour to start to get your heart rate up. Again, you can wear some kind of heart wearable heart rate measure device, where you're looking at your heart rate and you can feel it. Like when it starts to go up, sometimes it'll take a long time in an infrared sauna. There are studies out there that have compared regular hots on us to infrared in terms of cardiovascular benefits. And if the same volume of time is spent in there, you're not going to get as as robust of an effect on blood pressure improvements as you would with a regular sauna. So again, you might have to spend more time in there as well. Hot baths have also been shown to increase some of these biomarkers like heat shock proteins that sauna has. And I really think that's a really good, you know, the fact that it's able to increase some of the same biomarkers to me signals that maybe hot baths or any sort of modality that's really increasing your heart rate that's making you hot is something that's going to be beneficial as well. So I do think that people that don't have access to sauna could do a hot bath, get one of those little pool devices that measure temperature, put on your bath and keep it up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and being there for 20 minutes. Because that's what the study said. 20 minutes at 104 shoulders submerged all the way down. So that's it for today. Three powerful habits that I think will help delay the aging process that will improve health span. We have bigger intensity exercise, find a way to make it frequent. Do those exercise snacks are so easy and corporate it was just as training protein intake thinking about that protein intake is a lot of work. And then engaging in deliberate heat exposure, whichever way you like, I prefer to do it after we're workout, but I also like to do it at night as well. So that's that's that's what I have for you today. Hope you guys enjoyed it and thank you so much. Okay, we're going to take some questions for Ron if anybody has what there are lots of hands up. Thank you. I had a question about the Omega 3s. You mentioned a minimum of two optimal 45. Is that total Omega 3s or is that specific DHA or what Omega 3s? Yes. So the question is like what type of Omega 3 is involved and then disused after we study coming out of Dr. Chris McLeorys lab at Queens University? So it was the marine forms of Omega 3. So it was EPA and DHA. I don't know off top of the head of the ratio, but they were pretty similar. Ish, if I were to interject my own thoughts here, I think a large part of it has to do with DHA, which is what's mostly accumulating in the cell membranes, a lot more than EPA is. The EPA is a little bit accumulating in the BDHA is heavily accumulating in many different cell membranes, including in skeletal muscle. So I and I've talked to Chris about this. I was like I really going hard on DHA is something that you might want to consider in the future, because it's, you know, it seems as though the importance of the, you know, preventing the disused atrophy by a sensitizing skeletal muscle to amino acids from whatever way it's doing it. Chris thinks mitochondrial ways and possibly transport is not known. That basically, you know, getting that high dose and again, it needs to, it takes about four weeks for the DHA to accumulate in the skeletal muscle. So it's not, it's not like the anti-inflammatory effect of Omega 3, which is like instant, right? So it's a little bit different. The Aocursans, but I took away here, do you like lot of research is like more is better. And I understand that there's also some research around cardiovascular injury from like endurance athletes and intense intense sport. I'm just curious if you have seen any of that or offering a kind of cautionary around around those kinds of conclusions. That's a great question. And I'm going to defer to some of the experts on that, where like Dr. Ben Leving, I think he is far as I've heard from him is yes, like when you get to this like elite elite athlete endurance athlete level, I mean, there are some of the increased risk to do with like coronary calcification, whatever the increase risk of that outcome are actually even lower, even if the coronary calcification is a little bit higher. Do you know what I mean? So it's like their risk of cardiovascular death is still lower than normal like, you know, committed exercises or so. But yeah, I'd say that's not my area of expertise, but that's kind of the takeaway that I've gotten so far from experts. We had one, I had one. A question about the finish sonos versus the infrared sonos is the mechanism that they're providing benefit because of the temperature and the increased heart rate is that what makes finish better than infrared. And then, corollary to that, you mentioned like 174 degrees is being a temperature, whatever it's like 200 or 220 is that make it better or worse or is 174 kind of a sweet spot. Those are great questions. All right. So to first address the mechanisms and is the beneficial effective delivery to heat exposure that I've talked about today due to the increased heart rate and you know, the the the mimicking of I would say moderate intensity exercise. I think a lot of it comes down to that, the improvements in cardiovascular and cardiovascular improvements. Also the heat shock proteins as well. So the heat shock proteins are playing a role in muscle, they're playing a role in the immune system and they're also playing a role in the brain. So people that use finished sonos 47 times a week at those temperature, you know, parameters that I mentioned, have about a 66% reduction, dementia risk, Alzheimer's disease risk. So yeah, I do think there is it really does come down to elevating the core body temperature and getting that heart rate up and being physically uncomfortable like you are when you're exercising. Infrared sonos do work a little bit different there. They're moving molecules in your body and heating you up a different way. There is evidence coming out of doctor Ashley Mason's lab at UCSF who I've been collaborating with showing that a very rigorous infrared sonoprotecol. It's like a heat bed where you're head out and these people are they're used. It's using infrared, you know, heat to to a fever state. So they're getting to like 101.3 Fahrenheit. They're getting a fever. So it's getting them hot. But they're in there for like, you know, in some cases over an hour, 50 minutes over an hour and it's a very intense protocol that most people are doing infrared sono aren't doing. So I do think there is a role for infrared sono, but again, it's like you're just getting to that point where you're getting the heart rate up and getting all those benefits it takes a lot longer. And then the other question is, well, what about is more better? So here, I'll give you my take, then I'll tell you about one study. I think that when it comes to the, we're stressing our body, this kind of goes back to this, this lady's question as well. I mean, heat stress is a stress, right? I mean, hyperthermia is a real thing. Like you can get damage from too much heat. So it's important to keep in mind that there's always like a window of, you're engaging in this, this kind of stressful activity, like physical activity or deliberate heat exposure to have this, you know, response. It's, it's an adaptations, is some people call it a hormetic response to, you know, have the anti-inflammatory benefits, the anti-oxidate benefits, all the adaptations that happen. But when you make that stress too high, then it's hard to counter that stress with our adaptations, right? So when you're going in a 200 degree Fahrenheit sono or a 250 or whatever, it is very hot and there are studies, A and L. studies and stuff like, when you get too hot, you can actually permeabilize the blood brain barrier. And so I know it's like there's this go hard and it's always this push like, and if you're that kind of per se, like, well, I give it my all. There's, there's one study. This was not out of York, Dr. Yary Locken and his lab. It was another study. Can't remember if it was Poland, might have still been finned then, it was finned or poling. But they were looking at a variety of temperatures and dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease and it was a risk. I mean, people that used the sono and it was repeated what Dr. Lacken had found. So people that used the sono frequently had a much lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. But only if they weren't getting in a sono that was over 200 degrees Fahrenheit. If they were getting in a sono that was over 200 degrees Fahrenheit, they were actually having the opposite effect. And I don't talk about that a lot because it's not really understood why and I don't want to let people to get scared. I do think it kind of highlights the role of why do you need to go in a 215 degree. It's still hot. And your brain is in there. So I don't think that going in a 200 degree Fahrenheit is the way you have to do it. I think you can get in 180, 185 if you really want to go 190. But maybe stop before it gets to 200 degree Fahrenheit. So there's a one-step like four-age, just like this. What? Yeah, so the question is, was is 174 degree Fahrenheit the sweet spot? That is the average temperature that people in those studies were using. And I typically do around 175-180 and I do put water on the rocks to make steam, which makes it hotter. And I usually do it after work out. So I'm already hot. I'm already already have my heart rate elevated. So yeah, I mean, doing 30 minutes at 175 degrees Fahrenheit is nice. I think it's safer for the brain. I mean, you're getting a lot of the benefits. Studies have shown that 30 minutes at 163 degrees Fahrenheit increases heat shock proteins by 50% over baseline. So I don't know that you have to go to 200 degrees, and I don't know that you should. To be honest. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

The first thing to know about C-Vat is it is shockingly common. One out of three people in the US has some sort of sleep complete or problem. Untreated sleep app, and you can lead to liver problems, kidney problems, brain problems, because every cell that relies on oxygen starts getting stressed. So I was wondering if you had any tips on some more advanced type of sleep IDA. The enemy of sleep is effort. Sleep is something that happens to you when the situation allows for this. Let's talk about couple supplements. The top of my and top of my people think about one of the things about sleep that they think about. Melatonin. Some people, when they take melatonin, they might be taking the wrong dose at the wrong time. Best evidence-based way to fall asleep and stay asleep. I'll give you two, because one is cheating, which is the... I'm pretty excited to be sitting here with Dr. Michael Granner, who is one of the, I would say, the foremost experts in sleep science, behavioral medicine, and he directs the sleep and health research program at the University of Arizona. His research focus is on, I couldn't even tell you everything. It focuses on all things sleep, but, you know, even, I think you're probably, some of your research is some of the first to really kind of throughout this idea as using sleep as a performance enhancer, both athletic performance, cognitive performance. So I'm super excited to get into that today as well as a lot of other topics on sleep. So thank you for coming to this show, Michael. Yeah, no, thanks for having me. As we were talking about earlier, I kind of wanted to start this episode talking about sleep problems. You know, you've got a lot of patients that come into your clinic with sleep problems. In so many of being probably one of the most prevalent ones. Yes. When someone comes into your clinic and says, I haven't saw me yet. What sort of data points or clinical features do you kind of look at to distinguish whether or not this person actually has insomnia versus all the other things that could just be causing porcelain? Right, that's a great question. The way I think about it is that there's really two kinds of insomnia. I call it sort of insomnia with a lower case eye and insomnia with a capital eye. Think of it, it's kind of like depression too, where it's a word. It's a word that we use to mean a lot of different things, but in a clinical context, it means something specific. So a lot of people will say, I have trouble sleeping and I have insomnia, but is this an insomnia disorder? Is that how we would call it an insomnia disorder? And the way to tell the difference is how they're presenting. So an insomnia disorder is defined as a persistent, difficult, initiating or maintaining sleep or waking up to world. So it can happen anywhere in the night. The difficulty has to be there. It has to occur at least three nights per week. It has to have gone on for at least three months to be considered a chronic insomnia. It has to cause some sort of daytime functioning problem. Could be almost anything, but it's gotta cause problems. You have to give yourself adequate opportunity to sleep, so just sleep depriving yourself as intentsomnia. And when you think about what that means in terms of difficulty falling asleep, there's no hard and fast rule, but a good rule of thumb we use is about 30 minutes. So if it's taking you at least 30 minutes to fall asleep, or you're awake for at least 30 minutes during the night trying to sleep and you can't, that's a good sign that maybe what you have is an insomnia disorder. We're a lot of people will have occasional sleep difficulty sometimes, but that's really the difference where it's crosses the line to where it's really interfering with your function. And how do you just determine, what is the underlying cause of someone's insomnia? I would imagine hyperarous nervous system being one of them, but there's probably others. Yeah, so there's actually something really interesting about chronic insomnia versus acute insomnia. So acute insomnia, there are an almost unlimited number of things that can cause acute insomnia. For a very good reason, I mean, evolution figured out a long time ago that when we're under periods of stress and our survival is question and it's bedtime, we kind of should just keep going until we're safe, right? And we have all these systems in place to protect ourselves. So under any kind of period of hyperarousal or stress or anything, whether it's mental, physical, or both, we have systems in place that can prolong wakefulness relatively safely, especially in the short term. And so there are a million causes of short-term insomnia, but there's only really one cause of chronic insomnia, and that's, there's a switch that flips from short-term insomnia to chronic insomnia, and that switches all around the concept of a conditioned arousal. That's why when someone comes into the insomnia clinic, often the thing that caused their acute insomnia is actually no longer relevant. It's sort of like a ball is rolling, right? And if the ball's rolling down a hill, and with the ball was pushed, shoved, kicked, leaned on heavily, whatever caused the ball to start moving is important, because you want to prevent that in the future. But if you want to stop the ball from rolling, knowing what that is and doing anything about that is largely irrelevant, the problem you're dealing with now is gravity and momentum. And that's what happens with chronic insomnia. It takes on a life of its own because of this concept of conditioned arousal. Can you give an example of that? So let's say someone has work-related stress or something. And maybe it's a project-related or maybe there's emotional-related stress from a relationship. And it does eventually get better, and yet there's still kind of having problems while asleep now, why would be the conditioned stimulus? So this is what happens. Something causes you to lose sleep. And what ends up happening is you exert effort to get that sleep back. Now, when you lose your keys, what do you do? You go looking for it. Where do you look for it? The last place you had it. And if you're losing sleep, where are you looking for it? You're looking for it in bed. But what's happening is you have this activation going on. You have this cortical or cognitive or physiologic or any combination of these arousal systems engaged. And when those are engaged, it is just physically harder to fall asleep. So even if you are tired, even if your natural sleep wake-drive is working just fine, you have this counterweight sort of keeping your mind and body sort of activated. So what ends up happening is the act of trying to fall asleep, whether it's the beginning of the night or whatever, becomes predictably stressful. The brain's a pattern recognition machine. You feed it the pattern of sleep is difficult. Sleep is stressful. Sleep is hard to obtain. Sleep is a battle. You feed it that over and over and over again. Even when you are exhausted and tired and sleepy, just getting into that mode will then wake you up. When sleep becomes predictably stressful, think of something else in your life that's predictably stressful. So common analogy I like to use is a key. Go to the dentist's office. I have a friend who's a dentist who hates that I use this analogy. But people know what I'm talking about. Whatever that metaphorical dentist's office is for you. You go, you're there. Nothing has happened yet. You're already in this heightened state of arousal. You're responding to a stimulus that has it even occurred because you're predicting that it's going to occur. You're in the waiting room. You're already kind of a little antsy. You're delaying making the phone call to make the appointment three months in the future because you're already responding to that future stimulus that's causing you stress. Like being in a place that's predictably stressful, you anticipate it. You can predict it. And by predicting that stress, it creates arousal and activation. The difference is, when you're in the dentist's office, no matter how activated or stressed you are, as long as you open your mouth, they can do their job. Right? But in bed, it doesn't work that way. If you get into bed and you are dead tired, you are exhausted, you are sleepy, you are ready. And you get into bed and all of a sudden your body's like, oh, here we go again, where is this going to be a problem? Or whatever that automatic process starts happening, that predictable process happens. It builds activation. That activation makes it just a little bit harder to fall asleep. You eventually fall asleep, baby. But the connection between activation and sleep is not weakened but strengthened. And so you're a little stressed. You get into bed, have trouble falling asleep, eventually fall asleep. Getting into bed is predictably tied with stress and by adding stress to it, you strengthen the prediction and it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. So whatever the initial cause of the stress was, it's the stress about not sleeping itself that creates the very activation that makes it harder to fall asleep, which strengthens the connection with stress, which makes it harder to fall asleep and it becomes a cycle. That's why the best treatments for insomnia are in about sedating you. They're about reprogramming that's whole cycle. Wow, you've just explained it's so many had to me in a way that no one ever has. And it's just clicked and I'm like, this is, that's what happens. What happens, right? And so now I completely understand this concept of stimulus control. So let's talk about CBTI, cognitive behavioral therapy, and so many out. And obviously there's lots of components to it, one of them being the stimulus control, which now is making so much more sense to me. But let's talk about what that is, why it does work so well for people. And also back to this whole training, this negative association, this negative stimulus, where you're just the act of getting into bed is making you hyper arous, is giving you anxiety. Is that also true, then let's say you do eventually fall asleep and you wake up, whatever you got to repeat, whatever it is, it wakes you up, you're hot. And then all of a sudden you're still not bed. And it's like, again, that negative association, right? And so it's like every time you wake up. And that's why some people, they fall asleep just fine because something for people to understand is that sleep awake is not a unidimensional line, where you're asleep, sleep on one end, and awake on the other end. There's actually two separate dimensions. There's, think of it like, there's trouble in there's base. And it's not just mono. There's trouble in there's base. They have a wakefulness signal, and you have a sleep signal that are separate from each other. They're related, but they do function somewhat independently. And so, said it is boost that sleepiness signal. A lot of times within somebody what happens because of the excess activation or arousal, your sleep signal could be just fine. It's your wake signal that might be too high. And so when someone is taking, say, a set of medication, what you're doing is you're just, you're trying to drive up that sleepiness signal. So high, it's just steam rolling over whatever activation you have. And often that may work. And the reason it can work long term sometimes is if you steam roll it over enough, you can maybe break that learning. So it's not, so it isn't just the sedation, but for a lot of people, it's not sedation, that's the problem. The problem is in the activation. And when you're doing therapy for insomnia, it's often not about, so patient will come in thinking, like, how do you make me sleepier? Actually, we've got some tools for that. We'll talk about that. But often the magic isn't about making you sleepy. It's about making you less awake. And it's a different process. And that's also why it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nothing does. But that's why CBTI is so effective, because it's actually targeting the problem that the person actually has. Okay, let's talk about it. Let's see. So here's the deal. Oh, a few several decades ago now. So stimulus control was first published in 1972. This isn't new stuff. And it was under this idea. The idea of stimulus control is, if you're in a place where only a very limited number of things could possibly occur there, you will predict that they will occur and you'll get yourself in the zone. So we talked about the dentist chair, but a great positive example is going to the gym, right? Like if you're going to the training room or wherever, you don't do anything else there. So even if you're kind of tired or if you're in a bad mood or whatever, once you start that process, you can usually finish the workout at the end. And then you go back to your life. But when you're there, you can get in the zone. And because being there creates the conditions that are predictably tied with doing what you're going to do. And so when you're in a place where there's a limited number of options, those options become predictable. On the other side of stimulus control is if you're in a place where all kinds of options exist, none of them become predictable. So a great example of this, I found this is especially over the pandemic and the people are working from home more, is the dining room table started also becoming where people work. And it wasn't just a place where you eat. So it used to be you sit down at the dining room table because all you do is eat there, you'd start getting hungry. But if that's also where you work and it's also where you watch TV and it's also where you're socializing, you sit down, you're thinking about work and you want to put the TV on and you may not may or may not be hungry. So like it dilutes the ability of the place to have a response if you start increasing the number of things that occur there. And so the way this is applied to sleep is that if in bed, if being in bed is predictably tied to sleep, you can program that association, but if being in bed isn't predictably tied to sleep, you don't know what to predict. So I got a, so here's an example. If I say bed sleep, bed sleep, bed sleep, bed sleep, bed sleep, I say bed, you say sleep. Correct. If I say bed sleep, bed wake, bed think, bed wake, bed sleep, bed wake, bed sleep, bed think, bed surf. Maybe, scroll. You have no idea. Right. You have no idea what's coming next. You can't predict the pattern. Human brains love patterns. And if you can't control the sleep side of the equation yet, at least to control the bed side of the equation, stimulus control therapy, which is one of the core components of CBTI, was built around that. And since that time, CBTI has emerged as sort of this multi-component toolbox. Demous control is one of the core components, but there's all these tools that we have that are essentially, it says therapy. It's a lot less like psychotherapy. It's a lot more like physical therapy, where we're teaching your body to do a thing if physically can do, it just does it know how anymore, or if forgot, or you need to build it back up again. So you have everything is there inside of you. We want to picture comes in and says, I'm having trouble sleeping. It's like saying, I'm having trouble breathing. When someone says I'm having trouble breathing, it's not just because like they suck at breathing, and it's just a skill they never mastered. Like you were breathing when you were born. No one had to teach you. It's a part of how your body works. The trick is why aren't you able to do this thing you were built to be able to do? What's in the way? What's preventing your body from working the way it's post-do? And in some, your treatment is often like that. It's like, you can probably sleep just fine. You are built with this ability. There's a chance maybe there's something else, but most of the time you have everything in you you need to sleep fine. Something is in the way. Let's get that out of your own way. And I clear that path. So, do you, I was gonna ask you a question about what you think the most important mechanism behind why CBTI works. And it's through the conditioned arousal. It's teaching people that, that, a, they can gain more control over their ability to sleep than they thought. But also paradoxically, it also teaches people how and when to surrender some control. So, like, let's say you have a stomach bug and you have no appetite for a day, right? You're eating like toast and drinking tea or whatever. I just, if you eat anything that would be bad, you don't think what if I starve to death? That's not what you have. You don't think, I have this stomach bug, what if I get a nice and deficiency and have permanent damage because no, you don't. What you think is, I don't have appetite for a couple days, but in a couple days it'll come back and I'll be fine. And when people deal with temporary sleep loss that same way, it's a similar system. The system can correct itself if you let it. But what ends up happening is when we start stressing about it, it starts creating these problems. And a lot of times it's us getting in our own way. All right. Let's say you had someone that has to work on their stimulus control. Yeah. There's someone that likes to get in bed, they have trouble falling asleep, so they pull out their phone, they're scrolling, they're looking at social media, whatever. And maybe they're rumminating. Yeah. What would be your approach that? What would be like your two week fix? Great. So first of all, in addition to stimulus control and in terms of the other tools with NCBTI, a lot of them focus on this idea that you want to drive your natural sleep drive, put that sleep drive in bed. And when you're not, when bed is not really going to be used for sleep, you get up. And so if you're going to be on your phone, the first thing I would say is try and separate the phone from the bed. Have the bed be the place where sleep is occurring, not where sleep is predictably not occurring, because it's not occurring when you're on your phone. See if you can do that. If, for some reason, you have to be in bed when you're on your phone. I would say the thing to do is you still want to create that separation. The best way to do that is maybe stand next to your bed, because I say stand, it's silly and very rarely do people actually do it, but people sometimes do, and I do this, because if you're standing, if being in that proximity is important for your ability to sort of wind down whatever, but at least, A or not in bed, but B, the standing does something very important. And especially people in the athletic space will know this that you don't lose touch with your body's communication to you. When you're standing, there will eventually come a point where you say, but I really want to sit down now. That's your body telling you that you're ready. Or you may be standing thinking, like, what am I standing here like an idiot for? I've been here for a half an hour. What am I doing? That's your other signal that you're not ready. Sleep is not something that you do. Sleep is something that happens to you when the situation allows for this. That's a concept I bargained for a colleague of mine, Lindsay Shaw, who's also a fantastic sleep person and sports like a physiologist. I learned this from her. I used it all the time. It captures it really well. Sometimes sleep is not under your ability to sleep as it's under your control. You're awake. You need to wind down. Maybe you're just not ready. And if you're just not ready, laying there in bed scrolling is going to help. Go do that somewhere else. If you are getting ready, respond to those body signals. If you can't stand next to your bed, if that's a little too silly for you, sit and sit up on your bed. Don't not like just a little propped up. Your head's not on a pillow. You're not under a blanket. Sit up. Again, you're not going to lose touch of your body's signals. And where's case scenario? At least you get the head bob. The head bob is your friend. The head bob means your body telling you you're ready. There's also like if you're watching TV or on the couch or whatever. And you're within that zone where you might be wanting to go to bed, lean forward. When you're watching TV or you're moving or whatever. We're scrolling. Because you'll get the head bob. You won't get it when you're leaning back. You get it leaning forward. That's your signal that you're ready. And what happens if someone wakes up in the middle of the night and then they're reminating? Yeah. Can't fall asleep. So again, sleep is not something you do. It's something that happens when the situation allows for it. And if the situation is not allowing for sleep in that moment, get up. If you're sitting there in your eating and you have no appetite, you don't just sit there and stare at your food till you become hungry and it becomes more appetizing. It actually backfires. So often when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's because it's because something naturally occurred to produce that awakening, whether most commonly would probably be some sort of physical discomfort like pain or maybe you sunk into your mattress a little bit and it's just a little discomforting and you need to wake up and move. Sometimes it's untreated sleep apnea. Super common. You have a respiratory event that you don't know you had. If you ever wake up suddenly for no reason and you don't know why and can't get back to sleep, we'll talk a little bit later about sleep apnea, but that can cause these awakenings. And when you have something that causes us awakening that arose from inside you, wasn't under your control. And what is appalling is that physical activation escalates. And just like a snow globe, you shake up the snow globe, it takes a little bit of time for it to come back down. And when your snow globe got shaken up while you were asleep and you're awake, you can't make it fall back down faster. There's nothing you can do. You can poke at it, make it go slower, but you can't make it go faster. You just have to wait till everything settles back down. And it often doesn't take as long as people think, but what it's appalling is, as your snow globe is settling, then your stress starts rising again. Slowly rising because like, why can't I sleep? What if I can't fall asleep? What if I'm up the rest of the night? Love, love, love, love, love. And then you start stressing and freaking out about it. So now your body is ready, but your mind isn't anymore. And I gotta wait for that to come down and you just prolong it. The, because you don't have control over this part, surrender that control. Recognize that you're gonna get up, you can get up, take a break, wait till you're ready, try again. Just don't prolong it anymore than as necessary. So sometimes surrendering control actually shortens the awakenings. Sometimes it does it. Sometimes you know what, what if you're up for the entire rest of the night and you just don't go back to sleep? That's often people's fear. But the truth is, A, that's unlikely. And B, even if it does happen, you'll be fine the next day. And guess what happens? If you're halfway through your dinner and you just lose your appetite and you just don't eat the rest of it. What happens the next day? You don't die. You just are a little more hungry. And you'll eat a little more the next day and the system will correct itself. Overcorrecting is the problem. So to kind of just, for my understanding, for the stimulus control, like the most important part of it, like for these individuals that do have this like fear of like not sleeping, or like it starts to, you know, they just immediately get like anxiety about it. The best thing is to surrender or is that like the strongest part of the stimulus control? Yeah, it's the performance anxiety. The fear is what's creating the activation that's getting in your own way. So recognizing that it's not under your control, trying to control it is not going to help. Nobody got to sleep faster by trying harder. The enemy of sleep is effort. If you're engaging in effort, you're adding energy into the system. And athletes, especially are vulnerable to this because athletes are used to gaining control over their body and learning how to control their body in ways that most people just don't know how to because they haven't been trained to. So there's always a solvable problem there. Sometimes, it's like injury recovery. Sometimes you can't make it go faster. Like if you injure yourself, you gotta do what you gotta do to recover. You can't, there's no like, against you can do or book you can read that will make that recovery go faster. You gotta give it the time it needs. Similarly, this is at the process that's outside of your control, trying to control it will actually make it go slower. Okay. And so the next part of CPTI that you hear about is the sleep restriction which sounds awesome. First name, I mean, so if you actually look to the original publication, they didn't, they didn't even call it sleep restriction therapy. They called it restriction of time and bed, which is really what it is. It's a simple concept of, I can't, a lot of these things are simple and concept but difficult than execution, but the concept of sleep restriction therapy, which I hate calling it that because it's not about the restriction and that's the thing. Sleep restriction could be part of it, but it isn't always. The idea is let's say you're spending eight hours in bed but six hours of sleep. We know you physically can sleep six hours. Okay, let me give you six hours time and bed. See if you can fill it. Let's get you to the point where you can fill it and then we'll slowly increase it from there. Actually, sleep restriction therapy has more increasing of sleep than decreasing. But there's a decrease at first. The way I explain to people is this. It's actually not super complicated. Let's say you're trying your vegetables and you've got a kid who's not eaten there broccoli, right? You put 20 pieces of broccoli on their plate and they're not eaten. You can eat one or two and then they're like, oh, I hate broccoli, bubble, but then you say, okay, I need you to learn how to eat your broccoli. Tonight, I'm gonna give you two pieces of broccoli. Can you, I know you can eat that because that's what you've been eating every day. I know you can eat that. So you eat the two pieces of broccoli and then they say, but I'm still hungry. And then you say, great, you will get three tomorrow. Let's see if you can eat those. And they can eat the three pieces. But I'm still hungry. It's like, okay, hold off on don't eat anything else. But the next day, you'll be hungry enough to eat four. And then you slowly, you start with what they can already do. But you don't give the other stuff that will, so you don't let them stay in bed when they're not sleeping. At least give them the opportunity they're already able to fill. At first, all the mental blocks and stuff will be there. So it might drive down their sleep a little bit in the short term for several days, maybe even up to a couple weeks. But they eventually, eventually, they get hungry enough for they can eat all the broccoli on their plate. Because you're not giving them anything else. Then all of a sudden, you start introducing other foods back that they actually like, but they've gotten over their broccoli deal. And that's what it is with sleep. You drive up their natural sleep pressure. You separate out the time and bed that's not awake. You make it so that being in bed, you go from not being able to fall asleep to not being able to stay awake. Because you drive up that natural sleep pressure. And it's like, well, you have problems with your appetite. Fast for a little bit. That'll help a lot of problems with your appetite. You're going to be hungry again. And so this idea of not having your phone in bed. It's part of that. Yeah, it's part of that because you don't want to do anything in bed that is not sleep. You want to make it so that when you get into bed, you put your head on the pillow, your under a blanket, your eyes are closed, your breathing through your nose. That feeling is so predictably tied with becoming unconscious in a very short amount of time, that even when you get good at that. So this is the power of this. When you get good of that, you're using the prediction, not just to solve a problem, but to create a benefit. Imagine you're a little bit stressed. You've got a big day tomorrow. But you've so trained yourself that that place is so predictably tied with sleep that you're stressed. You've got a big day. You've got stuff you're working on. You get into bed, close your eyes, head on pillow, under blanket, start breathing, then all of a sudden you fall asleep. You can train yourself to get the outcome you want. And that gives you control. So let's say you've got to wake up super early one day because you're going somewhere. You've got to practice or something. You need to go to bed an hour so earlier than you really are used to. If you've got yourself well trained, you can use the environment as a condition stimulus for sleep when you want it to be. So how long does it take to, for most people to train themselves like through the stimulus control sleep restriction where the bed is really just for, I've heard sleep and sex. Yeah. So sex is fine. That's usually not the problem. You know, do that in bed out of bed wherever you want. That's fine. Usually that's not taking up so much time. I mean, it's not interfering with your ability to sleep. Sometimes it can help your ability to sleep. But that's fine. But it's probably the phones that are the biggest problem. Right. It's distractions. So distraction, the activation, all of this stuff, it's you're adding energy in instead of taking energy out. Relaxation is fine to do in bed. But if it's brief, you know, if you're spending, you know, a half an hour meditating in bed that might be a little too long. I know people who like they have this whole hour long routine that they do, like by the time that hour is done, the bed is no longer predictably tied to sleep anymore. So yeah, it's about getting this stuff out. It doesn't, I'm not saying don't be on your phone. But I mean, I actually think this, the sleep field, telling everyone get off their phone for an hour for going to bed is not a helpful recommendation because no one's going to follow it. We should be talking about how to do it safely in a way that's not going to get in your way. And that comes down to what you were saying earlier, either being in another room or sitting upper standing. Yeah, and also it's what you're doing that's important. You might want to create sort of boundary. So like maybe within a half an hour of when you're planning on going to bed, maybe switch to something that's not to mentally activating. Like if you're the kind of person where you watch the news and it gets you all worked up in angry, don't do that before going to bed. Maybe do it the hour, you know, in the earlier part of the evening. I mean, the great thing now is TV isn't live anymore. Back when I was a kid, you had to watch it when it was on. And that was it. Now we can watch, we can gain more control over what we're exposing ourselves to, media-wise. The rule of thumb I use. And this is what I used for myself. If an alarm went off right now and said, OK, time to turn it off, could I? If the answer is yes, then it's probably OK to do within that time frame. Because I can easily disconnect from it. If the answer is, do it in about five more minutes. I want to see how it ends or I want to, you know, whatever. That's probably not the thing to watch in that buffer time. Watch it before the buffer time. But don't do that in the buffer time. Like if you're scrolling and you can easily put it down, I don't know that that's that big of a deal. But if you're scrolling and like half an hour will go by and you wouldn't even notice and you lose that time. And then you say you don't have time, but you just threw away some time. You know that you didn't need. So those are the sort of things you want to make sure that you're curate what you're doing so that it's not too activated. Why are a lot of people that have that have in Somnia, why are they prescribed these sedatives, like, you know, ambian or? Well, if they don't not work. I mean, like, I was saying, like what they do is they drive up that sleep drive so much and overpowers whatever's in the way. And it's kind of an easy solution. The thing is, honestly, it's much easier to write a prescription. Like you can go to any primary care anywhere and they can write a prescription. But if you look at every medical organization that has any recommendation around in how to treat insomnia. And for athletes, you know, this includes like NCAA and IOC, who've put out sleep-related materials. They all say, CBTI first. And that's because every study that has ever been done shows that when you compare, when you pool the data from CBTI trials, it works shockingly well. Not only does it work reliably well, it works when you have other, like, well, what about if you're in chronic pain? Like, the pain is keeping you up. How is that you don't have condition or else? You have an active thing going on. It still works in fibromyalgia. Works in chronic pain. Works in cancers. It actually might be better in cancer survivors than people who aren't cancer survivors. So they don't want to take these medications or more motivated. It works in sleep-a-appnea. It works before your sleep-a-appnea is even treated. It helps with your insomnia. Find me a condition. Works in older people, works in younger people, works in, so like, it's a blunt instrument. It's retraining yourself to sleep. It doesn't, and it works well by helping people gain control. It doesn't necessarily add hours to your night, but neither do sleep-a-pills either. What it does is it removes some of those barriers. But again, about 85% of the time, not 100%. But it's also some people don't know how to get access to it. Or they read about it online, and either the information they get isn't great, or they have exposure to it in that, maybe they're doing it by the book, but they might need a little flexibility with it or something. But there's lots of adaptations. I mean, we edited a textbook on how to adapt CBT-IT into different populations. But a lot of people just don't know what exists, and the people who do don't really understand what it is, or how to find someone who knows what they're doing. Is that the key to you? Do you have to find someone that knows what they're doing? Or can you try this yourself? Yes, and yes. I mean, there are many people that I've talked to who've tried it. Don't it with themselves? I mean, because it's not rocket science. There's an arch to it, but the basics of it are relatively simple. It's bed equal sleep. Get out of bed if you're not sleeping. Compress your window of your giving yourself too much opportunity. You're not filling it. Compress your opportunity, but then expand it again once you can fill it. Some basic stuff like that. And some people could just do that on their own, and that's all it takes. Some people they need somebody who knows what they're doing. The problem is, there's not a whole ton of people who are trained in this, despite it's being around for a long time, despite the fact that it's really well supported, there's not a ton of people who are well trained. There are some online versions available where they can automate some aspect of this. It's a very, it'll be very by the book, but for a lot of people that's all it takes, you can do this over telehealth, any state that you're in. I can promise you there's someone who can do this via telehealth in your state. So it used to be a very geographic lyricist. Did it's not anymore? There's a couple of good directories online of if you're looking for somebody. We have a board certification. You can see who's board certified in this. And it exists because it's not part of normal training. So to be able to say that you're good at, you have to prove that you know what you're doing. But yeah, you can look online for people. And again, there's telehealth options too. So whatever state you're in, you can find somebody. What percentage of the US population has in Somnia? It's a great question. For decades, any population level study has generally found kind of the same thing. Mostly, and it doesn't seem to have mostly changed much. That about one out of three people in the US has some sort of sleep complete or problem, or something, whether it's falling asleep, staying asleep, not feeling refreshed. That seems to be about a third of the population at least. And it seems like about one in 10 people probably would meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder, if you assess them. And then what ends up happening is they start trying to fix it on their own. And they start going down paths that end up being unhelpful. And then they get more frustrated. And then sleep becomes more stressful. And they give up. And they say, I'm a hopeless case. I get one of these a week in clinic. So I'm the worst sleeper you've ever seen. I've tried everything. I've had this problem forever. Then six to eight sessions are better. Yeah. One in 10 is a lot. And I definitely think we're going to talk about some of these substances people then turn to, because they think it's going to help treat their sleep problem, which they don't necessarily know is even insomnia, right? And so they're turning to things like alcohol. And that doesn't really help. So but before we get to that, sleep happening, I you mentioned. And that's another one that I wanted to talk about. I've known a lot of people, it seems, that have had sleep happening. I wonder how you can tell me how common that is as well. But first I kind of wanted to ask you, like, what are some of the non-obvious presentations that you know, of sleep happening? That you see, especially people who like maybe don't even report feeling sleepy. Right. So the thing was sleep audience. The first thing to know about sleep out, yeah, is it is shockingly common. It is very, very, very common. The most recent data I've seen estimates that about one out of four or five men over 30, probably has at least some sleep related breathing issues, especially if there are BMI as over 30, it's more like 50, 50. It's really high. Women get it less often, but it's also shockingly common in women too. It might be more like one out of every 15 or 20 women. And then as BMI goes up, it gets more common. So it's shocking the common. It's so common that my threshold for screening for it is very low, especially among otherwise fit people, because the normal risk factor, so as you gain weight, you get it more because it can crowd out your airway. Masks will too. Yeah, muscle too. It's because it's taken it this way. So most mammals, their airway is a straight line, you know, from snout all the way up and to their lungs. It's a straight line from snout to their lungs. Humans, by moving up right, we solve the lot of problems and we've gotten a lot of benefit from being upright. But we created a problem with us in that our tube now has a 90 degree angle in it. And if you're designing a pipe and you put a 90 degree angle kink in your hose, where is it going to start having problems? It's going to have problems at that. And that's what happens. So like right around that spot here, that's where we get narrowing of the airway. So like any mass, whether it's muscle or fat or whatever, any mass, I mean, there are people who look at MRIs of like tongue fat, like cheeks, like anything here, whether even skinnier people with smaller airways, you know, where it's a little more compressed, it's a vulnerability in the human physiology for breathing issues. And it's actually mostly fine in that you can have four or five breathing pauses per hour in the night and be in the normal range. It's actually a sleep apid, as a begin, five is mild. Begin is the low end of mild. And it's not even till you get to 15 per hour that it becomes start being coming moderate. So many people who are in the mild range don't even have any symptoms and might not be causing any problems. We have a lot of flexibility in the system, but as you get older and neuromuscular control changes as we put on more pressure here in the airway by getting weight or whatever, it just becomes more and more common. And my guess is it's actually been common through history. It's just we've written it off of something else, especially in people that don't have those obvious signs. So what are some of those less than obvious signs? If I have a patient who comes in, I say, if they say, I fall asleep just fine. Actually, if I'm anything I'm a little tired during the day, whatever, I fall asleep just fine, but then I wake up in the middle of the night because of stress. My stress wakes me up and then I have a hard time falling back asleep. When I hear that, I think there's greater than 50, 50 chance in my mind that that was a respiratory event. Stress doesn't wake you up. What happens is if you wake up and you're thinking I'm stressed, your brain is reading signals like elevated heart rate, elevated respiratory rate, indoor the endurance of the muscles, getting tense, you're treating these physical signs. And then because we live in the society we live in, stress is readily available. We can fill that space really fast. But what was happening was, what's in the stress that woke you up? It was that your breathing was starting to get a little bit constrained. So then what happens is your airway tries to open itself up. And it wasn't successful. So it tried harder. Still wasn't successful. Tries a little harder. Still not successful. Worst case, you wake yourself up and you can wake up with a gas because you can breathe when you're awake just fine. It's a different neuromuscular control system. So as soon as you wake up, you sort of get that sudden awakening because you just got that little sort of a shot of adrenaline to wake you up. And like if I just shot you up with a little bit of adrenaline during the night, you'd wake up and you would not be able to fall back asleep. Your mind would start racing and you'd have all these physical signs. But it wasn't the stress that woke you up. The stress got superimposed on it later. So when I have a patient who comes in and describes that sensation of, I wake up in the middle of the night either because of stress or for no reason. I don't know why. Something wasting up. I have no idea, but I cannot get right back to sleep immediately. Like within a few minutes. I mean, something just happens. Some flare up just happens somewhere. That's what I look at. In athletes often when I'll look at is, I feel like my sleep is really shallow and I don't know why. Because what's happening is you might be having lots of these low level respiratory. That's the thing when you get the more severe sleep at, like 30 events per hour or more with these other presentations. But you get a lot of the mild to moderate cases in people who, you know, don't have a lot of extra weight. Or an older and have neuromuscular control issues. Like it just happens with age. They're younger, they're healthier. But they just might have a narrow airway. And so like I'll never forget, like there was a, and a little bit of level athlete I was working with. She was she was in the trials. And she's like, just not meeting the times I think I should. She was still faster than everybody else. But she's like my intuition is telling me something is in my way from reaching what I could be doing. I don't know what it is. And like how you sleep. It's like I feel like my sleep is kind of shallow. I fall asleep just fine. But I feel like I'm up a few times during the night. And I don't really know if that's a problem or not. So like, well, let's see what's going on. Turns out she had mild sleep apnea. Got that treated better. And she's like, oh, that was it. And in the real world, it would have been missed. It would have been someone just slogging through their day. They would have just been like, oh, you know, life is hard. I'm tired, not sleeping is good. And then probably in 30 years, she would have gotten diagnosed by the time it was more obvious if she weren't an athlete. So what should a person do? Like, how many is this an every night thing where people are getting woken up? Like if they're having apnea, is this like an every night thing? Like what sort of symptom clusters biomarkers can people look at short of like going and getting the thing on your finger and measuring the oxygen and, you know, the whole thing. Yeah, I mean, so here's the thing. It's normal for people to wake up in the middle of the night sometimes. Actually, the typical adult will wake up 10 times a night or more during the night. They just don't remember. It's very short. I mean, again, evolution figured this out a long time ago. You wake up, no bear, back to sleep. Like that's normal. But if you're remembering more of those awake, if you're remembering three, four awakenings, if you have an awakening, especially waking up like with a gasp, like if you wake up like that or you wake up with a snort, like, if you wake up with something like that, if you, if, or if you feel like, you just can't get enough sleep. Like you try and sleep a little bit more, but it doesn't help. It's like, it's just empty calories, you know? Like it's not about the amount anymore. There's like something that's keeping it artificially shallow. There's lots of things that could be. It's just sleep apnea, so common. Why not take test? Why don't you just get tested? Just go get her a furl, get tested. You can do them at home now. It's easy enough. In turn, there's no real good biomarker for it yet. I know people are working on it. There's no real good biomarker except that, that sleep is shallow, it's fragmented, and you don't know why. I mean, it could be something else. It could be inflammation, it could be pain, it could be environmental. There's lots of things. Like if you're not breathing, is there a problem with your lungs? Is there a problem with your airways? Or a problem with the pollution in the air? So like is it, is there something that's preventing your body from being able to sleep? Or, and, and if it is sleep apnea, it's so common. This is why my threshold for screening is just ultra low, because if it was that, and I do all the tips with you, and I work out this, and I do all this, and you're still feeling like, oh, but my sleep just isn't good. And I knew one day one that this was a possible reason why, then I'd feel like an idiot for not even checking, because I knew we did all this work, and we maybe we didn't even need to. So I do those at home, kind of, if I remember doing one once like years ago, when I was in graduate school, I was, I think that's why I ended up because it's stress, but the test came out negative, but I wore this like, ox pole thing, I think I don't know what it was in my fear. So there's a bunch of devices. They've gotten better and smaller over the years. There's still people who do need to come into the lab. Those are usually reserved for, when there's like another sleep disorder, you're also looking for like an Arco-Lepsy or limb movements or something, or if you're medically complicated, like you need supplemental oxygen, or if you might have heart failure or something, where you need to kind of be monitored in the hospital while you're doing it for safety. Other than that, or the test you did at home was negative, but you still have a lot of symptoms, and maybe it missed it, because the home tests aren't as sensitive. Like you won't get false pauses, but you might get false negatives. That's the only time you'd really need to come into the lab, most of the time. Usually they just give you the thing to take home, and these days you can wear it as a strap. They have ones that just go on your wrist, and they measure your oxygen levels during the night, and what you can see is, how is your respiration tied with your O2, because respiration drops during the night too? And so does O2, a little bit, but if your respiration is dropping, and then your O2 starts dipping, and then it opens back up again and gets recovered, like you look at these patterns of what's happening during the night, and you can see in one night, if someone's clearly has sleep apnea or not. Okay. It's easy enough. If you're working with someone who has obstructive, it's the gaping out. How do you go back to differentiating if it's caused by allergies or positional, or something like nasal congestion, I don't know, like... Yeah, yeah, especially when it's more on the mild to moderate side, where, so the great thing is, the ones that are on the strap, usually have a gyroscope at it, and they can measure your breathing separately on your side and on your back. There's a lot of people where it's just that it's on their back. That's the issue. And for those people, there's actually really simple fixes. You can set, they sell these devices where the truth is the strap you wear. In the old days, these to sew a tennis ball in the back of a t-shirt, and that's all it's like, whenever you roll down it, you just roll off it. And they have like fancy versions of that now, where it's essentially what it is, where there's a couple of them where it's a strap, it's like a belt, but like the back of the belt has a little bump on it. And so like whenever you roll on it, you just roll off it. It's just stays off your back. That's it. You can't force yourself to stay off your back when you're asleep, you're like, well, I just gonna fall asleep on my side while you can't control it when you're unconscious. So like, you can see if it's positional easily in the diagnosis, and if it is, then just try and treat it positionally. And then what I would do is retest using the positional device and see if it all goes away. Because it might not. If it's allergies, this is why the sleep docs, we get a lot of training, and I've gotten some of this too, when I rotated in sleep medicine, like you see what to look for. So like you look at nostrils, you look at their nose, you have them breathing, you look inside the airway in the mouth, and like you can see where their soft palate is, you could see their tongue, you can see some of these things. And sometimes, there's a lot of sleep medicine that's using, you know, flown-a's and some of this stuff to sort of clear up the nose, but remember the obstructions, almost all the time are back here. In that 90 degree angle in your airway, it's not up, like people think snoring is a nose-based thing, it really isn't. Sometimes you get sort of flopping nostrils or whatever, but almost entirely, the issue's back here, it's the back of your tongue. That's also why on your back, it's worse often, because gravity starts pulling stuff back. Or like when you open your mouth, and your tongue falls back and can block the airway. So, so like you can do that in the physical exam, when you go to the sleep topic and take a look at your mouth and take a look at your nose, and they'll be able to see, but I'll tell you, it is a vast, vast minority of the time where that's actually the cause. People want it to be because it's an easier fixed, but that's usually not it. It what happens if someone has untreated sleep apnea? So, I mean, what happens to their sleep architecture? I mean, first of all, maybe we should briefly mention like the sleep stages, but like, does it affect their sleep architecture? So, here's the different sleep stages. So, when you fall asleep, you enter stage one. Stage one is super ultra light sleep. If you look sort of like not off and someone bangs the table and you're like, well, what was that? That's stage one. When they say, you're asleep, and you say, no, I wasn't, that's stage one. It's very light. This is also where you get hypnick jerks. And if you have one of those, you were in stage one sleep. Totally normal, medically harmless, everyone gets them. So, I've stage one. It's a light-transitionary stage. Then you drop into stage two. Now, stage two, when you first drop into it, you're in it pretty quickly, but for most of the night, that's actually what you spend the most time in. Stage two is sometimes called light sleep. I don't like that name for it. I like just calling it normal sleep. It's regular sleep. It's vanilla sleep. It is more than 50% of the night, most of the work that your brain does, in sleep is done in stage two. But then you drop into stage three, which is also, in our world we call it slow-avesleep, because the brain waves are bigger and slower. A lot of people also call it deep sleep. It's not called deep because it's the good one, or the most restful one even. It's called deep, because your arousal threshold is the highest, and it is hardest to wake you up from that sleep stage. Because the thinking parts of your brain are largely like detached and offline. You're not thinking during that time, your muscles are very relaxed. This is, for athletes, it's super important, because this is when growth hormone is secreted in n3 sleep, but stage three, or non-rimstate's, three sleep. But it's also highly protected. Even sleep deprived people are mostly getting all of the stage three sleep their body wants. Like it's actually, again, evolution figured this out a long time ago. You, it's the hardest to wake up from, and it front loads into the night. So usually in the first few hours you're done with it anyway. So it's not a, sleep deprivation doesn't actually eat into slow-avesleep or deep sleep very much. And people also, so they don't need to worry about it so much. So I think you get into that, and then you come out of that into an episode of REM. REM sleep, a lot of people have heard of now, is weird. REM sleep is just fundamentally weird. So like this is where dreams and nightmares happen. Peak blood flow in the brain is actually REM sleep. Like their brain is extremely active. It's actually more like waking than many of any other sleep stage. But the waves are very different from waking brain waves, but it is more like that than other stages of sleep. You're also your arousal threshold is different in that it's easier to wake up out of REM sleep, but there's also a couple of other weird things that happen that you're paralyzed. So if indeed in the deep sleep, your muscles were very relaxed. Nothing compared to how muscle, relax, your muscles are in REM sleep. Not because they're recovering, but because you're actively paralyzed. Your alpha motor neurons are hyperpolarized. You cannot move. Even if you wanted to, that's because otherwise you'd be acting out your dreams, because you think they're real at the time. It's just part of your brain has its foot on the brake while it's jamming on the accelerator at the same time, and that's why it's not going anywhere. That's why sometimes you see twitches where it's shorter brakes through a little bit, but that's it. It's fascinating. And then also that's also why you get sleep paralysis sometimes where you wake up at a REM sleep, but you're still a little bit paralyzed, but you're also conscious and that switch for God to get flipped really briefly. So anyway, see, got that REM sleep. You also get the eye movements, which might be looking at things, but might not be, the data are very mixed where when you go looking to match eye movements in REM sleep to dream content, you can sometimes find it, but then sometimes you can't, it's fascinating. What seems to be happening between deep sleep and REM sleep, there's a really, really interesting dichotomy where they're both important for different reasons, where one of the things the main thing that seems to be happening in the deep sleep is synaptic pruning and synaptic homostasis. So and in REM sleep, there's a lot of synaptic strengthening and connection building, and those two things work in concert with each other. Think of it this way. When you're experiencing the day, you're taking in lots of experiences and information. Some of those experiences and information are important, you will learn from, are related to important things, maybe they're not super important, but they're worth keeping, and a lot of those are not that important. Like that piece of equipment over there, I don't need to remember it tomorrow. It's not, I will remember it for the next few minutes, but it's not that important to my life. It will get filtered out. So what ends up happening in slow-avesleep and in the deep sleep, the experiences from the day and all those new things floating around, they sort of get sorted and the things that are important are kept and everything else gets let to fade. Interestingly, this is similar thing happens where the spaces between your brain cells actually increases. And like sort of like a filter, the it increases and actually waste products can start clearing out of your brain. Is it because you're thinking, Bart, you're brain are working a little bit less and it gives it the chance to do that? Who knows? But it seems to happen specifically during that time. Just very protected the beginning of the night. So when you're after a few hours into the night, that cleaning out process is done and then the cycles toward the end of the night. So drop down to deep up into RAM and then you cycle through, but the cycles change. The second cycle, you'll have a little bit less deep and a little more stage two and a little more RAM. By your third cycle, you might have no deep left. It's all just stage two and RAM. Maybe a little stage one interspersed in there if you wake up. And the RAM episodes get longer. The dreams get more interesting. That's why the dreams in the first half of the night, you probably won't remember them anyway. But if you did, they usually little more boring with the dreams at the end of the night or the cool ones, the ones with the stories, with the characters and then the blurring of reality and all the emotion in the later parts of the night. Like nightmares, nightmares to a sleep scientist, a nightmare is a dream that wakes you up. That's the definition of a nightmare in our world. The dream that is so where the emotion is so powerful and that overcomes that process. Sorry, it's a sleep state. You go through these during the night and in REM sleep, it takes those important experiences that you segregated and deep sleep where you got rid of all the junk, kept the good stuff and REM sleep, but the dreams are doing is you're witnessing the brain rewire itself using what was left. So basically, the dreams are, among other things, essentially what's happening is, okay, here's what's left. How do I, what do I do with this? How is it, how does it connect to other things? How do I sort it? How do I file it? How do I process it? And the other stuff that's floating around that I was thinking about during the day, where is that? Where do I do it that? How do I process that? So dreams are, you're witnessing your brain rewiring itself, speaking to itself in its native language of ideas and metaphors and concepts, and feelings and how they relate to each other without rules. And so that's why all of the stages are important. And in stage two, that's not happening, but in stage two, it's happening. It's a lot of the recovery and repair stuff is also happening, is it? Because in REM, your brain's active doing the stuff. And in deep sleep, your brain's also active doing this other stuff. And in stage two is when everything else gets to happen in a more particular. So all of the stages are important. You cycle through them, and it's about every 90 minutes, anyone can Google that, but it's not exact. It's different across the night. And that's also why it's easier to wake up out of stage two and REM than deep sleep. But so if you woke up and you remember a dream, it's because you woke up at a REM. That's all, that's all that means. So anyway, how does sleep act in a effectiveness? Can I before you do that? Yes, so fascinating. Particularly the part where you're talking about all the new information that you're learning every day, you're during that transition between deep and REM. You kind of your brain is sorting it out and getting rid of the things that you don't really, aren't really that important to remember. And then during REM sleep, you're using what's left and somehow attaching it to other memories and enough and concepts. And sometimes they don't even seem to make sense. Like you'll, like, they may not make logical sense, and maybe they're wrong. I mean, you're sorting through your plan stuff out. And that's also why like, when you're awake, a person is a person, a house is a house, the car is a car. But when you're in a dream, the rules of the universe don't apply. The concept of a car can also be the concept of a person. And that person can be somebody else too. And then it was me. And then it was my sister. And then we were in this house that I grew up in, but actually, no, it wasn't. It was really a mall. Like things can happen. It's because you're not bound by the rules of the universe. You're just bound by how your mind is organizing that information. Well, based on what you just said, I have now a new hypothesis for why we dream, but I want to ask you, why do you think we dream? I think we dream, because evolution figured out a long time ago that you can learn a lot by reading all the words on the page. But you can also learn some really important things by reading between the lines on the page, by reading things that aren't on the page, and reading the concepts behind them. But when you're engaging in the day, so the way the brain works, which is fascinating, is the brain works by shortcuts. It's extremely efficient. It's extremely efficient because it makes a gazillion guesses and shortcuts without actually doing any real work, except when it absolutely has to. So for example, it's like, when you take a picture, your brain doesn't store every pixel. Your brain stores this line here, this line here, this sort of pattern of colors, and a set of instructions, and fills in the gap. Your brain stores the blueprint's not the house. And the blueprints are rolled up this. The house takes up the building and take up a whole city block. That's why the brain is super efficient. It stores, it figures out what is the minimum amount of information that actually needs, and then what are all the assumptions it needs to make to fill in all the details. And the good thing is, the universe works. That when things go farther away, they get smaller. And there's all kinds of rules of the way that you are, and you will be you five minutes from now, and I don't have to assume making assumptions that that can change. There's rules to the universe. And when you're engaging with the world that way, it could be really efficient. But maybe there's connections that aren't explicit that might help you navigate your life. So like let's say we're having this conversation now. Maybe you remind me of somebody who's a friend of mine from years and years ago. And what you're not that person, like conscious mind knows you're not that person. There's no question about that. But it may change how I speak, or my body language is going to look like, or how much I choose to ramble when I tell these stories, like these sorts of things. Dreaming is about, I think, it's about taking the actual written words on the page of life and sorting through those connections and sorting through those unspoken and details that don't actually exist but do. And inform our life. So dreams are the difference I think between memory and experience, where it's a difference between what you did and who you are. Like the dreams are sort of make you that person who reacts to things based on your own history, that forms those connections. But I don't know. That's my ramble of what I think. Well, thank you. Okay, so back to the sleep arts, yeah, because people having these awakenings, where there are multiple wakeings in the night, obviously this happening during different stages, what how does sleep apnea untreated sleep apnea affect the sleep, this sleep architect? That is one of, sleep apnea is one of the few things that can artificially reliably dramatically reduce your slow-wave deep sleep. Because it prevents it because you can't detach because your bodies keep trying to get your attention. The other thing it does is it dramatically increases, it can dramatically increase stage one and it can also, because your sleep is more shallow and you have more of these arousals in a wake but even if you don't wake up all the way, your brain is still sort of moving around. The other thing it can do, it can dramatically reduce your REM sleep, because remember what I said about muscles and REM sleep, even your respiratory muscles get weaker. That's why snoring is worse and REM, and or worse at the end of the night, because you have more REM at the end of the night. So if you're already in a floppy tube, trying to breathe out of this floppy tube, that's already having an issue, and then you make the muscles go extra limp, and your brain is going to get worse. So you're going to have more awake getting out of REM, you're going to have less sleep sleep, and you're sleep just going to be more shallow overall. So that's why people sleep apnea, they wake up, and they feel like it's sort of like, I just ate a whole meal and I'm still hungry. Right, yeah. I wonder if anyone's, maybe you can tell me if anyone's ever looked at, because you mentioned deep sleep is really important for this cleaning out that the toxic waste, or protein aggregate, how can we debate a 42-1? Yep. I wonder if anyone's ever looked at people with Alzheimer's disease to see if any of them have sleep apnea, like the untreated sleep apnea is my fault. I'm pretty sure that sleep apnea is a known risk factor for neurodegeneration, especially when it's more severe. So this is the thing, mild to moderate sleep apnea is a gray area. Severe sleep apnea seems very, and that's 30 events are more in hours, seems very reliably tied to bad outcomes. It seems like it's really only tied to bad outcomes when you also have daytime symptoms. Like you're mostly treating like the fatigue and the memory issues, whatever, you can still get cell death and you can get neuronal problems, because you're thinking about this way. Every time you have one of these respiratory events and you're having it, maybe dozens of times per hour in the night, your oxygen drops. And it's not the hypoxia that's the problem. This is what a lot of people get wrong about sleep apnea. It's not really the hypoxia. It's the intermittent hypoxia. So you're not hypoxic because what'll happen is you drop a few points, most people, unless you have some other lungs, most people with sleep apnea, their O2 doesn't drop a lot for sustained amounts of time, unless you have like emphysema or something. It'll drop a few percentage points then your body wakes up and then it recovers, then it drops again, then your body wakes up and it recovers, and it drops it. It's like it's constantly putting out all these little fires all over the place. The fires are never burning any houses down. They're just sprouting up all over the place, but when ends up happening is, all of these cells are releasing reactive oxygen species every time this happens. So you're releasing these reactive oxygen species that this oxidative stress is happening, and then it's quelled, and then it's stressed, and then it's quelled, and then it's stressed, and it's quite, and it's stressed, and it's all night, four days, or months, or years, or decades, usually. Imagine the stress, like your cells are trying to do their job, and they're constantly dealing with all this nonsense. Instead, imagine trying to do your job, and you're constantly having to do all this other stuff. So you're not getting the recovery function that you were built for, and so your trajectory goes slightly off. So that's why sleep, not just sleep deprivation, but also sleep untreated sleep happening. I can lead to liver problems, kidney problems, brain problems, heart issues, immune system problems, because all of the every cell that relies on oxygen starts getting stressed, and some of them are more sensitive than others. Right, and you're also disrupting your sleep architecture and not eating enough sleep. So people with untreated sleep apnea, then probably do have problems with working memory. I mean, emotional regulation, emotional regulation, executive function, attention. So this is the thing, when your sleep is poor, whether it's sleep deprivation, or sleep apnea or fragmentation or whatever, the first brain function to go is vigilant attention. Your ability to maintain focus, especially when whatever you're focusing on, isn't super excited. That is usually the first brain function, that's the first warning sign, that's somethings up. And the, and that can start creating memories, but a lot of the memory issues are memory issues, because sleep is really important in memory. Remember, you're taking all the supposed time, I was all memory connected functions, it's about sorting through information, processing information, consolidating information, integrating information. And if you're not able to do those things, you're operating inefficiently, you're not performing those functions. But memory is also a function of attention, where if you're not able to focus and attend, even if your memory machinery was working perfectly, you have nothing to process, because it never got in there. This is the thing with people taking sedating medications, sometimes it impairs memory, sometimes it impairs attention, which also impairs memory. You mean, sort of, it does that not while you're on it, but like, that's it. Wow. So, I mean, that's why a lot of these medications and stuff, and really anything that is impairing your ability to focus will have ripple effects to memory and decision making as well, because the information you took in informs those other processes. I mean, just like, because most simply, you can't recall a memory that never got stored because you're working memory, couldn't process it, because you didn't attend to it in the first place. Is this why men have a lot more attentional? They sure are the same. Maybe? Maybe? I mean, there's a lot of untreated sleep acne out there. And then there's a lot of other sleep problems too. And they all, I mean, sleep does a lot. Sleep, you know, we live in this society that sees sleep as an unproductive use of time, especially people who are training, especially people who are like trying to maximize their day. And sleep is not an unproductive use of time. Sleep is an extremely productive use of time. I mean, if you're working out, and you're trying to get stronger, when you're working out, you're stressing the system so that it rebuilds back stronger, right? When do you think that other part happens? Not while you're working out, it's when you're recovering, it's the recovery. Sleep should be your number one recovery protocol for any kind of performance driven person, whether it's physical performance, mental performance. I mean, when you sleep to private people, they trade sleep for work all the time, but you actually get less done. And we've actually measured this. You actually accomplish more on less time if you're well rested and your brain is clear. Right. Okay, well, let's talk about treating, you know, to sleep apnea. I know we can talk about CPAP and what that is and it certainly works. Yeah. It's a blood instrument, it works. Long-term adherence, maybe not so great. What do you find to be some of the best evidence-based non-CAP interventions? Yeah. So the thing about CPAP is it's a blood instrument because it's thinking that it's just to split the keeps open your way. It creates a pillow there. So if your way wants to collapse, it can't. And CPAP, it's continuous positive air pressure. Continuous because it's blowing continuously. Positive airway pressure, as opposed to negative pressure, which is sucking positive airway pressure is blowing. So it's just continuously blowing air in your airway to create a pillow there to keep it open. That's all it is. It's a blunt instrument. If your airway wants to close, you blow enough air in there, it won't be able to close. But for some people, it's too uncomfortable or whatever. So there's other approaches. The one I tend to use the most, especially with athletes, who are often presenting with more mild to moderate CPAP in any way, are what are called mandibular advancement devices. With these, that's essentially a retainer. You wear it at night. Mandibular, like your mandible advancement. So essentially, it's a retainer that pushes your jaw forward. And in a nutshell, that's all it is. There's obviously a science behind it. But what it does is it creates a little muscle tone here. Even when you don't want, even when you're trying to rest. So usually that's not a good thing. But it creates not enough muscle tone to keep you awake. But enough muscle tone to keep this part of your airway open a little more than it normally would be. And for a lot of people, especially more mild, sleeper-related breathing issues, does the trick. That's all it takes to knock out at least enough of those events so that you don't end up noticing it anymore. And you don't have to plug it in. You don't have to switch out your hose every couple months, like it's a little easier. You do have to get it adjusted. And as your jaw remodels, you might have to do some adjustments. You do it with a, there's a whole field called sleep dentistry. It's sleep medicine dentistry, not sedation dentistry, but sleep dentistry where it's about people diagnosing and treating sleep apnea with these dental devices. That's a very common one. There's also, musculos, myofacial therapy. So you can use the musculoskeletal system and essentially exercise these muscles so that they just carry more muscle tone. That can work. I mean, there's very famous work done with people who play the didgeridue where they have to do the cyclical breathing. It ends up strengthening certain muscles that even when you're asleep, they're a little stronger and they can maintain a little more tone. So sometimes that can help, especially for more mild apnea cases. There's a device called excidoSA, where it's, you put it on your tongue when you're awake and it's sort of electrically stimulate your tongue muscle. So then you go to bed, it keeps a little, it's like a tens unit kind of, where it stimulates your tongue muscles so that when you go to bed, there's a little more muscle tone in there. That seems to work okay. There's a new device, people maybe seeing commercials called Inspire, which just means breathing, but it's sort of like a pacemaker that they install. So it's an implantable electrical device that they do surgery, but it's sort of a pacemaker for your tongue muscle. And so what it does is when it detects that your tongue is falling back, it zaps it to open it up. And that also for people for whom it's a candidate for, that can also, you don't have to, again, there's no equipment to replace, but you do need surgery for it and there's complications there sometimes, but seems to work okay. There's more options now than ever. And the technology's always getting better, even with CPAP, there's more than 200 different kinds of masks out there. So for people who don't like their device and don't like their mask, because it's uncomfortable or whatever, it's rare that I find a mask problem that can't be fixed if what you need is one of those. What about mouth taping? mouth taping. So, all right, mouth taping. So mouth taping for decades in the state medicine field, we've been using chin straps. Just like a elastic band, who's from a host at night, for people who are snoring, that don't, that, where it's just mild snoring and they don't have sleep apnea, or their sleep apnea's mild, or their sleep apnea is due to them opening their mouth at night and their tongue falling back and they can breathe through their nose okay, chin straps have been great. They've been used for decades. mouth taping, I think, is just sort of the same thing, where you're essentially just keeping your mouth closed. You're just keeping your mouth closed. In a way that you can breathe through. Like it's, it's special tape where air flows through fine. If their problem is that you're opening your mouth, I have no problem with it, and it probably may help those people, but if the problem is that you actually have sleep apnea, and if you don't open your mouth, then you can't breathe, like in your opening your mouth to gasp for air, then that's probably not what you want. It's probably the opposite of what you want, if you need to open your mouth to breathe or else you're going to have, your oxygen's gonna plum it. Don't do that. But if you're like more mild snoring case or for people who are mild enough or if it helps you keep, maybe you're using a nasal device or like a more extraps or rhino med makes these nasal splints, we can keep your nose open. If you're using one of those, and you just need to keep your mouth closed, I have no real problem with it. I just don't think it's gonna, like, cure cancer and save the world. But I feel like it gets overblown by people's health. Yeah, it's gotten overblown, and it sounds more like maybe for snoring, than anything. And it's, if you keep your mouth closed during the night solves your problem, go ahead. But if that's, but if you're hoping that keeping your mouth closed during the night will solve your problem, and it doesn't, there are other options for you. Are there any for people that are experimenting with some of these perhaps the retainer or the myofunctional training? Yeah. I, we're gonna get into sleep wearables soon, but like, how do they really know it's working? What's that? Yeah, it's tough. The best way to know, and this is not a perfect way. Second best way to know is, are you, how do you feel during the day? How's your energy level? How's your ability to focus? Are you falling asleep whenever you stop moving? A lot of people sleep after you. They can, they don't stop moving, because then they'll fall asleep. They can't watch TV. They can't watch a movie. They can go to a dark movie theater without nodding off. Like, they have a hard time with that, or meetings. They hate meetings, because they have trouble keeping away. If all of a sudden that's just not a problem for you, it's like your appetite isn't ramped up because you're starving all the time. You're actually getting good nutrition, so you're not starving. That's a good signal. But it's not a great signal. It's not a perfect signal because there's a lot of people where they're sleeping after the scenes to be treated just fine, but they still have some of those daytime symptoms. And no one really exactly knows why, but it seems just means we need to learn more about what this condition really is and what it's doing in the brain. Well, what's permanent and what's not permanent? We don't know yet. And I say that's second best because the best is just get retested. And a lot of people sleep after you have, if it's been a couple of years, get to do it to do the test again, do it while you're using your treatment to see. And for a lot of those devices, insurance requires you to do that anyway to make sure it's working fine. See if you need to get adjusted. Because sometimes they need to get adjusted and they're not working great. Because your mouth changes or something. So that's one way. I mean, really, really, there's no other way besides either looking. I mean, you might in the future might even be easier to look at the wearable data. Check your auction levels during the night. Check your heart rate during the night. See if you have these spikes that you used to have. We're seeing most importantly, see how you feel the next day. All right. I kind of wanted to shift gears. We're going to get into the supplements because that's something everyone wants to know about. Before that, I kind of wanted to ask you a little bit about, you know, we've a lot of people have heard about seepaging the most important things for seepaging, you know, rapid fires. I do want to seepaging. I do all that's seepaging. Yeah, it's the same. Or mostly, paging is bad. Like people talk about this all the time. But yeah, but there's a difference between seepaging and behavioral seep medicine. There are different things. Right, exactly. I mean, obviously, people need to have sleep good seepaging too. That's important. But like, like, everything you were talking about with seepety eye, like that's different. Yeah, the seepaging is just something that already needs to be done. Yeah, but like, aging is hygiene. Hygiene isn't medicine. So like washing your hands is hygiene. And everyone should wash their hands more than once. You know, you should be, and if you're sick, wash your hands more. But washing your hands won't cure an infection. Right. But for people that perhaps don't have insomnia, right. Have apnea seepety. But everyone should still be washing their hands. Everyone should still be brushing your teeth. Even if you can't brush your way out of braces, doesn't mean you shouldn't be brushing your teeth. So sleep hygiene is all about setting yourself up for success or dealing with some of these more minor problems. Right. So I was wondering if you had any tips on some more advanced type of sleep hygiene. Like we know we all know dark, cold, quiet. Like it's either, right, it's either rocket science. But like, are there any other sort of more advanced sleep hygiene techniques like, oh, maybe you're resting heart rate or respiratory rate or something like that, like people could. So my unconventional, the stuff, this, you know, if you Googled, if you Googled sleep hygiene, what's some stuff that might not come up on those initial lists that are still useful? One of that, one of the things that you'll see often on sleep hygiene lists is keep a regular schedule. Because predictability, the brain loves predictability. So if you keep a regular schedule, time itself becomes a cue. So like, if you want to eat lunch at noon every day, start eating at noon every day, and your body will learn to get hungry at that time. But what if you can't keep a regular schedule? Well, an alternative approach I would take is find other ways of building predictability into your sleep, for example. So like, so one of the groups I do a lot of work with is Major League Baseball. And a Major League Baseball, when they're in season, they're constantly moving around and playing in different time zones and sleeping in different hotels. How do you keep regularity when you're constantly moving around? And so like, for people whose lives are like that, what do you do? Well, I usually say, OK, stop trying to keep a regular schedule, but find other ways to build predictability. And so maybe have a nighttime routine that is highly predictable. Were you do the same things in the same order, even if you do them in different places in the different hotel room or whatever? Especially if you can bring things with you, like bring the pillowcase with you as a condition stimulus. Use the same toothbrush, whether it's at home or on the road if you travel a lot. Use do the same things in the same order. So even if they're at a different time of the different place, find alternate ways to build predictability. If time itself is not the predictable one. Another one is avoiding bright light at night. What if you can't? So blue blocking glasses are great for this, because by blue blocking glasses, they have to be or injure red most of the time. Some of the other ones will work. Some of the yellow ones are brown ones will work. But if you put the glasses on and you look at something blue and you know that it's blue, it's not going to do its job for a circadian perspective. So some of them block blue for eye stream, but that's different thing. So if you put on say orange tinted glasses and you can't see the color blue, then the environmental light is not going to interfere with their sleep in the same way because it's not going to send a daytime signal. Another one that even fewer people know about is bright light in the morning can help set your sleep up at night in three ways that are actually a little unconventional. Number one, by having that morning be a regular timing and a strong daytime signal. I'm talking about daylight, I'm talking about like outdoor light, not just turn on light my bedroom light. That's a couple hundred locks. Step outside, it's thousands of locks of light. Getting that strong daytime signal in the morning at a predictable time starts a clock. And that clock, just like when you finish a meal, you'll start getting hungry a certain number of hours later. If you don't really have a really strong meal, you're sort of hungry all over the clock. You don't have that rhythm. But if you have a strong morning signal with some bright light at a predictable time, about 16 to 17 hours later, your body will expect to be ready for sleep. And if you can make that a little more regular, it makes, it's like if you want to be, if you want someone to catch a ball down field and you throw it the same amount about the same distance every time, but you keep moving, the person down field doesn't know where to stand. But if you stay still, they can predict where the ball is gonna land. So like by setting that time it creates, it sets you up for success by starting that timer. The second thing that it does is that it creates a circadian amplitude. So your circadian rhythm, this 24 hour cycle, it's like when you're on the couch in the dark all day, you don't have a strong daytime rhythm, so you don't have a strong nighttime rhythm. But if you get a strong daytime signal by being active and getting, especially outside light, especially in the morning to start that curve going by the time nighttime comes, you'll have an even stronger nighttime signal. And then the third thing that it does, that even fewer people know about, is everyone knows that light at night is bad and that light in the morning is good. But light across the day, matters where the more outdoor light, the more bright light, but it's mostly means outdoor light. The more light you get during the day, it annoculates you against light at night. Because if you've got a really strong light daytime signal, you can get all kinds of light from screens or whatever at night and it actually won't matter for most people. You can actually, so again, it's lesser known, but because the system knows where it is, it's not looking for information anymore. And conflicting information will get thrown out. As opposed to, like, I don't know, it's light now, but I didn't get a ton of light during the day, maybe at a state time, I don't know. But you can enoculate yourself against nighttime light by getting plenty of daytime light. That's fascinating. I've noticed that, of course, when I'm traveling and I'm outside all the time, and then it's like being in my hotel, I don't usually have my dimming lot, my dimmers and everything that I usually have, but it doesn't matter, because I'm dead tired. Right. Yeah. This is, human's lived for most of our existence, an equatorial, bright days, dark nights, relatively little seasonal variability all around all around, like the Mediterranean area and that part of the world. You know, we saw all kinds of problems by creating these walls and buildings and artificial lights and everything. We saw a lot of problems. We've created some new ones too, and we're still running the same code. Right. A couple of questions, follow up questions for that. Do you think the time of morning light matters a lot? Like you wake up in the morning and like, is it like first thing you go outside and how long should you have to go outside for 30 minutes? Yeah, morning light is key. Earlier, the better. I mean, honestly, earlier, the better. And how much, I would say 15 minutes is probably fine. 30 minutes is probably better. Like a morning walk or a morning run is actually probably perfect. And because what's happening, it's not only that date time, so the other thing it's doing. And we'll talk about this one when we talk about selfless, but Melatonin. So Melatonin naturally, your natural melatonin will drop in the morning down to like almost from its peak to almost nothing. Light suppresses Melatonin. Naturally, that's what it does. And so the early, if your melatonin is still kind of hinders dropping by getting that light, you accelerate its ability to drop. It's like coffee. Yeah, kind of. And actually, this is also why I don't recommend that people caffeinate as soon as they wake up. I recommend people wait an hour because if you caffeinate as soon as you wake up, the amount of a denys scene that that caffeine is blocking is still very low. You haven't produced enough yet to really have much of an effect. But if you drink caffeine as soon as you wake up in the morning and you feel more alert, it's probably your sleep inertia, what naturally coming down, and your melatonin naturally get a block and you're feeling the effects of it and you're attributing it to the caffeine. When actually you could skip the caffeine, you probably would have felt mostly the same. It's just the caffeine is still having effects later, but you've missed the caffeine peak. So like actually, it's time to caffeine a little bit later. So you're saying you want to use the caffeine for when you basically need it, when you're working maybe adjusting the filter. Yeah, use the caffeine. So the denys scene builds across the day and you're at your lowest levels as soon as you wake up. Why are you going to block something that you know, caffeine works mostly by blocking a denys scene and your lowest levels of a denys scene the first thing in the morning, why would you recommend someone block it first thing in the morning? Wait till it accumulates a little bit, especially if you for most people that natural sleep inertia will wear off within 10 to 60 minutes as soon as they wake up. And my favorite way to tell this story is that you know how you wake up and you smell the coffee and then even that kind of perks you up a little bit, they say, yeah, and I say, did you know that there's a term for that? And they're like, oh, there is. And I say, yes, it's called placebo. And then so they laugh and like what do you mean? And like coffee doesn't work all factory. It doesn't work through the nose. If you smell it and you start parking up, it's because you're predicting what its effects are going to be before you even ingested it. And which means when you're drinking that coffee, it's giving you a placebo effect as much as it's giving you anything else. So like, wait a little bit, because you don't need it. That's why I drink D.C.C.F. Coffee, like 11 am and I feel like it's totally working. And I'm totally fine with that placebo. Because you had it in you all along. Right. So it sounds like the morning routine would be wake up. Go outside, whether it's water. You probably see it in the face. Get some water. Go outside, whether you're taking your puppy or dog out. I just got a new puppy going for a run. Yeah. But go outside for at least 15 minutes. And then wait a little bit, then you make your coffee. Obviously, there's some people are rushing to get to work, but you drink your coffee in the car and wait to work. Or wait till you get there. Or wait till you get to work. OK, I'm going to try that. Yeah. And also, you got to remember, caffeine doesn't reach its peak effects for at least like a half an hour after you ingested it. So and then it'll last for a few hours afterwards. So if you want to, if you... Wait, say that again. So it doesn't reach its peak until 30 minutes later. Until about 30 minutes later. So if you feel it, it was sort of right away. That wasn't that was sort of the effect of caffeine. OK. And then, yeah. And then it'll trail off. Like it'll have some effects. It'll build. So it's something there. But it's actually the peak effects of caffeine for alertness or about a half an hour in. So that's why a lot of people will do is they do the whole calf nap or the napachino or whatever they call it. We're like, they drink the coffee, take a nap for 15 to 20 minutes, wake up, right when the coffee starts ramping up and then they go. Never heard of that. Oh yeah, it's a thing. I mean, I don't do it, but not because I have any moral opposition to it. But it's a thing where because they leverage the delay in the caffeine reaching its effectiveness. So and they use that to limit their nap time. But we can talk about strategic naphing and we'll be able to do that. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. We cover a lot of detailed evidence-based content here and I want to make sure that you don't miss any of it. Now back to the episode. Okay, we'll just talk about supplements. I mean, obviously we're talking about the behavioral interventions being absolutely the best. The most likely to actually help. Okay. That's the way I think about it. It's like, they don't always work. And other things may sedate you more faster, but there were the things that are most likely to solve your problem long term with the least negative effects. What about, you know, you were talking about early light exposure, the timing of going to bed at the same time versus waking up in the morning at the same time. How does that play a role? I would say focus more on starting the morning than timing your bed time at the same time because the morning will set up the evening and usually people have more control over that anyway. And the way I like to think about the evening is I think about sleep as my commute to tomorrow, where instead of thinking, so if you had to go to work, you don't think, well, I'm gonna wake up when I want, I'm gonna do everything I need to do around the house, pay all my bills, do all the dishes, do all my chores, and then when I happen to be done, hope that I make it into work in time. And then like shoot, I ran out of time. Like, that doesn't work. Instead, what you do, you think, what time do I need to leave the house? How long is it gonna take me to get ready? What do I wanna do in the morning? What do I wanna go for that walk or whatever? What time do I need to wake up to make that happen? And that's how we should be thinking about sleep, cause then you should be thinking, keep going and think, okay, how much sleep do I wanna get? How much time do I need to budget with a couple of wakeings during the night or whatever? That's normal to get that amount of sleep. When do I wanna be in bed to be able to fall asleep when I want to get all the sleep I need so that I wake up naturally when I want to be woken up, fully refreshed. So when do I need to start winding down? So you think backwards. And so the nighttime routine, regularity, I think is important, but I think more important is thinking strategically about it and start thinking, based on my goals for tomorrow, when do I, when do I need to be up and when do I wanna go to bed? But the morning routine building regularity will help set you up to be tired at the time you want to be. But going into bed at a regular time when you're not ready for sleep, that's bad stimulus control. That'll set you up for problems later. So that's also why I don't stress the nighttime getting into bed. Because what if you're not ready? If you're not ready, if you're not hungry, don't eat. Like if you're not ready, don't sit there and count sheep for an hour. That'll just make you stressed. So that's why I focused the regularity on the morning. So you think people should try to have a consistent wake-up time in the morning. It's impossible. But not everyone can. And like maybe your wake-up time during the week is uncomfortable early and you wanna sleep in on the weekends. I got no problem with that. Regularity is good, but like if it means you're getting a little bit of extra recovery on the weekends, it's a trade-off. There might be an positive there. But if they do, if they are waking up early in the morning during the week, then you think they're building up an up-sleep pressure to fall asleep earlier. Right, you think, and it's just, that's the heaven's command. If they, and if they, that assumes they're giving themselves permission to go to sleep at a time, that is ideal for them. A lot of people don't give themselves permission to go to sleep. You know, we have this whole concept of revenge, bedtime procrastination, where you're only taking, you're taking revenge on your own day, right? And your own resentment of your life being too full of junk and crap to have no time for yourself. And it's tough. And the way I put it though is, I think you're cutting off your nose despite your face at that point. When people say, I know I should be going to bed earlier, but you're asking me to give up the one hour in my day that's mine that I need for my own mental health. What do you say to that? And I say, you're right, I am not gonna ask you to give up time. What if I could give you some more of your time back? What if the reason why that is the only hour in your day that you have is because you could be more efficient and productive during the day and you won't need as much buffer time on stuff if you were a little sharper. And actually, that's what the data show that actually instead of asking you for time. So we did this, I went to the university into the division one of athletes, cross all the different sports. And I said, look, I'm not gonna ask you to sleep more, but if you want to fall asleep faster, here's how you do it and we'll get into what I said. So I'm sure you're gonna ask, how do you fall asleep faster if you want to be? If you need to wake up early, how do you fall asleep earlier than your body wants to? How do you get moving during the day? Let me teach you how to do this. So that you become your own sleep expert. And if you wanna get more sleep, peers with some of the benefits would be if you're not getting enough, especially in students, especially in athletes. But I'm not gonna tell you what to do, like I don't know your life and I can't control your schedule, but here's how to make an informed choice. On average, time and bed increased by 40 minutes. Total sleep time increased by over an hour. Most of the time they needed, they were already in bed anyway. And they gave up those extra 40, I didn't ask for it. They found what was useful for them and actually they were rating themselves as their grades were better, they were more productive. Their social life was better after they were sleeping better. And so what did they do? Well, it's the product. So, first of all, I hammered stimulus control. I normalized some things like, they would, what would happen is they would freak out when they wake up during the night and they have trouble getting you back sleep. I said, don't freak out. Take a break, five, 10 minutes, get a drink of water, whatever it go back to bed. And like reducing that performance anxiety, hammering stimulus control, winding down routine stuff, like dimming lights, gave them blue blockers, you know, we'd like, and then in terms of morning routine, talked about getting light first thing in the morning. A lot of that basic stuff, but really it was, and it also coupled it with some education of a talked about how the different sleep stages work, talked about how sleep works, not as like this is sleep on a one class, but it's more of a look, you're an athlete. You're trying to do all the stuff with your body and have it in peak condition and understand what's going on to the hood. Let me teach you what you need to know about what we know about how the system works, so that you can make the most informed choice that you can make. Teach them about how circadian rhythms work. Teach them about how sleep propensity builds across the day, dissipates. And when they're awake in the middle of the night, it just because they haven't built up enough sleep pressure yet. So you've got to give it a little bit of time before you can go back to sleep. Like teach them how these processes work so that it demystifies it a little bit. So even if they have an awakening, it doesn't become a stressful one. And if they want to fall asleep earlier, they can learn to program that in and create those conditions. So we all like, we hammered the don't lay down in bed. So like if you're going to college students, their bed is also their couch and it's also their desk and it's also their whatever. So we had a sleeping part of the bed, wake part of the bed. You know, when you're in the wake part of the bed, you're sitting up. You can lean back, but you're not going to lay down with your head on a pillow unless you're playing it. So we separated these things out. Work beautifully. How many weeks? We did it for a semester. So it was like, it was like eight to 10 weeks. That's amazing. Yeah, that's like typically six to eight weeks is normal. That usually even people who come in and say, my sleep is terrible. Often, you know, and I'll say, like, look, it's extremely unusual for someone to walk in. Unless they have some other major medical complication that's getting in the way. That within six to eight sessions, they're usually sleeping way better, often by then they're like, you know, this is my problem anymore. And I'll say, you know where to find me if you need me. Well, that's awesome. Yeah. Okay, well, let's talk about, let's talk about a couple supplements. Yeah. I definitely want to get into jet lag in a little bit later, but you know, obviously the most, the top of my and subpoena people think about when they think about sleep, I think melatonin. So melatonin is a hormone. It's a very old molecule. It's in plants, it's in other stuff. It's not a sleep hormone. Except by association. Melatonin is the hormone of darkness. Melatonin is a nighttime signal. You produce it at night. A great example of how it's not a sleep signal has no sedating properties whatsoever. Melatonin doesn't. You give melatonin to a nocturnal animal. It wakes them up because it's a nighttime signal. To agree to which your body gets a nighttime signal and that makes you sleepy, yes, it can promote sleep. Melatonin can promote sleep in humans. For that reason, it can help you fall asleep faster. It can help you stay asleep. It can help you sleep more restfully because it's strengthening that nighttime signal. That's what it does. It's also why it is almost universally useless for insomnia. Because if you have a conditioned arousal, remember now, now everyone knows what conditioned arousal is. If you have a conditioned arousal, your body already knows it's nighttime, still can't sleep. So taking melatonin is almost never going to work to treat an insomnia condition. But if you don't have conditioned arousal, if you just need a little bit of a boost, actually melatonin probably works just fine, it's also you produce it natural. During the day your levels are almost non-existent, they start rising in the early evening, they pick up, they peek during the night and then they drop off right about the time you expect the sun to come up and light suppresses it. So even if you're at peak levels during the night, turn on a bright bathroom light, plummets, then you turn the loft the light as long as the clock still thinks it's nighttime, it'll regenerate them again. Might take a delay, especially the older you get, the less flexible the system is, but that happens naturally. Now some people, when they take melatonin, they might be taking the wrong dose at the wrong time. So the way we started using melatonin as a treatment for something was, our natural rhythms are about 24 hours. So some creatures they use light from the sun to like when you put a blanket over a bird's cage, they'll go to sleep because their natural melatonin starts spiking as soon as it's dark, and then it suppresses as soon as it's light. Humans, we have mammals, we have our own internal clock that guesses what time it is, so we could be an cave and still keep a roughly 24 hours cycle, otherwise the systems in our body would get all out of the clock. But it's not precise 24 hours, it's a biological clock that is slightly longer than 24 hours and almost everybody. Not quite 25 hours, but somewhere in that gray zone. But what happens is, so it's like if you wanna, if every day of your life is a string, and every day is gonna be 24 hours. And you had to produce the string to be the exact same length. What you do is you make all the strings slightly long and trim the edges off that way you can guarantee they're all gonna be the same. And that's what physiology does to your rhythm. It makes it slightly longer than 24 hours than resets it in the morning to start it all over again, with the morning light, does it hits the reset on the rhythm. So blind people who can't see light, they get this, their natural rhythm never gets reset. So it's slightly more than 24 hours. So if you were living a slightly more than 24 hour rhythm, you woke up at six o'clock today, you'd wake up at 630 tomorrow, you'd wake up at seven the next day, and eventually you're waking up at two in the afternoon, it's miserable. And then it cycle around. It's called non-24 hours or cated rhythm disorder, where you just can't reset your rhythm with light. They found is you give someone a third to a half a milligrams of melatonin in the evening, in a blind person fixes the whole thing. Sends the nighttime signal at the time, but it needs to see it, and the system responds beautifully to it. You're not trying to replace their natural melatonin. That half milligrams dose is the signal. It's a clock signal. It's what tells your body, hey, nighttime now. And if you give it a little bit before, you're naturally gonna start producing it right around that time. It sends the signal a little early. So it's sort of like your body responds of like, oh, I didn't realize it was nighttime yet. Better get started, and it starts your own natural process a little early, so that half milligrams dose in the evening, like five hours before your bedtime. That's the evening signal, where your evening hasn't even really started yet, you're giving your evening a little bit of boost. So it's basically like jet lagging yourself. Where you're telling your body it's nighttime, before it's actually nighttime. It's not your really tiny, you're telling it it's evening, before it's actually evening, like right around dinner, or like usually two to three hours before your typical bedtime is when you start producing melatonin. You give it a couple hours before that. It's in the zone where you're looking for it. Like, given the middle of the day, your body's not looking for it. It's in the zone where your body's looking for it, and you can confuse the system, and think it's later than it really is. That also means you'll wake up a little earlier, because the whole thing got shifted. Same thing is if you take that low dose melatonin as soon as you wake up in the morning, that drop gets delayed a little bit. So it ends, so that ball lands a little further along than it was expected to. So your day started a little bit later than it thought it was going to. So you'll stay up a little bit later the next time. So you can use that half dose, half milligram dose, as a clock shifting dose. So why is everything over the counter? Like five and ten? Well, A people think more is more, and sometimes more is less, especially with melatonin. If it's just a nighttime signal, more does it, is it more? Five, you can take closer to bedtime. That's a little more of a sleep promoting dose, where it's more of like a hay body, idiot. If you didn't know it was nighttime already, I'm gonna scream it and all cap it'll letters for you, and get your act together, and it'll boost that net, whatever natural sleep drive you have, that is an interfered with by insomnia. It may boost it. So people who take that three to five milligrams with it, close to the bedtime, it can have that sleep promoting effect, not because the melatonin was sedating. Was it sort of got, was that strong enough signal to keep you into gear a little bit? Now a lot of times people will feel groggy in the morning with it. That's because you just couldn't metabolize it fast enough, that you gave yourself such a big dose, you already were naturally producing it anyway. So you were overfilled your bucket. And so by the morning, you still have melatonin floating around, backfiring. So now you're telling your body it's nighttime when it's daytime, because you couldn't get rid of the nighttime signal fast enough, and it had built up over time. So often when I say if you're taking melatonin at night and it's helping you, but you're feeling groggy during the day, cut your dose and half. And then there's the other problem, there was a few studies that have been published where I mean almost all these melatonin supplements that are out on the market have huge variations. Some of them have like a hundred times more melatonin than actually what's on the, like, so that's the thing where there's a lot of them out there that can be unreliable, especially from some of the manufacturers that don't have the good quality control. It is regulated by the FDA, it's just, you know, there's just not enough money for enforcement. So there's a lot of ton of enforcement, but any of the larger companies, they're actually gonna have pretty good quality control. And if you look at those, the ones that are the bigger companies that are on the shelf, they are almost always right on target for what they should be. And I say that because what's on the bottle is actually not what's supposed to be in the bottle. And a lot of people don't know this, but the bigger companies that have the higher quality and the higher quality control are following the law. And the law says that the amount on the bottle has to be within a certain percentage of the amount that's in the pill at the expiration date. That is the definition. So if you have a supplement that's sitting on a shelf with a three year expiration date and you're working with a company that's trying to do everything really well and correctly, your chemists and food scientists have to calculate exactly how much they have to put in that pill so that as it degrades naturally over time, how much will it degrade to the point to hit the target two to three years out? That's actually the calculation they're making. So in melatonin, that answer is usually 30 to 50%. So when you buy melatonin off the shelf and it says five, it's probably closer to eight, seven or eight, when you buy it. And then two to three years later, yeah, it's five because they did their job, they followed the law and they had really high standards in their manufacturer. But it's still, you're probably taking a much, you're probably taking a higher dose and they can't tell you because the way the law's written, it's like if you tell people what's in there is different than what's on the bottle, you've now changed the label and now you have to beat that. It's complicated. The law was written in the way that I think they didn't foresee this problem. But people need to know that actually, if it's a good brand, it's actually gonna be higher than what's in the bottle because they're gonna calculate in the overage needed to be able to degrade to the point that hits the target. Is that correct? People don't know this. So that's is more for sure with what I have. That's also why I say, if you're still having effects, actually your dose might be too high just cut in half. The other thing that's worth mentioning about melatonin is it's actually a very potent cellular repair molecule. Those effects don't really seem, those effects need to be stronger at the higher doses, actually. Like closer to the 10. But that's where you get more side effects too. So most people don't need it. Like we have an immune system. Melatonin as a recovery molecule is a very old molecule. Our immune system probably does the trick, but that's also why. When people take melatonin supplements, they get sick less. It was seen as an adjunct treatment during COVID that didn't conflict with any of the other treatments, but actually made illness recovery better. Melatonin's a very is a really cool molecule. It's just misunderstood. Yeah, it's a hormone. I think it's a regular like 500 different protein encoding. Yeah, it's a lot. It is a hormone. What other hormone do you just like buy over the counter and sort of unlimited amounts? Like it. We are. So when it comes to melatonin, I know there's a lot of questions I get from people is well, if you're taking melatonin supplement, are you going to then stop making endogenous? Yeah, there is to my knowledge. There is no evidence that that actually ever happens. To my knowledge. It's a worry, but melatonin is so, is so old that like you're going to produce it. Like the way to stop producing natural melatonin would be aging that reduces it. But to my knowledge, there is no data that shows that continual use of supplementary melatonin changes or reduces your ability to naturally produce it at night. What about, and that's also what the conclusion I came to. What about the ability like your melatonin receptors? Like, is there remodeling? I don't know. I haven't seen anything that's concerning in any way. I just haven't. Like no one has, there's no finding that's, that when people have looked, it doesn't really seem to be doing that. It doesn't seem to change the same way other receptors do it. Again, it's a very old system. It's an old built-in system that isn't, that is meant to adapt, that is meant to be able to deal with flexibility, rather than respond to it. Super quickly. I haven't seen anything either, but it's not clear that. I've seen anything either. Maybe like maybe findings will come out in the future when people look at it. Is the other thing that other people need to know, this is about supplements in general, that research on supplements is scarce, especially really well done research in highly controlled conditions, not because there's any sort of like conspiracy to keep the information out of people, just that research is extremely expensive to do. My day job is in research. That research is extremely expensive to do. In Pharma, it's because you can do some of that basic stuff with research in Pharma has the deep pockets to do this. The reason they do is because they have IP, racked around this wide drug, just so expensive, because it costs about $2 billion to bring a drug to market and 10 years at least. In supplements, you don't have that IP protection. You can't patent a supplement that naturally occurs. You might be able to patent a molecule as an additive or something, but that's extremely rare in the supplements base. So, the sub-living companies have no, they can't, they can't charge what drug companies can charge. They don't have the deep pockets to pay for this research. They don't have the IP protection around it, which would incentivize them. Why would a manufacturer spend $2 million on a clinical trial at their competitor or could just take the results from and claim as their own? Like, and NIH, who funds, I mean, people need to understand how absolutely fundamental NIH is to all health research in the US. I mean, every bit of health research in the US absolutely depends on a healthy NIH. And NIH, as much as they fund, whatever, I mean, they're dramatically underfunded already compared to the need, but supplements don't seem to ever rate as high enough priority, where they're dealing with trying to cure cancer and Alzheimer's disease and other at sleep apnea, and other major health conditions, and supplements by definition don't treat medical conditions. They promote health, but they don't treat... And my dish that helped right back. They might could, they could. It's just, people don't understand how competitive grant applications are for NIH. And so to survive that competition and studying supplements is really hard. So that's right, like, the deep pockets don't have as much of incentive to study it. So it's not that it's not that anyone's trying to hide the research. It's that it's really expensive to do and no one's stepped up willing to pay for it. Yeah, it's why there's not a lot of high quality studies out there on supplements and you always have to take it with the greenest salt. Right. And it's not the supplements fault. It's not the company's fault. It's just, you know, I would love for there. I would there love for there to be more investment, or if there was a public outcry that like, look, we need these studies. Yeah, hopefully we'll get them. Well, with that said, are there any other, I mean, I've heard of a variety of supplements, like magnesium, lavender, glycine, healthy anine, any, I mean, moderate evidence that... Yeah, I mean, these were... So a lot of them have evidence that they're definitely not nothing. None of them have beaten placebo to treat insomnia. The closest that came was Valirium, but when you pool the date, it still doesn't beat insomnia placebo for insomnia, I can't, but it's the date. It can be calming. Magnesium also does seem to promote sleep in a number of different ways, actually, more than just one way. Doesn't treat, and doesn't usually treat insomnia, but it can help promote sleep. Glacine also, great data on glycine, showing that people who take glycine, it can help fall asleep, help stay asleep a little bit better. A lot of these supplements, it can help you fall asleep as to stay asleep a little bit better. Some of them don't do anything to sleep per se, but they work in terms of calming. So calming isn't sleep inducing, though, for people who don't have insomnia, because if you have conditioned arousal, you can become and still not sleep. But for people for whom a little bit of calming and relaxation is really helpful, that's where things like the alphineine and some of these other more calming things, like the camony, and some of that stuff that can be calming can actually be helpful. Even if they don't actually technically do anything on the sleep side. Other things that can help promote sleep, things that have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidating properties. Remember, your body's doing a lot of that healing at night, and so if you can help give it those raw materials, so this is where there's certain supplements out there that actually seem to have some of those anti-inflammatory properties and when you take them, you might be sleeping better. I mean, people take ibuprofen, they can also sleep a little bit better, because like it, it, those awakenings and arousals do to discomfort might be just a little bit less, and might help you sleep through the night a little bit more. There's a few things, but that's a difference, where just because something is not nothing, doesn't mean it is a cure all. It's like not black and white. A lot of these supplements can be helpful. I recommend them for all of the things that they do, but I also recommend them for none of the things that they don't do. And I think there's a gray area that I think people have a hard time wrapping their head around. Yeah, no, I've definitely not talking about insomnia, and some people just like to have a little bit of help, and glacing is interesting, that's when I've been interested in, and have you seen any of that thermal regulation stuff on that, like, even slower and more regulated stuff? Poor body pressure. It's seen, so it's unclear to me whether that's a cause or an effect. Right. But either way, does it matter? If that's what you're taking it for? It's more of a GABA and more of that inhibitory. Yeah, it does seem to promote those inhibitory. But so a lot of people who are taking work out supplements at night for recovery, like take one that's, if you're taking a meenows at night, brand-shayner amino acids in general could be good for recovery, especially after trading, and if it's got some extra glycine in it, all the better. But if it's got a lot of glutamine in it, you want to not be using that, because glutamine is activating. And so I mean, I've had athletes I've worked with who, like, complain, complained about their insomnia, turns out they're taking these nighttime supplements and the whole bunch of glutamine in it, and that's sort of what's counter, that's what's getting in their way. So it's not just about supplements at night that can be helpful, it's avoiding stuff, they can get on with, like, B12. B vitamins are good to take it night, because they can help with recovery. B12 helps boost the ability of light to suppress melatonin. You don't want to take that at night. You want to take that in the morning. B12 is great in the morning, so it can help wake you up a little more for a bunch of reasons, including its ability to help light suppress melatonin. But you don't want it at night when even a little bit of light can get and start getting in the way. Fascinating, so take your multivitamin in the morning, not in the evening. If I have this dream one day of having like an AM vitamin and an opium vitamin, where like some stuff might be better at night. Like if sleep is all about recovery and repair, put those raw materials in play at the time you want to use them. If they're going to degrade, or you can just take them in the morning, if they're going to hang out all day anyway. But yeah, I mean, some of the multivitamin you might want to take in the morning. Okay, let's talk about substances that affect sleep. This is another one. I mean, a lot of people, will get into CBD because that's like the biggest thing now. But I just hear it in peer groups. I hear it on the internet. I hear it in just everywhere, in the audience. Yeah. But kind of even a step ahead of that was marijuana, like which has CBD and THC. Right. They're two separate compounds. Right. And so I kind of want to start maybe with a THC. Like if someone's doing the whole thing. Yeah, it's basically a good place to start because THC seems to have pretty reliable effects on sleep. So, price is nobody who's used it when I say that. But it can help you fall asleep, can help you stay asleep, can help you feel more refresh, THC does. However, there's three downsides of THC. Four if you're an athlete. One is that the sleep promoting effects fade over time. Over time. So often, it works great for a period of maybe a few weeks. But then you'll notice that it stops working in the same way. And so people start escalating doses for that reason. And so maybe, you know, it's short-term benefits and long-term benefits are different. That's number one. Number two, in a lot of people, not those things need to be everybody, but in a lot of people can be a very potent REM sleep suppressor. Let me know, don't realize that anti-depressants also, most anti-depressants are potent REM suppressors. Like you can knock out 50 to 75% of all your REM sleep of the night by taking like Alexa Pro or an SSRI or THC. Does that affect memory? Because isn't REM important for, in format? We're weird, huh? Like, why is it? If REM sleep is so critically important, and we'll get to this when we talk about sleep stages on wearables, if REM sleep was so critically important for what it seems to do, why is it that when all these people who are taking anti-depressants are not falling down, not being able to remember things? Don't know. My hypothesis is, these processes are way more complicated they'll be realized. And when we see a decrease in REM sleep, what we're not seeing a decrease in the process itself, we're seeing a decrease in an effect of the process. And in a down, like, REM sleep, as these physiologic signals and brainwave patterns, maybe it's downstream of whatever's happening under the hood. And just because you don't hear the downstream signal anymore, it doesn't mean the thing wasn't still happening to some degree. But then again, with depressed people, if their ability to process information is fundamentally flawed, and because you're, I mean, when people are depressed, they see a neutral stimulus that feels negative to them. And it makes their life more miserable. Well, stop processing things emotionally then. Like, at least coming to neutral and blunting is better than, it's like, who knows? The answer is who knows? Is that a benefit? Is it impacting memory? Might that be part of what's going on in terms of THC's impacts on brain neurochemistry and some of the negative effects? Maybe? I don't think anyone's been able to take the time to study that pathway. So anyway, that's a second. The third one I just did want to mention is when you stop using THC, you get just like any kind of sedating medication, you get an insomnia rebound. And with that insomnia rebound, because it was a REM suppressor, you get a REM rebound. So you can get vivid nightmares and like really unpleasant dreams. And the worst insomnia you've ever had. So then you're like, I need to take this or else by insomnia comes back. When the insomnia was over with draw symptom. So, so like, so that, so you can become dependent on it. Well, well, it's like a logical, so where it's just like you get that tolerance. So like you're taking it and you're sleeping sort of normal and then when you take it away, you're in somnier Ramsup, but then it'll usually fade back to baseline. It was just a reaction. But you don't know that. You think that you're using the THC to keep the bad it's on the away when really, whenever you pull that bandaid off, it's going to hurt for a little bit. But then it'll be fine. And then the only other thing I was going to mention for athletes is the increased injury risks due to THC because of the amodivation and the coordination stuff that you get sometimes that like whatever your sleep problem is. If you're thinking of using THC for it, there's probably a better option. That's less harmful. But is that if they're using the THC at night, is it the THC directly affecting the coordination or is it the indirect effect of... I don't know, I'm asleep. All I know is that people who are using it more, I mean, we don't have great data on the timing of use. That would be a cool, cool study to do. But it just does seem to be that there's more injuries, there's more, there's the daytime amodivation, there's the, and able tovation being like not just like, the stone or sitting around like, I don't want to do anything all day. But if you're an athlete on the field, you need every split second to make these choices to be paying attention to be thinking ahead and all that stuff. And if you've got just a fraction of a piece of a cloud there. It gets in your way. And one wrong step, you know, could be twisting something. You know, I guess just one of those things of like, there's probably a better option out there. I mean, I'm just saying. But that's THC. So THC does have effects on sleep. They could be relatively short-term. They could produce a rebound when you stop taking it, and there could be remphets. And but having remphets doesn't sound like it's a good thing now. Maybe not. Is it, is it the same remphets as you get with an enterprise and it's not clear? It's murky, the literature is murky. You gotta remember, until very recently, researchers were almost not even allowed to study it because it was a scheduled substance. And you weren't, it was federally illegal. So anyone who takes federal money for research and is again, NIH is the lifeblood of all research. You were essentially forbidden from even studying it. Now we can sort of start and that work is being done. Canada started it because they legalized it first. So they're actually doing a lot of really great THC research up there. Watch the space. Next 10 years, I think more stuff is going to come out. Okay. What about CBD? CBD? Much more murky of a story. CBD is a legit molecule, especially in terms of the things that it does, but the sleep data from CBD are extremely murky. About half the studies that have used CBD have shown that it could benefit sleep. The other half don't. Some of them actually show that it makes sleep worse. The dose and the timing seem to matter. The individual differences seem to matter. It also seems, so it's one of those things where like, if I have a patient who says, should I try this? I would say, I'm having any objection to you doing it. I just don't have super high hopes and to be totally honest, most of the patients that I've had. So yeah, didn't really help. And or maybe help the little bit. It's also the difference between relaxation and sleep promotion. So if you have insomnia, little bit of relaxation isn't going to be enough. But if a little bit of relaxation is all you need, maybe it'll help. What kind of dose and timing are we talking about here? I don't know. Lower dose better. Yeah, it looks like there's a sweet spot for dose. You can have a dose that's too high, which can actually make sleep worse. But then again, if it's too low, then it won't be doing anything. I don't know all the doses in the different studies. So that's also why there's such murkiness in the literature where people are using different doses. Different combinations. Different times a day. I don't have any clear answers about CBD except I would keep. I would keep an open mind with it, but expectations in check. How does it work? Does it just reduce anxiety? Is it like an elthianine kind of thing? Yeah, it's from a sleep perspective. It doesn't. I haven't seen any strong data that shows that it does much to sleep wake regulation itself. That it's a fax on sleep or usually secondary through anxiety and stress. I could be wrong. I am not like there are people who know way more about cannabis and sleep than me. But from what I've seen, it seems to be going through that indirect path. And does it affect sleep architecture at all? Does it have the REM stuff? I haven't seen anything that shows that it does in the same way. I mean, it's like most of the studies show it doesn't do much of anything to sleep anyway. So unlike THC. Yeah. OK. Another one that people use to help them self-sufficiency is alcohol. Yeah. I mean, that's like. Alcohol is probably the most do-sleep drug in the world. Right. So the thing about alcohol, alcohol, it would surprise nobody to tell you that alcohol can make you fall asleep faster. And actually sleep a little bit deeper in the very beginning of the night. But the thing about alcohol is, sorry for the fact that it's not good for you for all kinds of reasons, it gets out of your system very quickly, metabolize it relatively quickly. And so what often happens with alcohol is, when the alcohol leaves your system, it creates activation. It creates a rebound. So often when people are drinking to fall asleep, they fall asleep fast, but then they wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. I mean, anyone who's had sort of too much to drink and fall in a sleep will they have that experience where you wake up and you're in your up. And you're just like, oh, I don't want to be up, but you're not falling back asleep. And it's because the alcohol creates that reaction. One of the reasons it does that is as the alcohol molecule metabolizes and becomes acid aldehyde, it can become a neural stimulant. The acid aldehyde could become acetate, which could become a neural stimulant. And as the liver is processing the alcohol, it can create a glutamine rebound, which can be activated. So like there's all these things that can end up being activated from the alcohol couple hours in. That's also why it's not a great sleep aid. I mean, a glass of wine after dinner is not going to, for almost everybody is not going to be that big of a deal. But if you're drinking enough where it's making you sleepy, that's how much it's going to be waking you up later, probably. Do you think timing it earlier helps like if it's your hot? So if you've viewed earlier than your, if you're having wine at dinner and then you still got a few hours, alcohol is probably out of your system by the time you get to bed. The only thing you don't want is to time it so that the activating part of the alcohol being out of your system is it when you're going to bed? So like that's sort of a tricky part too, but usually to be honest, the amount that most people are drinking, it's really not, that's not so much the issue. But what's really cool is that you can see, if you drink before going to bed, which great is some of the newer wearables, like you they pick it up right away. You see that heart rate data, you see that that lack of recovery happening. It was still a toxin that your processing. And I've had a number of patients come in thinking like, well, I used to drink some wine before going to bed and I thought that would mellow me out. And then I looked at my wearable date and realized, it made my sleep crappy. It made my sleep terrible. And so I stopped. And so getting that feedback can sometimes be helpful. Yeah, no, I mean, I, I'm gonna talk about wearables. Yeah, well, I definitely get into that. Okay, I mean, any other of these, there's caffeine we could talk about. Yeah, I mean caffeine probably the most used psychoactive substance in the world. There's a reason why people use it. It works, it's relatively safe. Coffee is actually a great source of antioxidants and phenols, especially if you're actually just, if you're drinking it from coffee, not just the isolated caffeine molecule, it picks up peaks at around 30-ish minutes and trails off for most people four to six hours before bed is the last time they should be caffeinating in any way. Some people they can drink and espresso go to bed just fine. People metabolize it differently. For some people tend to 12 hours is actually too much where they need to stop in the morning or else. There's just just enough floating around their system in the evening where they're not like jittery from caffeine, they just might have a harder time settling in. So that's a real thing. People can actually, because doesn't caffeine shift your circadian rhythm over as well. It's not a circadian signal as much as it can be like an alerting signal, at which can change your activity rhythm, which is more of the circadian signal. I don't think, I don't know, I haven't seen anything. I could be wrong, but I haven't seen anything with caffeine itself as a potent circadian marker, except that if you drink caffeine around the same time every day, you can make it one. And it increases activity, which is itself a circadian marker. I thought there was one study maybe. Maybe, and it was like they were giving men kind of caffeine, it was like nighttime, like close evening. And I think it somehow shifted there. My mind, my mind. 45 minutes or so. Like it might have shifted. Well, my guess is it would have shifted, it would have delayed, they would probably increase the activity level, increase their exposure. Yeah, it's delayed every five and a half. So, yeah, so that's why I like, it delayed sleep on set, but I don't know what it did to endogenous circadian timing. But I don't have to look, I don't remember, I don't remember a paper looking at, so like in my world, there's a difference between behavioral rhythms and circadian rhythm. Because there's like a circadian patterning, but like if did the melatonin rise at the normal time, it just got blunted because of the light you turned on and the activity you were engaging in, for example. Right, yeah. Yeah, so I just, I never, doesn't, does caffeine not do anything to sleep architecture if someone drinks? Yeah, I mean, like it'll, I mean, increases fast frequency eG activity. So it'll make your sleep shallower, so it'll probably, I mean, I have to look at the literature, but like if I had to make a prediction, my guess is it would dramatically reduce slow asleep and deep sleep because you can't, you can't get into that stage if your brain's sort of still wired and active. So for those people to say, I can drink a cup of coffee and then go to bed 30 minutes later. I may be opting to sleep, but it might be, it might be, but also, again, people, there's huge variability in how people metabolize caffeine also. So some people might be more resistant to it, some people like, I'd be, for those people, I would really be curious to see their data. Yeah, I mean, what's the quickest you could metabolize caffeine though? I mean, I don't know, or I probably, I mean, no, that's when it's peaking. Right, like I don't know. They would never feel it. Or maybe, or maybe just the way it interacts with the denocene is different, or maybe they're just so sleepy, their sleep drive is so high. It's the way a denocene is interfacing with their sleep wake because a denocene itself isn't sedating. It builds across the day and interfaces with that system. But the denocene itself, like you can't like take a denocene and fall asleep, like that's not how it works. So baby, differing, you know, humans are humans, we're all different. And you know, are wired, some of the sometimes some people their system might be hooked in in a different way. You're talking about like one person here and a person there and like out like getting 20 of them to come into the lab all at the same time and look at a systematic evaluations. I don't know that anyone's ever really done to be honest. Right. It's more like clinical work, I could do this and sleep fine. And I've seen people who drink coffee at night and their sleep looks fine. So like, who knows? Another one that I've talked about with Dr. Sachin Panda, who's up in on the podcast a few times, is late night eating. Yeah. And obviously food is a substance. Yeah. And at least with my conversations with Sachin, it seems like a good sort of on average time to stop eating before you go to bed seems to be at least like three hours. Yeah. So before you go to bed, how does food affect sleep? Yeah. I mean, so he is the world's leading expert on that, on that issue of the timing and he tells these incredible stories about how just the cellular machinery of transporting glucose fuel into the cell is partially clock dependent. And from the first bite of the day, once that machinery starts, it has a certain window of maximum efficiency that just that only fades. Like it's fascinating work. But as a psychologist, I have other perspectives on this as well. Where a lot of times people don't eat at night for metabolic reasons. They're eating at night for emotional reasons. They eat at night because they feel like it helps them line down. They eat at night because they're stressed. And what's interesting is when you in a sleep deprivation study, if you take somebody and you sleep deprived them, they're going to number a size of it did this. And they look to see what calories they're consuming. And on average, people tend to consume about 350 to 600 extra calories per 24 hours when you sleep deprived them in the lab. Not in the morning, if anything, the little bit less first thing in the morning, not in the middle of the day, not snacking, not dinner, but after dinner. That's when all the snacking, the extra snacking, seems to occur. Especially when people are kept up, pass the point that their body wanted to go to sleep. So if you're up and all of a sudden, and it's getting late and all of a sudden, you're really hungry. You probably should have been in bed already. That was your brain telling you, what are you doing up still? I guess you're going to have to have another meal. If you're going to keep going bug, because you're supposed to be a bed already. I was done. We checked out. Like, are we doing another shift or what? So there's reasons for this, but people start craving, for a lot of years, people in the sleep room were talking about, is it carbs, is it fat, is it, I just think it's energy. People are craving energy. They're craving calorie dense food. They're craving pleasurable food. Food that feels good to eat, a pile of palatable food. And especially, sort of like the later it might get. I mean, there's a reason why people generally don't crave a salad at 2 o'clock in the morning. Even if they would during the day, it's your thinking and your emotional reason and your choices are fundamentally different, especially between 2 and 5 in the morning. That time seems especially vulnerable. In our lab, we're studying that vulnerable time. We're calling it the mind after midnight. Like, on how you make different choices in that zone. All kinds of bad things, like suicide spikes in that time. Four times greater than you would expect by chance than any other time of day. Spikes in that time. Bionic crime also spikes during that time for maybe different reasons. But unhealthy eating. Also, like 3 a.m. food. If I tell you, this is the kind of food you want to eat at 3 a.m., you know what kind of food I'm talking about. And it's not healthy food. Why is that? Why is that that there's this? And I don't think this is a pathological thing. I think this is a normal human function that when our brain is awake, when it wants to be asleep, especially when it's right there in that circadian dip of all kinds of other functions, it's this perfect storm of bad choices, where we, it's rewards seeking, but decreased reward processing. So we seek the thing that feels good, but it feels less good when we do it. So we seek it more. And our decision making is we're not thinking about tomorrow. This is also why people wake up in the middle of the night and they're all freaked out about stuff. And then in the morning, they look back and they think, ban, I was all worked up about that, but it's really not the end of the world. I can solve this problem. Our brains, when we're kept awake, when we don't want to be, that we're not our best self, and it applies to food too. So how does this apply to shift working? And people that have these irregular schedules? I mean, no, I don't know. I mean, we've known for years that, so like if you ask a circadian scientist, is shift work worse for you than smoking? They will usually have to stop and think, can be like, ha, good question. And then you're supposed to say, I didn't realize that was a hard question. I thought it was obvious that smoking is the worst thing ever. Like if you smoke, whatever else you do, it's the smoking, it's probably going to kill you. Shiftwork isn't good for you. Shiftwork is a problem. You know, we're the only species that shift works ourself on purpose. Like anyone who has a pet knows, like they might be up for a bit during the night, but not because they have to be. Because, you know, mammals sometimes sleep in bouts, and humans also are awake in the middle of the night for a certain amount of time. But, you know, it's forcing a square peg into a round hole, and there's consequences. Some people may be more resilient. People who are more night owls, they might be more amenable to taking a night shift as long as they're able to go home at four o'clock in the morning and go to sleep. People who are early birds might be more amenable to taking a night shift as long as they can sleep between like night 8pm and 2 in the morning. So for that, maybe it's not as extreme as shift work as it's not as extreme, but shift work in general. It's a known course of the genic. It increases diabetes risk, increases dementia risk, but shift work isn't good. But yet we live in a society that demands, someone's got a man in the phones, someone's got to drive the fire truck, someone's got to work the hospital, do all shift work occupations require shift work? I don't know, that's like do all factories need to run 24, seven, like I don't know. But it's a trade-off. There's this phenomenon in the hospital. I mean, it's just, that's the shift work that's closest to my life. Where someone brings the box of donuts at the start of the shift and no one touches them because everyone knows that like they're bad for you, but by the end of the shift they're all gone. Decision making it gets impaired, especially when, and what food is available in the middle than I do? Why would happen if we go into a shift working setting and set up palatable but healthy food? Why don't we have nighttime snacks that are just healthier, that feel good to eat, that satisfy those cravings, but just don't do the same kind of damage. And why don't we make those available? Oh no, I mean, I don't know why this isn't, why everyone isn't doing this. It seems obvious to me. Just don't buy the bad processed food stuff and don't have it in your house. That's a good solution to not have it available. For shift workers, is there any way they can use these strategic kind of napping strategies to improve? Yeah, so the first thing for shift work is if you can keep a reliable shift, if you wanna turn your day in tonight and make that permanent, that will actually minimize the damage. You're just in a different time zone. But if you stay in that time zone, it's the shifting around that causes, though it's the unsettling the system that causes the problem. So the more, the more infrequently you keep shifting. So those are the things that people have families and they don't stop doing it. Yeah, that's the problem. But anyways, so napping, napping can be great. Think of a nape like a snack, where our snacks good for you were bad for you. Well, it depends. Healthy snacks are great. A healthy snack in the middle of the day can health stay off hunger, increase your energy, increase your focus. Especially if it's kind of a healthy snack, high protein, some fiber, you don't maybe a little bit of sugar, something in there to make it palatable, but you don't wanna load it up with calories because you don't need them. Same thing with the nape. A nape on purpose, that is restricted in time. But you wanna wake up before you drop down into that deep sleep. If you wanna make it sort of like a power nap. And, remember, you're dropping down the stage. You wanna wake up before you drop into stage three sleep. Because how long would that nappy? So in the middle of the day it could be an hour. If the closer you get to where your body is trying to drop into it, that window shortons. So it could be just 15, 20 minutes. The later in the day. Sometimes you're gonna drop, like you shouldn't map when you're in your biological night, don't expect to nap because you're gonna drop straight into it. But the further out you are, the longer you can make it. And so that it can increase reaction time, increase focus, increase learning, increase training recovery. You can, there's data that shows like even in sleep deprived people, a decent nap in the middle of the day can dramatically improve metabolism, muscle strength, all this stuff. It can be, they can be great. And that's sort of a power nap. If you're napping all the time, it's like if you're snacking all the time. It's not the snack that's the problem. It's why are you snacking? There's also a different kind of nap that shift workers can use. And I call that a sleep replacement nap. It's like a meal replacement shake. We're no one looks at that and thinks that that looks like a meal. No one's confused that it's really a meal, but it does the trick in a pinch. And what a sleep replacement nap is. Athy's through this too when they, especially when they have late games and they have to wake up in the morning, college students do this one all the time where you go through a full cycle. You actually make it all, and you get a whole cycle of deep sleep, which does exactly what it does at night too. It's not quite as good, but it does the trick. And you want to wake up after you've made it all the way through. In the middle of the night, during your regular sleep period that'll take 90 to 100 minutes. During the day, it might take two to three hours to make it all the way through, because you're not expecting it. You have a system to protect yourself from dropping into deep sleep during the day. You're buying it as it won't there, because it's trying to protect you. But if you stay in your nap long enough, you're buying it like, all right, I guess we're doing this. And so it gets in it and you get all the way through. And if you wake up out of that feeling pretty good, that counts almost the same as night timeslee. It's just most people don't have the three hours in the day to do that. Shift workers do. And so they can do it like either like right after a shift or before a shift or something you can do that. Or even a strategic nap like while you're on a shift, you can get a little bit of a nap and be, sometimes be a bit of function. Sometimes you're too much in the middle of your biological night. And that one little nap, it's like you're starving and you only get one bite and sometimes that's a little worse. Just everyone's a little different. But think of a nap like a snack and use it strategically like you strategically use a snack to stay off hunger and to make it through a shift. OK, that's great. As long as you're not drinking a lot of coffee. Right. Well, that too, because then if you're a lot of times you could be drinking a lot of caffeine on your shift, but then you get home and you can't sleep. Right. And which makes you more tired on your next shift. So how should shift workers use coffee? Strategically. I mean, you should use it as think of it as I will drink coffee in about 30 minutes. It'll have its peak effectiveness. And I end about six for at least the next six hours I will not be in a sleep window. And so the higher the dose, the longer that window goes. So what you might want to like caffeinate at the start of the shift, but not in the second half. OK, that makes sense. I want to kind of shift and talk about jet lag. And we're talking a little bit about this sort of strategic timing of melatonin, if I was going to. And like, right and light. But I've heard you talk about jet lag in a way where you've talked about like when you get on a plane and you're going somewhere to a different time zone. Yeah. As soon as you get on the plane, you need to mentally be in that time zone that you're going to be in. So I'd love for you to kind of walk us through, like how does this relate? Let's say you're going to the east versus the flying east word versus west word. Yeah. Like I'm going to be going to China soon. A 17 hour difference from that. I mean, how am I going to get to that time zone? So yeah, let's talk a little bit about how can we help ourselves adjust to the new time zone if you're only going somewhere for a day or two, should you try to adjust or more? So mostly, the answer to that question is like mostly now. Travelling a couple of time zones is totally different than traveling a bunch of time zones. It's like going to China or going to Europe is very from the west coast, US anyway, is very different than going from New York to LA. New York to LA, it's a few hours. And you'll adjust within a couple days. You could adjust probably within two to three days. You're probably fine. Travelling that far, the circadian literature would say that it takes about an hour per day to adjust. Obviously, faster going west, little slower going east. But when you're 10 to 15 times zones away, like what is Dave's four versus day 12 look like? You're not going to slowly adjust. It's going to be in, it's going to be jerky. So what I would say is when you get on that plane, think of yourself as having had maybe just a very short day. I like sleep depriving myself a little bit before these long flights. And you get on the plane. I like to try and schedule my flights so that it would be great if I challenge your epithesia to do this where you time the flight so that it lands in the morning local time. So you're taking off in the afternoon from the US. And it might be three, four, five, six in the afternoon. But you're landing at 10 a.m. local time. So as soon as I get on that plane, I'm like, OK, it's nighttime. I have this eight hour, eight, nine hour flight. This is my night. So I'm going to have crappy sleep. I'll sleep, trust sleep on the plane when I can. I got my earplugs. Got my I'm asked. Got my melatonin. Got like, you know, whatever. I will do whatever I can to catch a little bit of sleep on the plane. I'll have a crappy fragmented night of sleep on the plane. Land the morning local time. Wake up. I'll make it through my day just fine. I'll power through the day. Because my sleep's generally good beforehand. So I'll be pretty resilient. Make it through the day. I will be exhausted by nighttime local time. And I'm essentially brute forcing my sleep wake home in the Osteasis. Even though I'm essentially my circadian rhythm is way off. But I'm tired when I want to be asleep. And I am awake when I want to go around during the day. And I'm getting the light exposure during the day. And I've spent a lot of time outdoors when I travel. And so I'm sort of brute forcing it a little bit. It's like, I'm not going to be fully adjusted. And maybe if I'm there for a week, I will be. But those first few days, I mostly make myself sleepy when I want to be unconscious at night when it's dark, even though my body thinks it's daytime. And be awake when the sun is out and be moving and don't nap. I do not nap for that reason. Because I would be, it's sort of like, if you're taking a snack, if you're going to have a light snack, don't have it be at the end of time because that snack is going to be miserable. Because then you're going to wake up and you will have dropped into deep sleep. And so. So no naps when you're when you're traveling. Yeah, I would. Especially as you're still in the adjusting period, don't give yourself mixed signals. But try and if the, and if traveling to Asia is more complicated because the fight's so much longer. But think of it as local time. Think of when you're going to land, when do you want to wake up before you? It could be a few hours off. That's that's probably fine to adjust to. But like, you know, if your flight is going to be landing say like in the afternoon, but you're going to be taking off like the day before or whatever on the clock. Think of it as you're going to be landing the next day. Have some crappy sleep on the plane. The other thing that will help is planes are slightly hypoxic of an environment. And oxygen rhythms, actually there's some great data. There's there's there's there's there's a lab in Israel that's been working on this especially showing oxygen itself is a circadian signal because oxygen dips during the night when you're asleep. So being in a slightly hypoxic environment for extended period of time, it's easier to trick your body into thinking it's nighttime than it's daytime. And then as soon as you leave the plane and they open the door and now it's normalxic again, that can be an alerting signal. So timing it that way is also helpful. What about exercise? Exercise is a awakening signal. So there's not much exercise you can do on the plane without annoying everybody at least I guess. But as soon as you get off the plane, that's a great time to be moving because you want to send that daytime daytime daytime signal, even though you're in your biological night. Say no, no, no, it's daytime daytime and get light suppressed whatever natural melatonin you have, take the melatonin at night to, because you might still be producing some of the melatonin during your biological night, which is the environmental day, and not producing that melatonin at night when you want to be. So that's when you might supplement. Yeah, which is why being outside is so important during the day when it's your biological night. Yes. Great, all right. Well, that's the thing with jet lag. Send yourself a daytime signal when you want your body to think it's daytime. Send yourself a nighttime signal when you want it to think that it's night. And so you can block light as the daytime signal. So give light as a daytime signal or an use melatonin is the nighttime signal. So no sunglasses in the morning. Right. Yeah, or if you're going to use sunglasses, make them kind of blue tinted. So even if it's even if like it's blocking the UV or whatever, at least the light, so it's the blue green frequency of light that sends information to the clock. That's why the orange lens is block it. But where like a blue or green or tinted sunglasses, if you're going to wear sunglasses in the morning? So that actually works where you can see it. There's no data on this. I just made that up. But it should work because as long as you're getting that frequency of light, it's the blueish greenish light that sends the information to the clock. But it's also, I live in Arizona. Some to sunglasses, if you don't want macular degeneration, you need to wear sunglasses when you're outside. So how do you get enough light to influence the clock without doing retinal damage? And so that's why, I love to see data on this. I don't know that anyone's actually studied this if they have. I'd love to see it, but that's my hypothesis. Yeah, because I would imagine like you were saying earlier, obviously the early morning light, it's not as damaging so you play the meat sunglasses then. But you're talking about being outside long hours during the day and how that also protects you from the blue light in hitting melatonin later. You want the blue light to inhibit melatonin. Right, sorry. Where it. In the morning, you want it to. Exactly. And the evening you don't want it. Yes. OK. So let's talk about where we do have a lot of data. And this is definitely an area that you're an expert in as well. And that is these sleep tracking devices. Yeah. Lots of them out there, or the woop. What do we have? Apple Watch, the Fitbit, and Pixel. You and I are both on the scientific advisory for the Google. We love which is where we first met. But I want to know what metrics do you think are truly good at seeing captured accurately, and which ones should we interpret with caution? Yes, excellent question. People need to know that using wrist-based movement to estimate whether someone was asleep or awake across a night has been around since the 1970s. That data has been well worked out. Those algorithms are pretty robust. It's actually shockingly good. You can predict with about 90% accuracy using movement alone. And this was analog devices with that we're on a tape back up or eventually 64 kilobytes of memory on the whole watch. With that level of technology, you could get over 90% accuracy minute to minute, where you awake, or where you probably asleep relative to brainwave activity. A sleep versus wake. That's what these devices are. Best at. They've always been best at. That is the data that I would trust the most with the asterisk of it's going to be different from the brainwave activity and that the brainwave activity will pick up lots of little awakenings that the movement detection probably won't. So it will underestimate wake time relative to looking at brainwave activity. But it will overestimate wake time versus yourself report. So if I asked you how much you slept and you said seven hours and you're watching six and a half, that's not a problem. You're measuring two different things. Because the watch is probably picking up awakenings that you don't remember. So were you physiologically awake during that time? Probably could it have picked up stuff erroneously? Yeah, maybe. Were you awake during that? I'm probably. Does it matter? Probably not. So because all of the guidelines and recommendations, the seven hours of sleep guidelines, I was on one of the panels. I was on the ASM and SRS, the CD, the panel funded by the CDC to develop time recommendations. We were there in the room. We were arguing over this. And those recommendations are not based on wearable data. They're based on an average how much sleep do you feel like you get? Because that is what's correlated with the health outcomes. The wearable data is a lot more murky in terms of its correlation with the health outcomes. It's different. So if you're targeting a certain amount of sleep, based on guidelines, the wearable data can fall under that and you're totally fine. Like up to maybe an hour even under that and you're totally fine. So that's, I trust it to be correct and accurate for what it is. But it doesn't mean it's measuring the same thing. And so I expect it to be a little different. So that's, and that is what it's best at. The heart rate data are also really good. Separate world in that the heart, you know, photo-pluff isography for getting heart rate data. That science is really well developed. And you know, you can get really good heart rate data with pretty good resolution from the wrist and even from the finger. You can get pretty good heart rate data. So yeah, terms of the other stuff. There's sort of two levels of other stuff. One is the sleep staging data. And the other one is other metrics like recovery or readiness or sleep score, and all that sort of stuff. The sleep staging data. It's a ballpark. It's actually better than a lot of sleep people assume that it is in terms of its level. It's probably between 60 and 80% accurate. So it's not nothing. It's also not perfect, but it's also not garbage. Like it's helpful. It's probably ballpark correct. Kind of remember what sleep stages are. We were looking at different patterns of brainwave activity. And then in 1930s, people looked at these squiggly lines on paper and put them into four buckets. And then it became five, and it was back to four. Just, are you stage one, two, three, or REM, based on the pattern of squiggly lines. This is human's radiance. They exist in nature. No, we made them up. This is how humans categorize stuff. Based on patterns of brain activity on the outer layers of the cortex that are fluctuating during sleep. The fact that you can look at heart rate fluctuations in combination with movement and get a really good estimate about which state of brainwave patterns you happen to be in at that moment, even though two humans can't always agree but looking at the same squiggly lines is that stage one or stage two? Is that REM? Is that REM where did they drift into stage two or stage one at this point? Yeah, it looks kind of similar. I'll call it REM. I'll call it stage two. You see this all the time. This is why we don't even use AI yet to rate these things because humans don't trust them because they can't even agree with each other. There's no gold standard that equally can even train all of these AI's against because even the humans can agree. So it's a moving target anyway. It's the fact that you can get that close from this stuff on the wrist. I think it's a miracle, but you gotta keep your expectations in check. It's like playing two games of telephone going in opposite directions and using the result of one game of telephone to guess not what the source was but what the other game of telephone came up with. So the fact that they're even in the same ballpark I think is great and useful. But what that also means is, don't read too much into it. If it shows very little deep, first of all, I can't distinguish stage one and stage two at all so they call it light, and usually. And as I mentioned before, those are very different things. If you have a lot of stage one, that's bad because you're super super shallow. You have a lot of stage two, that's normal. That's what it should be most of what sleep is. And the deep sleep detection is only about 60 to 70% accurate at best in most people. So when people say like it's not showing, I'm getting enough deep sleep. They're saying, well, the algorithm is in picking it up. It doesn't mean you're not getting it. And be, if you weren't, as long as there's no barrier to your body of tin, if you don't have untreated sleep app near a chronic pain or an environmental stimulation to prevent that deep sleep from occurring, we're drinking alcohol or whatever. Your body is doing whatever it wants to do. So if it doesn't want to take more because as people get older, they take less anyway, growing people, healing and recovering people, usually need more. But if you're not getting it, A does it matter and B, how do I know you're not getting it? And so it's, you gotta interpret it with that caution. So that's the caution with the sleep stages. If I show you a brainwave tracing of sleep stages and a wearable tracing, that you can, you could, if it's a good device, you can easily tell, these are the same person on the same night, if you looked at them. But if you actually counted the exact number of minutes, you would probably find that 20 to 30% at least of those minutes didn't exactly agree with each other. But you can tell visually. That's why clinically I look at it visually. I don't actually count the minutes because I don't depend on it. And actually one night of data is at worth much. It's more about the weekly trend or like trending and changing over time. That's what I care about. So that's the sleep stage of data. The third bin is the metrics like the scores with very few exceptions. Most of those scores are, I give almost no attention to those. I can be ungenerous and say they're mostly made up nonsense anyway. Can you repeat what scores we're talking about here? I'm talking about anything that's called like sleep score, sleep quality, sleep needs, sleep readiness, recovery, any of that stuff. If I'm being ungenerous, I'm saying it's mostly made up nonsense to sell devices, because telling people what they want to hear. But there's not the truth either. They're not nothing. They have a lot of these companies, not all of them, but allow these companies have smart people working for them who are not idiots, who know how to work with the data and are trying to make prediction algorithms are actually useful. Thing is, none of these things are published. None of these things have been vetted. None of these things, it's kind of like at the trust us level of like, well, how do I know what you're putting in your algorithm and how to interpret those numbers? So like, if I drink alcohol that I'd be for, but I'm otherwise totally healthy, and the number looks bad, should I worry or not? Is it actually impairing my ability to perform or not? Or is it look like it is because of how the algorithms using heart rate data? I don't know because none of its transparent and forget the transparent. I know Google did a study on the, that was a Google's Fitbit before it was Google, I think, where they had their sleep score, and they correlated the actual global sleep score to outcomes and they presented the data at a conference. As a global thing, I don't think they ever really followed up with it, but I don't know that that's, even that baseline level of, is this correlated with anything remotely useful? Is a step that, I mean, that they did, but I don't know that anyone else has ever really done that much. So as the literature's coming out, as more and more people are using these metrics and seeing what's it related to, what's it not related to? What is it predict reliably? What is it predict unreliably? What is it not predict at all, even though a thing's it does? As a researcher, you give me a number, I don't know what to do with it. Unless I can, unless I understand how it works. So I guess what I'm saying is, I don't trust these numbers almost at all. I almost 100% of the time completely ignore them because they don't give me any information I can use because I don't know what they mean. And at worst, they're made up, but at best they're really good educated guesses made with assumptions that I don't totally know so I don't know what to make of it. I mean, I'm trying to be fair and not throw them all under the bus. They probably aren't useless. They probably have value and they're probably not all incorrect either. It's just, you gave me a number and I don't know what to do with it. So I was gonna ask you what the biggest misconception about these wearable devices, you kind of wanted people to know right now and I'm thinking maybe this. Yeah, that's the big one. I think the biggest misconception is that accuracy matters. It's not about are they accurate or not accurate to relative to what? Accurate relative to your memory of the night or accurate relative to the physiology, those predictive different things. And even if it is accurate relative to the physiology, does the number give you a useful metric that you can actually use to do anything with it? What do you wanna do with that information? And you're gonna make the decisions based on it. You better know what it is. And I feel like a lot of companies, like they're stuck in a bind because if they're too transparent with their algorithms other people are just gonna copy and scam patting an algorithm. So what are you gonna do? How do you maintain your competitive advantage? And that's a line to walk. And as these companies, they're just gonna try and come up with better metrics and better metrics as a researcher and as a scientist and as someone who cares about public health who has family members who ask you what to do with this information, give me the data I need to make choices to make it in form choice of what to do with this information. So that's probably a big misconception is that these numbers are what they say they are. Okay. Well, well let's talk about actionables then. How can you practically advise people that are watching or listening to this to use their data? What data can we use and how can they make it actionable? Excellent question. So another saying that I should be to a colleague of mine, Amy Athey who's a sports psychologist who's a colleague of mine and she's helped me a lot on a lot of sleep stuff. And I was explaining this wearable stuff to her and as we were developing our own trainings with this. And she came up with this way of thinking about it as a bathroom scale is not a weight loss program. And just because these are measurement tools, measurement tools are not interventions. People, if you're buying this to give you information to make a change and you don't know what to do with the number that's giving you, how is it gonna make a change? You know just because it gives you a number which is because it's a bathroom scale that has an app and has all kinds of other metrics in it. Doesn't mean it's giving you useful information that you know what to do with. So the way the first thing in terms of creating actionable steps out of this is first to realize that it's spitting you out of number it's measuring something. To make it in a form choice of what to do it that information, you have to know what that number means. So first is I got to teach you a little bit about what these numbers mean and what these numbers don't mean. Then just like when you see the amount of sleep you got, what does that number mean? Does it mean a meeting guidelines or not? No, doesn't mean that. But does it, if I see it over time, if I see I'm usually hitting six and a half, six and a half, but today I was at five, what happened? It's like that is the number it's probably best at. So if I'm gonna make a decision based on wearables, the first number I'm looking at is the how much sleep did I get and where did it detect the awakenings because those were probably correct, especially if they were more than a couple of minutes. And are there discrepancies between what my memory of the night was and what the device found? And in those discrepancies might be some wisdom. So sometimes people within Somnia feel like they were up all night, but they actually got more sleep than they thought because they were up and down. So they could use the wearable device to sort of destress a little bit and find the sleep that they may not remember. On the flip side, if it's detecting awakening, if you're trying to figure out why you're tired, then you feel like you slept okay, you can look at the device and say like, oh, I see what's that. Like I'm up and down a lot, or the night, this seems very fragmented. No wonder why I feel kind of, it's like you use that information. So like the continuity data, the wake of versus sleep data can be used for all kinds of things that might not even be totally conventional. That's what I'm looking at the heart rate data sleep stages data. Then I'd look at the heart rate. Heart rate should start relatively low in the evening compared to your resting and it should be dropping. And then at some point, you should have an inflection point where it sort of starts picking up again, probably around three or four in the morning. When a lot of people wake up around that time, maybe you're just kind of sensitive to that shift in your circadian rhythm where your daytime is starting up and as some people get older, they might be more sensitive to it. Or you might have a natural awakening around that time, but you don't have the same sleep pressure to get back to sleep. So also in that heart rate data, so like if it's staying, if your heart rate staying high during the night, what's going on? If it's not dropping, what's going on? If it's rising during the night, what's really going on? If you see your heart rate data looks normal, and you have a couple of periods of intense fluctuation, what's going on in those periods of time? They might give you some insight that there's something under the hood that's causing activation that's going on. If you see your sleep stages, irrespective of what it gives you, if it shows that they're highly variable across the night, something's up. If it's putting deep sleep in the second half of your night, something's up, if it's putting a big bout of REM sleep, and you're first three or four hours of the night, something's up, it doesn't belong there. Could be, but it's unlikely. And if anything that tells me that, I don't know what's going on under the hood, but something is apparent there, not that your sleep stages are in the wrong place, but that the algorithm is finding them where they don't belong. And so why? Well, what's the algorithm? Use it. If it's using movement and heart rate, it means there's something unusual going on with your movement and your heart rate in that time where it doesn't belong. And then you could start thinking about what that is. Could that be sleep-happening and you're jerking around or something, or you have limb movements, or maybe it's a bed partner who keeps rolling over or making noise. So it might give you a window into, I was in conscious during this time, but something was going on during that time, and then you can start looking into what that could be. So let's say someone is like their heart rate isn't dropping like it's supposed to, or what sort of things can people do to try to help with that? Yeah, so first I would look to see is there anything chemically in the way? Is there all cause their medication that you're taking at night that you should be moving earlier in the day, for example? I actually see this not uncommonly where people have trouble with sleep because of medication that is perfectly acceptable to prescribe in the evening is being taken in the evening is just your sensitive to it in a different way. So I see this a lot. So first see if there's something chemical or if you're eating, you're eating a food that's too metabolically active, too close to bedtime. Or you caffeinated too late. Yes, it was four hours ago, but it was still too late and it's still hanging around in there. Or something like that. Or you have something, something active going on. So like do you need, is there a pain issue going on? Is there some inflammation going on? Is your mattress 10 years old and needs to get replaced? Is just uncomfortable and is creating too much activation during the night? You know, there's all kinds of reasons for that. And then if not, what's your relaxation, wind down routine like, why is your heart, are you exercising too late? And your core body temperature and your heart rate is high because of what you happen to be doing, where it's not dropping, why not? Or maybe you need to introduce some more relaxation techniques and to the evening, whether it's physical relaxation, like breathing exercises or stretching or yoga stuff or mental stuff like, you know, there's imagery exercises and other stuff in body scans or mindfulness exercises and meditation or like a mind body approach, like like on a huge fan of progressive muscle relaxation, where it's especially done right and false both. Maybe you're going to bed too hot and you need to chill out a little bit first whether it's mentally physically or both. What about, I know we talked about the accuracy of these sleep state being able to measure sleep stages anywhere between maybe 60 to 80% which isn't terrible. No, it's not terrible, but it's nothing too, but it's not called standard either. No, it's not called standard. But, you know, let's say that someone is, we're not just talking about a night but we're talking about weekly, like months, like we're seeing it consistent pattern of not getting enough either deep or REM sleep. Right, and so the way I would interpret that is, you may or may not be not getting enough, but you're definitely exhibiting a pattern where the algorithm is saying you're not getting enough. Why is it the problem with the algorithm? Is it a problem with maybe you are getting it, but there's something in the peripheral system that is like maybe your heart rate is just too variable and it's not picking up for other reasons or something. I would say the way I do this is, just like the breathing example, where it's like, if you're having trouble breathing, okay, do you have a problem with your lungs? You have lung disease of any kind. Let's figure out what that is, treat it. Okay, lungs are fine. Do you have an airway disease? You have asthma, you have airway inflammation. That could be interfering with your ability of your lungs to be transferring oxygen correctly. Are those fine? If we'll identify any problems there, fix them. Okay, that's fine. Okay, well, is your air vary polluted in that case? In that case, maybe you need an air purifier. So from a sleep perspective, it's, is there anything physically that's preventing you from getting deep sleep if you wanted it? Do you have some sort of systemic inflammation going on? Do you have untreated sleep apnea? Do you have chronic pain? Do you have some, are you taking a medication that could be suppressing this? Like, is there something that's a physical barrier? Let's go down the list and rule them out. Because if there's something preventing you from getting deep sleep, let's get it out of the way. Let's unprevent it. Let's treat that condition. If there isn't, and we still see that there, then it's like, okay, well, maybe it's environmental. Do you have, is your room too hot? Is your bed too uncomfortable? Is your spouse too snoring too loud? Or roll it over too much? Are you just too sensitive to light? Do you live on a street where you're asleep, but there's still cars driving by and that's creating this? Like, is there something in your environment? If we go through with somebody and their environment is fine, their sleep continuity is fine, their falling asleep fine, their sleeping through the night, there's no medical reason that's preventing them from getting deep sleep at all. My perspective on it is, don't worry about it. Your body's doing what it wants to do on its terms. If it wanted more, if it needed, more, it would take it, but it doesn't. So forcing it may or may not be a good thing anyway. Well, this is kind of leads into the next question, which is the pitfalls of these sleep tracking devices. And I've known several people that have fallen into this pitfall. And that is obsessing over their sleep data, which may not fall into what they want it to be, or think it should be. And that actually causing sleep, because they're just obsessed with it. And I've heard you refer to this as worth of Somnia. Yeah, yeah. So that was a term developed and meant by a colleague of mine Kelly Barron. She's at the University of Utah. She's like me, she's studied sleep and sleep health and wearable and stuff. And so she came up with this idea, putting a name to what we would see in clinic of people who overly fixated on the data, to the point of sort of like orthorexia, was the idea, where people are obsessing over food ingredients. Where it's like, you're missing the point here. You know, like the degree of information that these data are giving you is not the level of precision you should be using that could even give you to be obsessing to this level of detail. These are rough estimates that's a fuzzy picture at best. It's a fuzzy picture that's probably true, but it's still a fuzzy picture. So, because you see things in there that might not be perfect, doesn't mean they're not fine. And sleep doesn't have to be perfect to be perfectly fine. So, as you're talking about condition or arousal, what do you think is gonna happen when you start obsessing in bed over your sleep metrics? You're gonna start developing arousal and so orthosomniac can be a precipitant to insomnia. And it's gonna make your sleep worse and then you're gonna worry about it more. Actually, for a lot of those people, a lot of times we'll just take it off. Let's take it off. It's not, it's a net loss for you. It's not a net game, but I want, but I want, you know what? You can't handle it, truth, I guess. It's sort of like, let me teach you how to be happy with the sleep you're getting. Then you can put the device back on and you're approaching it from a place of happiness and you know your sleep is fine. And this is just giving you more information. It's not, and you know your sleep is fine. As opposed to relying on this information for what it can't give you. It can't give you those answers. We don't have that level of precision. So there's nothing worth worrying about. I mean, at least, I mean, if you're, the way I think of this way, if your device is giving you information, you think it's bad news, come see someone like me. We will probably, I'll look at your wearable data, but most people in my world don't even do that. They don't look at your rubisix, they don't care. If you have a problem with your sleep, I will ask you the questions I need to ask, do the tests I need to do to figure out what that problem is and use all the tools I have to fix that problem, irrespective of whatever your wearable sets. And if that wearables got you into the clinic in the first place to say, hey, I thought my sleep was okay, but this, but now I'm a little worried about it. I will say, okay, well, I'll tell you if you need to worry. Well, I'll ask some questions, figure out what's going on. Sometimes I'll say like, you know what? You have what we call normal, and I can't fix normal. I might be able to optimize a little bit. Can work on that. And actually, destressing your sleep is more impaired because of the stress around your sleep than anything else that you're doing. It sounds much like the stimulant negative stimulus. Yeah. And so often that's the case. So like if you're looking at, if you're looking at your wearable data and you're not happy with what you see, if there is a problem that needs to be fixed, come to a sleep specialist, we will find the problem we'll fix it. If there is no problem to be fixed, if you're within the normal range, a sleep clinician is probably not going to fix it. It's not going to have anything to fix for you. You might have to come to somebody who has a little more experience with optimization, if you really want it. If your question isn't, is this bad, but could it be better, then you might need to go to somebody who has more experience on the performance side who can read those numbers, read those TVs and say, yeah, no, this is totally fine. I couldn't make these numbers better if I wanted to, or we could do something about this. Let's talk about making these numbers better. And I know that we've kind of talked, we've touched on it a little bit. So you tell me, like if there's more information that you want to share about it, but like using sleep as a cognitive performance enhanced, you talked a little bit about this. Yeah, I mean, think of sleep as sleep should be a choice. Sleep should be a friend. Sleep is what helps you face the next day with as much resources and resilience as possible that a colleague of mine Teresa Aurora, she led this project that I also helped on. We looked at, we basically scoured the entire medical literature on resilience and sleep. Because everyone talks about not getting good sleep as bad, but is getting good sleep good. And basically what we found was cross the board, people, if you can sleep better, your resilience will improve. You can improve your level of resilience, whether it's physical or most sure whatever. It was very, it was to find however the study, whatever the study defined it. Any study, if you improve your sleep, you could improve your degree of resilience. You could improve your reaction time. You can go from normal to better. You can go from good to great. There will be a ceiling, but especially athletes, especially younger athletes, like adolescents, young adults, most people in elite sport are under 30. Younger people will benefit more from more sleep than older people will to be honest. If you're 20, I'm not saying more is always better, but too much is very rarely a problem for adolescents and young adults. There is such things too much sleep, especially as you get older. If you've ever slept 10 hours in a row, and woken up feeling groggy, they call it the rip-than winkle effect. You know, like you didn't, it's a real thing. You can't over sleep, but it's kind of hard for a 20 year old to over sleep. I mean, there have been studies where you take, where they're sleeping maybe six, seven hours. If you get them up to like nine, 10 hours, they're faster. They're stronger. They're mentally sharper. So, first of all, just sleeping a little bit more if you're younger, that's probably the easiest thing you can do, and that's about budgeting time, and that's about planning your wind on routine so that you land where you want to land when you want to land there. So it might be thinking a little ahead and giving yourself permission to put stuff down. Is that harder for younger adults? Because they're, at least I know as you hit adolescents, you're circading rather than later. It shifts later. So you're, I mean, I go to bed at midnight so like when when a typical adult looks at a clock and sees midnight, clocks has midnight, their body says midnight. When a five year old looks at a clock, clocks has midnight, their bodies like, oh my gosh, it's three o'clock in the morning, why are you awake? Right? Little kids go to bed early, wake up early. When an 18 year old looks at a clock, clocks has midnight, their bodies like it's only nine PM, why are you going to bed now? And when they have to wake up at seven, they're like, oh my gosh, it's four in the morning, why are you trying to wake up? So yes, they are shifted. And it changes with age. So yes, you can use light behavior and melatonin to physically shift that. You can do that, but they are more naturally inclined to stay up late. I mean, high school should not start before 9 a.m. Totally, 100%. College should start before 9 a.m. 100%. It's developmentally inappropriate. It's a lot, I mean, colleges I can't speak for that, but for like high school, since it's about the parents' work schedule. Yeah, it's it's logistics. It's not about what's better for learning, or it's not about what's better for the student. I mean, and all of the data that shows that when you delay school start times a California, led the way on this. California took the step and at least pushed it to 830. Right. Noah, I don't think any other state's followed yet. And there's a tons of data on this. My colleague Wendy Trucks, she has a fantastic TED talk on this on school start times. It's just it's wherever you look, when you delay school start times, you improve everything, not just academics. Why do you think kids are so sleepy? Why do you think teenagers are falling asleep? You know, all these ADHD diagnoses, how many of them are just sleep deprivation? You know, mental health problems depression and anxiety. How much of it is just, is just insufficient sleep and circadian phase shifting. So like you can actually improve these outcomes by getting kids at a time that actually works for them. So there's that. So yes, part of this is we live in a world mostly designed by old people who make all the rules. You know, if you look at who's in Congress, who's making all this legislation, it's not 20 roles. And they weigh, they're like, I wake up at five, six in the morning, just fine, you know. So what's your problem? You're just lazy, you know? Like I'm not saying they say that. I'm just, we live in the society of like, what, early to better, early to rise. Well, it's nice if you're 60. But if you're 20, early to better, early to rise, you know, you might have a circadian rhythm problem. But you said you can sort of you can. You can. You can. You can't. You can't. You can't. You can help with it. You can give people a melatonin to, you can give a melatonin, low that low dose half milligram melatonin is a phase shifting dose and light as a phase shifting dose of bright light. You can, you can do that. If you, if you get a 20 year old, that early flood them with bright light and movement, physical activity exercise movement is extremely powerful, also as a phase shifter. What time of day? Early, early, early exercise. Yeah, early exercise. Get them, get them up, get the moving early. They will get tired a little earlier. They're circadian rhythm, might still be a little bit off, but they'll be able to sleep. And over time, especially if you get the, have the dim lights in the evening, though, though, those dim lights in the evening can help pave the way for, you know, even if they're natural melatonin is in going to rise, give a little bit of melatonin the evening, force that rise a little early. You can, I mean, you can essentially jet lag yourself on purpose without traveling by doing that by giving light and melatonin at the time that you wouldn't know, right? I mean, yeah, some people are more resilient to it than others, some people are more sensitive to it than others, but you can do it. And actually, it peaks, this delay seems to peak in the early 20s, like, 22. But then after that, like, you can get, I mean, I work with athletes all the time, athletes tend to be pretty good at getting up in the morning because they wake up, they get light, they get movement first thing in the morning. And we did this study at looking at, this is called chronotype, which is like sort of where in the 24 hours, are you chronotype in athletes? Athletes, maybe it's also self-selection, where the teenagers who were just super late people were less likely to survive the training schedules to make it to the elite level. Who knows? Or maybe they've adapted to it a little bit more. But yeah, athletes tend to be on average not as much of a night owl as typical people there age. Right. What's the most, if we're talking about athletic performance, what's the most consistent sleep hack you could, you know, get a little more, get a little more and see how you perform, because the data show over and over again, that extending sleep, especially in younger elite athletes. I'm gonna talk about 60 year old, I've been talking about like 20, 25 year olds, 19 year olds, 29 year olds, like doing experiment, get more sleep if you can. And there's some strategies for doing this. Because if I just say spending extra hour in bed, we just talked about how you can't fill that time, you might actually create an insomnia. So you might wanna slowly increase amount of time you're spending. But unless you're tired enough that just spending an hour in bed, you'll knock out any. It's like 15 minutes and I really like that's how I like to do it. I like to extend it by 15 minutes, see if you do that, extend by another, because also you don't have to find an hour in the day. You could always find 15 minutes. And that 15 minutes, my buy you enough productivity where you could find the next 15 minutes. And do you go to bed earlier 15 minutes? Usually that's what people have more control over. Okay. Usually when people wake up is not what they have control over. Usually they have to wake up at a specific time. So it's about advancing bedtime little by little, but the point is you're ready for it by the time you do it. But anyway, so sometimes it's like go to bed an hour earlier and if you're exhausted enough you could do it. But over time that might make your sleep shallower and you might create more arousal if you can't fill that time. So you don't wanna just, I don't wanna just say like, get more sleep because not everyone needs it and not you don't know how much more and you don't know if you can fill that time if you haven't saw me anyway. But the data consistently show that if you can bank a little extra sleep first of all on average, you might show up it'll likely show up in your performance, but you might need to track it objectively using something like a tracker, like, or a stopwatch, are you getting faster? Are you being able to lift better? It might not be perceptible by your memory, but if you are 5% faster you won't notice, but the stopwatch will, for example. So that's the first thing I would say. The other the other most important sleep hack for athletes is sort of comes after that and it's sleep banking, bank good sleep. Get as much good sleep as you can while you can because if you have a competition tomorrow and it's high stakes you're not gonna sleep great, probable, maybe you will, but many athletes don't. Even at the very elite level, they are not sleeping well right before competition. But if you've banked good sleep up before, like if you're already off balance and barely keeping on two feet and someone bumps into you you're gonna fall over. But if you're well planted and someone bumps into you, you can recover pretty well. So one to two nights of short sleep does not dramatically impair performance. It might stress you out and you might psych yourself out. That might impair your performance. But if you're coming from a place of strength, one or two nights dropping your sleep from eight down to like six or five hours, you might have some cognitive impairment but it's gonna be quite minor. A week out, it's gonna be very pronounced. It builds, it's cumulative. But one or two nights isn't gonna be that big of a deal if you're coming from a place of strength. Is this, so it's really about the week before, yes, your week or two, a week or two. Okay, come from that place. Is this the same for a cognitive performance as well? So sleep banking really, it's not just about the night before. Right, it's not about night before. And that's great to know because so many people stress about the night before. If they know that at that time, come in with confidence. It's like with nutrition. It's like, it's not about what you ate today. It's about what you've been right. It's the same thing with the sleep on the weekends where when people say how much sleep do I need to make up on the weekends to make up for being sleep to private during the week, like, well, that's like saying how much kale do I need to eat on the weekends, but to make up for eating nothing, but cheeseburgers and pizza all week. Like, well, it's like I was saying in Po weekend. It's better to do that than just having cheeseburgers and pizza all week. But that's not the answer. You know, and that's also why you don't recover right away. That's why it's not like a sleep debt isn't like a financial debt. It's not like you don't have to pay it all back, which is good. You just have to get back in balance and your body will start taking care of itself once you're doing the right thing. For in terms of recovery, injury prevention, how strong is that data that you really do? So yeah, it looks like sleep, first of all, sleep is critical for recovery. And everyone knows it. Like when you're sick or when you're injured, you actually have an instinct to rest more. I mean, yes. But from injury prevention standpoint, sleep to private people injured themselves more. We see this from all occupations, like you crash your car more. And actually, if you ask people how well rested you think you are, but you see how much sleep they're getting, it's how much sleep they're getting, not how well rested they think they are the predicts drowsy driving, for example. Like even if you say you're fully well rested, if you're getting five or six hours of sleep, you are three times as likely to not off behind the wheel. Even if you say I am 100% well rested, data don't bear that out. People are not a good judge of how impaired they are through to sleep deprivation. So how much sleep you get is important in terms of those sorts of things, in terms of athletic surgeries, what seems to be a bigger driver actually is our two variables in Somnia and daytime sleepiness, which are very common in college students. But actually, if you're sleepy during the day, even if you're getting, if you feel like you're getting plenty of sleep at night, if you're nodding off during the day, if you're having trouble staying awake, you're more likely to hurt yourself. You're more likely to wink out, you're more likely to not focus on something, you're more likely to hurt yourself. Same thing, if you have really bad insomnia, irrespective of how much sleep you're getting, that inability to sleep when you're trying is predictive. So one example, so we did probably what is the biggest controlled study of this where what we did was, we again went into a division one school, measured everybody over the summer before they showed up for classes and training. And then we just combed through every interaction with any healthcare person and in this school, everything from, I feel stressed too, I twisted my ankle, gets documented in their record, everything. Every headache gets documented. So we just combed through to see what over the summer predicted concussions. And what we found was, prior concussion history, being male and being in a high risk sport where the three biggest predictors of concussions except for the sleep variables. Insomnia, having a high insomnia severity, and it's like, which is a question where we use to see how much is your insomnia interfering with your functioning during the day, and how much is it stressful for you? And daytime sleeping, as saying at least two days a week, I think it was a week, at least two days in a period, I'm having trouble staying awake. Those two, not amount to sleep, but those two were better predictors of whether you were gonna get a concussion than in the even the concussion variables. Has it been replicated? No one's been able to do something this large since, I'd love to do it, I'd love someone else to do it, but this is consistent with the literature that's coming out. That shows that it's not just, the amount of sleep sets you up for a cute sleep deprivation effects, but it's gonna bear out in terms of daytime functioning. And if your daytime functioning is bad, then you're more like it into yourself, and getting better sleep is the best way to not be sleepy. That's very interesting. Your study. Yeah, well, and it was actually inspired by a study that was done a bunch of years ago by a guy named Ben Potensiano, who's actually a sports person, as a sports psychologist. And he did this project, and I read it when I was a post-doctor, who was brilliant. He worked with Major League Base, while he still works in pro sports. He's a great guy, but he did this project where he gave sleepiness questionnaires to a whole bunch of MLB players, followed them up a couple years later. I don't remember exactly the timeframe. Just look to see who's still in the majors. And you could see dose response. Every one point extra increase on that scale, the likelihood of no longer being in the majors. Wow. And the ones who were in the clinical range, who scored over a 10 at that baseline time, 75% of them were not in the majors anymore. Incredible. One simple questionnaire, more than a year in advance, could predict someone's career trajectory. And so that's what gave me the idea of like, wow, what other simple questionnaires can predict just at screening? Who's that risk? Yeah. I want to ask you before getting onto the rapid-fire audience questions. Sure. The cognitive performance when I'm very interested in just personal reasons. And I'm wondering, is there, let's say someone's getting pretty good-ish sleep? Yeah. Like, would you have a couple of your top tips that do you think they could still improve cognitive performance with a couple of sleep tips? Yes. And if so, what are the things? The first thing I'm going to say about the cognitive performance is caffeine could dramatically improve performance in some domains but not others. You can, you can caffeinate things like attention, focus, reaction time, speed, all that stuff. But data show over and over and over again, whether it's military samples, whether it's sport samples, you cannot caffeinate a way complex decision-making. You just make bad decisions faster. That's when happens when you caffeinate a sleep deprived person. Over and over again, the data show this. You can, so like, a great example, there's this great story where they did in tennis players. Samy pro tennis players. Serving, when they took them down to five hours of sleep, impaired their serving accuracy by a five-rounder correctly, something like 35%. It recovered about a third of the loss was recovered when they caffeinated. But not all of it because there's other higher order stuff that's happened. Like, that's the sort of stuff you see in the literature that it's not fixed by caffeine. Some stuff is some stuff isn't. So caffeine is not the answer. But what one of the things that would be the answer is actually, and there's actually data on this, insulate yourself a little bit. Bubble wrap your sleep a little bit. What does that mean? If you can protect yourself against minor environmental disturbances during that I am protect the sleep you are getting, you can make it a little more consolidated, especially the deeper sleep and get a little more benefit from it. Here's a great example, the simple example. Some of the best sleep technology on the market, simple cloth eye mask. There was a study I think was in Switzerland where they'd had an eye mask, just a plain old cloth eye mask, and they had a placebo eye mask where they cut the holes out in the middle. Same strap. Just cut the holes out. Improved sleep consolidation during the night. These were in college students so they were in sort of noisy environments anyway. But consolidated their sleep better in the night, translated to better test scores the next day. That's just one example. Like I'm a, I'm asked in earplugs, some of the best cheap sleep technology that exists. Yeah, so darkness and darkness. Well, but it's not, but it's also, you might need to just the extra layer of insulate. I feel like a white noise machine could be good for something like that. Don't have a puppy in your room. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, anyone who has an animal in their room, another mammal in their room, like moving around. Yep. You're gonna have more fragmented sleep. Okay, awesome. Okay, let's get to some of these rapid fire audience questions. Yeah, let's do it. Best evidence based way to fall asleep and stay is sleep. Fall asleep faster and stay sleep. Yes, I'll give you two, because one is cheating. The one is stimulus control because if you can be rigorous about stimulus control, you can get into bed anytime, anywhere. It's like when I travel, like when I travel to a different time zone, even if I'm in a totally different time zone, I'm so rigorous about stimulus control. I can be at a very off time zone, but the lights are out, my eyes are closed, my heads on a pillow. It's a condition stimulus, I fall asleep fast. So you can train, if you can train yourself that that situation is reliably paired with sleep coming soon thereafter, you can make yourself, even if you're stressed, you can fall asleep faster by putting yourself in that situation. Riggers highly empirically supported lots of data support this. The other one I would say is allowing sufficient wind down time with nighttime signals, dimming lights, literally and metaphorically for at least a half an hour before bed. Literally meaning you want them orange, you don't want them bright and blue, and metaphorically, I mean, give yourself time and space to detach. That is actually usually, if you're going to bed at the right time, or within your window of time, if you're having trouble or your mind's racing, it's because you're trying to go from 30,000 feet to park at the gate right away. Just put a little bit of space in there, let yourself come to a stop, and you'll find it's way easier, and you don't have to fight so hard. That's like, if you're trying to stop at a stop sign, start breaking more than one foot front of the stop sign, you will find it's so much easier to break wherever you want, if you're coming in a little slower. I definitely do number two. I am definitely now going to, I'm going to be on top of this, this control thing, this is a, I'm the jet. Super interested in it. Thanks for your buck. Yeah. Sleep tip in the world. Great, okay, awesome. Most effective pre-bed routine you've seen to shorten sleep onset. Yeah, so that I would say is orange lights, putting screens down if you can, if you could put down screens, reading, actual paper books is great before sleep. Unless you're me, I actually suck at reading before bed because I get into it, but for most normal people, the data actually support reading because it's self-paced. If you can't maintain muscle tone, you'll learn you'll know it, and you'll tap right into your body signals, you won't be overstimulated, and as soon as your body's ready, you'll know it and you can put stuff down. So reading, dimmer orange light, the way to go, and that's sort of the way to go. All right, best strategy to fall back asleep quickly after waking in the night. If I were going to turn this into an algorithm, step one is, if I wake up in the middle of the night, what do I do? First step one is, okay, can I fall right back to sleep within the next two or three minutes, I try? And if I don't, then I evaluate, okay, is there something going on my body right now that I actually need to get up or not? Is this something I can, and let whatever activation was right out if it's gonna be short, let it do not, and I guess the answer is, do not add performance anxiety to it. Read the room. If you are not in control of your ability to fall asleep, if it is outside of your control, don't try and control it, let it be. And don't panic, you will fall asleep just fine. If it's possible to fall asleep fine, if you didn't panic, you will. As soon as you start panicking, you're adding energy into the system. All right, don't panic. We're gonna recap, one proven method to increase deep sleep in healthy adults. Proven methods, so there is some really, not that I think anyone really, whether or not people need it, I don't know. But there is some data you can improve the deep sleep, not improved, you could potentially get more of it, get it more consolidated. Besides the obvious is, if you have a barrier to get rid of it, if it's sleep apnea or whatever, but it helps the adults. There's some actually cool data on neural stimulation where you can induce more deep sleep activity, using auditory stimulation by sort of tricking your brain to create those waves. Juries still out on exactly is it just creating the wave forms or are you actually getting the extra benefits of what looks like more deep sleep or does it just look like you're getting more deep sleep because your brain's creating the wave forms? Not quite, I'm not quite sure yet, but there's actually a bit of data you can do that. And actually like I said with the imask, the environmental bubble wrapping of your sleep because if anything is gonna prevent you from getting more deep sleep, it's extra stimulation. With the auditory stimulation, is this something that you listen to while you're... Yeah, it's like the binoral beats kind of a thing where it induces, it basically sends waves that are in the wave forms that you want your brain to sort of create to echo them. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's like biofeedback, but for brain waves. Most effective way to reduce nighttime urination and wakeups. Most people when they are peeing a lot during the night, it's not because they have to peel a lot during the night because they're awake during the night. So what I would say is first of all, see if there's something that's waking you up, untreated sleep app, or probably the leading cause of nocturnal frequent urination, because you're keeping these arousals at night and your bladder's like, okay, well, you're awake, bite as well. That usually comes afterwards. The other thing is if you're used to getting up to go to the bathroom a lot, maybe you don't need to, and you might want to do an experiment and see if you can go back to sleep without going to the bathroom if you don't need to. And then you can get used to that too, because if you can hold it till the morning, just hold it till the morning. I've done this before. In fact, I used to go, I used to get up to go to the bathroom one time in the night, and now I don't get up at all to go to the bathroom. And you know, I'll usually wake up and it's probably like around five ish or so when I feel like, oh, I can go pee, but then I just like close my eyes, I go back to sleep. And guess what? You're fine. I've made it. I've made it now months without having to do that. See? And that's the thing. It's actually you might have accidentally programmed yourself to do that. Remember what I said? The average person will wake up 10 times a night or more. That the awakening occurs is not the problem. That it's blossoming into something you're remembering as stressful as the problem. Take the stress out. It'd be like, oh, I just had one of my hundred awakenings during the night that I just happened to be conscious of this one, but go back to sleep. And if you can train yourself to do that, it's actually shockingly effective. If you reduce that performance, things are exactly like you talked to. Yeah, no, I'm going to be all over the stimulus control thing. That's going to be a menu, my new thing. OK, one actionable change that measureably improves overall sleep quality. Overall sleep quality. I talked about a lot of stuff, whether it's nighttime routine, getting having the bed be a good place for sleep. But in terms of sleep quality, actually daytime morning, have a day, get activity. Don't sit around in the dark all day. Humans are not built for that. Eat well. People who eat like crap, especially late at night, their sleep is more disturbed at night. Reduce systemic inflammation in your body. Your sleep will feel better. If you're sharing a bed with somebody, and that somebody has sleep issues, drag them kicking and screaming to get tested for whatever it is they have and get a treated. Or get to twin XLs, put them next to each other. Sleep in a set of, you can sleep with somebody, but not in the same mattress. You can just put them next to each other. People underestimate how much this environmental stuff is shallowing out their sleep quality. My husband and I, we have our own separate blankets. Yes, on our base. Because there's nothing wrong with that. There's people who talk about this as if it's a bad thing. But actually, from a sleep science perspective, you get all of the social, positive, human benefits of sleep. Humans were not really meant to sleep alone. But at the same time, you get to be in your, essentially your own microclimate and environment where you get to be under control and not have it be. It's best to both worlds. Right. We're not feeling the movement as much. Exactly. For sure. OK. How can you quickly assess if you're getting enough sleep without a lab test? You couldn't even do that with a lab test. We don't have a good test of are you getting enough sleep? Test number one, if I put you in another, as quiet dark room for 20 minutes, could you stay conscious? If the answer is no, you're probably not getting enough sleep. And it's not might not be amount. It might be about quality. Because for people with a sleep disorder like Apnea, more isn't always better. More might just be, you can get an unlimited amount of sleep and still feel tired because the quality you're getting is poor. So it's just like nutrition that way. It's multi-dimensional. But by more, I mean, more quality or quantity. So one is, if you're having trouble staying awake during the day, or if you, if you put yourself into situation or it would be really easy to fall asleep, could you? Like, would you fall asleep right away? If the answer is yes, something like, why are you so hungry? That, like, if you, if you, if you put a plate of food in front of you, can you resist it? If you can't, what's up with your appetite? If it's not meal time, you should be able to resist it. The other thing is, you can experiment and get a little more and see if you feel better. If you don't, okay, good to know. Another way to tell is if you fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow, you probably waited too long. It's just like saying, I cleaned my plate in 30 seconds as soon as it was put in front of me. Should have taken a little bit of time. So, so, maybe you're going to bed too late. Maybe you're waiting a little too long. Yeah, that's, how do you know you're getting off? Unfortunately, we don't have a good test for that. I like those. I like those. Yeah, it's practical. Do you really need eight hours of sleep? No. First of all, the recommendation these days is seven because when we looked at the data, there was no distinguishable difference in almost all cases between seven and eight. Plus, people don't tend to have that, it's all based on recall anyway. So, people don't have that much resolution. Sevens kind of the new eight. At six people were starting to show problems on average. Are there people who sleep six hours on our fine? Yeah, I'm sure, probably. Are there people who are sleeping five hours in our fine? Possibly? Is it you? Probably not. Think of it as a bell curve. Or you're probably somewhere in the middle. The chances that you're on an extreme outlier or low. Just because you're an outlier and one part of your life doesn't mean you're an outlier here. And athletes, especially probably need more because they have a higher load on their recovery system. So, you want to recover. You need to give yourself the time and space to do that. Do you need eight, though? No. Do you need seven? Maybe. But then also need for what? How much sleep do you need to not die? Is different than the amount of sleep you need to be optimally functioning? Yeah. Optally function. Optally functioning. I would say most people probably need seven. Bicell report that might mean six or six and a half on your wearable. Right. Okay. And then one practical tip for aligning lifestyle with your chronotype. Yeah. I mean, give yourself permission to schedule stuff out in different times. You may or may not have control. I mean, if you're a night owl and you have a job that works early in the morning, I don't know what to tell you. But if you could control your day such that maybe you're doing certain things at certain times, we're adjusting meal times or adjusting where the heaviest workload of your day is, scheduling meetings at certain times, like you might be able to do that. I mean, if you're a heavy night owl, but you have to go to work in the morning, just wake up as suit, give yourself as little time as possible to get there so you can stay up as latest possible and do all your household stuff at night. And keep that schedule as consistent as possible seven days a week. Well, this has been very, very enlightening and interesting. I've actually learned quite a bit today. So thank you so much. Oh, it's just climbing on the show. You have a book coming out in, I think, October. Yeah, it's a text book. So it's an academic book, but it's all a bit. So it's a wearable book. We also have. It's all about wearable sleep tech now. Yeah, yeah. We also have, I've also edited a few other text books. There's one on sleep health, another one on sleep in sports. And another one on adapting CBTI for the day. Oh, great. Like, I'm an academic, you know, like this is what I've got. But if people are interested in them, they're not priced like a regular book. They're priced for libraries and for academics. But so if people have any questions about anything in them, just shoot me an email. I'm actually easy to find. And I'm happy to be responsive. Yeah, I'm looking forward to. A book on wearable sleep tech knowledge you written by an academic who actually knows about it is sounds interesting. It'll be fun. So great. So people can look you up. You got your lab at the University of Arizona. Yep. Thank you so much for coming on the show and sharing all this really, really knowledgeable, you know, important information with everyone. And thank you for everything that you do. No, you're very welcome. Thanks for having me on.

Dopamine that follows effort is generally good for us. One would hope that effort is in service to our own goodness and the goodness of others, but that's generally true. Large amplitude peaks in dopamine that don't require effort are dangerous. And to me, it's clear that if you care very much about your brain, that more than two drinks per week on a consistent basis, probably not a good idea. If you need a stimulant every time you're going to exercise, you are creating a pattern of behavior and likely some underlying or chemical habits that are not going to serve you well in the long run. Super excited to be sitting here with Dr. Andrew Huberman, who is a professor of neurobiology at Stanford University and a phenomenal science communicator, has the wildly popular podcast, human lab podcast, Andrew. This has been a long time in the making super pumped to have you on a podcast and had this discussion with you. It's been a couple of years since we've talked. So, really excited to get into it. You've covered a lot of really interesting brain related things in your podcast, but some of the things that have jumped out to me as very interesting is just understanding the way our dopamine system works. So, I was wondering if we could kind of just start by talking about what dopamine is. A lot of people think it's just a neurotransmitter and why it's so important for our everyday life. Okay, happy to do that, but I'd be remiss if I didn't express a debt of gratitude. I love your podcast. I've been a fan for a very long long time. So, for me, it's a dream come true to be here. As a guest on your podcast, I know you've been a guest on mind and hopefully we'll be again in the not too distant future. And also, I want to point out what should be obvious to everybody, but in case it's not that any time people say with respect to public science communication in the realm of podcasting, people will say, who is the first man in and I say actually it was a woman. Her name is Rhonda Patrick. You are the first advanced-degree scientist to step into the public facing education arena and to do it in podcast format at scale with your own podcast on Tim Furris podcast. You're a Rogan's podcast and of course, you continue to do that. So I just want to say thank you for being first one in. And yeah, and just really remind people that that's the history of this whole thing. So thanks for paving the way. We all owe you. And so thank you. Much gratitude. Thank you very much. Yeah. Dopamine. Super interesting, neuromodulator. Neuromodulator, not neurotransmitter. I'm not being overly nitpicky there. The word modulator is key because if you want to understand dopamine, it's important to understand that it basically adjusts the activity of a lot of different circuits. Meaning it's less involved in most cases in very local communication between neurons. It can be than it is changing, say, you know, how much the reward and motivation circuits are ramped up. Versus the circuitrys in the brain that are involved in feelings of satisfaction. So you can think of dopamine because it's a neuromodulator as kind of generating playlists, if you will, of certain genres of neural circuit function. Okay. And that's distinctly different than a neurotransmitter like glutamate or GABA, which can also do the things I just described. But our most often associated with like local communication between neurons. So use a different analogy. If we were to drop a million microphones into a stadium filled with people, each microphone listening to the specific conversation between two or three people, then we could say the speech between those people and what's going on there is more like what neurotransmitters are responsible for local communication. Whereas if we were to have, let's say, 10 or 15 microphones, grabbing from a bunch of different conversations and even shaping those conversations, by virtue of, you know, pinging those conversations with certain keywords like, excited, motivation, et cetera. Well, that's more akin to what dopamine is doing. It's working at a broader scale to change the way that the circuitrys in our brain work. So when I say neuromodulator, that's why. When it comes to understanding what dopamine does, specifically, it's important that we know that it does different things in different parts of the brain and body. So there isn't one singular function. Dopamine is, in fact, expressed in the eye, it's involved in adaptation to light. So that's a function that most people don't associate with dopamine, but it performs that role there. It modulates the activity of retinal neurons so that under different luminance conditions, brightness, or darkness, the eye can still make sense of the visual world. As you go into the brain further, you find that dopamine is expressed in neurons that are exquisitely tied to our ability to move. Okay, most notably in a brain area, called the ventral tegmentum, which just means the floor of the midbrain, which is called the substantian nigra, because the neurons there are dark. And those neurons are critically important for generating smooth movements. Those are the neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's, and that's why you see a elevated resting tremor and difficulty initiating movement in people with Parkinson's. In fact, most of the treatments for Parkinson's center around trying to replace that dopamine or those dopamine neurons. And then as you move into the classic reward system of the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens. These are all just names of brain areas that are associated with reward, motivation, and pursuit. And most people associate dopamine with a sense of reward. We hear about dopamine hits the idea that, okay, I'm thirsty. I take a sip of my tea, and I get a dopamine hit. That's the idea. Now, in reality, dopamine is more closely tied to motivational states, the pursuit of rewards. And those rewards could be in the form of something that you get or a punishing thing that you remove. This is important. The removal of a painful stimulus or say agitation or moving from a state of being too cold to being comfortable or too hot to being comfortably cool, also will release dopamine. So dopamine isn't really tethered to any one thing. It's a currency that is involved in generating movement. That's not coincidental. And is involved in motivation and pursuit of particular rewards. And those rewards are contextual. In an environment where it's exceedingly cold, finding warmth is the reward. In an environment where it's exceedingly hot, you're hiking in the Joshua Tree Desert, you run out of water and it's really, really warm, getting into that cool shower is going to feel fantastically good. And dopamine is no doubt released under both conditions. But dopamine is released and roots to goals when we think or to rewards, when we believe that we are on the right path to those goals. And this is critical. And this is why we say it's involved in motivation. There's a classic experiment that I think summarizes the specific role of dopamine and disambiguates it from the reward properties of dopamine because it does have reward properties. Best. And the experiment is essentially the following. You take two groups of rats. One group of rats has an intact dopamine system. The neurons are alive and thriving in this reward system and other areas of the brain. And you give them access to a lever press or some other small amount of work that then generates a food reward, like a fruit loop or something. Rats and mice love these kinds of things as we know. As do humans for all the wrong reasons. But real ones nonetheless. Those animals will work. They'll leverage press. They'll even work through a maze. They'll do a number of different things. Someone will even cross a shock plate to get to food if they're hungry enough. And the intact dopamine system helps them do that. It's motivation based reward pursuit. A second group of rats has a specific category of dopamine neurons ablated, neurochemically ablated. And that particular category of neurons are the neurons that are responsible for what we classically think of as reward. This ventral segmental nucleus succumbens pathway that we can talk about. And those animals will not motivate to get the reward. However, if the reward is accessible to them, they'll eat those fruit loops all day. In other words, it appears that dopamine is required not for the sense of pleasure or reward, not for the reinforcing properties of food or other reinforcers. Warmth when it's cold, cool when it's too hot, etc. But rather the desire and especially the ability to convert desire into a physical movement. Or in some cases, a cognitive movement we could talk about with look like cognitive effort to reach a particular goal. So what that experiment illustrates. And by the way, this has been observed in a naturalistic type and experiment where people with Parkinson's have fewer dopamine neurons, not just in substantial nigra, but elsewhere. As evidence that dopamine is most critically involved in motivation and pursuit of goals, not pleasure itself. So you've talked a lot about this dopamine wave pool and understanding how our dopamine levels are flexoring throughout the day. So this dopamine dynamics. Can you talk a little bit about that? The peaks and the troughs and our baseline levels and how that does influence our motivation for pursuing goals or in some cases, maybe rewards in general and how that just affects our performance. Absolutely. So before I do, I'll just mention that the dopamine wave pool analogy is one that I borrowed from Dr. Kyle Gillette, who is a medical doctor, who's been on my podcast and focuses mainly on things related to obesity and hormone stuff. He was the one that initially coined that phrase. I like it very much because it embodies a number of key features of the dopamine circuitry at large, not just one circuit, but how dopamine works generally psychologically and physiologically. It's the following. First of all, dopamine is a deplitable but replenishable resource. In other words, unless the dopamine neurons are destroyed, like in it, it's like Parkinson's or rare exposure to neurochemical that are involved in certain pesticides and that's not a dig on certain pesticides per se, but there's a history there of people taking certain compounds in and destruction of dopamine neurons. Those particular cases aside, most of us have dopamine neurons that can readily release dopamine and do so at what I would call a tonic level. It's kind of what we could just refer to as a baseline level of dopamine neurons firing in the background. Just firing off action potentials, electrical signals, releasing dopamine into the various circuits that they're trying to modulate. Then there are what we can call for a sake of this conversation, dopamine peaks and dopamine troughs, which are increases in dopamine release that ride on top of that baseline and that influence that baseline. Let's go back to the wave pool. In the wave pool analogy, you start with a certain amount of water in this wave pool and then you start generating waves of different amplitudes. If the waves are of a particular size, well then they rise and subside, rise and subside and you don't actually deplete the total amount of water in this pool. The baseline level doesn't change despite the fact that you have these peaks and troughs. If you get enough movement in that pool, you get big waves, some starts to splash out and the total amount drops. In other words, the baseline level of dopamine has dropped or in this analogy it's dropped. I like the wave pool analogy because even though it doesn't embody all of the dynamics of dopamine, it embodies many of them that we can relate to, for instance, if we take the extremes of things that cause massive amounts of dopamine release, these are typically illicit drugs, things like methamphetamine, thousand fold increase in dopamine release. You know cocaine. The combination of different highly reinforcing dopamine-related activities or drug. So methamphetamine plus sex, right? This is common in certain addictions, right? People will take stimulants like methamphetamine. They will also engage in sexual activity. Now you're getting way up past a thousand. It's not always additive, but it often can be additive or even synergistic. What happens under those conditions? Well, neurons in the, let's just call it the motivation and reward pathway, are releasing massive amounts of dopamine. Sometimes to the extent that the readily-releasable pool of these cycles are sometimes called vesicles in the U.S. of the little spheres filled with, with neuromodulator dopamine, actually get depleted. And the neurons need to manufacture more, and that takes time before more can be created. There can also be neurotoxicity where the neurons actually are killed off, although that's in more extreme cases. So what we're talking about here are drugs of abuse, like methamphetamine, cocaine, combination of dopamine-releasing activities, sometimes drugs, sometimes sex, sometimes video games, in excess, plus maybe compounds like adderol, vivance, et cetera, which clearly increased dopamine release. And then what happens is some hours later, or days later, depending on the frequency of the activity, the reservoir, the pool is essentially lowered. It's overall level. So now in order to generate waves of equivalent size, or even smaller size, you need a lot more, let's say movement. What is that movement? Well, typically that's the pursuit of more reinforcing stimuli, but guess what? Would dopamine depleted? That becomes harder to generate. And so hopefully I've created a picture here. This is obviously a kind of cartoon picture of dopamine dynamics. It's not quantitative in any way. But what it essentially says is big dopamine peaks lead to lots of dopamine release. And then what we know is that the dopamine levels that follow those peaks drop below baseline. And if the peaks are high enough, they will deplete that baseline. But remember, we said that the dopamine pool is deplatable, but replenishable. How is it replenishable with time? And with either lower or no dopamine peaks. So if we step back from real life, and we look at it, and we can say, okay, if I pick up my phone and I'm scrolling on Instagram, highly reinforcing behavior. I mean, videos and images are so powerful to us. I mean, a few years ago, there was a hack that I think Tim Ferriss put out on his podcast. If you shift your phone to black and white mode, gray scale, I mean, all that stuff becomes far less reinforcing. You kind of don't want to look at the thing. You shift it back to full color. And it's like, whoa, it's just so much more compelling. So you're scrolling, you're seeing things. And yeah, if you see something that you really, really like, maybe an animal video that you really like in my case, then sure, there's very likely to be some dopamine release. Is it going to deplete the baseline of dopamine unlikely? But if you engage in that activity for many, many hours, could imagine that it might. We don't have exact data on this. Certainly, if you're combining any kind of stimulants that tap into the dopamine system, this is going to happen. Certainly, if you're engaging in drugs of abuse or just a lot of, you know, exciting high-emplitude activity, it makes other things seem more boring because actually relative to what was going on neurochemically, it is more boring. The brain doesn't have a sense of exciting and boring. It doesn't have a sense of motivated a motivated in the subjective sense. It has a correlation between the activity of these dopamine and other circuits, but certainly these dopamine circuits. And some subjective feeling of either desire to engage a key movement or lack of desire to engage such as, you know, just kind of apathy and just feeling like, hey, there's nothing here for me, but here I am continuing to engage in this activity over and over. And we know that with most all drugs of abuse, but certainly with anything that releases dopamine, there's nothing quite like the first time. And that the circuits actually learn, they can become reinforced in the sense that they build up strength between particular synapses and things that sort so that we continue to, and a seemingly logical way, go back to the original behaviors, trying again and again, hitting that lever, hitting that lever, trying to get back to that similar state. And just like a slot machine, everyone's in a while, we get what we're looking for and the whole thing is further reinforced. Now, that's all painting a very sinister and kind of dark image of the dopamine system. And I want to be clear that this wave pool analogy doesn't have any valence to it positive or negative. It's just one analogy for how the system works. In a different frame, if you understand that you have some baseline level of motivation, desire to move cognitively, physically, and you understand a bit about how these dopamine and peaks and troughs work, within you can work with it. I believe you actually can leverage it so that things like procrastination become less likely, so that you can engage in social media in a meaningful and positive way, but then no, okay, you know, I'm going to put it away now and I'm going to take some of that elevated arousal that I feel and put it towards some other, you know, enriching activities. There's nothing good or bad about dopamine and we shouldn't fear it. It's really about understanding the underlying dynamics and that if we've taken ourselves to a place where we are just depleted, where that baseline, the level of water and that wave pool is way down because we've had these huge waves, huge waves, huge waves. Well, then we need to be patient. We just need to wait and expect that at some point pleasure and motivation will return, but that we need to wait a period of time as opposed to what most people do, which is to go pursue things to get them out of that somewhat, you know, subdued state. So I have a few questions. First of all, I'm a big thanks to Dr. Gillette for that amazing analogy I love it, too. It's it really makes it a lot easier to understand this, how the dopamine systems like working in a general sense at least. Maintaining the steady baseline levels, it sounded like it's not so easy to deplete the baseline unless you're really going after something that's either a substance, that could really sort of increase your dopamine, in combination with other enjoyable things as well, it is the effort that you're putting in so like you are preparing for a long term, let's say you're preparing for a wedding or something big or a party. And you put in all this effort and planning, you know, for a month, and then you have the party and it's fun. It's great. Everyone has a great time, it's a fun party, and the party's over, and then you feel kind of depressed. Like, can you deplete your baseline levels just from like putting in like having an event like that, or is that effort that I put in kind of going to shield me from the drop in this baseline levels? Yeah, well, the simple answer is the latter that dopamine that follows effort is generally good for us. One would hope that effort is in service to our own goodness and the goodness of others, but that's generally true. Large amplitude peaks in dopamine that don't require effort are dangerous. Drugs have abuse. Do this. One pill, one shot, and you've got a thousand fold increase in dopamine release. That's that's scary because that's not the way the system was designed to work under normal conditions. Right? These are drugs that sure might, you know, mimic certain compounds in nature, but let's face it. These circuits that we're talking about evolved for the pursuit of particular rewarding activities mainly centered around food and reproduction, and keeping us safe of waiting extremes of temperature, etc. So I think the critical thing is that, well, in the example you gave, you know, a lot of effort put toward planning a wedding, and then hopefully a wonderful wedding. That is all goodness. That is all goodness. In the sense that there's going to be dopamine released as one is making plans. See the invitations. You like the invitations. Maybe there's a dispute. You resolve the dispute, which by the way, remember the removal of a negative stimulus. Also dope. We're back on track. We're doing all this and then wedding goes fantastically well. Maybe one glitch. Okay. Great. And you have the photos and the memories. All of that is great. If the next day, when the day's falling, people feel a bit of a low, a bit of a postpartum type low, that could be related to a drop in the dopamine level. More likely it's fatigue. It's also anticipation itself. Breeds this own, kind of let down, want something follows. I mean, this is the nature of, you know, true clinical postpartum depression where, you know, post childbirth, this is a real clinical syndrome as we know that sometimes people deal with, unfortunately, it needs to be taken really seriously. But in the kind of more popular use of the word postpartum depression where, you know, post wedding, post graduation, it's the shift in a rousal state from anticipation and higher arousal. What's next? I'm excited about what's next, what's going to happen to. I don't know what's going to happen. What now? It's the what now, kind of circuitry. So I think that when it comes to understanding one's own dopamine system, there are a couple things to pay attention to. First of all, we all wake up in the morning, depending on how we slept. Let's assume our typical good night sleep for us. You know, I need seven hours, some of the people need eight hours, or some nine, you know, what is your level of positive anticipation about things to come? Even if those are deadlines or things that you might not want to do so much. How much get up and go do you have? I move a bit slowly in the morning, but once you're fully alert, how much get up and go do you have? You know, one of the classic signs of depression is early morning waking. That's one. The other is a lack of positive anticipation about future events. It's a classic depression symptom. The dopamine system might be involved in either of both cases, but what is the sort of classic representation of a positive, highly motivated person? It's somebody who is eager to move, like the ability and the desire to move into action. I was, I borrowed this from a friend who was a former seal team guy, he always said, you know, in everything in life, you can either be back on your heels, flatfooted, or forward center of mass. How much forward center of mass? How much gogons do you have in you or jog, and you have in you or wrong, and you have in you. At any given moment, we're rogan to these, you know, you all seem to have so much motivation. And I think that's, I know that's why many people are inspired to pay attention to the things you say. It's also the underlying spirit of pursuit. It's exciting to us. Other people have more of a kind of layback and observe mannerism. And I do believe that they too could have perfectly fine levels of dopamine. They're just more observant in the way they take in life. And I would just not say any of the other people I just mentioned are not observant. But you know, there's this business of cognitive movement or this phenomenon of cognitive movement, where we aren't necessarily in movement in our bodies, but we are reading voraciously. We are thinking voraciously. We are deconstructing ideas and being reflective. All of those patterns of what I'm calling movement, cognitive or physical, reflect underlying firing off of dopamine neurons. It's when we have a goal in the short or long term, and we are focused on that goal that the dopamine system really becomes active to generate these big peaks. Okay? It's this, I'm going to get, you know, the company is going to IPO or if people post on Instagram and they start getting a lot of positive feedback. Like one of their clips happens to go viral or something in a positive way. It's like, whoa, you know, it's this thing, like, oh my god, it's like raining down on them or from within them rather in the same way that the slot machine and, you know, in Vegas, it's, you know, the bells are going off and you hear the coins just dropping. Taintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaint. There's all this excitement about here, here it comes, here comes the rewards, here comes the rewards. That process, as I mentioned before, is not just, quote unquote, rewarding, it reinforces the circuitry that led to that behavior in a very powerful way. It actually strengthens through neuroplasticity. It strengthens the very underlying circuits. And the brain is either conscious or unconsciously or both will go back and repeat that behavior over and over again in order to try and get back there, even if we're not aware that we're doing it. And so what I find so interesting about the dopamine system is that it can create its own plasticity feedback for in plasticity. Okay? They're a number different, you know, specific seller events that underlie that. But what it's essentially trying to do is know where the water is, where the mates are, where the warm locations are for when we're too cool and where the cool locations are from when we're too warm. It's learning all that, but less than recording the specific locations, like the hippocampus wood or place that into the cortex, it's trying to remember the algorithms that led to specific patterns of mental or physical movement that allowed that. So if we step back, I mean, I hate to beat up on social media because you and I both teach on social media and I love social media. It has to be, you know, control, but I love it. But if we engage in social media and we get some positive feedback, we've reinforced it at an unconscious level all sorts of circuitries that lead us to think, oh yeah, you know, I posted that this one time. And I remember it was that that was a text post, the other one was a slide that was a video and your brain is trying to learn the patterns that got you where you were before and it worked out so well. So the dopamine system can learn the dopamine system can adjust its baseline. The dopamine system can create these peaks. And then we shouldn't forget about the anticipation aspect of it itself, which is what's called reward prediction error. These are classic experiments where essentially it was discovered that dopamine is being released and root to a reward while a monkey or human is working for a reward. And that was itself was a cool discovery. It was like, wow, dopamine isn't just, you know, when the monkey gets the juice or when the person gets the monetary reward, it's when they think they're on the right path or they might get a reward. That's when dopamine's released. Then they get the reward. If the reward is equal to or in excess of what they anticipated, boom, they get a bit more dopamine. What better way to reinforce a behavior at the neural level? But if the reward is less exciting or less money or less intense than one anticipates, what happens? Dopamine levels drop and then they drop below baseline. When they are on their way to eventually returning to baseline. And the duration of that drop is proportional to how high the peak was. So it's like you could imagine, you know, planning the wedding, planning the wedding, planning the wedding, planning the wedding, planning the wedding, planning the wedding, and then rainy day, funder storm. Oh goodness, well, hopefully people are adaptable and they adjust to that. But it's such a bigger letdown if you put in all this effort. It's such a bigger letdown if you thought it was going to be great. Because, well, the peak was bigger or the sort of slope rather was steeper. And the slope of the decline of dopamine is also going to be steeper. So not all of this works out to perfect math when it comes to the dynamics of dopamine. But by and large, dopamine reward prediction error says, if you think something's going to be great, it better be that great or greater to reinforce the behaviors that came first. If you think something's going to be great and it's less great or not great at all or even punishing, well, then it's going to send signals to alter the circuitry in a way that says, whatever you did to get there, don't do it again. It's going to discourage you. You talked about people that have this intrinsic motivation, right? Where it's like they're motivated to do. They have that, they have that maybe even just initial motivation. And then they have that intrinsic motivation to sort of carry it through that effort. Can you talk a little bit about the differences between the motivation and effort? It's very easy to confuse them. But some people have a really hard time even if they want to do something. I want to do this thing, but I just can't put that cognitive effort into do it. Are there any little ways that people can using the understanding of this dopamine system help themselves to push through and put that effort in? Yeah, great question. It starts to get a little bit complex in ways that make it hard for me to tack specific seller phenomenon too, but I'll do my best. So dopamine is one of the catacolymes. It's part of a group of cousin molecules. Dopamine being one, epinephrine also called adrenaline and nor epinephrine, also called nor adrenalin. These are released both in the brain and body from the adrenals, from the case of nor epinephrine, from a brain area called the look ascerrulious, which releases nor epinephrine in kind of a sprinkler like manner into the brain, although it can direct the release of nor epinephrine as well. And of course, all this stuff is active and released from neurons in our body as well. It's not a coincidence. It can't be a coincidence that these three neurochemicals, which by the way are very similar to one another, and actually are manufactured from one another biochemically. It's very interesting. People can go look up, you know, how is epinephrine made, how is dopamine made? And you'll see that the molecules are actually made essentially from each other. They're cleat by enzymes in their various changes there. But they work together to create motivation and to heightened focus, in the case of nor epinephrine, in epinephrine. In fact, these are the same neurochemicals that cause the changes in our pupil size under constant illumination to change the optics of our eyes so that we narrow our visual focus. Like when people heard, for instance, if you're, you know, people get really big. That's a state of underlying autonomic arousal that leads to a narrow visual window and heightened focus, okay? Whereas, you know, a shrinking of the pupils causes something quite different. Nor epinephrine epinephrine and dopamine are involved in all of that, and that's not a coincidence. At the same time, and I'll answer your question directly in a moment. But, you know, you said, you know, some people tend to be highly motivated. I'd be curious to run an experiment. I haven't run this experiment, but some people have kind of a resting balance to them. They have sort of, it looks like they're ready to go. Like they're just like excited. They're ready to go other people have kind of what looks to be like a more lethargic stance. They're more still. That can be a bit misleading because sometimes they're very active inside. You know, still waters run deep kind of thing. But it is interesting that some people are very, you know, you say, hey, you should, we head out and go, yeah, let's go. And then just pop out of their seat. Other people are kind of like, you know, and this is independent of how tired or alert we are kind of thing. So I think people idolate different RPM. I've noticed that certainly different dog breeds do that. They've been bred for that. Had a bulldog, low RPM, very low RPM. We also had a pit bull years ago. Tail was always going, higher RPM, more likely to engage in spontaneous movement. People are like that too. Okay. So if people lack motivation does that reflect some deficit in the dopamine system. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. What we know is that many people have a hard time initiating movement. Remember that in the Parkinson's patient, it's not just resting tremor that they have, you know, lack of smooth movements, motor movements. They also have a lot of difficulty initiating movement. Okay. So this is in the neurons that control movement, but it's a similar thing in the motivation realm. This is why I keep drawing this parallel between physical movement and mental movement. We don't really have a better language for it, at least not the number whereup. But mental movement is the motivation to open a book and start reading with a high degree of focus to take in that information as opposed to, you know, kind of opening in, like, I don't know, I don't want to do this. Or, you know, just kind of not necessarily apathy, but challenges and leaning into mental effort. The two things, the two things, meaning movement and cognitive movement or pursuit, are both governed by the same neurochemical systems, these three catacolomines, mainly dopamine, with the neuropinephrine, epinephrine being involved in generating focus. Other systems involved, too, of course, but this is still true. So for people that have a hard time getting motivated, if we just make it that simple, assuming there's in some major underlying neurochemical or life situation issue, oftentimes it's a lot like exercise. You probably experience this that once you get going and once in fact, if people accept that there's going to be a transition phase of maybe five to ten minutes to get the relevant circuits going for focus and for motivation, things often get much better very quickly. Now, this is a real problem where we live in a world where we can go on YouTube instantly and sort of get something right away. Again, you get a feedback or activation of these circuits for getting information with essentially no effort. It's a click. You just have to listen. I remember a few years back hearing that it wasn't going to be a long before people would generally have two screens in front of them most of the time. And I noticed nowadays, I've got two phones and often a computer and then there are, I mean, screens everywhere. Most people are dealing with at least one screen all the time, often multiple screens. So easy to get information. Now, if you want to sit down and read a book or listen to an audiobook with a high degree of attention, I think if you're somebody that doesn't get engaged quickly into things, telling yourself the truth, which is that this dopamine system and the associated other catacolomines take some time to get online for those circuits to start firing, can be very helpful. People can realize, oh, you know, my attention and focus isn't going to be great for the first five or ten minutes. In fact, it might feel like it's a bit of a kind of like there's some friction there. I feel like maybe my brain fog or something like that. But after a few minutes, people often will drop into a groove where then they are in a steady pursuit of information and then sometimes it's actually hard for them to transition out of it. In the same way, exercise, some people say, hey, let's go out for a hike and let's do it. Other people, you know, you need to get into a rhythm. You need to start activating those circuits in order to feel like you can be in that forward center of mass. I almost always feel this about running for the first ten minutes. I'm like this sucks. Whatever is, it's not how I'm not warmed up. Some things not warmed up in my mind and then it starts to feel better and better and better and then I feel like I could run all day. So, you know, I'm using loose analogies here but also real life examples to explain that the circuits that are responsible for motivation for effort in the movement system and in the cognitive space are similar, different circuits. But there's also similar to the extent that sometimes they need warming up and that will likely be more and more the case if we are engaging in activities in the rest of our life where we can get what we're looking for without any effort at all. We are, and I'm not blaming social media or YouTube, I love YouTube, we're on YouTube, you're on YouTube, but we live in a world now where our brain has learned, we can get things in an instant. It doesn't require effort and so there's been a learning of that as well. There's this hint like, where's the reward? Where's the reward? Where's the milestone that I'm on the right path? Well, it's not there as you crack open the book because your circuits have essentially been trained to have that just deliver to you in video form. I mean, reading words on a page, I love reading but it's to your brain, it's far more boring than watching a movie. Nothing, you know, pictures worth a thousand words and a movie is worth a billion pictures. Right, it's just the brain loves motion. It loves visual motion, it loves visual motion with color, it loves faces, it loves those dynamics and so we should not be surprised at all that when we tell our kids or we ask ourselves to sit down and read something, you know, I'm like, it's going on with me. Give it a little bit of time, five to ten minutes and understand that it's, you're asking something very different of your brain under those conditions. Now, if you get a text message from somebody in your anticipating that text message, what's the diagnosis? Did you win this? You know, are you going to see them and you're excited? Well, then you're going to be wrapped with attention. But again, text messages are this instant form of communication that, you know, both taps into no doubt the dopamine system, the anticipation system. But I think what I'm saying here is that a lot of the typical daily activities that we engage in and that we all love are actually training our circuits to be less effective at working through that initial friction. Less effort. I've heard you talk about attaching the reward to the effort itself and how that can help you and your system sort of value more the effort, right, rather than the and reward. Do you have some examples of, like, how would you attach a reward to the effort itself? Okay, so there's this psychology and then there's the physiology. The idea of attaching a reward to the effort process itself is kind of the holy grail of learning anything and being human in my opinion. And here we can look to the beautiful work by my colleague Carol Duac on growth mindset. You know, this notion of attaching the word yet, you know, that somebody isn't good at something and they can tell themselves yet that they can be that there's a capacity for growth and so on. There's also the beautiful work of another colleague of mine, Dr. Alia Crum at Stanford and David Yeager, who's down at University of Texas Austin, which has combined a lot of the discoveries about growth mindset with the stress can be performance enhancing mindset and to great success in my opinion in terms of cultivating better academic skills and so on. So we'll get to that in a moment. But the idea here is that the dopamine system, even though it's, you know, it's down in the mid-brain and it's involved with the end. It's also, you know, community came with the striadeum and it's community, down to the spinal cord and it's involved in all the stuff that's evolutionarily pretty, pretty old, right, reward, existence and reward mechanisms and movement exists in other animals too. But the amazing thing about these pathways is that they are highly subject to context-dependent learning. So the prefrontal cortex, the neural real estate behind or forehead, it's the bunch of different areas of the prefrontal cortex, but it's essentially a context-learning machine. It learns what's appropriate in one situation and not another and it learns rules. It can teach and learn rules. But it doesn't just teach and learn rules to you. The circuits involved in motivation and reward can learn those rules. Even so much, just, even so far, as to say accurately, that if you are in a process of trying to learn something and you can't do it, you know, like, I can't figure this out, I can't figure this out, but you have the knowledge, the cognitive knowledge that that feeling of what I call limbic friction, you know, I made that term up. But this feeling of friction, like this is tough, this is agitating. I can't do it. If you are aware of the reality, which is that that reflects the release of neurochemicals involved in attention and alertness, and it's changed the milieu of your brain to allow plasticity to occur. Then you can tell yourselves in those moments, the challenge that I'm experiencing right now is the gate to neuroplasticity, which it is. It's a way that my brain knows this is different than everyday life, because I can't do what I'm trying to do. Pay attention, do something differently, keep drilling. And that process, if you tell yourself, the simple, you know, self-talk of among the right path, the fact that it's difficult means I'm on the right path as opposed to the wrong path. What that means is that the dopamine system can start to recognize those general themes of thinking, general themes of internal or else, state in the body and brain, so that in the future, when you encounter those states, you know, this is good. This is good for me. In other words, we can, it's not just that the dopamine is released when we are in pursuit of heat when it's cold, cool when we're too hot, food, sex, et cetera. The dopamine system can also learn based on knowledge that we are told and that we believe. And there's actually a beautiful paper in neuron, published a few years ago that actually attaches beliefs to the dopamine system. It can get a little scary because what it essentially showed was that people who get confirmation of their preexisting beliefs get dopamine release under those conditions. This is explaining a lot of what we see out in the world, both online and elsewhere. But the important point here is that what we believe about how dopamine works, what we believe about effort, those things can be merged in a way that, indeed, we can start to attach reward to the effort process itself. As we are striving, as we are trying to go from flat-footed to forward center of mass, if you will, or from back on our heels to flat-footed to forward center of mass. As we're doing that, if we tell ourselves, okay, this is supposed to be painful, hopefully in the non-traumatic, non-physically or psychologically traumatic way. But that I'm doing this, this is it, this horrible day that was so difficult, this is part of growth, this is part of the growth curve. That knowledge can shape and will shape the neural circuitry associated with dopamine and reward so that in the future, when you encounter it, it's like, yeah, this is how this works. People hear this and go, how do I do that? How many times do I have to tell myself, I got it right? There hasn't been a deep exploration of that. But everything we know about the psychology of growth mindset and then I mentioned this stress as enhancing mindset. It's worth just noting the stress as performance enhancing mindset is one in which it's a beautiful experiment where people watch a movie about how stress diminishes performance causes challenges in immune system function, et cetera, et cetera. It's all true. A different group watches a video about how stress can enhance performance, sharpens focus, sharpens memory for specific things, et cetera, and it improves performance. So what it basically boils down to is that what you believe about a certain state in your brain and body has very much to do with how your dopamine and other neurochemical systems react, and that carries forward into other activities. That's why I love so much about the dopamine system where these other systems is that they generalize. Dopamine is the currency for all of this. There are other currencies in there too. I want to be fair to the biology. But dopamine is the currency of motivation, reward, and pursuit, but mostly, but mostly motivation and effort. And then additionally reward under certain conditions. So I guess if I, if that was a, you know, to word dense, when things get hard, tell yourself, the fact that their hard means you're on the right path. You might not be on the exact right path, but think of yourself as cutting a wedge through a map to get to a certain destination. Sure, as you gain more knowledge of right and wrong aspects of your pursuit, you can sharpen up or narrow up that wedge so that you nail the location like a Google Maps trajectory. But understanding that as you are in pursuit, you are tapping into the dopamine system. Now, if you hit a node, if you will in your pursuit, and it's like, oh, you got the wrong thing. It was like, you didn't meet the goal. It didn't go the way you wanted. It's also useful to understand that that is valuable knowledge. The lack of reward, the disappointment you feel will also reinforce not doing many of the things that led up to that. We just have to be careful that we don't generalize too much. There were exams that I studied for in university that I didn't do as well as I would have liked. In fact, one course in particular, and I still remember the course, I still remember exactly what went wrong, but that's exactly the point. We have a heightened memory for where effort led to the thing we didn't want. And we can use that to make sure that we remember that information going forward. We apply that information going forward. In fact, as you know in a qualifying exam, they keep asking the graduate student questions until you say, what? Until you say, I don't know. At that point, they've found your limit and the answer to that question inevitably people go look up. It's the one thing from your qualifying exam that you never forget. In any case, that's the best sort of topical description. In some of it really sounds much like the placebo effect, too. The placebo effect where you believe something is going to be positive. It's going to happen. And I believe you also believe dopamine. Absolutely. Absolutely. A placebo effect is amazing. And scares certain people, but I don't think it should. I think that we should look at the placebo effect as proof positive that the circuitry is in the brain that are involved in primitive things. Dopamine release, temperature regulation, hunger, et cetera, are highly prone to contextual learning. This drink is going to do blank and it does. This gives someone else the same drink. Again, a Leia Crumbs work. Give the milkshake study. Reigh give people milkshake, tell them it's high calorie, tell them it's rate nutrient dense. You get more satiety than if you tell them it's nutrient sparse. It's just as a and it's the same calorie drink. But you can look at the level of growing the secretion and see that is pure placebo slash belief effect. And I think that that makes sense if you are in the middle. If you're wanting to reward effort, then while you're in that, when you're doing it, when you're in the effort part where you're in motion. Then thinking about like this is working. This is like you can then there's the dopamine. Touch the effort. It's what I mean, am I thinking about it, right? Absolutely right. You described it far better and more succinctly than I ever could. It's important to pay attention to what effort feels like in the brain and body and to remind ourselves in those moments. I'm on the right path. I might not be on the exact right path, but I'm headed in the right direction. And sure enough, when you hit a milestone, whatever that milestone is, you should pay attention to that milestone, the reward, the grade, et cetera. I'm a big believer of also sometimes not paying too much attention to that. I'll never forget in graduate school, we got our first paper published and I thought we would go celebrate and I asked my PI, my lab head. I said, you know, we're going to celebrate and she said, I don't know, wasn't the celebration doing the experiments. I was like, well, those are a lot of fun. Yeah, and she said, well, I guess we could get a pizza or something, but how about just go do more experiments? And so that's what I did. And at the time, I remember, remember, I think, oh, that's no fun, but she had a long commute home and maybe, maybe, who knows, she didn't have the time. But looking back, it's like, what a great gift. Because it was like, no, you do the, it was the doing of the experiments. I was the reward. The paper, yeah, that's super cool. It's fun, you know, first paper is always a thrill. But the real thrill is in doing the experiments, doing science. And so let's not introduce anything to this picture that doesn't map on to that. And I don't know to what degree it played a role in my pursuit of goals. But I really enjoy effort. In fact, I love building stuff as much or more than I would indulging in the final one. And you do an excellent job. I guess as a parent, you know, like, if you're trying to attach it a reward to effort to kind of help facilitate tenacity, will power, like if a child, like you're not going to be able to tell a child to do what we were just talking about. But like if a child was like learning a new language, then you would reward the studying time, they're studying, okay, every study session they get a quarter or whatever. So then they're rewarded for studying, not for the fact that they can say the words properly or get the language correct or whatever. So exact reward verbs and verb states as opposed to providing adjectives. So when we tell kids, you're so smart, you're so smart. We think we're doing a great job of reinforcing their psychology. But actually what a lot of data, not all data to be fair, but what a lot of data show is that leads to a state where if that kid or adult get something wrong, then what's the opposite of smart? They think they're stupid. Whereas if you reward, it's incredible and I'm so impressed by the effort you put in. How hard you worked? The fact that you, you really double checked everything before, I'm you know, turning in your paper. You know, the fact that you were really, you know, I noticed how carefully you blanked, right? You went through each thing. And you're also reinforcing specific things that they can repeat. Just telling a kid that they're smart, then they go through, I think in their smart. Well, the first time, since it's going to happen sooner or later, the first time they get evidence to the contrary, they just take the opposite of that. So much so that I remember also my graduate advisor saying, you know, with students, you want to say, what was it? Instead of be careful, be mindful or something like there was this idea that, you know, trying to get students to pay attention to things in a certain way as opposed to rewarding people based on bins, like, you know, smart or less smart or something like that. So with kids, I think rewarding and reinforcing verbs states that lead to the sort of categorization is what's going to be most effective, at least that's what the data show. Yeah. I'm going back to procrastination. I've heard you talk about some interesting visualization, you know, techniques, where, you know, if a person's in a state of mind where they're, they're, yes, they want to do this goal, this, you know, whatever the fill in the blank project is or goal, then, you know, they can use a visualization technique, but if they were not, they could also do something, but they could use the pain and discomfort to help themselves get into that, like, do, like, actually do it. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, Tim Ferriss was right with fear setting. So there's a really fantastic scientist professor at NYU Emily Bell Chettis who talked about this and continues to research it which is that oftentimes fearing the worst or feeling negative outcomes, if we don't do something, can be very beneficial as a motivator. So that's not to say, you know, fearing the worst case outcome, it's placing some real time on fearing the negative thing that happens if we don't do something. Okay, so there's a kind of a unique to that case as I understand it. Visualization of positive outcomes is great as a motivator, but there are data that suggested it might not sustain motivation over time. I think it's probably fair to say that having both in your toolkit is great, you know, visualizing success can be useful in some context, visualizing the negative effects of not staying in pursuit of a goal also can be very motivating. That's essentially what the data now when it comes to of the underlying circuitry and what's going on in the brain, that's a little bit harder to know, but what we do know is that the pain system and so called negative reinforcement and punishment of the psychologists really parse these carefully. So I want to acknowledge that I'm not using the exact operational definitions here that the dopamine system, as I mentioned earlier, is also very tightly woven to avoiding punishment, to escaping punishment, to being under conditions of discomfort and then no longer being under conditions of discomfort. So we could hypothesize or we don't know, but we could hypothesize that for instance, if you imagine goodness, if I don't do this, a bunch of negative things are going to happen and that itself could trigger a certain form of internal arousal that would put you in emotion for that and that whole process would be rewarding. So that makes logical sense, at least in the kind of top contour, it makes logical sense. The other thing is that if we try and think about ways that we can avoid procrastination, we can go back to the dopamine wave, pool baseline peaks, troughs, and return to baseline kind of stuff that we were talking about earlier, and there's some interesting ideas out there and data, although right now it's still being sculpted out in humans, meaning the experiments are still underway. It's a little bit tougher to do in a scanner to get it exact mechanisms, but I think there's enough logical basis in mechanism to propose the following, which is that if there's something you need to do, that you know you need to do, but that you're finding yourself very unmotivated to do, it can be useful to do something even more uncomfortable than waiting and procrastinating. I didn't say even more uncomfortable than the thing, said even more uncomfortable than the thing that you happen to be doing at the moment, which is just waiting and procrastinating. You know, so what would that be? Well, we've all seen the opposite where we have a deadline, and suddenly we find ourselves cleaning our home. We find ourselves doing these things that are kind of low level effort that for whatever reason, if you think about it's kind of wild, we weren't motivated enough to do a day before and hour before, but suddenly we're motivated. It's almost as if the motivation circuits are sort of getting ramped up, trying to figure out what to direct it toward, but clearly that's easier than focusing and directing one's effort toward the deadline, or the cognitive or physical effort of something else. So there's this idea that many people have put to good use, what go do something that's really uncomfortable, again, don't make it psychologically or physically traumatic, but if you really don't want to exercise in that moment, that'd be a great moment to exercise, to engage those circuits. Remember, it's a generic circuit. There isn't a circuit for motivation for one thing versus a circuit for motivation for another. As I'll just the general same circuitry is applied to different things. So I happen to hate the cold. I don't like doing cold. I love the sauna, hate the cold. So for me, getting in the cold plunging anytime, ever, unless I'm getting out of a very hot sauna and I want cold, is like the least exciting thing to me and the thing I'd like to avoid most. So if I'm finding myself in a state of procrastination, some writing, some whatever posting, researching, et cetera, I will often do the cold plunge as a motivator. Now we need to be fair to the biology and acknowledge that when we get into cold, uncomfortably cold water, the catacolomines are released, dopamine, epinephrine, or epinephrine. We know that. There's this beautiful study in European journal physiology. You know far more about this, this work than I do. But I've spent some time with that paper and there's a pretty remarkable and significant long lasting increase in the three catacolomines. Dopamine, epinephrine, and or epinephrine. So we can't know that it was the discomfort of being in the cold plunget, self that led to more motivation. It could be the discomfort led to the release of these catacolomines, which led to a different brain state, which allowed for more pursuits of whatever this other task that one was procrastinating on. But I think it's reasonable to assume that all of that stuff together had a significant effect. Okay, not we're not trying to statistically significant the study hasn't been done yet, but about evaluating procrastination versus cold plungers is no cold plunge, there'd be an interesting study. But the point is the same three catacolomines involved. The discomfort of one thing leading to the post discomfort state of less discomfort, but elevated catacolomines bringing one into a state of more motivation. To me it makes perfect sense, like it all holds up logically. And why cold? Well, cold is always provided it's uncomfortable, but safe, uncomfortable, safe, cold water exposure. Always to poison these catacolomines is a core part of our physiology. They're probably other ways to do it, exercise, et cetera. Exercise hard. I mean, exercise hard. I mean, it's like going on a zone two run is not like that uncomfortable. No, I think like going hard. You're going doing a hard hit. Right. Is like, like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, yeah, the assault by just, I do a Friday workout for me. It falls on Friday where it's, it sounds so easy, but it always sucks to start it. Ten seconds hard peddling on the assault, like 20 seconds rest, 10 seconds on 20 seconds often, just do that eight times. Just give my heart rate just way way up once a week. I never want to do it. I never want to do it. And then afterwards, you always feel terrific for many, many hours. It's wild. Yeah. It has to be the catacolomines. I definitely want to go into a little bit more on exercising cold exposure and dopamine. So kind of, I guess if I'm understanding this correctly, really like, there's something about doing and embracing something that's more uncomfortable to you than just, I guess, sitting and waiting. And then you do it and let's, okay, let's, let's forget the fact that it, it cold plunge also overleases dopamine, right? Let's say you do it. And then you go back to your task and it's like, okay, you did this really hard thing. Is there like a contrast now where it's like, like, I think it's actually that that and I think it's also just that the ending of the difficult thing creates an increase. We know that's the removal of pain. Creates an increase in the catacolomines that it's like the we, you know, one, I mean, interrupting myself. But from an evolutionary standpoint, we go back to time like what this circuitry really evolved for. It's like you just survived the effort. You just, you just, you just survived something, which is a tremendous relief, which is a, it's a lift. And but when I say it's a lift, as a biologist, I have to acknowledge it's a neurochemical lift. Dopamine, epinephrine, nor epinephrine, no doubt involved. Now, if you go too hard, too long, you know, you exercise too hard, too long. Well, then you get the post-exercise dip and energy and you might feel amotivated. But we're really talking about here is generating a wave front in that dopamine pool that then you can devote to other things. So it's interesting talking about the thing that you don't like, you see you talk about cold exposure or like going really hard and the exercise, how does exercise generally affect the dopamine system and does it depend on how much you enjoy doing it. Like like the nice run on the beach. Great question. There is unfortunately not as much data about this about the influence of exercise on dopamine. There's some, but because it requires ideally brain imaging and exercise involves movement. It's been harder to do those sorts of experiments because people are in the magnet, often with a bite bar and like it had us to stay stable. But in the case of cold water exposure and looking at the catacolomines, it was by blood draw. And I want to be fair, the levels of dopamine and other biochemical increases by blood draw on the body don't always correlate directly. In fact, they never correlate directly with brain level changes in these chemicals. But they're loosely correlated. You know, as one goes up, the other goes up, as one goes down, the other goes down. But unfortunately, we don't have great real time imaging of dopamine release or dopamine levels with like a skull cap that you could run without a bunch of equipment next to you. So there aren't as many studies about this. But there are some using blood draws because people can run on a treadmill, take blood and look and certainly people can be scanned in the scanner as well. We know that intense exercise deploys the catacolomines. We know that. We know cold water does it as well. And a number of other things as well, as well, people playing a monetary reward game as the typical way this has been done in the lab while people are in a scanner. There's also some interesting data. I just want to mention in two sentences where the way that the dopamine system is kind of checking off milestones, I talked before about pursuit milestone, pursuit milestone. The human brain has a capacity to like create long milestones like a four-year degree or a marriage or you know, raising a kid and also moment to moment milestones. There's an interesting experiment also published. I believe in neuron. I have to go back and check with certainly cell press journal by my recollection that had people watching a sports game and it was a basketball game and every time their favorite the subjects favorite team got the ball and there was an opportunity for another basket, another score to take place. The dopamine circuitry sort of reset itself, if you will, toward anticipation of that particular drive-down court. Now that's a perfect experiment in many ways because basketball has a very, it's a very constrained environment. You know which team is going for which basket you know when there's a turnover, you know when the turnover got reversed, you know it's not like most of life where you're in pursuit of things that is very dynamic. A lot of interwoven goals throughout the day, etc. But the point being that as we move through our pursuits the dopamine system is constantly updating. Okay here's if you will a drive-down court right toward and it's paying attention or it has knowledge of even the sort of the the shorter milestones like you know as we move through this podcast. You know I'm not tracking where we are. I don't track time very well. I'm tracking whether or not I can answer your questions co-hearingly enough. Right that's how the my dopamine system right now is tacked to this. As opposed to people who are you know gambling on a game in Vegas and who you'll find all scores really what matters. But you know talk about dopamine and reward prediction error. I mean you that's what Vegas is all about right. It's basically the town should be called reward dopamine reward prediction error town USA because that's what's going on there. So okay so that's a little bit of a divergence into that one particular study. When it comes to exercise there are a number of ways in which dopamine can be released in response to effort. Remember the catacolymes, nor an effort and an effort and dopamine close cousins biochemically related. All of which are involved in heightened state of arousal focus movement effort. Okay it's just the kind of perfect cocktail that nature created. If we engage in vigor it we know that if you engage in vigorous exercise exercise that requires effort and you completed in a way that feels satisfying to you. No doubt you're going to get a dopamine increase from that. Now is it the long elevated increase in dopamine, epinephrine and nor epinephrine that one sees with deliberate cold exposure? That's going to be pretty nuanced. It's going to depend on the nature of the exercise. I don't know. I suspect no. Now I will say that I feel very different after a good long morning run or 30 minutes jogging versus a hardweight workout. It's just like it's it's subjectively distinct feeling in the hours afterwards. What's interesting about deliberate cold exposure, you know, cold plunger, what have you, is that people generally report feeling very good almost like a mild euphoria for many hours afterwards, elevated focus, many hours afterwards. That maps beautifully onto the, I can see those images in the paper now of the, you know, the big dopamine increase in the neuropinephrine increase in something. It's three graphs set above one another vertically in that paper where, I mean this is long arcs of dopamine release way above baseline distinctly different from one sees with like cocaine or infetamine which has also been measured in humans, you know, the big amplitude, big drop at blow baseline. In fact, I'm not aware of but base of that, in fact, I'm not aware that what I'm about to say is always true, but in that paper about deliberate cold exposure, I did not see probably because they didn't look out that far. A drop in those catacomines below baseline. It may be that it just elevates and then tapers down to baseline again. Remember, the slope of line, how the faster you get up to a peak, the more of a drop below baseline. This is why people who smoke crack cocaine faster into the system, then if they bring cocaine into their system by, by snorning it or orally. Okay, we know this, the route of of administration has a lot to do with the amplitude of the dopamine peak and how far below baseline it drops afterwards. This is one of the reasons why certain forms of drugs of abuse are far more reinforcing than others. It's not just that they create more a bigger dopamine increase, it's how quickly they get there and then how quickly and long that trough lasts. So with exercise, I get a clear state shift from exercise, I'm sure you do as well, and it's wonderful, but it's distinctly different from the kind of state shift that one gets from deliberate cold exposure. Again, less data, but one thing that's kind of fun that I don't think I've talked much about if at all on podcasts is the entrainment and anticipation of exercise. This is kind of me, if you exercise it more or less the same time each day for three days, it doesn't even have to be consecutively. What you'll notice is going forward, at least for a short period of time, 15 to 30 minutes before that exercise, you'll notice kind of an increase in a rousal, where your body is entrained to that movement. The neurochemicals that were released, the state of a rousal, there's some learning there between the memory systems, the hypothalamus, and the autonomic nervous system, and the body starts to anticipate being ready. If you then don't exercise, you can also apply that elevated readiness to mental work. People oftentimes will say they wake up right before their alarm clock goes off. Wild, right? You wake up, you look your glass, like a one more minute, what's going on? Well assuming the clock didn't make some sort of noise, like a click or something like that, it's the entrainment to that waking up time. Even in sleep, your body is clocking time, your brain is clocking time, and then you wake up and then the alarm goes off. The same thing is true if you exercise at the same time, and this is what's really interesting. If you exercise it more or less the same time, you can use that elevated rousal at that time to exercise or do other things, but then there's the post-exercise increase in whatever mental state you happen to exit that exercise from. Again, I say it that way, I'm not trying to be wishy-washy here because I find that a eight minute hit workout is distinctly different from a long jog, is distinctly different from a hard leg day in the gym when it comes to how you feel afterwards. Each one has to be neurochemically distinct and hormonally distinct, and then the laboratory unfortunately, most of the studies have been done like tread milling or swimming. There aren't a lot of studies looking at the neurochemical changes there, the consequence of different types of exercise, especially things like hit and resistance training. I'm sure there are a few, I'm not aware of them, but they're far fewer than just cardio because it's harder to get people to come in and do a hard hacksquat or something like that. I think the biggest changes that's been done really with high intensity exercise and versus lower intensity or moderate would be looking at lactate and how that affects no-rop and nephrine and other things. But the entrain of thing is interesting because I'm wondering if let's say you have someone who is not motivated to exercise. The best thing you can do is get a coach, that's going to help. But if you can get them to do the three or four days in a row at the same time, then on the fifth or sixth day at that same time, are they going to now because they have that you were saying that, that motivation, like that anticipation, which is tied to the dopamine system, then maybe you're going to tap into that, like, okay, we're going to get some of that motivation. So it would be interesting to come up with a protocol, like how long, how many days of training the same time of day can we get someone who is completely unmotivated to exercise? They just they haven't experienced it, right? I would say three to seven days. If we based on our understanding excuse me of how the autonomic nervous system can learn and how the dopamine system plays into that. Three to seven days, maybe not even consecutively. I mean, I always say that the most important thing with exercise, if I were going to write a chapter on exercises, number one, don't get hurt, but that doesn't mean don't do it, but don't get hurt because the best way to get and stay in great shape in your life is to not get hurt. So you don't want the new exercise or you like to injure themselves, but three to seven days, they should then on the, you know, eighth day or on the fourth day, left to their own devices, feel the energy in their body 15 to 30 minutes before doing that exercise and hopefully they would just do that. I mean, I think that people relied often too heavily on psychological motivators and we overlook this entrainment phenomenon and the ability for our body to entrain to certain times. You know, I, for instance, it's a terrible thing, but I like to get up, hydrate, caffeinate, slowly do some mental work, and then in my ideal training time, you know, if I ever retire, I don't know that I ever will, but would be to train mid-morning, like 10 30. Amazing. I love it. My workouts are always best, et cetera, but my life isn't organized that way. So I like to try and exercise within an hour of waking up, but I have to drink caffeine first. I don't do my 90 minute delay thing. I drink my caffeine first, if I'm going to exercise right away. And I should say that for people that feel a motivated, what do we do, generally? We consume things like caffeine, which, as we know, disrupts the adenosine system, so adenosine being a molecule of sleepiness or fatigue, also upregulates dopamine receptors incidentally. It's actually shown in human dopamine receptors, pretty interesting. Their, regular caffeine consumption, very likely increases the sensitivity and or number of dopamine receptors available, so whatever dopamine is released can have, quote unquote, more of an effect in terms of motivation of reward. People will take nowadays, and I'm not passing judgment here, but there's a lot of use of things like Aderol, Modafin, LVIV, and stimulants. What do all those stimulants do? They release the catacolamines, mainly dopamine, and epinephrine. They are amphetamines. People go, and we're going to speed. Yep, that's what they are. Again, not passing judgment. They can have certain positive effects for certain clinical issues in some cases, again, not promoting or discouraging, just stating the reality. But what do people do? They take stimulants. What did I do right before this podcast? All come clean. I don't hide these things. I've been experimenting lately with two milligrams of Nicaract nicotine in the form of gum. I don't smoke, vape, dip or snuff. Those are all bad, carcinogenic, et cetera. I know people say vaping is not as bad. It's vaping is bad. It's as bad smoking, probably not, but it's not good for you. Don't vape. I just got some enemies, but that's my read of the data, more coming. But nicotine taps into the acetycolian system, increases focus. It also will tap into the epinephrine and dopamine system. It's highly reinforcing, so I limit myself to two milligrams, maybe four times a week total. And I'm thinking about stopping altogether, because I'm just running this as an experiment on myself. And it really, really works for me. What does it do? It makes me more alert, more motivated. That also scares me. It's not, um, and many people I know that take their these pouches that come in canisters. I've never tried them. I don't want to. Those are generally four to eight milligrams of nicotine per pouch. I hear over and over again that people take one. They love it. Take one pouch. They then will do two a day, three a day, and pretty quickly they're consuming a canister. So if not every day, every couple of days. So it's a very quick route to, let's just call it habit. Is it addictive? Maybe, is it habit forming? Clearly, and this is becoming all the rage. Now, I don't recommend it. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, which isn't good raises, blood pressure, et cetera. There's some evidence that nicotine can be a cognitive enhancer, and maybe later in life it might be something that I'll return to. And for that reason, but it does have certain health hazards. Clips always get cut of me saying the cognitive enhancing part. But the point here is that when people feel amotivated, they tend to look for something that they can ingest. Remember, no effort, get the, get the molecules going. There's nothing wrong with that. A cup of coffee, or espresso, or your bhamate, you know, all three, sometimes. And you're more alert, you're more arousal. You need to do something with that energy, and then try and lean into work. The problem is with pharmacology, it's hard to get the dose just right, so that you have the ideal level of focus, ideal level of alertness, but not so much that you have agitation in your mind is kind of darting all over the place. So my typical thing is I will use coffee, or your bhamate, or both prior to a hard weight workout. But when it comes to cardio, I try and do my cardio without any any caffeine, or even certainly no excessive caffeine. Maybe a half a cup of coffee, maybe a year bhamate or two, and then just get out and go run in my case, or do the hit workout, and let the workout itself be its own source of neurochemicals. But that's just me. I know some people are doing the energy drinks combined with nicotine, combined with, I mean all sorts of stuff, and it's wild because then what they find is in the absence of those things, they're a motivated. Well, why? It was minimal to zero effort followed by high amplitude dopamine release, and probably less directly from the exercise that you're doing. Right, you talked about the stacking of things that are releasing dopamine, either you and because you enjoy them, or there's something that can release dopamine assistance, is what will cause you to have the really high amplitude beat, and then you can go below baseline. How does caffeine from coffee affect, so you mentioned the dopamine receptors, is that so is that like long term, because then you start to like you never feel as good as like if you take a break from caffeine, then you have that first cup of coffee. Right? I can't say I relate because I can't remember the last time I took a break from caffeine. I've done it when I had flu's or I was cold, you know, I had colds or flu's, because I just don't want to drink caffeine under those conditions, usually like chemical, and I'm just huddling in bed or something. I love caffeine. I don't drink that much of it, you know, but probably told loud about 4,500 milligrams a day. You know, I wait 250 to 20 pounds, so that's not that much, and I'm pretty caffeine acclimated, and I tend to drink caffeine in the early part of the day, and not so much in the evening. Certainly not after 3 p.m., so I can sleep well. But, you know, the stacking is something that, you know, I don't want to give the impression that if, you know, you have an energy drink like a pre-workout, and you've got the music blasting, and you're hydrated, and you're slept great, and you have a great workout, like crush your workout every once in a while, but don't be surprised if the next time you're walking into the gym, you don't feel quite as motivated, and I don't think one should rely on that every single time, you know, that you need to, if you need a stimulant every time you're going to exercise, you are creating a pattern of behavior, and likely some underlying or chemical habits that that are not going to serve you well in the long run. You're going to feel less motivation to do the thing that itself can generate feelings of motivation, and that's what we've been talking about. The use, a cold shower would be a great one, because of that long, I'm just fascinated by this. I've never seen anything else, no drug prescription or otherwise, no supplement, no workout that I'm aware of, but I haven't explored every single one that creates that long arc of dopamine, epinephrine, and nor epinephrine release, that one minute, one minute, of being uncomfortably cold, can create. Now in that study, it was a longer exposure. They used warmer temperatures, and it was much longer, but I think based on my understanding of things you presented and what I, as I understand, the shorter, colder exposure, no doubt creates similar subjective experience. I was going to ask you about that because there's a lot more papers looking at Norrup and Naffron release with respect to cold exposure, and that can be even 20 seconds, like at a minute. I'm a 39 degrees. That's right. That quickening of the breath, that's a adrenaline is an incredible molecule. But I'm wondering what you think, and this can be some of your opinion, is the minimum duration and what the temperature should be to get, increase in the dopamine like peak above what you're at, like you're talking about. Yeah, so unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of exploration of this, and there needs to be, and at one point, my colleague at Stanford Craig Heller, who's done a lot on cold exposure, and in particular, Paul Merkooling for lowering core body temperature before exercises, a way to increase in prolonged effort. A lot of Stanford athletes do this. Other athletes, pro athletes do this as well. Interesting topic. And I work considering doing some work on this, but we haven't gotten around to it. I guess we both have been busy with other things, but here's how I approach deliberate cold exposure, and people might scoff and say, well, that's completely subjective. But what I like about it, or what I'm about to say, is that it's highly individual. It doesn't say 40 degrees for three minutes, because 40 degrees for three minutes at 8 a.m. is going to feel very different than 40 degrees at three minutes at three a.m. No one's doing cold, lunch at three a.m. unless they're in a sealed team training or something. But if you're tired, you're stressed. People have different levels of excitement about the colder fear of the cold, and so on. Here's how I approach it. I think of everything in life as it relates to the stress system as coming at you and it's like a wall in event. It's not, you're not thinking temperature and duration. You're not thinking, oh, how intense is this difficult conversation on a scale of 1 to 10? And how long is it last? And that's not how the stress system works. We tend to be confronted with stressors that we either know or coming or are not coming. So the way I approach cold is I look at the cold plunge and I think how resistant to am I psychologically to getting in it. And usually it's very. I'm not excited to get in. I'm excited about the feeling I know will exist when I get out. So I think of getting in as the first wall. It's like climbing over a wall. Okay. This is the first wall. I get over that first wall and then I get in. I like to lower myself to my neck. I like to put my hands in. I try and move my arms away from my body because I notice when the cold water gets to my armpits that's when it really starts to be uncomfortable. And I pay attention to my breathing a bit or maybe I'll distract myself. I find it doesn't really matter and what I'm waiting for is the first impulse to get out. So that's the second wall. And then I force myself to get over that second wall. Again, this is assuming that the water is and so cold that it's going to be damaging. And then what I start doing is I start counting walls. And most importantly, I start paying attention to how far apart in time those walls are. Now, eventually you just go numb and you're not going to feel any wall. You'll go hyperthermic. So you don't want to do that. But what I generally try and do is five to ten walls. And it's very interesting to notice how the waves of desire these what I'm calling walls to. I want to get out now. Now, I'm going to just go over this next wall and this next one. What that seems to do and I realize I'm not answering your question directly. But the reason I'm describing this is that so much has been put to the time and the temperature. But ultimately, we're all highly individual in terms of how we react to stressors in a given moment. And what I find is that there's tremendous learning in noticing stress coming toward us, us confronting that stress, getting past that stress, and then moving through it. And then when I get out, I always feel much better. It's like, okay, there's a relief there. You get that arc of dopamine release that's quite long lasting. There's no question, I mean, what you can like feel it in your body. I'm trying to be too, you know, anecdotal about this. But everyone feels different after cold. Maybe just relieved you got out. But, and that's it. But you feel different. And then what I'm trying to do is attach the fact that there was a feeling of accomplishment in having gone over a certain number of walls and paying attention. So again, this is not answering your question. I acknowledge this. But the ability to notice how stress hits you and how you move through stress. And then how your adrenaline system is like, it's trying to create agitation. So you get the hell out of the stressor. That's what it's doing. And your ability to stay calm and to ride through that in a safe way. That is a skill that I think is invaluable. Far more than sitting there and just watching the clock ticked down, getting out, and then enjoying the feeling of being out. Now, to directly answer your question, what are the different parameters that lead to different patterns of dopamine release? We don't know. With 30 seconds at a very, very cold, but still safe temperature, do it. My guess is it would. My guess is that the catacolymines are released in a bowlless in parallel from the locus serrulious nor up in effort, from the adrenals adrenaline, from the various sources in the brain that can release dopamine, that they are just released in parallel. And we know they have different time courses. Without see even seen in that European journal physiology paper, you see they have different time courses, different amplitudes. They're not released as a little kit of, you know, blue angel planes flying right next to one another on those graphs. They have very different dynamics over time. But they are released in parallel. And then, you know, wouldn't be that five minutes at a, at a, you know, 50% cold, colder would release, you know, X more dopamine. Very likely the problem is right now in, in 2024, we don't have great ways of measuring these things in real time. We just don't. We're just now getting to the point where you can measure things like insulin and blood glucose in real time. In really careful ways while people are moving about. So the short answer is we don't know. But I do think that there's great value in paying attention to how one encounter stress moves through stress. And then when you get out of the cold plunge, I don't tend to spend too much effort thinking about how I feel in that time. I just know that it's a complete state shift. I also know based on my reading of my sleep, on my aid sleeper, whoop, that doing cold plunge in the morning dramatically increases the amount of wrap. And I move and sleep I get at night. And I don't know the exact reason for that. Not incidentally, certain forms of pharmacology, not drugs of abuse. But that I don't use regularly, but that I've used in the past, that increased dopamine and nor up in effort. Like, preparing will increase my wrap and I move in sleep dramatically. I currently don't take it. I took it years ago for a short amount of depression. I don't take it any longer. But I decided to take 50 milligrams of preparing as a focus aid at one point doing an experiment there. It didn't work well for me. But I noticed that my wrap and I moving it sleep just at night, just spiked like crazy. The duration increased by, I think it was about 15%, then I stopped taking it and went back to it's, you know, previous value. So there's something about adrenaline release, perhaps even just early in the day that seems to impact sleep at night. For people that don't have a cold plunge, and that are experiencing maybe a perhaps drop in their baseline dopamine, what are some other behaviors that can help to replenish the dopamine pool? We're talking about sleep. That would be one. And also, how you're talking about just waiting, too. How long do you have to wait to experience that? Yeah, well, cold showers always great, and it's not just zero cost. It'll save you on your heating bill. Cold showers sucks because it's almost like the fact that part of you can be out of the cold makes it worse. You got like part of you can be a slightly warmer. Whereas with the cold plunge, you're all in up to the neck, hopefully. Sometimes people get their hands out and I don't judge. I think that's fine. People have different levels of vasoconstriction and pain from the cold, so to be fair, it does not a problem to keep your hands out as I understand it. Cold showers great. I think the high intensity interval training that I know you're a big fan of, that's a remarkable tool. Not only is it brief, but it deploys all these systems, these neurochemical systems that create alertness. Also, because it's brief, and it does that, you're unlikely to fatigue yourself to the point where cognitive work is harder. There's something that isn't often discussed, but a good hard work, like workout, mid-morning for me, is great. But then, you know, then I eat a meal, and then by two or three in the afternoon, I haven't measured my brain oxygenation levels at those times, but I am not focused. It is really hard to focus. Whereas it's interesting if I exercise earlier in the day, I notice a significant increase in energy all day long. I don't know why that is, or if anyone else has experienced that. But certain resistance training regimens can be really depleting, especially if you're doing sets to failure. And I try and limit my resistance training I do it three times a week, ideally, and I try and do 10 minutes or 15 minutes of warm-up, usually a smaller movement or something like that, some warm-up sets, and then 45 to 55 minutes of work. And that's it. And the reason is, if I leave the gym then, I have energy to spare, mental and physical energy. Whereas if I take it to the point where everything's left on the mat, you know, I'm just depleted. I actually am depleted for several hours, if not days afterwards. Maybe my recovery quotient is as intense as good. Maybe I'm not hydrating enough, but I try and do all the things. And still that's the case. So what I recommend people do, this is just what's worked for me, if they are a person that has other demands in life, they're not an athlete or solely devoted to their physical fitness. As I try and make 85% of my workouts, about 80 to 85% in 10 city. Meaning, I'm not doing forced repetitions, I'm not pushing past an hour of total work, maybe even more like 45 to 55 minutes of total work. I try and do an additional 10% of workouts at higher-intensing 90% intensity. And this is all subjective, but this would mean more sets to failure. This would mean a couple of advanced things like forced reps or drop sets that would last set of exercise. And then maybe just 5% of workouts, resistance or cardiovascular workouts are all out everything I can give. And so that really ends up being like, I don't know, just a few per year. For me this last year, the the hardest workout I did, maybe ever, was that 72 pound rock carry that camhains had me do. Because there were moments training that thing, I told myself I was going to put the rock down and then when you say it on camera, you better not put the rock down and cams there. And I just decided, that's it, this is the one, this is it for me is like an 11 out of 10 effort. You know, this, I, I don't know what more I had in me, Goggins would probably say, I was only at 40% of what I could give, but it felt to me like everything I could possibly give. I don't do that sort of training very often. And I find it takes us back to a couple of important things. One is the best way to get and stay in great shape is to not get hurt. You do those kinds of workouts too often. You're the person, the guy I got with the injury that you're always talking about, right? Then we hear from, you know, my back, my this, my that. And they're not training or they're in surgery or they're have to deal with pain, stuff, which, fortunately, I don't. The other reason is that if you leave some gas in the tank, when we say gas in the tank, I don't think we're just talking about glycogen and caloric energy. I think we're talking about the riding of that neurochemical wave front and no doubt, endocrine, hormonal wave front, also and using that for other things. I mean, I use the coal plunge because I like the way it makes me feel and I can apply it to work. I can apply it to energy. I can apply it to mood outside of the coal plunge. I don't live to get in the coal plunge. I use the coal plunge to live. You know, that wasn't meant to be a, you know, saying, but same thing with working out, I used the gym, I enjoy working out, I love running, but I use it as a stimulus for the brain that then I can go apply and be more present for other things. And I think if people looked at physical exercise that way, I think A will be less daunting, B, they really start to understand and appreciate how the physiology and one endeavor tethers to another endeavor. And you start to learn a lot about yourself. I mean, this is becoming a bit more, you know, subjective as I describe it, but, you know, for me, learning how one's body works and how the brain and body interact and how exercise influences cognitive function and mood. And I find it so important because that's how you navigate the challenges and also the great stuff of life, whereas getting really tacked to just performance in the workout and then constraining it like that's it. Doesn't, doesn't do much for me. Put differently, I have a little note on my laptop, which says, you know, completing a short bout of hard work always makes me feel better. And I have to remind myself that, yeah, it's kind of cheesy, it's corny, I get it. But I wrote it, so I put it there. And I know that in the morning, there's this time when I can drift into doing things that are very passive consumption. But if I do one thing, read one chapter of a book, put together a post that is hard to deliver in one take or go and read a paper or do something that's challenging. It's like this lift in my brain and body that I can't describe. It's like I did the cold plunge. I have a long arc of elevated sense of accomplishment and well-being and motivation. And I, we have done the brain imaging experiment, but no doubt it's the translation of the activation of these very generic, all-form circuit, or I should say circuits for all forms of motivation to other things that I pivot into. So again, it's subjective. I'm not talking about a peer-reviewed study in that case, but I find it to be very useful just to learn how to do something challenging. And along those lines, for me, for going along that I just so excited about, there's this literature that's emerged recently on the anterior mid-singulate cortex, which is a brain area, most neuroscience is, are in a way of, but my colleague gets Stanford Joe Parvisi, who's a neurosurgeon, was poking around in the brain area, stimulating it in a patient, and then subsequently other patients and found that if you stimulate it in the anterior mid-singulate cortex, these patients would describe a feeling, a subjective feeling of like a storm coming, or a challenge, and they felt like they were going to lean into it. Super interesting. Move the electrode back a little bit further. They don't report anything like that. Stimulate again in anterior mid-singulate cortex. There's a challenge coming, but I can take it. That's amazing. This is a state shift, and a cognitive shift into, I, forward center of mass. There are other studies showing that this brain area is maintained in size, in volume, in people that maintain cognitive function later into life. It increases in size, and even activity in people who are successful dieters. It atrophies in people that fail to reach certain goals. There's now a, you know, not a huge, but a decent size body of work, supporting the fact that the anterior mid-singulate cortex, which by the way is a hub that gets input from lots of systems, including the dopamine system, memory, lots and lots of different brain areas, inputs and outputs to anterior mid-singulate cortex. But it's a brain area that is engaged and that seems to increase in activity, and maybe even size, when we engage in effort that we don't want to engage in. So if you love working out, probably less activation of this brain structure, if you force yourself to do something, more activation of this brain structure, it seems to be related to its synacity, willpower, and possibly, again, possibly the desire to live. It might even be part of the circuitry to continue pushing on in life, you know, kind of a high-level concept, but these, what they call super-ajors, have, if you look at the brain areas that maintain size into later adulthood, as compared to age match controls, the anterior mid-singulate cortex is one of the two that represents the most significant difference. So I find this brain area be really cool, and if ever there was motivation for taking on some hard things or a hard thing that you don't want to do, maybe it's resisting doing something, maybe it's doing something. I think it's the data on the anterior mid-singulate cortex. This, along the same lines, it kind of reminds me of some of an I'd be curious to know what your thoughts are on the quality of data. If you've, if you've looked at it, doing something like direct trans-cranial direct stimulation or trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, maybe that brain region, or, you know, I think the prefrontal cortex in terms of motivation. I mean, I think I came across the study. It was like people, they stimulated a certain brain region, and they were motivated to work out. Like they were like motivated to exercise. Yeah, I haven't seen that paper when it makes, I said, sure, because it makes perfect sense, you know, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, non-abase of approach, which originally was used to quiet brain at areas. Now, can be used to stimulate brain areas. Ultra-sound now can be, can do this as well. My colleague Nolan Williams at Stanford is using this in combination with studies of psychedelics to increase plasticity in certain brain regions. I mean, it's a wonderful, in principle, wonderful, non-invasive way to activate or deactivate certain brain regions. It makes perfect sense to me that if one were to stimulate certain brain regions, people would feel more alert, more ready to go. In fact, there's a beautiful description of vagal nerve stimulation in a, I think it's a New Yorker article about my colleague Carl Diceroth, one of the greatest neuroscientists of all time, is a bioengineer, a psychiatrist. And in that article, they describe an interaction you add with a patient. She has a stimulator on her vagus nerve. A lot of people think the vagus nerve stimulation always leads to states of calm. That is not true. vagal nerve stimulation is one way to increase arousal and alertness. So we need to revise our understanding or the sort of popular understanding of vagus. There's a conversation that's recorded in that article where this patient is sadly suicidally depressed. She's saying, you know, I don't want to live. I don't anticipate much of a future. I can't get excited about things. They ramp up the stimulation on her vagus nerve, which feeds into a number of the sort of core arousal circuits within the brain, hypothalamus, locuser, earliest, and elsewhere, other indirectly or directly. And in real time, she starts saying, yeah, you know, I could imagine myself going out and applying for a job or, you know, pursuing some, you know, it's like you're watching these depressive tone peel away and not just peel away to a place of neutrality, but peel away to a place of forward center of mass. If ever, there was evidence that like what goes on in our brains is influencing these broad motivational and psychological states, it's that. And I realize as people hear that a lot of people say, well, of course, it's the brain. It's to stimulate one brain region, you get rage, to stimulate another brain region, people lean into efforts to stimulate another brain region, people start crying in our sadden they don't know why. It all makes sense. But what's so exciting about trans-cranial magnetic stimulation is that it's non-invasive. So we're not talking about a surgery. I think the issue is how precisely the stimulation can be delivered and then how persistently it needs to be delivered. So I would do people have to return to the clinic over and over again. And I really think in the next five, 10 years, thanks to the efforts of neural link and and other laboratories, I mean, to be fair, you know, brain augmentation through electrodes is something that's been going on in academic laboratories for a long time. Neural link is, you know, making great progress there as well. But I think the development of non-invasive tools, maybe it'll be, you know, you go in and they, you know, shave a small patch of hair, got for bed, we'll get it'll grow back. And then they put a little, let's say dime size stimulator on the surface of the skull and close that up. And then by Bluetooth, everyone's a while someone is just stimulating magnetic stimulation of some brain area and they're feeling better. I imagine that will happen within five years or so. I don't think that it's going to require a wire down deep into the brain in every case. There will be cases where that's required, neurosurgery. But I think we're very quickly headed towards a time where non-invasive tools for directed brain stimulation and everybody who needs it is going to be the reality. And the beauty of neuroscience over the last 10 years is that the, the circuitrys are being identified. I mean, what you need to know which brain area is to target. Right. The anterior mid-singlet cortex has been on the anatomy charts for a long time, but wasn't clear what it did. And so all this poking around with electrodes and neurosurgery patients is, um, is with purpose and goodness. I mean, I can't think of a more important thing. And also, if you think about it, you're talking about the release of neurochemicals from specific circuits to get specific results. When people take a drug, which is one of the best tools we have now, people take a drug like, let's say, well, be you trying to increase dopamine and neuropinephrine. It's doing that all over the brain. It's doing that, you know, in wherever, you know, those neuromodulators are able to be released. It's not selective for one particular circuit. It's also causing changes in the body. It has some positive effects, you know, but hopefully, um, but potentially some negative effects. It depends. And dosages are hard to adjust in a very, in a very precise way. It's also hard to know in real time what's going on, because you adjust the dosages and takes two or three days or more for the changes to occur with trans-cranial magnetistimulation. You can know instantly, you know. And so I'm very excited about this. Also, that the polarity of the stimulation can be switched from activation to inhibition. You know, you always love that double dissociation in any experiment, activate this brain area, get effect X. Deactivate the area, get the exact opposite effect. Right? Somebody feels worse when you deactivate it. They feel better when you activate it as compared to baseline. Great. You now have pretty clear understanding what this brain area is involved in probably involved in other things, but at least that. Awesome. And that's, that's not far off. And it's happening in labs now. It's super exciting and fascinating. I want to, like, talk, kind of shift gears for a minute and talk about, you know, like, I didn't get a good sleep. I don't know for a couple nights in a row. And I, you know, have deadlines and things to work on. I was feeling very amotivated, as you like to say. And so I was, you know, of course, deep in some of your stuff. And came across this non-sleep deep rest. And I had never heard of it. I mean, I'm sure, you know, become popular since you've talked about it. But I would love for you to talk about the non-sleep deep rest and STR. And, you know, so sleep is important for replenishing dopamine and I didn't, I didn't get that for replenishment of dopamine. And so some tools that people can do, again, we're talking about behavioral tools that we've just mentioned a few. But this, this non-sleep deep rest is interesting to me and how it can help replenish the baseline pools. Yeah. So, um, I first thought about and learned about something called yoga knee-dra. Yoga knee-dra means yoga sleep. There's a thousand year old or more, um, protocol where you lie down. And you try to stay awake while remaining completely still and involve some long exhale breathing, which we know slows the heart rate through respiratory sinus A rhythm. Yeah, which is a good thing. So it's a heart rate. And it is, it had long been used as a way to offset sleep loss, as well as to just create states of replenished mental and physical vigor, even if you slept well. And there are a bunch of theories and some, actually interesting writings about yoga knee-dra potentially allowing people to, um, tap into intentions and things like that. Okay, great. I learned about this process, by the way, I went and somewhere around 2015, 2016, I had decided to shift a significant portion of my lab from animal studies to human studies. And I was very interested in stress mitigation and trauma. So I went and visited a trauma treatment center in Florida where they were doing yoga knee-dra with people every morning for an hour. They would wake up, they would do this yoga knee-dra for an hour. I decided to participate once or twice and I found it to be incredibly restorative because I wasn't sleeping well on that trip and I would come out of it thinking like, I just fell like I slept eight hours, I only slept four or five broken hours, I do this one hour of yoga knee-dra and whoa, so amazing. Like this is wild. This is a big effect. What is this? Go back to my laboratory. We're studying stress, stress mitigation techniques. And for whatever reason, you know, I decided, okay, what could talk about yoga knee-dra, but it's a little bit like talking about meditation and then you have these name which is, you know, located for the scientific literature because it's not clear exactly what it is. And I want to be very clear, I'm not trying to take anything away from yoga knee-dra or those practices. I've tremendous respect for them. But I came up with this thing called non-sleep-deep-raster NSTR for short, which a gives people some sense of what they're doing. And b, strips away the intentions and any kind of mysticism whatsoever. And it really just involves lying down for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes or an hour, I suppose. And people are doing long-exil breathing, slow their heart rate and calm down, doing a sort of body scan of paying attention to different parts of their body, trying to stay awake, but if they fall asleep, it's okay. We observe that it creates very dramatic decreases in sympathetic autonomic rals, aka alertness, and places the brain into and body into kind of a shallow state of sleep, not surprising, but a state that is unusual, and at least to my knowledge, not observed in other meditative states, that at least to my knowledge. But to be fair, we didn't do neuroimaging of this, so we didn't have a lot of insight into it. I started digging around in the literature and turns out there's a study out of a medical hospital in Denmark that had people doing yoga knee-dra for an hour. So very similar protocol, but an hour. And using what's called positron emission, tomography, measuring the amount of dopamine in the reserve pool in a certain key area, the brain called the stradome, which is involved in the generation of movement. It's also part of the reward of motivation pathway. Although there are a bunch of different pathways for dopamine, so I want to be clear about that. We talked about that earlier. So what they observed was really interesting. They observed at least by positron emission tomography that people who did this one hour yoga knee-dra protocol, experienced a 60% above baseline increase in dopamine in these key brain areas. Just from this hour of lying there completely still, trying to stay awake, listening to this script relaxation. I think like this is wild. And then there's some other study showing that post-yoga knee-dra performance on memory tasks or other cognitive tasks is improved. I got very excited about this and started whittling down the non-sleep deep breast protocol to what we hope is the minimal effective dose, which is about 10 minutes of non-sleep deep rest. We've done some exploration of that in my lab. Currently there is a collaboration brewing between myself and Dr. Matthew Walker, the author of why we sleep, the Great Sleep Bridge, Researcher, the Great Matt Walker, to explore what is happening at a neural level using brain imaging during non-sleep deep rest. Matt has some, my understanding is some inside or hypotheses. I don't know what exactly is based on something I want to be very clear. This is all very, very preliminary. That certain pockets of the brain might be able to go under ghost sleep-like states in things like NSTR, yoga, and utra. That is not whole brain sleeping, but it might be pockets of brain areas going to sleep-like states. But the whole purpose of doing these experiments going forward, this collaboration is to figure out exactly what's happening at a neural level during non-sleep deep rest and how closely it mimics sleep. Can you recover sleep that you lost? We don't know. Here's what we do know subjectively. And again, this is anecdata, if you will. These are people who have challenges falling asleep often benefit from doing non-sleep deep rest, a 10-minute or 20-minute protocol, at any time of day or night, because it's teaching you to self-direct your own relaxation. It's different than meditation, because meditation involves focusing. Meditation is really a focusing perceptual exercise. Think about your third eye center, focus on your breath, redirect your focus every time it drifts. Meditation is a focus exercise and work from when he says, Ooke is lab at NYU is shown that it can improve performance in different cognitive tasks, but the traditional forms of meditation sometimes can disrupt people's ability to sleep well. Why? Well, you're increasing focus capacity to fall asleep. You need to kind of defocus and let go of your thoughts. It's kind of interesting at the beginning of all Yogan-Eager scripts. At least the ones I've heard, you hear, you're going to move from thinking and doing to being and feeling very new agey language. But let's explore that. Thinking and doing is about anticipation. It's about memory to feeling and being. You're going into as much as possible purely sensory state. You're focusing on just how things feel. You're not thinking into the future past. You're just thinking the future or past. You're just feeling sensation in your body. Very interesting. And so different than meditation, different than hypnosis. Hypnosis is a sort of meditation designed to solve a specific problem. Quit smoking, relax, less pain. Meditation more of a focus exercise. Non-sleep deep rest is used to restore mental and physical vigor and to teach you to relax yourself. So it can be done in the middle of the night if you're having trouble sleeping. It can be done in the morning. This is when I typically like to do it. This morning, I woke up at five that's a little early for me. I should have a phone call for about an hour and then I realized, goodness, I got to get up soon. I'm going to take 30 minutes into a 30 minute non-sleep deep rest. In this case, it was yoga, knee-dra. I come out of that. And I recall falling, being in a pseudo sleep state, and I personally just feel as if I slept eight hours. And many people report the similar sensation. And again, it's subjective, but I think if ever there was a protocol that is useful for people to explore, given that it's safe, it's zero-cost, and that sleep is so important and mental and physical vigor is so important. And the date on dopamine, it's a 10 to 20 minute yoga knee-dra or NSTR script. We've put a few of those out there on YouTube, and there are a lot of them out there. I really like if I want to female voice, I'll listen to the ones by comedy-desai, D-E-S-A-I, or Kelly Boyz, B-O-Y-S. She's on the waking up app. She's terrific NSTR scripts and yoga knee-dra scripts, and then there's some with my voice. I can't bear to hear the sound of my own voice, believe it or not. So we have a 10 minute and 20 minute one at our Clips channel, and there are a bunch of you Spotify scripts and you can find them out there. But to me, it's one of the more interesting aspects of protocols, meaning, you know, we have exercise protocols. We have nutrition protocols. We have deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure protocols. What about protocols for restoring mental and physical vigor that aren't meditation, that aren't hypnosis, that aren't pharmacology? And what does that look like? It's taking the brain out of that anticipatory mode. So if we speculate, go, okay, move from thinking and doing to being in feeling. Again, very new agey. But what are we doing? We're deliberately shifting our thinking away from the very types of thought and action that deplete the dopamine reserve. And should we be surprised that there's this significant increase in dopamine in the striatum, post-yoganegir, or NSTR, probably not, because you're not tapping into that neural circuitry for a period of time. It also underscores the extent to which in our waking life, we are constantly in gold-directed behavior even when we don't realize it. And so, I find NSTR to be among the most potent and important tools or protocols that I've used in my own life, I've continued to do it about once a day. Any time a day or night, sometimes based on need to get more sleep, sometimes just as a practice. And even 10 minutes of NSTR for me, I emerge from that feeling completely different and always better. I did your 10-minute one of your 10-minute NSTRs. It made me feel better. And I didn't, like I said, I hadn't gotten sleep in the last two nights. And good sleep, it was like my sleep is disrupted. And so I stopped and I did your protocol and listening to your voice was very soothing. And it also helped me, like I was able to shift right back into my work. And I don't know if it's because I was understanding, I was trying to read how it's affecting dopamine or replenishing dopamine. And so I sort of believed myself into it, or if it just actually worked, right? I mean, so it's also not a nap. Well, I'm glad you had a good experience with it. If people don't, of course, there's no obligation to do it again, it's different than a nap because it does not create sleep inertia. Matt Walker has talked about the fact that not everyone needs to nap, but a nap can improve cognitive performance. If you're going to nap, don't let up to late in the day or certainly not if it's going to disrupt your nighttime sleep. A 20-minute nap seems to be the limit beyond which it can increase sleep inertia. You can wake up feeling groggy, have trouble waking up and then people then will use caffeine and then it just drops their sleep. I like a 20-minute to 30-minute nap. I'm guilty of sometimes taking a 30-minute nap. A yoga needra is being awake while deeply relaxed. And that's a very unusual state. I also want to just speculate a little bit further. There's some interesting ideas out there about how body still mind active states can be very useful for creativity. We had a couple of guests on the podcast including Caroldizer off. He has a practice believer or not where he sits completely still, deliberately completely still and forces himself to think in complete sentences for about an hour at night as a way to sort of practice thinking. Very interesting body still mind active. Then Rick Rubin when he was on the podcast, not a scientist, but we unfortunately had to be friends with Rick he does something similar. What is a part of life where the brain is very active, the body is completely still and is known to be associated with ideas learning and creativity. Rapid eye movement sleep. So there's something about the body being still and the mind remaining active that may lend itself to certain types of cognitive effort or cognitive endeavors. I don't know this hasn't really been explored using neuro-imaging, but I'm excited about this as a potential tool. And non-sleep depressed in yoga, Neudra, again the writing about it tends to be from these more ancient traditions. But starts off talking about replenishment of sleep, learning how to relax, etc. But remember they were doing this at a trauma treatment clinic and I asked them why. You know, as it's just calm everybody down, make sure they get enough sleep and they said, no we're doing so much work here trying to get people to remap their relationship to traumas. And they were really ahead of their time in understanding that the actual rewiring of neural circuits occurs during sleep. So they want to maximize the amount of depressed that people were getting to maximize the rewiring. But also that in these states of depressed, you also replenish the ability to lean into what really is the hard work of trauma therapy. It's not easy. And does the brain rewire itself more readily if we're NSTR, yoga, Neudra, I don't know. I suspect yes, based on the similarity to sleep, but that's one of the things that Matt and I would like to explore. Can it replace sleep that one's lost? Can it enhance the speed of learning? Can it reinforce learning in the same day? Because there's a thing called the first night effect where the first night of sleep after about of learning is really critical for consolidating that learning. But let's face it sometimes we don't get that night of sleep. So can you wake up the next morning and do a 30 minute NSTR and consolidate learning? Sometimes that learning is new information. Sometimes that learning is the dumping of information you don't want. This is why people were rapid. I movement sleep deprived, often carry forward a lot of emotionality that frankly they would like to unload then you get a great night sleep and you're like that thing that was bothering me. That's like nothing now. So rapid I movement sleep is incredibly important. And yoga, Neudra, aka NSTR, I should say NSTR is a buildout from yoga, Neudra, and fairness. I think is a super powerful technique and 10 minutes is a pretty minor investment. We've been talking a lot about things that are positive behaviors to engage in and prove our motivation, our focus attention, dopamine, system, replenishing the baseline. There's also behaviors to avoid as we touch on a little bit and probably one of the biggest elephants in the room here would be the technology or smart devices or smart phones. You mentioned the brain loves visual information and also the fact that we're addicted to getting, looking at our likes and when we get a lot of likes, we get dopamine peak and it's rewarding. And so- Usually rewarding endsets the expectation for the next time. Right. And the algorithms are very clever. Everyone's in a while and a new account comes up. I know someone who recently started posting and posts get some feedback, posts get some feet and then boom, something takes off, gets a million and a half views. That will change their relationship to social media, maybe forever. It's just chasing that thing. And it's very clever. It's very clever. Not always die-ballicle, but very clever. So I mean, what is that? There's a couple of questions. One is, what is that doing for our ability to live in like everyday life? That isn't like that. First of all, the visual information isn't there. It's not as moving rapidly and all that things. And also get that huge peak from a million and a half views. Every day life isn't usually like that. And then the second is, how can someone have a more healthy habit? Like, you and I, we have to use social media for our work. And a lot of people are like that. You know? And so there's, like, what's the healthy balance? How can you find it? Have you found it? Have I found it? Most of the time, not all the time. I think two things, one is an observation, one is a perhaps a suggestion, two everyone. The observation is that disengaging from social media takes time, but it happens very readily every single time. So for instance, get off work, you're still on your phone, you're still on your phone, you're with family, still on your phone. They're like, hey, wanting to engage, you put it away, expect some agitation. Expect like something's been taken away from you. It's this kind of low-level malaise. Other things aren't as interesting. I mean, hopefully one's life is interesting, and hopefully isn't just drawing us out out of like urgent demand. But it requires a little bit of time. If you've ever gone camping or you don't have access to your phone, in fact, this coming weekend, I'm going to take three days away from my phone. And I'm sure getting back to the phone will feel a little bit oppressive. It'll feel like a little bit oppressive. But once the phone is away, expect, I don't know, 20 minutes to an hour during which you don't feel quite right, maybe even some underlying anxiety because it's that it's an unconscious anticipation. So that's my observation. The suggestion I have for people to have a healthy relationship with social media, it's one actually that I learned from a professional poker player, which is play for time. If you're winning, don't stay there. You're losing. I don't want to suggest people gamble. But this is all just translating a social media, play for time. Designate how much time you're going to spend on there and a given bout. So for me, getting a post up once every day or so, maybe four times a week is kind of the goal. And I try and mix up the form of post. And I have rules for myself. Most specifically, I try and make sure that 90% of posts are so the audience can learn something useful, hopefully also interesting and actionable, etc. Ken present her from my delight. I can't help it. Or where I'm curious about, I'm kind of peaning the audience for their thoughts, because I genuinely want to know. I got was walking up a reset with my girlfriend a few weeks ago and saw this sign outside a store and said, we have a ozempic and mungioro. And I took a picture of it and thought, that's kind of weird. It's normally you see like we have a lot of days or something. And I just kept walking. And then when I got back to California, I posted that on social media. I thought, kind of curious, what do people think of a zempic and mungioro? I know it's controversial. I'll just ask people. And it just tons of engagement. I didn't even expect it. But I'm learning a lot from all those comments. So I have rules. But the main rule is, I don't let myself, or I try to not let myself pick up the phone and just any at any old time and go into social media. I really try. I don't always succeed, but I really try. And if I'm going to be on there, like, okay, I'm on here now for an hour or I give myself an hour. That's the best thing I can do. I also know that if I answer a few comments, I'm kind of a runaway train when it comes to people pinging me with questions about science. It's very hard for me not to reply. So I have to limit myself to five to fifteen responses and then I actually feel some anxiety as I go to do my life activities and I have to tell myself, they'll be okay. It's just kind of like, you ask a professor at least, this professor, a question about something. If I know the answer, like, I'm going to try and tell you. So there's always that agitation, but for me, so expect that agitation when you set it away and play for time. Don't base it on any particular mode of engagement or whether or not it feels good or doesn't feel good, play for time. So decide, I'll be on here for 30 minutes. And it's interesting because when I don't do that, when I start to notice, as I'm scrolling, but I don't even know what I'm doing. Like, what am I doing here? Like, what am I doing here? Like, I don't even know what I care about. This thing or that thing. It's nice to see people in their events. I love the baby picks and the animal picks and our friends in the podcast space. It's always great to see and to learn. I learn a lot from your post. I genuinely do. I learn a lot from Lane, Lane Norton's post, I genuinely do and I really enjoy the podcasters, the public facing health folks. But I know also when I remind myself that for me, the real raw materials for the podcast, unless it's opposed from you to be honest, I'm not just saying that, the real raw materials tend to come from PubMed. They come from books. They come from papers. Then I'm reading thoughts that I'm going to have like conversations I'm going to have. And so those are the raw materials for my work and that social media is more of a mode of consumption and occasionally broadcast. Exyn Twitter, totally different picture because I now go on exyn Twitter and I know they're going to try and get me through a, let's just call it a psychosocial dynamic. Someone, like you're on there to see how people are going to engage. It is a little bit more combative. It also can be really supportive because of the meteor retweet function. You see something you like. You can get out to a lot of people. You can link out to things. But it's more of a, like the center of the town square where everybody's interacting. And so I have a very clear cognitive pictures of Instagram feels pretty benevolent to me. People have to generally show their face. X feels like, okay, do I really want to engage in this very intense dynamic? So I go on X far less and I've had much more polarized responses to things that I put up there. I've had things clipped out of context. I've had attacks and and I just don't enjoy being angry. I don't enjoy feeling that friction. It just sucks for me. And I don't like seeing other people suffer. So on X, I see just a lot more of that and I've got nothing against it and I think they've done great things with the platform. But I just have to just be really protective of myself to not go there terribly much. Is there like a study that has shown that there's a maximum amount of time that adults may be children versus adults should spend with their smart devices to, you know, for prevent these huge amplitude and peaks and dopamine where they're just getting, you know, really rewarding things or even just like you're saying negative things, that can be in a way. It's very, you know, you're getting that engagement and then you know, it's the clapped back, you know, if you get a good clap back on somebody. I mean, there's a neuroscientist up at University of Washington, Sam Golden, who's shown that, you know, animals will work for the opportunity to fight. Don't work for it. We never understood this until recently. I mean, you could say we always understood that. But no, you know, humans probably do, you know, engaging in those kind of high intensity ways can be rewarding for some folks, even for people who don't like that unless they're really conflict the verse. It has a certain level of a route. Like a rousal itself can become rewarding, right, just that the engagement, when I say rousal, like the level of cognitive engagement, especially if the rest of life feels kind of passive and uninteresting. There have not been clear studies that I'm aware of, but at the same time, if I think of something like virtual reality, like my colleague at Stanford, Jeremy Balinson has done, it's one of the early pioneers of virtual reality. And as virtual reality came to be, they established, and I'll get the numbers wrong here. So for Jimmy Jeremy, you have to look this up. But, you know, limits of, you know, kids should only be in the VR goggles for X number of minutes per day. And it was minutes. Otherwise, there's rewiring of the visual system and vestibular system, the balance system in ways that might not be healthy. They had real clear limits and guidelines with social media, sort of like as much as you want. And then, of course, there's the intrusion of social media and tablet use and phone use into sleep, where then you're depleting the replenishment of the dopamine reserve. Right? So then there's all that contextual stuff. I think an hour a day on Instagram, if you think about, that's a pretty significant investment. And with X, I can't even make a recommendation. I do go on there and post. I have kind of a bittersweet relation to it right now. Lex Friedman, my buddy, our buddy, as a far more kind of symbiotic relationship with X. It just sort of like works for him. Whereas I feel that more on an Instagram platform. And it's just different cultures and maybe I need to adjust my follows and so on. But I think an hour a day to me just seems like, okay, that's plenty and is enough. What role do you think that going to things like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, this context switching where you're working, but then you check in Twitter and then what role is that playing in our ability to focus and attention, ADHD like symptoms? I read last night. One in nine children has ADHD. Now, I don't know what that actually means, but yeah, wow, exactly. So yeah, I think the because I grew up and spent still a fair amount of time in the Bay Area, although I'm in Los Angeles, far more now. An interesting question is always to ask the heads of these companies or the CEOs, how long they let their kids be on social media, and you'll often find that it's a very, very small number. And that tells you something right there. Okay, so I think the task switching, the context switching, no doubt is impairing adult's ability to adults's ability to engage and stay engaged in one thing. Reading a book, unless it's extremely engaging, is going to be less attention harnessing than social media. Why is social media as movies? Why you're scrolling? I mean, the brain has never seen this kind of thing before. Even you have 300 channels on your television, you know, just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling at short distance with the feedback of people you recognize and just isn't true for most people with watching television or and feedback and likes and comments and clap backs and attacks and reward. I mean, it's incredible. I think I'm a, you know, I'm a content consumer, but I'm a content creator as you are of course, and I like to think in terms of our, we consuming content or we creating content and just being very judicious about consumption of content. I mean, I think it's great fun and I encourage people to put stuff out on social media. In fact, recently a clip was cut. There was like a math gap that I did and I came out and apologize for the error I occasionally make errors in podcasts and we put them in the captions, but anyway, put something out there, but the caption to that post was, you know, I would hate for anyone to resist posting their creative thoughts, their creative outlet for fear of attack or making mistakes. I think we need to sound kind of like, you know, it's a party line now, but to foster a community of people like encouraging people to create stuff and put it online. But that's different than just passive consumption all the time. I think there's so much good to be had with social media, but I think an hour a day on Instagram, maybe 30 minutes a day on X, and you're good. And even there are 90 minutes out of your waking day, and then what part of your day? This is an important, you know, when I look at my day, I know that when I wake up in the morning, I'm a little groggy, but then I've got three or four hours that if I can get, if I'm going to get really quality worked on, it's in that three or four hours or the three or four hours right after lunch. And that's it. I'm not the kind of person that's doing quality work now between the hours of 8pm and midnight. It's just not happening anymore. It happened years ago, but it's not happening anymore. So where is that 60 to 90 minutes falling is also key? Maybe it should be for an hour or so before bedtime, provided it's not too stimulating. Maybe it should be over your lunch break and you just handle it then. But when it's first thing in the morning, then several times throughout the morning, and then later in the afternoon, and then in the evening, I think what I'm describing is not unusual. And not unusual, not just for kids, you know, Jonathan Hates work that's being discussed so much now about social media consumption and the challenges and concerns with that. But also in adults, I mean, since when I'm 48 years old, and it's kind of remarkable. I mean, I see people from my high school class and like, I'm one of them, so I can only laugh at myself here. But it's like, we're grown adults, like posting what we did and like showing it off to the world. There's a kind of teenage element to it. It's kind of like silly if I really step back from it. I go away like are the adults behaving like kids and the kids are behaving like adults. Like what's going on here? And again, there's use of sharing science and other creative crafts and, well, aren't they chasing the dopamine like? Yeah, it just shows that adults are just as prone to it. But it's sort of if we step back and look to ourselves like an experiment, we'd say, wow, you know, like the people in the, you know, 35 to 60 year old range of the species that we call human is going to like doing the same stuff that the kids are doing. It's maybe you just say, well, duh, but it's interesting. I mean, you know, and you say, well, like, how good or poor one's life is that? And so I think about this stuff a lot. But I'm on there and I teach and I enjoy it and I learn and, you know, and I'll continue. But I think one has to be really discerning and set constraints. Absolutely. I mean, if it's tapping into your dopamine system and you're, I mean, if it's, if it's kind of like that substance, right, it's technology. It's not methamphetamine. It's not cocaine. But it sure has heck is affecting your dopamine system. And so it absolutely is. And it also has the potential for a lot of problems. You know, this isn't domain that, you know, I have expertise in or that is covered on the podcast. But, you know, there's this guy on Houston's in podcast with Lex Friedman and he's been on a few others, James Sexton. He's a, he's a divorce lawyer in New York and he talks about how the Adventist social media has created this huge surge in, um, I don't know, overall divorce rates. But then, you know, he talks about the trajectory of a lot of the failures of a lot of marriages. And it's like, you know, that and actually people have talked about Instagram as like one of the main dating apps. It's not sold as a date. It's not offered as a dating app. But this is where a lot of people meet. They see people that used to know, hey, how's it going? And then the conversation converts. I mean, this is, you know, I'm, I'm not, they're saying, I'm not passing judgment. I'm just saying, you know, there's a lot in the landscape of social media that lends itself to too much ease in certain types of human interaction and that inhibits our ability to do things that are really functional for our relationships and for our professional lives. And for family, I mean, you know, or just presence, you know, just like being there, um, not to get sentimental here. But that graduated advisor I was talking about before. Unfortunately, passed away young. She had the BRAC mutation died at 50. Her name was Barbara Chapman had two lovely daughters. Actually, the second one just finished university in neuroscience is so super happy for her. And I'll never forget at her, um, it wasn't her funeral, but it was a kind of like celebration of life thing after she ended that her daughters, maybe it was one or both talked about how one of the best things about their mom and their memories of their mom was unstructured time with her. Where she would just like sit with them and hang out and they would just like do stuff. And she wasn't heavy user of the phone. So that was 2014, she passed away. So phones were kind of really beginning to pick up in terms of their use smartphones. But I, that, that, rung in my mind because I was thinking, wow, like of all the things for children to remember about their deceased mom. It was the unstructured time. It wasn't the, the giants game, although they probably remember that. They were big giants fans or other things. But it's the unstructured time that we spend with people where they are giving us their full presence and we're giving them our full presence. And then you look around it like dinner tables now and restaurants, you look around and like everyone's on their phones. Anyway, I'm saying what everyone already knows and I'm guilty of it too. But I think we, the world is due for an adjustment. So I'm, I mean, kind of all on the same lines of this technology thing. But shifting gears more to light, circadian rhythm. I mean, this is vision. This is my favorite top. This, yeah, perhaps your, your favorite top. I am obsessed. Yeah. I, you know, I spend a lot of time at my computer as do you and many people. And we're all, you know, we spend a lot of time indoors, working in our laptops or computers, whatever. And I've heard you talk about something very interesting, which is this low-angle, soul, low-solar angle, you know, viewing. And I'd love to have you elaborate on that because I've always heard and such and panda was the first to really kind of get me interested in this topic or, or our mutual friend, wonderful chronobiologists. Yes, talking about early morning bright light exposure and how important it is for resetting our circadian rhythm, which as for people listening is our 24-hour clock. And, you know, everything is on this, the cycle as you know, more than I do about our metabolism, getting sleepy or wakefulness, as you mentioned, or arousal all this stuff. But I would love to know about this, this low-solar angle light, and how that ties into our circadian rhythm. Yeah. So, so, um, some just real quick overview of some very simple biology, lining the back of your two eyes like a pie crust is your neural retina, these are the neurons that transmit information about the amount and quality of light in our environment, to the brain. And then the brain does various things with it. There's a pathway directly from the eyes to the hypothalamus. There's a collection of neurons that are called the superchiasmatic nucleus that dictate our master circadian rhythms that's, you know, essentially cause all the other cells of our body to be on a similar schedule, or control the clocks within all the other cells of our body. There's a pathway from our neural retina's, of course, to areas of the phalamus, which is essentially a relay station up to the visual cortex for conscious perception of things like color, shape, and edges, and things like that. And this system is the main system by which we know where we are in space, vision, in physical space, and time. Now, the time part is a little bit more mysterious to most people, but the way it works is the following. Obviously, um, the sun rises in the sun sets. And our bodies, our internal milieu, need to know where we are in time within the course of a day, and longer within the course of a year, as well. We can talk about circanular rhythms in a bit, but there's a special category of neuron called the retina ganglion cell, which is the cell that actually passes electrical information into the brain. And that cell has a bunch of different types, some of them respond to edges, to colors, et cetera, but there's a specific type called the intrinsically photosensitive melanops in retina ganglion cell, a real mouthful that's such in in in San Marjotar, and Iggy Prevencio, and David Burson, and others characterized in the early 2000s, and for the subsequent years, I'm still characterizing, that is a neuron that's not as concerned with the shapes of things, or the colors of things, although we'll talk about color in a moment, but rather how bright it is in a given environment. And it is those cells and the activation of those cells that so-called sets are circadian clock, so that we have elevated daytime mood focus and alertness, and that we fall asleep at night and stay asleep. Okay, so low solar angle sunlight turns out to be the optimal stimulus for these cells. What do I mean by low solar angle? I mean when the sun is low in the sky, so that's twice it is in the morning, and in the evening, low solar angle sunlight, even on cloudy days, okay, even on overcast days, is distinctly different for the system than when the sun is overhead. Why? Okay, so we have in humans, we are tricromats, unless we're red green color blind, just like 180 males, I think. We are tricromats, we have a, what's sometimes called a blue cone of green cone in a red cone, but that really means that they respond, they absorb short wavelength, medium wavelength, or long wavelength, or long wavelength, and from that we generate this incredible thing in our brain, which is tricromacy, the ability to see the difference between reds and greens and grays and purples. It's incredible. A mantis shrimp can see far more of those things, but we can see a lot of different color variation based on the absorption of those different wavelengths of light. The intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells have their own pigment within them, they don't need input from these cones, but they get it and they use it. This is important, they get it and they use it. So these cells are brightness detectors, such that if you shine a really bright light on your eyes. Let's say in the middle of the day, you walk outside in San Diego Los Angeles, even over Caste, like before we came in here today, really bright tons of photon energy coming in far brighter than even under these bright artificial lights here, even though here it looks really bright. If we were to measure this, the environment we're in now is probably, I don't know, 1500 to 2000 looks. Outdoors is probably 10,000 to 50,000 looks. It's just a wild difference. And again, that's even behind cloud cover. The middle of the day constitutes what's called the circadian dead zone, meaning bright light at that time is known to improve mood. On the skin provided, you don't burn, maybe we talk about sunburn and sunscreen, maybe we don't avoid that third rail. By the way, I use sunscreen, the right one. As does Ronda, despite what you might read or hear about in the internet, we both said it, we both use sunscreen and we just use the right ones and avoid the wrong ones. The light in the middle of the day will improve mood by activating these melt-nops and cells. It will improve a alertness on the skin. There's evidence that it can improve the output of certain hormones, like testosterone and estrogen, feelings of well-being, study out of Israel a few years ago in cell press. But that light in the middle of the day, if you see the sun, don't stare at the sun, but if you see it, it looks like white and blue light, all wavelengths essentially coming at you. Full spectrum. In the morning, when the sun is low in the sky, you'll notice that there are blues, and there are like yellows and oranges. Maybe even reds if it's a beautiful desert sunrise. And then the evening, of course, the sunset has all that richness of the long wavelength light, orange, red, et cetera, and blue. And it turns out that the cells that set your circadian clock, these melanops and intrinsically photosensitive ganglind cells, yes, they respond to bright light, very high intensities of light, such as at midday or from a, maybe a sunlight simulator of just blue light in a home environment, if you purchase a so-called sad lamp. But the optimal stimulus is that low solar angle sunlight in the morning, especially and in the evening, because those cones, and in particular the short wavelength, responsive cones, the blue, aka blue light, and the longer wavelength, the reds, the orange, they converge in terms of driving the activation of those cells, those melanops and cells, and they activate those cells robustly early in the day, meaning when you see contrast between blue and orange or blue and red, which is characteristic of low solar angle sunlight, you are driving those the activation of those intrinsically photosensitive ganglind cells, the most, and you are sending the primordial evolutionarily conserved, robust signal to your brain, the day is starting. You're going to activate a huge number of different endocrine, neural, and other systems, immune functions in the body. Now, what this translates to is even if it's overcast, get out as soon as the sun is up. Sorry, I should restate that, even if it's overcast, as close to waking as possible, get some sunlight in your eyes. Now notice I said sunlight, you don't have to see the sun as a physical object, get the light in your eyes. Early day sunlight is going to be most valuable for setting your circadian rhythm. Now, what's interesting is that all species that we are aware of, like dogs, for instance, they're not tri-cromats, they're di-cromats, but they have a short wavelength cone and a long wavelength cone. Look at a dog in the morning or in the afternoon, and they will look in the direction of the sun. Birds have that primial that can get light through the skull, so slightly different, but most all species have some, excuse me, all species have a dedicated system in the eye and brain to extract the specific qualities of light that are present at early in the day, low solar angle sunlight, and again in the evening, low solar angle sunlight to convert that into neural and hormone signals that the brain can understand. Put very simply, get outside for five minutes or so in the morning, maybe ten minutes if it's overcast. Don't wear sunglasses for this. Don't stare at the sun. Eye glasses and contacts are fine. Don't try and do it through a window. That's not going to work too much as filtered out and just look in the direction of the sun, the general direction, and you will improve daytime mood focus and alertness, and it sets a timer for your nighttime sleep. Now, people say, well, I wake up before the sun comes out, what can I do? I was just saying, well, listen, unless you have powers, I'm not aware of it, you got to wait. If you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason for about a hundred dollars, I don't have any relationship to any of these companies. You can get a 10,000-lux light panel, and you can make your coffee in front of that. It's not quite as good as the yellow blue or inch blue contrast system that's going to come from low solar angle sunlight, but it's going to be better than nothing. Now, there's a diabolical twist in all of this, and then there's a solution, also based on low solar angle sunlight. The diabolical twist is that early in the day and throughout the day, bright artificial lights are not sufficient for all the good stuff that you want from light. You either need a sunlight simulator or ideally you just get outside for a bit in the morning. After, say, 60 hours of being awake or so, however, it only takes a small amount of bright light to coash the amount of melatonin that's present into disrupt your nighttime sleep. So, you need a lot of light early and throughout the day, but don't get sunburned and don't damage your eyes. And you want a minimal amount of light at night. In fact, I've vastly improved my transition into sleep and sleep by, I'm not talking about red light panels, but just buying some red light bulbs. There are a couple of companies that make these, you can look for the inexpensively, and just going to amber red lights before sleep for about half an hour. It's known to be to prevent some cortisol increase that can come from bright lights of the blue variety. Some people just use blue blockers and I have no objection to that. Now, what do you do if you're going to be under bright lights at night viewing evening light can partially offset the negative effects of bright light later at night. And this was shown in a really nice paper where they looked at the degree of melatonin suppression to bright light at night, depending on whether or not people had seen some bright light in that study design. A mimics sunlight in the evening for, I believe, it was somewhere between 10 and 30 minutes in the evening. Now, not everyone has time to watch a sunset in the evening, but just getting outside, popping the sunglasses off while you're walking to your car after work, it's going to partially offset some of the negative effects of artificial lights at night. And now we could get into a whole description about what's actually happening with low solar angle sunlight. And I'm happy to do that, but suffice to say that the contrast between these oranges and blues or yellows and blues or reds and blues that are occurring when the sun is relatively low in the sky. You don't actually have to see it crossing the horizon, but if you do great, relatively low in the sky, it's that contrast at about 19 Hertz, believe it or not, that's the optimal stimulation for these cells. And there is one company I don't have an affiliation called two-o-life that has developed a bulb that mimics this. It's actually built by some absolutely spectacular circadian biologists up at the University of Washington. The bulb, unfortunately for me, is a little bit cumbersome because it involves an app, and hopefully they'll make an app free version, but it flickers at 19 Hertz between blue and orange, blue and orange, it's designed to mimic the sunrise and sunset. So people can, if you're if you like geeking out on light technology, you can do that, but I think there's still some improvements that need to be made, and I'm saying this specifically, so they'll make those improvements, because I do like the technology. It's the only one that I'm aware of that's grounded in the logic of how the biology actually is organized, with this contrast between long and short wavelength light. But all this is to say, get more in sunlight in your eyes, try and get it again in the evening, great during the day, but don't burn, and at night try and dim the lights as much as you can, meaning as is reasonable for whatever activities. And don't sweat it if you don't get bright light in your eyes or sunlight early in the day once. This is a slow integrating system, but after about two or three days, you'll notice that things like your sleep will start to drift later. You're morning energy will drift later. There's also a really interesting effect of cortisol where bright light exposure early in the day increases the total amount of cortisol by about 50%. People hear cortisol and they go, I don't want elevated cortisol. You want your cortisol elevated early in the day, and then you want to taper off end of day spikes or increases in late day cortisol associated with depression and anxiety work from our psychiatry department. It's Stanford to show that and others have shown that. So you want that big amplitude and then cruising down out of that cortisol release early in the day and bright light is one way to do it. That cortisol increase will provide some important activation of certain immune system components, alertness, focus. We don't want to treat cortisol as the enemy. It's just about timing and amount. Right. You mentioned the five, even five minutes being enough early morning bright light exposure. Is it an hour and a half? How long is this low angle in the morning? How long is the low angle? Probably until depends on time of year, of course, in location where probably until about 10 a.m. or so. Just if I had to put a rough number out there. If you're waking up at 9, just get outside. If you wake up at 6, get outside. If you can catch the sunrise, amazing. That's the ticket. Most of us are not doing that. Because we are not waking up early enough necessarily, but we get up in a few year or an apartment. Can you get to a place where you can see the sunrise across the horizon? But look, if it's combined with a walk, some hydration, some caffeine, and maybe even social time or time with your dog, even better. There's no reason why you can't combine these things. Also, the cortisol one is that how much light was you? Remember how much light was needed in the morning? It was quite a bit. Yeah, and they used artificial light because it was a laboratory situation, but it was designed to mimic sunlight. I have to go look it up. I'm sorry. I don't call hours. I don't think it was hours. I think it was on the order of minutes. I'd be surprised it was more than an hour. If you get in front of one of these 10,000 looks light panels. I have one I bought at on Amazon. It sits actually on our shelf. In the morning, in the kitchen, so I'm making coffee or something. It's right there. And from my supplements actually, so I'm there. I'm going out my supplements. And there it is. It's about the size of a computer monitor. After about 5, 10 minutes in front of that thing, you kind of want to get away from it. It's really bright. Some people will get a little bit too much activation if they're in front of it for too long. Then, of course, at night, you don't want to be anywhere near that thing. You want it off. I have one in my gym as well. So if I go into my gym, the lights in my house aren't particularly bright, I'll turn that thing on. And so getting a lot of photons. But of course, nothing beats sunlight. Nothing beats sunlight. And if you get a morning walk in the direction of the sun, in the morning, as the sun is rising, that's what I mean. Then you've done something right in the line. Right. I mean, or if you just want to go outside and drink your coffee out on your, you know, portrait patio or yard. What's that? Exactly. Exactly. So along those same lines with, you know, the technology and viewing things, it's the topic of the short distance viewing. And there's something that you're really, I think pretty much, I haven't heard a lot of people talk about this in taking breaks from because we're always, again, you know, everything's so different than it was, you know, decades ago when people were not inside all the time looking at a computer or a screen, something that is very, very short distance away from our eyes. What is that doing to our vision and, and how does something like long distance viewing as you call it, help counter that? How much do you need to do? Yeah, it's wild. The rates of myopia and your sideness are going way up. Okay. On your sideness is not just a, you know, a throw away phrase, basically, as light enters the eye, you know, the lens focuses that light onto the neural retina. Nearsightness is a change in the shape of the eyeball and, and there's some other things to that have that image landing closer to the lens to close. Nearsightness, as opposed to far sideness where it lands behind the neural retina, the neural retina being the detector of that light. So there are a couple different ways to manage that one is to put a lens in front of the eye and eyeglass or a contact that then adjust the position that it arrives to the, to the neural retina. One thing I should say is that there are some big studies, many, many thousands of subjects. These are still somewhat preliminary, but they're exciting enough that most ophthalmologists who read the literature are into this, that show that kids mostly, that spend two hours or more of time out of doors during the day, even if they're on tablets or computers or phones, have a lower incidence of myopia. Now that's not perfectly, it's not causal, right? But it's interesting correlation. So get outside, maybe kids should be doing some of their work outside, again don't sound burned, but very interesting. The other thing is that early in development and really up until our, let's say, are mid-20s. If we do a lot of close viewing, the eyeball actually changes shape and lends itself to things like myopia. There's some people thinking, how could that possibly be? Well, these classic studies mainly done in chickens, but then it carries over to humans as well where they would put glasses on these animals, where they would essentially view something up close or further away or natural viewing, and the shape of the eyeball lends and therefore the position that light is focused into the eye changes. So you can create myopia by looking at things too closely for too long. And it's probably, again, probably the case that even in adulthood, if you're not myopic or near-sided, near-sided early in life, that too much close viewing causes some changes in the shape of the eyeball that does this. Okay? So the idea is pretty simple. If you're going to be looking at things up close a lot, which we all are nowadays, you would be wise to also take a few minutes each day and try and view a horizon. I mean, how often do we do that now to get some horizon viewing and or panoramic vision? So when we look at something, it's so called foviate to it, we're like directing our vision towards it, and if we really sharpen that to a point, we're doing what's called a virgins eye movement. If we were to track the movements of your eyes, you'd notice that they got focused in, we're a little bit and they'd really directed at something. That's finding good, in fact, it's great. It's part of our primate evolution to be able to do that as opposed to animals with lateralized eyes that can't really do that. But it does create a state of heightened internal arousal. There's an associated, it's really activation of locus serrulious that that brain area that we're talking about before for release of neuroopinephrane, nor epinephrine, excuse me, and other things. But it's really creating a ramp up in attention. So when you're on your phone scrolling, you're foviating to the small box, independent of what's in that small box and what you're viewing and how that's affecting you. And you just imagine the amount of time that you're doing that or texting while walking to your car while on the bus while commuting or in any kind of environment whereas for the many, many hundreds of thousands of years or more prior to that, you would just walk between things in your vision, would go into what's called panoramic vision, where you're not really foviating or placing a virgin's eye movement to anything in particular, unless you're interested in it, you're pursuing it, analyzing it, et cetera. So it can be very relaxing and beneficial to just take a walk with a couple minutes of just letting your head and eyes go wherever they want to go, not directing them to any one location in particular, meaning not looking at your phone. You can look at whatever you want as long as you want to appreciate things around you, appreciate people around you, but going to panoramic vision, long distance viewing, very useful. And if you're stuck in an indoor environment and you're finding that you're feeling anxious, sometimes that's related to all sorts of things in the room, temperature, air, people, you know, agitation, whatever, but if you want to calm down, I've talked a lot about physiological size to and hails followed by a long exhale, fastest way I'm aware of to shift your nervous system to a more pericimphathetic mode, excuse me, and calm down, but also you can dilate your gaze, even without moving your head or eyes, you don't have to be rigid with your head or eyes and like you'll fix them in place, but you can just try and view the ceiling, the walls, the floor, and everything around you and sort of more of a global manner, and that releases this intense load I'm calling, foliation or virgin's eye movement. It's a little bit of a trick, it's kind of nice because it's completely covert, you know, we're at physiological size too deep in hails through the nose followed by a long exhale through the mouth, a little bit harder to hide if you're trying to you know, cloak whatever level of anxiety one might be feeling. So if I right now went, you know, given that's me it might not be so strange, but it's a little weird to do in a meeting, but you can kind of relax yourself through going from virgins to panoramic vision, but even better would be get outside, view horizon, let your eyes sort of not sort of let them relax, so that you're not looking at one particular thing for too long, and you'll notice undoubtedly a pretty major state shift to a state of more calm. If people are in let's say an office building or something and can't, is this is this scenario where they can look out the window? Yes, yes, this would be a good case for for looking out the window, and for students who are looking out the window in class, you can just say I was trying to catch some anxiety relief, and then you may be your teacher, let you get away with it. Speaking of anxiety, I just have tried to be mindful of your time and I have to go soon, I just want to try to dive into one last topic. Sure, no, I'm enjoying this so much. And it's a topic that you really, I think have changed the public perspective in terms of public health with respect to the effects of alcohol, which you can bring. And I don't think there's any controversy about heavy alcohol use and how it's negative for every organ that we have, right? It's just very bad. There's been a lot of, I would say, conflicting ideas and conflicting research and just disagreement with respect to what would be considered maybe perhaps moderate alcohol, which many many people do one glass wine and night or something within her, or even less than that would be light alcohol consumption, so maybe less than two or three, less than three drink, three or less per week, per week. First of all, I want to talk about anxiety that triggered me, but I want to ask you about someone that's doing, let's say moderate drinking, so they're doing the glass wine and night. What's that doing to parts of the brain in terms of the structure and the function? Yeah, so first of all, do as you wish, but know what you're doing. That's my stance. I am not anti-alcohol. I'm not now alcoholic. I don't particularly like alcohol, so I can drink or not drink. I don't tend to drink. I might have a sip of alcohol. Well, it's been a long time since I've had a sip of alcohol, but you know, there's certain white tequila's I've enjoyed and like occasionally like, you know, one of those and, you know, we're a vodka soda or something. You know, it's just to be clear, like I'm not anti-alcohol. My read of the data are, as you pointed out, that yes, alcohol's a poison, but many things are a poison and the dose determines the poison. It seems that our threshold for what we call moderate or low amounts of drinking is shifting nowadays. I don't know if that is something to do with the alcohol episode that we did, but here's what I do know. The data say that zero to two drinks per week, you're probably fine. Provided you're not an alcoholic in your average, okay? And you're not pregnant, or dealing with some other, something that would make it a case where you wouldn't want to drink it all. Zero to two drinks per week. Now, what happens past two drinks per week depends on a lot of other contextual factors, okay? First of all, how well or poorly you metabolize alcohol? How much alcohol, how much alcohol dehydrogenase you tend to express? Why do I say that? Well, a lot of the, so-called negative effects of alcohol are due to disruptions in sleep and gut microbiome. So those are indirect, right? Alcohol is changing for the worse. They gut microbiome and sleep patterns. We know this. People attract their sleep. They have one drink and they're like, holy cow. My sleep is so much worse. Not just sleep score, but amount of REM sleep, amount of deep sleep, etc. Is that the director indirect cause of any kind of disruption in brain structure or in neuronal health? We don't know. But what these larger scale studies show is that if you look at the amount of gray matter thinning, which occurs with age, regardless, gray matter being the neurons in the brain, white matter being the fiber tracks, the axons and myelin in the brain, is how their image so they show up as gray or white. The amount of gray matter thinning starts to increase as you get out past two drinks per week. Can's now, is it significant enough that people should be concerned about cognitive decline as a consequence of three drinks per week and do gray matter thinning? Probably not. So then should we set the threshold at three drinks per week or four drinks per week? I don't know, and I'm not here to say that one way or the other. What I'm saying is my read of the data and I know there are people that disagree with me is that zero is better than any and that I think I'm told has brought great relief to a number of people that didn't want to drink, but that actually were drinking red wine specifically to try and get some, quote unquote, health benefits. It also brought great relief to a number of people because they tell me that did not like drinking. They didn't like the way drinking made them feel either while they were under the influence of it or maybe taste or just general malaise the next day or due to disruption and sleep. I don't really know the reasons, but for people who don't like drinking or who don't want to drink, I think there's ample evidence that zero is great that you don't need to drink. Okay, I might seem like a kind of silly statement, but I think a good number of people kind of doing it because they thought they were health benefits. Now, to be fair, most people were drinking and if they were talking about the health benefits because they like the way alcohol makes them feel. To me, it's clear that if you care very much about your brain that more than two drinks per week on a consistent basis, probably not a good idea. Now, are there exceptions to that sure? Are there people who, you know, everyone says, why are they a grandparents and they're living to be 98 and they're super sharp and they drink a shot of vodka every night. Great. I just say how much better would they have been had they not, but I also understand you need to live life and for many people, alcohol is one route by which they enjoy life more because of its relaxing effects. And that's important to note that anxiety is bad, anxiety that disrupts sleep is bad. So many people will drink to kind of provide a segue from the work day to the evening and they find it helps them calm down and sleep better, but we know it disrupts your sleep. Would it be better to not drink it all? Probably, but I want to be respectful of that scenario as well. If we look at four drinks per week, five drinks per week. Let's say a drink and I seven drinks per week. I just don't see where the debate is. To me, you look at the gray matter thinning, you look at some of the other metrics on gut microbiome, you look at the disruption and sleep and again, people should do as they wish, but know what they're doing and it's just so clear that it's not good for people and that they're doing at least some degree of harm. Now, there's also the business of off-setting harm. I would say, listen, if you're the kind of person wants to have a drink every night, be my guest if that serves you well, but you might be wise to also do some things that offset some of the, for instance, gut microbiome disruption. Perhaps pay a bit more attention to consuming one to four servings of low sugar-framented foods per day to really feed the gut microbiome. Maybe be extra thoughtful about a consistently safe schedule. Maybe the extra thoughtful about a number of other things to offset whatever negative effects are sure to be introduced by that kind of regimen. So zero's best. Two's probably fine. Three, four, five, six, seven is where are you going to shorten your life by a significant amount? Well, provide you don't drive while you're drunk. Probably not. Are you going to be disrupting your health? Probably mainly indirect effects through disrupted sleep or gut microbiome. Try and offset those effects. But then once you get past a drink per night, which many people are consuming, then I think there's general agreement, higher incidence of cancers, especially in women, higher incidence of cancers generally. And a number of other things relate to immune system disruption. So, and on and on. And, you know, just as a final statement, I don't have anything against alcohol. I don't call is, you know, I understand it's part of the fabric of most every culture. And that says something. But to my mind, alcohol, if you don't like it, or you care about your health more than you care about alcohol, I say, you know, don't drink. It's pure and simple. What does alcohol do to our serotonin system, dopamine system? I mean, while we're drinking while we're consuming it, you feel good. I don't know exactly what's happening at that moment. But also long term, like after you're, you know, you're done with the alcohol. Like what happens to that serotonin system? Lots of animal data, not a lot of human data. Here's what we do know. Most people experience the what they, you know, subjectively report as pleasant feelings of alcohol is disruption of inhibition, relaxation, et cetera. That's mainly through the GABA system and there are a couple other systems as well. There is a subset of people for whom, for whatever reason, it seems they get more activation of the dopamine system from alcohol. These people may be and very likely are more prone to becoming alcoholics. One of the strong gets determinants of whether or not somebody becomes an alcoholic is the age at which they took their first drink. So very, very young, higher likelihood that will become an alcoholic and so on. But there does seem to be some genetic predisposition or some other predisposition for folks that drink and seem to be very energized by alcohol. There's kind of a coordinate release of dopamine from the dopamine system that's not always observed in other people. But again, there aren't a ton of human studies on this. But there's some, what I think logical speculation that can be had that those are likely going to be the people that are drinking and staying up, drinking throughout the night. I knew these people in college was kind of interesting to see that some of you would just like drink and drink and drink and they're upright and they're clear. You think it gushes their tolerance very high? Well surely that's the case. But it also seemed as if alcohol was affecting them differently. And then of course there's the whole notion of black-out drunk where people are awake and alert and they don't realize what's happening and that's super scary. So the dopamine system is involved and perhaps, so the dopamine system is involved at a low level, we can say almost certainly in everybody when it comes to alcohol. It has reinforcing properties, especially if people like the feeling they like the circumstances. Again, it's that contextual learning about what happens when they drink. A number of people, proven by the way that if somebody gets really really sick after drinking a certain type of cocktail, they're very likely to be averse to that cocktail forever after. There's the subset of individuals maybe less than 10 percent or so that perhaps it experiences heightened increases and dopamine release in response to alcohol that other people don't. So that's interesting and certainly needs more study. And then you asked about the serotonin system. Here I have to apologize. I'm not aware of the direct relationship between alcohol consumption and the serotonin system, but I am aware that there's this phenomenon of hangsiety where people, yes, achieve some relief from anxiety while they're under the effects of alcohol, but that the next day that part of the hangover effect seems to be a elevation in hangsiety that's what called hangsiety. Is that directly due to depletion of or some disruption in the serotonin system? I don't know. Seems likely. One of the phrases that we have to keep in mind, there was a professor of mine where I was a graduate student. He used to say, a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or consumed by a human produces a scientific paper. What I think he was saying is that when it comes to the neuromodulators, there's a lot of interaction so that I have to imagine that if you took two groups of people and you gave one group alcohol or you titrated and you give some high alcohol, moderate alcohol, low alcohol, and then you looked at circulating serotonin. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see differences. The question is whether or not those differences can be tacked directly to any kind of subjective change. So there I have to admit being naive. I'm sure someone will tell us in the comments that what alcohol is doing to the serotonin system. Serotonin, I think for a long time, was looked at only as kind of a calming neuromodulator or something like that. I think we now appreciate that it's doing a lot of different things in a lot of different brain structures, not unlike dopamine, but perhaps even more so. Because you see evidence out there for serotonin and resilience, but also serotonin and parabonding. It's involved in so many things and so what we need to ask is what circuits in the brain are serotonin modulating? And certainly it's modulating a lot of them and in many ways in a much more widespread manner than is dopamine. Well I've read a lot of literature with alcohol as well and come to the same conclusion as you where it's not like it's good for you. I haven't been, couldn't convince myself that drinking alcohol is actually good for you, but I think I found that two drinks a week doesn't seem to have a lot of the negative effects of brain-atrophine cancer and other things. Great, I'm happy to be a great. I'm glad we agreed. I mean not that if we disagree to be a problem, but I, you know, consensus is great, even if it's a small group in consensus. I think attitudes towards alcohol are changing and as our attitude towards cannabis, you know, has certain health benefits and medicinal benefits and also can be problematic for certain people and I think more understanding of genetic and other predispositions to alcoholism to psychosis to things like that are going to be really valuable as we go for. We just really don't know what to look for yet. But again, it's been a while, maybe I'll have a drink at some point. There's a dopamine connection to being predisposed to being an alcoholic. So I don't remember if it was which one it was, one of the one that dopamine receptor ones or another one. There's a, there's a handful of them. I would say five that are known, that affect likelihood of being be ADHD to have substance abuse disorders, alcoholism. I mean, all this makes sense, right? What do you think that we're talking about? To being able to like deal with stress and anxiety. And so I'm very interested in that interaction with the genetics and also like, okay, we'll if you're, if you have ADHD, so these things that we've been talking about in the podcast in the episode, not limiting the phone to like, you know, one hour a day, you know, and doing the, the NSTR, the non-sleep, deep rest and the exercise and the cold shower, cold plunge if you have it. And all these things can help even people with ADHD. Yeah, they tap into the dopamine and neuropinephrine system. And I also want to acknowledge that a lot of the prescription drugs for ADHD can really help people, the children and adults. I did two episodes on dopamine and focus in ADHD. The first one is mainly focused on behavioral, nutritional, supplementation based approaches. And I would say about 50% of the comments were love, love, love this. Thank you. The other 50% were, I hate this. What about all the drugs that are really valuable for it? So we did a second episode as we were originally planning to do on Adderall 5 Ants, Riddlein, Dioxin, which is actually my Themphetamine prescription, my Themphetamine. These things are prescribed to try and help people with ADHD and other intentional issues. And the response was exactly inverse, 50% of people saying this is fantastic. Thank you, parents thanking us for doing that because a lot of them were living in kind of quiet shame about the fact that they were giving these drugs to their kids, but observing that their kids were feeling better and doing better and performing better. And so, and then the other 50% were saying this is all terrible. We're putting kids on speed. And so, again, I don't come to any of this with any kind of judgment. I think it's highly individual. But what it all comes back down to are these neuromodulators, right? And the various circuits involved. It's the catacombs. In both cases, whether or not it's a coal plunger, whether or not it's at or all, it's not the same route to it. It's not the same level. It's not the same predictability. So, I'm not trying to equate those two things. But they all funnel into the same mechanistic system. So, we shouldn't be surprised at all that, yes, there are behaviors. There are things to avoid. There are prescription drugs. And yes, there are supplement based compounds that tap into these pathways, macuna purines, for instance. What do you think of that? Well, it's L-Dopa. L-Dopa is a precursor to dopamine. And so, if people now, it's true supplements are not as regulated as we both know. Sourcing becomes an issue. I've tried macuna purines. I don't have ADHD, but I've tried it. It gives you a clear state shift. I mean, you're taking L-Dopa produce a pretty big crash for me afterwards. I don't know, I never want to try that again. But I think people are very individual. I think getting the baseline things right, sleep, stress modulation, exercise, nutrition. Look, there's absolutely no way that that can't serve a person, younger old for the better. And so, that should be the place to start. But in many situations where there's a clinical urgency to get a kid focusing so that they don't fall behind in school. I'm over the mind that, yeah, it makes perfect sense for parents to safely explore some of the pharmaceutical approaches. But if they don't work, they also need other places to turn. And while doing that exploration of what's going to really work best for this kid or this adult, one would hope they're doing all the things to bolster that system, that catacolymine system, with great sleep, NSTR, maybe coal plunges, exercise, nutrition, et cetera. So that the whole system doesn't crash while they're doing it. And that's really what I believe I can't speak for you. But I really think that your work and my work is really what we're trying to do. It's trying to get all of that information out to people for people to look at, evaluate and make decisions for the best situation in their hands. And does that mean that certain drugs are being over prescribed? If they are in some cases, and in some cases, they're being under prescribed and somebody is really tortured by their inability to focus and they could do well with some low dose of some particular drug. And then we say, well, are we creating, excuse me, a generation of addicts? Again, depend on these things. Maybe, but maybe it's also encouraging the kind of neuroplasticity and the intentional systems that's going to allow them to be able to focus without these compounds. I think my concern is who is diagnosing it? I read a study when I was trying to decide, like, my son was born in, it was like in the summer. And so all parents are kind of faced with this to waste our kind of winter waste or kindergarten. So I was starting on the September baby. So I'm the always the youngest in my class. Right. And so that was exactly what I was looking into. And I was looking into reading what's out there in public data. And I read a couple of studies where teachers, so children that were met boys that were born in July and August were three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Oh, wow. Ben boys that were not born in July and August. Okay. So there were the youngest, they were going to be the youngest in their class. There's nothing about being born in July and August that makes a child susceptible to ADHD. Let's be real. Right. So it has to be the early struggle with keeping up with what's happening. Yeah. Is that cognitively more mature? Teachers are comparing younger kids. School readiness for boys is not the same as a girl for one. And then on top of that you add youth where they're younger. And so you have a child that can't sit still and focus and then in the is distracting and fidgety and all those things. And then all of a sudden you have this, I think your child is ADHD. And then you go down this sort of path. And so, you know, my concern with that one in nine number that I cited knows a one in nine. That's nuts. Like is that real? Or are we just like, are do we have a system where we're putting kids in this environment that they're not meant to be in in the way at least in the way that we're doing it? And then now all of a sudden we're creating this situation where like, oh, well, some kids, these girls can sit nicely in follow directions. It's really easy and they can sit for hours and hours and hours. But, you know, what a lot of kids can't do that. Do they have ADHD? I don't know. Maybe they don't. Maybe they just need to get out and move around more. Like maybe some kids do. Like, absolutely. They're, I, it's definitely, you know, there's this, and there's a spectrum, right? It's not just, oh, yeah. You know, it's a spectrum. But, yeah, I think, I think my, my take on, you're talking about people's feedback and the 50% are like, oh, yeah. Yeah, I, and I know exactly what you're mean. But I do think part of it is the, the diagnosis and do they really have ADHD? And what, like, maybe we all kind of have it somewhat because of our modern life now, right? Or the capacity for it. I mean, what you're really talking about in that age difference in the late, you know, the July August kids is that, you know, you look at a group of young kids and some are moving spontaneously and looking around a lot and some can sit still. And it's, um, top down suppression from the for a brain. You know, the prefrontal cortex does many, many things. But one of its main roles was described me by a really brilliant neurosurgeon, actually the head neurosurgeon at Nirlink. That make to a goal is the prefrontal cortex job is to send a signal to the other circuits of the brain to say, to quiet that down. And that comes online, meaning it matures very slowly in the early years of life. It's when kids learn to defer gratification. And I, Martial Malotest, you know, it's when there are other things too. Of course, it's when kids learn contextual rules when to say, please, and thank you, when to run around and have, you know, be crazy and, you know, and when to try and sit still. And kids are developing that at different rates. It's developing at different rates in them. Now, we know one thing about ADHD, which is interesting, at least one thing, which is that it does not mean a total lack of capacity to focus because oftentimes a kid with ADHD, you put them in front of something they really enjoy, like a puzzler of video game or particular dog gamer, whatever, and they are wrapped with attention. And that tells us right there that the circuits work, but that the threshold for their activation is somehow altered. And it's clearly engaged in one context, but less easily engaged in other contexts. Now, let's face it. We're all like that. If something's really exciting and interesting to you, it fully engages you. If it doesn't, it's not going to. And I do think that these circuits, even once they develop, they can be unpeeled a bit through lack of reading, lack of focus, lack of, you know, time and conversation, like this, directed conversation. I often feel that podcasting, whether or not it's a solo episode, or an episode like this, one of the great pleasures of it is that, you know, I'm engaging face to face in a conversation where we haven't looked at our phones once. And that's exceedingly rare. If we were at a restaurant or cafe or out in the world. So I think we can all train up and we train down these circuits. And much of what we call schooling early in life is training these circuits. Some kids can benefit from pharmacologic assistance. Some likely don't. Some adults can benefit from pharmacologic assistance. In fact, I've talked to a number of psychiatrists that have said that oftentimes adults who, they don't abuse, but they heavily use stimulants, like caffeine, and they require a lot of caffeine in order to focus. Might be a low grade ADHD. I'm not diagnosing anyone. I'm not a clinician. But I find that interesting. Are they seeking the same catacolymine stimulation that one would get from, let's say, low dose modafinal, or from vivance or at or all in which case, which one would you go with? Would you say maybe a little nicarate or something like that? Again, I'm moving away from the nicotine thing. I think that experiments over for me because of the concern about the vasoconstriction. So to be clear, I'm not going to stay with it. But you know, all the behaviors, all the supplements, all the nutrition, all the prescription drugs they, they are not haphazard. They center back to these core mechanisms. Today we've mainly been talking about the catacolymine system dopamine in particular, but these other systems as well. And so it all makes perfect sense why these ADHD like patterns emerge. And it also makes sense why certain treatments would work. And what I love is that the behavioral stuff is quite potent in its ability to tap into these systems. Is it the same as taking X number of milligrams of Adderall or Vivance? No. But it certainly gives people at least an additional line of entry to explore and given that these things are low cost or zero cost, typically zero cost. They're just a little bit of time investment. And that they also do other healthy things for us. I think, you know, I think it's great. And I love how the health space is emerging around this. I think the conversation is going to get better and out worse for all of the stuff. As long as we're not on our phones too damn much. Speaking of healthy habits, so you talked about your workout routine. I'd love to sort of end on your, your healthy habits that you do maybe daily weekly, you know, your diet supplements. Talk to about your workout. Sleep. Yeah. So I try and get to bed by about 10, maybe 11 p.m. I don't always succeed. My wake up around 6 a.m. or so if I don't sleep enough, or I don't feel rested, I'll do it 10 to 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes, NSTR, yoga, and needra. I get up. I like to hydrate. First thing I try and do is string 16 to 32 ounces of water. I like just hydrate in the morning. Get outside and get some sunlight. If I can't get the sunlight I get in front of that 10,000 looks light. I prefer to work out early in the day, in which case I'll drink caffeine if it's a resistance training workout. For me that's your bramate or coffee or both sometimes. I'll just tell you my workout schedule is really easy to hit on the same thing I've been doing roughly for 30 years. Although sometimes I've been less, you know, less focused on it and let it lapse a bit here and there. So first day of the week for me it falls on a Monday but it could be any day. I train my legs and calves, hamstrings, quats. I'm a big believer in glute ham raises, hacksquats, leg curls like extensions, calf raises. Just keep the lower body strong, keep the posterior chain strong. There are a bunch of different ways to do this. One could do it with kettlebell swings or dead lifts, but those are the things that work well for me and that I can consistently at load or other ways of increasing intensity without getting hurt. Okay, knock on wood. The holding takes about an hour. Next day is a rest day, typically after like day and I'll try and do don't always do but some deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure. In an ideal world it's 20 minutes of sauna, three to five minutes of cold, two minutes of sauna, three to five minutes of cold. And yes I finish with a warm shower because I'm a human being and I like that and I will listen to podcasts or books or something while I do it and helps my recovery. It's also just thermal training, it has all the benefits of sauna and cold and I like to do it on that day. The next day, I'll do typically a run, a 25 or 30 minute run at a kind of faster pace. So where I'm you know, breathing hard for most of it but it's not all out maybe 85% of effort and that's it. The next day I train my torso. I know a lot of people were all their eyes. I was like, what are you talking about? How do I do? I do some overhead pressing, some dips, some pull ups or chin ups and some rowing and then I do some abdominal work and I train my neck because it's an important part of the structure of the upper body to keep the head stable and not get text neck and things like that. I don't train it heavy but I train my neck and I do make sure I do things like rear delts. I really am trying to emphasize outward external rotation of the limbs so we're not kind of like hunched over like this and heavy in the traps. You know, just upright posture those kinds of things. And then the next day, the only workout is about 10 minutes long. It's that 10 second hard cycling on the salt bike, 20 second rest, 10, 20, 10, 20 for eight rounds. That's it. The O2 max. Saturdays, another short resistance training workout. So three total for the week and then it's you know, biceps triceps calves, little neck work, abdominal work. It's kind of just small body part stuff. And then on Sunday, which for me falls on a Sunday, I train do some long rock or hike, often socially put on a backpack with some weight or if I'm by myself I'll do a 60 to 90 minute jog or something of that. So it may be hike part of it and listen to music or just let my thoughts go. So what it boils down to is six days of training per week, three resistance training sessions, one longer slow run, one moderate one and one short one. The total amount of time is actually quite low when you when you think about it. And then there's that rest day where I may or may not do the the heat and cold. This schedule I could micro dissect, but what ends up happening with this schedule is because for instance, I'll train my legs on Monday directly. But I'm doing the salt bike for hit on Friday. So my legs sort of get targeted twice per week once directly once indirectly. So I don't have to worry about too little frequency of stimulation for things like strength and hypertrophy, although I'm not trying to grow anymore for maintaining muscle. Similarly, I'll train my torso on that one day during the middle of the week, but you're using your arms for that and then you train your arms directly another day. And on the arm day, you know, I'm doing some dip like things and so you're also hitting your torso muscles. So I never worry that it's not frequent enough. I find that getting into the gym more than three days per week or doing resistance training more than three days per week. I start to lose my motivation for it, but I like to be really focused and targeted when I'm there. And I love long runs, I love moderate runs, and I love the hit workout. So I get to do a little bit of everything. And I really want to emphasize it because I'm not a professional athlete or even an amateur athlete. The whole basis of this thing is to be able to do anything. Meaning I can go for a long hiker backpack during the summer with a heavy pack. No problem. I can sprint for the airplane. No problem. I can lift things without hurting myself. No problem. Provide I'm smart about it. I'm not trying to be the strongest, the biggest, or the fastest, or the one with most endurance. Just kind of all around life. And none of these workouts is longer than an hour and in many cases, they're 12 minutes or 30 minutes. Okay. The daily routines pretty much consistent. And I should say that schedule if I travel, things might slide a bit. I might move day one next to day two. I move things around, but I'm careful to never wait train more than two days in a row. I personally don't recover. I don't like doing that. Okay. Nutrition. I just try and emphasize non-processed or minimally processed foods. I'm not really hungry until about 11 a.m. And then I like some meat, some berries, some rice or oatmeal, sometimes and some vegetable. I'm not low carb. And the afternoon, I generally have snack, maybe approaching, drink some nuts. You know, I do, you know, those Maui-Newy jerky sticks or thing-a-bone broth or something. It's not promotion. It's just a fact. And then for dinner, I like, I tend to emphasize less protein for me that works. This runs counter to what everyone says. But I like more vegetables, pasta, rice, risottoes. Occasionally I'll go out for a big steak or something like that. But generally the heavier on the starch is not heavy, but heavier on the starch is relatively and vegetables and then a couple hours before sleep ideally. But sometimes I'll finish dinner and collapse. You know, it's just life. I do find nice sleep better if I allow a few hours before sleep. In terms of stress modulation and things like that, I do deploy the physiological side, which sounds very technical, but two inhales through the nose. Followered by a long exhale to long as empty. I try and do that anytime I feel that my stress is too high. My lab published a clinical trial in cell reports medicine in collaboration with David Spiegel's Laboratory at Stanford showing that five minutes a day of breath work of sick like sign. So inhale and he'll exhale, both through the, both inhale through the nose and he'll inhale and he'll exhale. Done as a dedicated practice for five minutes a day. Lead to some interesting changes, positive changes in reductions in resting heart rate, reductions in blood pressure, improvements in sleep mood, et cetera, not all significant, but several which work statistically significant. But I don't tend to do breath work. I tend to just use that physiological side whenever I'm feeling kind of overly ramped up. My due drink caffeine, drink in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, supplements. Okay, this could be a long discussion. Our friend Brian McKenzie used to tease me if you ask me what supplements I take, he'll just shout from the background. All of them. I don't take all of them. But here's what I do take. In the morning, I do take Tonga Ali and Fadoja. This is kind of for freeing up testosterone and for lootinizing hormone stimulation. For me, I've been on it for years. It works great. It shifted my testosterone and free testosterone in the right direction. Sudely, not super significantly, but subtly and meaningfully for me it works. Some people have not good results or some people have. I have no, by the way, I have no relationship to any supplement company. I do have relationship to age you want an element. We can talk about age you want if you want. But this is not a promotion of any kind. We used to be associated with momentous, we partied ways on good great terms. It just was part and parcel for some other brand relationships we had. So search for best sources if you're going to explore these things. I make it a point to take at least a gram of EPA form of essential fatty acids in the form of fish oil. Probably more like two grams per day is what I'm shooting for. You've talked a lot about this. I make that a point for me. I feel better. My blood work looks good and that's something I really, I really strive to do. And then I take a bunch of things that I don't know the extent to which they've really shifted my physiology in the best direction. But I know it hasn't made me worse and I feel better. Okay, what am I talking about? I take a multivitamin with my first meal of the day, just to cover any basis, that I might be missing out on. I take a ginger capsule, seems to improve my digestion. I take a couple digestive enzymes when I eat. I take 100 milligrams of zinc with that meal. I do that consistently. I take, let's see, what else is in there. I take a low dose of boron and there are a few other, and I make sure that I get enough vitamin D and K2, about 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day and some K2, and a little bit of grape seed extract. And that's it. That's it. Before sleep, I will use magnesium and apigenin 30 minutes before sleep. And I've been exploring some other things for sleep. In full disclosure, because I just think it's really important, I've experimented with various peptides recently, to be honest, they are so potent in certain directions that impact my sleep that I've started to kind of back away from most of them, but I'm very curious about a lot of them. There's a ton of animal data on BPC-157. So much interest in BPC-157. Very little if any human data. That worries me, but what worries me more is that BPC-157 appears to be angiogenic, meaning it grows blood vessels and that can be great, or it can be problematic depending on what those vessels are feeding. I'm not saying BPC-157 is bad. I'm just saying this is my kind of caution about it, and I hope to, and I will have. I was taking, I have a calf injury on one leg that is reduced from nerve damage, from escape warning injury, repeat escape warning injury. I was trying to bring that back. And actually, it's amazing. I was injecting it directly into the calf for a couple of weeks, and I actually found I could and longer actually, there's a couple of months by time I think, because that was doing it infrequently. And I found I actually was able to finally contract that calf, meaningfully, while running and through weight workouts in a way that brought some of it back, but it was pretty badly atrophied. But I've been doing other things to try and get the tissue generating again, or I wish to say the neural activation of that calf. It's not a structural issue that I was born with. It's injury induced, and it feels much better, but I'm currently not taking BPC-157. And I'm worried about prolonged use. That's my concern, prolonged use. But, and then some of the other peptides like Surmerellin, Testermerellin, the so-called growth hormone secretagogs that stimulate growth hormone release, I'm not on growth hormone. My concern about Surmerellin was that I would take it. I took it for infrequently over a period of time. And I noticed that my sleep, I got a lot more deep sleep, as measured by my sleep, by my sleep, but that it obliterated my rapid eye movement sleep, completely gone. And then I stopped taking Surmerellin. But, and I wasn't taking it for that long or that frequently. So what I found for me is that you know, the core set of supplements, plus training right, plus life, lived in the way I describe some hydration, et cetera, that seems to work best. And what's my measure of that is feeling as a figure whether or not I can recover from my workout, meaning am I getting any progress in terms of loads or other intensity variables or distance or speed over time with the cardiovascular stuff. And the answer is yes, small improvements over time are really what I'm after or being taining what I've got. Because at 48, I'm just interested in staying healthy and, you know, sure, would love to be even healthier. But I'm also paying attention to how much cognitive vigor I have. You know, if I'm training so much or paying so much attention to nutrition that I can't engage in work and function, that's not good. If I can't sit for three hours and have a conversation, because I mean, pain, that's not good. And fortunately, you know, I've got things in a place where I feel generally good, sometimes great, but good most of the time. I still get bad night's sleep every once in a while. I still stress, you know, I don't tend to do cheat days or things like that. I love the occasional piece of pizza or croissant or something like that. But I've also learned that most of the things about taking great care from nutrition, lifestyle, mindset, and the rest creates a kind of a heightened sensory experience of life. This is what I think people miss. They think of it as deprivation. But when you're doing these things and you do them consistently, I find at least that, first of all, I love the foods I eat. I love meat, fish, chicken, eggs, vegetables, certain starches, you know, fruit, et cetera. I enjoy all those things. And I also enjoy all of life so much more. Whereas I find that things for me, anyway, alcohol, highly processed foods, they create a kind of cloak over my senses. I don't enjoy life as much. But of course, a really good cookie, a really good cookie, or just that sure, that makes sense. And I enjoy those. So I look at things that all of it, exercise nutrition, supplementation, you know, any kind of NSTR, things like that. As do they allow me to lean into life with more vigor, with more curiosity, with more texture, or do they kind of consume a lot of time and don't allow me to do that. And in my experience, the things that I described in there a few others, I do allow me to live life better. It's not like I'm sleeping all the time or I'm neuroticly saying, okay, everybody, it's 30. I got to go to sleep, you know. And look, I respect people's individual choices. I actually, the other day, saw for the first time in a long time Brian Johnson, who's, you know, he's like wholeheartedly and whole everything. The voting is entire energy to being the most measured human and longevity stuff. And that's what floats his boat. Me, I like to have some flexibility on my schedule in life. And if it cost me a few years of life, I'm willing to make that trade. One last question. It's kind of, how do you, I'm just interested because I experience this, because we are on, you know, we put ourselves out there, right? We're in the digital world. How do you balance the negative, the negative parts of it, right? Like getting people being mean, it's easy for people to be mean. How do you balance that? Yeah. So to be fair, you know, it's a professor, I'm still a professor, just by way, you may say I'm still a tender professor at Stanford as of walking in this room anyway. I teach a few lectures in the winter and I'll teach more in the spring starting next year. My lab has been shrunk down as a consequence of the podcast. And my interest in moving away from animal research towards human research still involved in clinical trials, which are done remotely, mostly in collaboration with psychiatry and ophthalmology. So that was my life for the longest time, plus the lab life, you know, and people running experiments. And I was just a very private person. Then 2019 started posting on Instagram, 2020 started going on podcast, 2021 launched the podcast. In three years, you know, it's, you know, quite great for this, but it's it's grown a lot and I'm, you know, humble and honored, like truly it's such an incredible honor and privilege to be able to teach to so many people and to get the feedback. The negative stuff comes in a couple different forms. Some are negative comments and and news articles that are really in the form of the comments. I think people working out their stuff, you know, I don't know if they're drinking, they're angry, they're dealing with a psychotic issue. Or they maybe are just kind of having fun or they're angry because there's a misunderstanding. In terms of press, you know, as the podcast has grown, our name, my name, and face have become a source for generating, you know, clicks in response to things that contrasts with people's preconceived notions of what I might be about. So I understand that relationship. When you put yourself out there, you make yourself subject to that as your popularity increases, the potency of of attacks as a source of clicks increases. I also look at it as much as I can through the lens of not just how it makes me feel, but like what's meaningful in coming back here that I can pay attention to and might want to adjust my delivery of information or anything else in life, too. It gets frustrating when it's personal. I think that, you know, I mean, I'm not going to be around the bush here. I think there've been some personal attacks that have been quite public. And I've talked about those, I talked about those a little bit on a jocca-willing podcast recently. I can summarize it, you know, pre-simply by saying, you know, I'm over the mind that personal matters should be settled personally and not publicly. I also just really believe in trying to have those conversations privately because both people understand context, you know, and articles context is lost. I also worry not so much about direct or indirect interpretation of things as much as certain narratives getting exported and kind of like the runaway train of those. And there I will just kind of leave it at that and just say that, you know, obviously I like everybody else's flawed. I struggle in certain ways. I have certain things I'm better at and worse at. I'm always striving to be the best version of myself I can be. And to try and, you know, do that on a personal basis when it's personal and when it's public in terms of relationship with the public to, you know, communicate as much as possible without, you know, just trying to convince people. But hey, that I'm here to try and learn, organize and distribute information that I think is really useful to people. They can take it or leave it. I really do that. It is a labor of love. I really do love doing it. And I know that I can't do it perfectly. I certainly have made mistakes. We correct those in the show note captions. People definitely point them out. It's always embarrassing. Erds. And yet I try and just take it. Okay, what can I learn from this? In my private life, make those adjustments as best I can. In my public life, make those adjustments as best I can. I published a correction recently on, you know, by saying, hey, I made a math error in this thing. It was actually, I made a joke about it in the episode that didn't make clear that there was, you know, it didn't make clear the, or clarify them as understanding. So in any case, just said, okay, here's the deal. Here's what we do. I guess the short answer is, um, I like to think there's always learning there. Take the jockel-wheeling-like good, you know, mindset of, okay, good, given that it happened. You say, good, what can I learn from it? Move on. I think a big part of being an adult, and being a human being is learning when to stand one's ground and say, okay, you feel that way. I feel this way. We're going to agree to disagree. That wasn't that way or I feel differently. Okay, but the other half of being an adult is saying, oh, like, oh, I could have done better there. Or, wow, I screwed up and apologizing or making the effort to remedy it going forward. And it's always hard to know exactly where that is. I have been, um, saying one thing in particular, lately, which no clinician has challenged me on yet, which is that when I go online, I generally assume, especially social media, that I'm dealing with essentially a borderline organism. You know, borderline is not bipolar. Okay, borderline is, you know, the classic definition is weaving back and forth between a healthy mind and psychotic, you know, a borderline person split by telling you at one moment they love you, they adore you, and then at the next moment that they hate you and all the reasons why. And I look at engaging on social media, like engaging with a borderline person. So I now expect that when I go there. Um, and I could go on and on, but what I'll say is, um, you know, this stuff that comes your skin, the good stuff feels good, the bad stuff feels bad, and then over time, it all kind of neutralizes. And I'm also blessed to have a great team around me, to help me with optics and clarity, and um, I've great people in my life, and um, but it is not fun all the time. And there are days where you go, hey, I'm trying to help people amount there trying to do this, and don't they see it's not about supplements, it's about these behaviors and the supplements help, but they're not focus or I'm not all about the cold plunges. There's always this desire to try and explain oneself and that never works. So I've decided, I'm here, I'm doing this. I know I'm doing it with the real intention of trying to give people the best information at zero cost that I possibly can. I'm human. I'm going to make mistakes. I will adjust as best I can going forward, and people also have the opportunity to tune out or tune off. And, um, you know, a live and let live is my, my philosophy, my graduated advisor by which I've been used to say, listen, tolerance has to go in both directions. So um, yeah, never easy for the hard stuff, very gratifying for the positive stuff. One of the best sources of feedback I receive one people say, I can't believe this is free, like you're giving us this information. I'm like, yeah, and I love doing it. So that fills me and I'm planning to keep going. It's very clear. I mean, it's very curly, you love doing it, and I've certainly learned a lot from you, and, you know, especially on a lot of the topics that we talked about today, where I was really diving deep. People can find you, of course, on YouTube, human lab podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, everywhere. So we're right. You were in lab. We're out there. There wasn't having those. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun. And we've got some stuff, you know, planned, some shorter format episodes, audio only, some the AI stuff is starting to build out. But you know, the core of it is learning and organizing and distributing information. More great guests, please come back on the podcast. Please show us your order cover. We're still doing it. I know. I was like, more solo episodes for sure. And, and again, I want to make sure that I say this again, as I did at the beginning, you're a true pioneer in this area. You went first in the bravery associated with that as immense. I know that as an academic like you. And you've persisted in really pushing hard to deliver the best information with the most amount of rigor, even touching into some areas that there's not, you know, let's just call them what they are.

We have tiny blood vessels in the brain. So if you don't exercise, you don't make sure that your heart is pumping and high rate regularly during the week. Those tiny vessels that are even smaller than your air in terms of diameter, they will start to collapse. And you're going to have, and remember, the capia is, it's, it represents 90% of your brain vascularity. All these tiny blood vessels. So if you don't do enough exercise, you will start chronically to have some vessels that will basically constrict and collapse and disappear, meaning that the surrounding neurons that are here and they need oxygen and nutrients and everything from these vessels. If these vessels disappear, you're going to lose neurons. So exercise is the number one thing. You have to do that not only for the brain, obviously for the heart, it's true for the eyes. Obviously, if you don't exercise, you're going to tend to lose high-dition quickly than in a normal person, person as you age. But very important for the brain, you're going to turn, you know, if you're prone to go to cognitive detain because let's say you have a major genetic risk. But if on top of that, you don't exercise, you're going to accelerate as we know from study. And in that's one of the biggest things we have to put that, you know, we have to put to the world like, okay, each of you just started to handle that, what, and if you want to stay healthy in terms of brain function, yeah, no other choice. Hi, everyone. Today, my guest is Dr. Axel Monten, who is a professor and group leader at the dementia research institute at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. I'm personally really excited to have Axel Monten today because we are going to be discussing really a new paradigm for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Often when we talk about Alzheimer's disease in particular, there's so many ideas floating around, is it brain diabetes, is it amoloid beta plaques? So rather than speaking to the role of amoloid or metabolism, today, I'm hoping to discuss a new paradigm of research that suggests not only an important way of understanding dementia and Alzheimer's, but also how to prevent it. So Axel, thank you so much for coming on the show today. Can we, can you talk a little bit about this idea that dementia can be a vascular disease? Yes, hi. Thank you for the invitation first of all, very happy to be here and talking about that. Yes, so I think the word new paradigm, it's correct and not correct at the same time. It's been several years and there are many studies back from 20, 30 years ago that shows that when you look at the post-multian brain sample on tissue, just a tissue of people that died from Alzheimer's disease, you can see a lot of vascular problems on every single case and it has been shown like 20, 30 years ago, but people didn't really pay attention to that vascular phenotype that we were seeing on post-multian brain. It's just I would say probably the last 10 years or so that we are really tackling this because we have more and more evidence that shows that the vascular dysfunction and we're going to go into details of which later, but the brain vessels, so the blood vessels, starts to be dysfunctional and leaky and not doing their job to make sure the brain functions normally and that's something that we can detect very early on that is something that is happening with normal aging and we know now that this is something that is accelerated in people that go towards dementia. And this is true in Alzheimer's disease, which is the major cause, I mean the main dementia form, there's also small vessel disease we'll talk about this, there's vascular dementia there's different kinds, but the commonality about all these dementia is they have a vascular component that is quite early in the disease and we want me as a lab and different groups in the world try to understand how vascular dysfunction contribute to dementia and that's something that people pay really attention you were a co-author on a paper showing that about 50% of all dementia start with breakdown of the smallest vessels in the brain and I mean this seems very important so let's talk about how a leaky blood brain barrier could be even more important than beta amyloid plaques or amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles what causes that breakdown of the blood brain barrier? Yes, so so the paper you were mentioning so I guess that's the paper we published in 2020 in nature where we show and we had a few other papers prior to that where we showed that just the fact so just the fact that we age normally the vessels start to be normally dysfunctional as we age like the whole body it's not telling the brain just not telling the vessels we are just aging and these vessels we we've developed a way to to measure how leaky if I can use that term which is easy to understand so everyone how leaky meaning that things from the blood can leak out to the brain and we can measure that with magnetic resonance imaging MRI so we developed that technique in the US and California and the University of Southern California where we can really detect small weakness of the brain barrier and what we've noticed is when we scan normal in cognitively normal individuals young and old just normal aging we start seeing some brain regions that are leak here than others so first of all there's what we call the blood brain barrier there's not only one blood brain barrier in my opinion very several and we are trying to understand how they have different properties different depending on where we look in the brain but we see special brain regions that starts to leak with normal aging and these regions it's a bit that's the region of the e-pacampus that we call medial temporal load so that's the spot of the brain medial temporal load where we have the major you know the learning and memory region that is called the e-pacampus that region somehow we still don't know why at that at the time is leakier than normal in people that are older versus controls young and we know that this region is the region that leaks the most early in dementia as well so we developed that MRI technique where we can really see visually okay where do we have this vasculopropics and interestingly we also I guess we're going to talk about this but not only your imaging is important but we also developed new biomarkers to look at in in plasma so in the blood or in cerebrospinal fluid we can measure markers new markers of that gives us an idea of how leakier the brain red vessels basically to make it simple and so we have this new imaging marker this biofluid marker and we show on both that we we see etapa we're acknowledging an increase what we call bleperine value breakdown so the vessel vessel disruption in the brain and and we we know also in this paper that you mentioned is we can predict future cognitive neglect so the people having more leakiness at base like when we scan them on when we we measure on the plasma of csf cepers waspanofluid the level of the vasculopropics in the brain we know that there are more they're going to decline more faster than the people that have low levels of this biomarker so we have some predictive value of looking into vasculopryne disruption so to try to link amilloidant tau which is which are the classical Alzheimer's or mark what we found is the the leak areas that we seen the brain are have nothing to do with the areas that where we start seeing the buildup of amilloid plaques and tau tangles so it seems to be two different two independent paths where we say so you have people that have vasculopryne dysfunction but and in some brain regions they're going to start having some amilloid plaques and it doesn't seem to relate to each other so that's the first point I wanted to make but also what is interesting to know is when people start to have amilloid plaques they tend to have cerebral what we call cerebral amilloidant jocacy c-a-d which also will disrupt vasles so you have two schools in research right now we use people that think that amilloid is something that happens very quickly very hurly that will disrupt the vessels and you have the others school that are in thought of that we say that we can see vasculopryne without amilloid happening at that stage and we know that having vasculopryne dysfunction will promote also the formation of amilloid plaques in the brain so it's still unclear how this is going what we know for sure is there's early vasculopryne and we need to fix that to make sure that the brain doesn't develop plaques function normally to avoid dementia specifically you mentioned some early diagnostics I mean both more more sensitive types of MRI to detect some of these you know leaky vessels but also a plasma biomarker and this is these were in cognitively normal individuals and mucher what age range but that seems like extremely important because you're talking about a new potential diagnostic well before cognitive decline is occurring it seems like intervention you know it's obviously there's been a lot of failed attempts to treat you know even people with mild cognitive decline that have Alzheimer's disease so is this is this something that you see coming into clinical practice this is you know like what what what are your thoughts about that no that's a great question just to have something from the previous answer question because people don't know is we we have screened people by the major genetic risk factor that for Alzheimer's disease which is apoly pro protein E4 so we know that the people carrying this particular gene have more chance to develop Alzheimer's disease than other people and these people they have much more vasculopryne problems in the brain and they are still cognitive normal so we can detect as you said we can detect perhaps I don't want to speculate but we know roughly that at least we can detect 10 years it's not more prior cognitive decline we can detect those vasculopryne problems so as you said there is a window where we can intervene and if we have the right therapeutic we can proceed to protect the vessel and what I used to say sealed barrier to avoid this leakage so the way I see it so first of all the research is ongoing right now there's a lot of a lot not but several targets that are very promising currently tested in both animals and clinical trials to try to protect these vessels because it's not only a question of leakage but if the vessels are not functional there's not enough blood flow throughout the whole brain so which is a big problem so it's I see that the two vasculopryne issues blood flow is reduced plus the leakage of the barrier so we know that we have a street targets that basically target different cell types that comprise the neurovascular unit so it bears the under-tile cells that are forming tubes basically that's where the blood flowing but around these vessels there is multiple layers of different cell types one of them that is it is to meet one of the most important one is called the peri site so they wrapped around the blood vessels in the brain and those cells are very sensitive the detach the vessels and they die very early into disease and if they are not there to maintain the integrity of the barrier we know that there's these leakages so the whole idea of different labs in the world is to make sure that these various size of wrapping the smallest vessels in the brain don't detach they have to stay there to maintain the integrity and to avoid the leakage so there's some targets either targeting the under-tile of cells themselves or targeting the peri site's direct there's gene therapy there's a lot of things ongoing stem cell therapy and things like that that are very promising so I would say it will happen tomorrow in a sense that it's going to take a while to do the clinical trials but I want to stay very optimistic for the listening because we're talking about less than 10 years I would say if these targets are successful which they already are in the edible modes we're going to have some sort of intervention to fix the blood vessels in the next few years so I think it's very important and to do that the critical part as you said there's a lot of failure in anti-amidoid treatments we have to design the trial very you know we have to really think about the design of the trial and what are the category of people you want to treat right and I think one way you said is screening people by apoi genotype so if you have the genetic risk you could get get the treatment but again we're talking about one fourth of the population of the world having the apoi fauchia type so one third there's a terrorist eye case and a homozygous people so it's I don't think it's realistic to just screen anti-altypropedition or just give them a treatment to fix the blood vessels which would be a bit more realistic is to do a combination of biofluid biomarkers of the talquate where we can see whether there's things that starts to go wrong in your brain and when we know that there's something we can do to fix the vessels before there's a no-degeneration and cognitive decline so I think it's more like maybe screening for apoi but it was also screening for other things around that will tell you okay this particular individual will benefit from getting a drug that will fix the blood vessel and I truly believe based on the animal experiment and based on the transletrature and clinical trials that yeah if we fix the blood vessels we may not be able to cure that's a big world worth cure as a disease but at least we will be able to postpone the symptoms by quite a few years for sure which is a big deal obviously for day-to-day you know when people they really dementia on the day he basis it's a nightmare so he can have a decent life for another 10 years that's a big progress hopefully I mean hopefully we want to cure the disease but I think we are going to the right direction so a couple of questions kind of stemming from you know what is causing the parasites to detach or causing the endothelial cells to you know become you know leaky and the blood brain barrier if you have someone with apoi four you mentioned that's happening sooner I mean it's it's very detectable and people with apoi four and also is is that is the parasites detaching is you know these these signs of I guess you know what you might call leaky blood brain barrier is that something that happens in normal aging or is it something that happens in abnormal you know brain aging that is almost certainly going to lead to cognitive decline because the reason I'm asking is you know with the amoloid beta plaques which is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease you find them in cognitively normal people and it's a little perplexing right yes no I think so to answer that question so there's a bit of controversy in the field but most of the literature says that yes parasites is a it's they're all the particular cell type that are quite vulnerable and quite sensitive so they do detach and they do die as you page of course we're not talking about the extent of what we see in the match but we see just to give you some numbers which will speak to people we know from mouse studies and human studies plus more temperant tissue analysis we can see that when we stain when we look at those parasites around the micro-asculture varies roughly a 10% to 20% loss of these cells just with normal aging it's more complicated than that because there is a brain regional differences we have some region that lose more the others let's say if I talk again about the picking piss there are reports showing that there's fewer parasites in the picking piss than in the cortex the human brain at baseline so we'll that's why I was saying from at the beginning there's a different blood brain barrier properties there's different cell types different numbers probably different functions so we know that these parasites some regions have fewer than others but they do tend to detach and die with normal aging the reason why they detach if I had the answer we didn't do my research right now we have some answers the first one is very close crosstalk between the endotillium so the between the blood basically in the parasite very the endotillium so the endotillium cells on the parasite cross-stalk a lot and I didn't mention it but parasites are here to wrap around the vessels and make sure there's no like a strict barrier between the blood and the brains nothing can cross easily except because and things that we need oxygen to the the second major property of the parasites that they do have contractile proteins meaning that those cells are able to constrict so to constrict vessels and die red vessels so if they are not here you can easily assume that your blood flow will be disturbed so they are here to to contract to constrict and die red vessels so obviously when they detach not only you have the leakage of the barrier but you also have some flu problems one of the hypothesis that we are working the lab it's not only hypothesis very kind of growing evidence on that is the the leading cause of parasite lost might be that the under-till cells themselves so they are they are what we call in in a familiar static state so they are normal they expressed certain proteins certain transports those that are there to make sure of the transport oxygen and because as I said and other things as you age these under-till cells will turn to a pro inflammatory phenotype and that's a normal thing as we age we are there's a phenomenon called inflame inflame g it's a contraction of inflammation and pg and there's several things happening as we age based the what we called what is called the seven pillars of age which basically has very seven things that overlap between normal aging and new-digit generative diseases and out of these seven the central one is inflammation so as we age we have more information going on and we know that there is a more cell-dition molecules to sight-mortes of a cell-dition molecules are start to be expressed at the under-tilly which is normally not there or very minimal quantity and we start having significant amount of these cell-dition molecules throughout the whole but and the brain is very sensitive to that because these cell-dition molecules what they do is they collect the immune cells from the brain from the blood story to bring them into the brain the more you have the more information the what we call neuro information the more information you have in your brain so that's a normal aging process and the fact then those cells end up to your cells turning to a pro inflammatory phenotype the pericisertal right next to them will will so there's a cluster of this I won't go into details but the pericite will have to detach because to let the immune cells go through physically if the pericite stays of touch to the vast to the vessel there is no possibility for the immune cells to go through and to their job so the fact that there is more information of the vasyletry as we age there is more detachment like a which is a physiological detachment of brain pericites that's one thing and we there's some report that as we age very less we don't have the capability I mean the pericite don't have the capability to reattach as we can do as we are young so I don't know if that's clear but at least there's some int some that tells us that the fact that the undertale cells become more enslaimed in a way the vasyletry is enslaimed the pericite will react to that in a bad way and so they will start shortening their processes also so I didn't mention it but pericites are there's a small cell body with a process like small processes like an optopus kind of thing sitting on top of a vessel and all these processes are here to to push the blood through basically and maintain the integrity and these processes will shorten because of the inflammation and of course if the the pericites are shortening their processes the flow will reduce and if it's a chronic thing if we think about chronically having too much information at the vasyletry the pericite will chronically detach more and more and shortening their processes so the leakage of the barrier will be will come at some point because the tight junctions and everything that makes the barrier intact will stop to degrade over time and the flow will be drastically reduced so short answer I'm speaking a bit too much inflammation of the blood vessels might be one trigger and that's something we can target theoretically relatively easily by injecting drugs IV right intravenously so that would be perfect way of targeting the vessels to improve the healthcare function hopefully I think also the the fact that you're you're mentioning the role of inflammation being so so critical on key in this in this process kind of makes me think about you know lifestyle factors of course that you know aren't necessarily the same as you know therapeutically targeting you know with the drug but Omega 3 being one of you know at the forefront of one you know Omega 3 transport has been shown mechanistically at least in animal studies to regulate blood brain barrier function through the MFS D2A transporter and it's also like many of the metabolites of both DHA and EPA the marine Omega 3 fatty acids are involved in resolving inflammation so they have resolveings they have the specialized promediating molecules the SPMs and the Marisens and there's and so do you think there could ultimately be clinical relevance for Omega 3 status in in regulating dementia associated you know blood brain barrier leaking us you know in humans or maybe something worth exploring no I can't agree more I think there's a more and more studies coming up nowadays Omega 3 and you mentioned MFS D2A which is one of the markers we are studying carefully because it's specific to the smallest blood vessels in the brain so the capiaries and that's where the most of the parasites are and there is a recent studies are that shows that as we age and we've dementia MFS D2A so the receptor for Omega 3 it's reduced the blood vessels and there's also a link that where there is a reduction of MFS D2A on the vessels that's where we see very site loss so we can almost connect what we were saying earlier of course these are just a few studies and it has to be confirmed but apparently there's a more information of the blood vessels to go back to the first question to link it which as we age also MFS D2A transpose and other transporters not only this one but this one in particular is decreased at the capiary bed which have an impact apparently on periside function because we can see that this hotspot of MFS D2A loss are also hotspots of periside loss which means that where we have the leakingness of the bark so yes I cannot agree more I think we have two study a bit more DH share Omega 3 and how do you seem back bread bread bread value functions because that would be some preventive interventions things like that even like targetable drugs like a retract but yeah cannot agree more and just to we can talk a bit more about this but just to go back at the beginning of your question you were mentioning exercise and I think exercise is very important even me at mid you know I'm not too old I'm not even 40 years old and I try to practice every week knowing all the the recent data so we have we have to do some exercise some higher up big exercise to make sure that the vessels we have tiny blood vessels in the brain so if you don't exercise you don't make sure that your heart is pumping and high rate regularly during the week those tiny vessels that are even smaller than your air in terms of diameter they will start to collapse and you you're going to have and remember the capiaries it's it represents 90% of your brain vascularity all these tiny blood vessels so if you start not see if you don't do enough exercise you you will start chronically to have some vessels that will basically constrict and collapse and disappear meaning that the surrounding neurons that are here and they need oxygen and nutrients and everything from these vessels if these vessels disappear you're going to lose neurons right so exercise is the number one thing you have to to do that not only for the brain obviously for the heart it's true for the eyes obviously I should not exercise you're going to tend to lose high-dition quicker than the normal person person as you age but very important for the brain you're going to turn you know if you still prone to go to cognitive detain because let's say you have a major genetic risk but if on top of that you don't exercise you're going to accelerate as we know from study so I think exercise right now it's highly funded very a lot of we're going on and and that's one of the biggest thing we have to to put that you know we have to put to the world like okay each of just such a normal matter what I mean you should want to stay healthy in terms of brain's function yeah no other choice I could not agree more when you're talking about if not exercising and how the small vessels lining the brain they start to get you know basically go away are you is that small vessel disease or is that something different so we have to be careful yes it's not it's not like a person if you don't exercise you're going to get small vessel disease I mean it's a bit more complex and and I think that's a where that didn't say at the beginning but these dementia as I'm with disease is one but the second major form of dementia is cereble small vessel disease and and I thought it were wanted to say what was the question again oh I was just yeah I was asking about what I mean what is small vessel disease yeah okay so yeah so I wanted to just mention I want to people to freak out of course it's a multifactylial disease you know it's felt like if you have a genetic respecter on top of that you can kind of contour balance that by doing more exercise and eating better and stuff but we can discuss about this but small vessel disease is it's very different from our sinus disease although there's a lot of commonalities in terms of brain imaging if you look at two brains our Alzheimer's in small vessel disease you're going to see a lot of similarities meaning that you're going to see what we call microbleeds so the we were talking about blivering bar breakdown so if there is a significant breakdown of the vessels you can start having red blood cells going to the to go break so that that are detectable using MRI so we can see those microbleeds that's one feature they also small vessel disease compared to other studies this tend to have small strokes like what we call lacquins so they have small spots small lesions that we can detect in the brain which chronically and over time will you will have a deterioration of your cognitive functions the the other the first thing that is very important is white better eye print entities so these are white metal disease it's it's a heart topic a heart rate heart research area because it overlaps as we age we are white matter disease normal age we do have some as I read these there is quite a lot of white matter small vessel disease there is a lot also and blivering bar breakdown obviously in other other reasons small vessel disease these are key features of these two to the disease especially to explain the white matter i current entities people are these white metal disease are from the task of resource so it's it's still ongoing research but we know that these are we do have lead vessels possibly the pericide detachments leakage of the of blood toxins into the brain which will damage the milding sheets and all the the axons and the white matter fibers that that makes your condition running properly so these are the features of small vessel disease and small vessel disease also the common the common cause of stroke so and so there's many many small vessel disease we have a quote here in the UK that we are following with the leader is trying a workload so I invite people also to if you want to learn more about small vessel disease she is probably the the world expert in small vessel disease but so it does to disease that I'm independent of the middle it that's the big difference obviously from last time as disease but they do have the micro vessels do have some problems and I can tell some of them which we've talked a little bit the the find the deandotinium gets pro inflamed so that's something that is very present in small vessel disease and to give you an example i told you about the cellarogen molecules that are expressed at the liminal side of the micro vessels of the brain when they get shaded they are released into the blood right and we can measure them and we know that people that do have small vessel disease they are very high levels of soluble form of this cellarogen molecules that can detect in biofluids so that's already a feature so the what we call on the tail of this function so the on the tailium of the blood vessels are getting very inflamed and they don't do a proper job which in ply also and there is some evidence that the perisites surrounding them are also dysfunctional very quickly in those details and we can measure one I don't know if you mentioned that today but the soluble form of very complicating them pdgf receptor beta so it's platelet derived growth factor receptor beta that's a receptor on the perisites and that's receptor same thing it can be shaded and released into the plasma and into the cs and that can be measured so basically we know in small vessel disease they are high level of perisite dysfunction and high level of point formation of the vasculature so that's and those things we can also what we do nowadays is we try to relate those biofluid biomarkers with the neuroimaging features that we see in people to try to correlate whether there is if you have high level of perisite problems do you have more weight metal disease and things like that so we try to relate what we see in the blood and cs that's what we see in the brain and obviously we look at cognition whether there is a predictive value or whether there's some correlation or association between these biomarkers and cognitive problems but now we are fairly confident that targeting somehow the blood vessels the micro vasculature in small vessel disease is the way to go we have to fix this blood vessels very quickly to to make sure that these people don't go into small declines micro bleeds and other things that will make them detailier detailier very very quickly in terms of cognition and the last thing maybe I forgot to mention is this is the sporadic form of small vessel disease but there is also the genetic form same with our zymers we haven't talked about this but there is the sporadic form the most common form and the genetic form so in terms of small vessel disease there is two diseases that are quite known now and quite studied one is called cedarsial the other one is called cedarsial and interestingly these two diseases involved parasites and vasculus muscle cells so these are the two cells of the brain that are basically dropping around the vessels and eating both the aggregates and in four cedarsial it's not three proteins that aggregates in parasites and vasculus muscle cells which makes our vessels dysfunctional very quickly and those people develop white varieties is at the edge of 30, 40 years old and they go towards cognitively trying very rapidly very severe and can I really about the same thing it's htl1, htl it's tr, he1 sorry protein that is involved but there is the also genetic form that has exactly the same features white monodysis, micro bleeds, lecunes and pre-bren bio-re-issues and we can measure that we have all of the tools now to measure those things very early before people really go to cognitive problems so which means again have to target those vessels to make sure that function properly how common is small vessel disease and do any how common is late on says small vessel disease and how do any of those people actually that have small vessel disease end up getting Alzheimer's disease so our common is very common because a ad and s vd so our pharmacy small vessel result two major form of dementia so it's it's very common more common that we take and and what she said the second question was about sorry people that have if you said there are two separate diseases but I was wondering if people that do develop small vessel disease end up sometimes getting also Alzheimer's like if there is a lot of so yes that makes the research more complicated right yes to give you an example we are we have the duke bio bank here where we have brantishy samples where we can really look at features of these different things out of the house of small disease and a good proportion of small vessel disease dying those patients they do have some sort of CAA that what we talked about earlier several aminoidensuphety and some of them have aminoate so that's the complexity of of dementia there is no pure Alzheimer's disease there is no pure asvd effects always also a new or a new or a new or a new disease that are coming into into the play and so it's difficult to disentangle things but at least when people are alive very good imaging tools and very markers that can measure in blood and C.S. have tells us who is what but some people have and that's true and I couldn't say I'm not an expert that I couldn't say the ratio of how many can have both some people have asvd and leweeper ewe body some people also have some Parkinsonism traits so yeah and for frankly it's not it's very common that we can have two form of dementia kind of simultaneously but yes I hope that that's an interesting question. It does circling back to something you mentioned and sort of briefly you were talking when you were talking about blood brain barrier not functioning well you mentioned glucos metabolism and you decrease or you know it's important for the you know the blood brain barrier being in tact is also very important for you know glucos transport reduced brain glucos metabolism can be measured you know up to decades even before any Alzheimer's disease symptoms or dementia symptoms occur hence you hear the term type 3 diabetes if what effect does breakdown of the blood brain barrier have on brain glucos metabolism. That's another great question and on going studies are tackling this because it's not that key and quite controversial just to tell you a bit more so the main transport of glucose at the blood brain barrier to make sure glucose comes to the brain is a good one. So that's a receptor glutton that has been found to be reducing Alzheimer's disease so people have looked at again post-mortem brain tissue bank and looking at the micro basculature and that be your vessels and they found that as a respite they have much less glutton at the brain barrier which means that there is less that are you know potential of the the flowing glucose in the blood that to penetrate the brain so that's one thing and we can measure that even with several techniques but one of them is a very spectacular pet so positive on the mission to mammography and we can measure what's we call FDG so which is a marker of what people say neural activity things like that so we know that when we inject that tracer it's field delixible because tracer into a patient if you have Alzheimer's and if you don't you will have much less FDG signal if you have Alzheimer's computer control but what is interesting and there's a bit of controversy and how to tell too much about this but people are explaining these data just saying that there's less neural activity and that's that's all but what they don't take into account is these people have less glutton so there's less probability that the the regular lagoon lagoon will go very less with one receptor into the brain so I think the FDG pet signal has to be carefully analyzed in a sense that it could be a neural activity but it also could be indirectly the marker of vascular problems because of what I've just said but again there's experts in the pet field that will tell you the reason why it is not an vice versa it's very technical and I don't have that these but again we know that there's less bit quite one independently of the retuction of the vascular networking as I'm as easy but I think because is a playing a big role here and it's crunchy and sophisticated I don't know much more than that sorry well that's it's everything it's very interesting and it certainly doesn't seem like it the like we have you know the consensus or you know on on on the answer to that question I'll just mention I remember reading a couple of studies years ago where animal studies where omega 3 deficiency caused a reduction in include one transporters in the brain again of course omega 3 deficiency also breaks down blood-brain barrier you know so it's kind of what's first you know like it's always goes reduce glucose getting into the brain affecting blood-brain barrier is blood-brain barrier affecting the glucose transporters are both you know I mean it seems tricky to sort of figure out but um that's the chicken and a question all the time same thing with normally the I mean up I'm not an expert on omega 3 but it's basically the same thing when it comes to peri-side loss on the t-o-le activation like pro-information breakdown of the barrier loss of blood flow what is happening first it's always difficult to address those questions because the human must have the king of studies are cross-sectional you look at one time point now um I think there's more and more studies that follow individuals along it in a little leave with scanning with a looking at biomarkers looking at neuropsyched testings so we're going to get more and so it's very very stupid there's big centers working to that but for the omega 3 yeah I'm not surprised that you said that omega 3 deficiency leads to a reduction of good work that what you said yes it's a good show I haven't read that paper but um but it goes well with what we said earlier right there's a vicious circle where I think it's likely that of course the under-trial peri-side cross-stoke should be very involved in that problems in my opinion and that's something I would love to study I um I'll send you my paper I wrote a sort of interactive review article back in gosh it must have been like 2018 or something I think and it was it was on the important role of MS MS MFS D2A and omega 3 in apoi 4 carriers and I have references because I for for a lot of the studies like the the deficiency you know omega 3 causing group 1 transporters to go down and uh so I'll send you my review you might have been in of course it's it's a little bit uh a little bit of a hypothesis sort of review you know so I review the literature but there's a lot of my sort of thoughts for for people that are actually exploring the field because I'm not I'm not doing these these studies that you know so you might be interested in that and um it's just oops sorry uh just rings a bell um I just remember um reading a couple of stories and it's uh very relevant to what we do in the lab is that yeah omega 3 the fact that you give omega 3 to an to aged animals and I told you with as you age you have information like like an hyper activation of the brain on the tailion and a couple of studies I've I've given some omega 3 to the mice and I remember seeing the reduction of one particular protein that I really like to study and we are currently studying is V KM1 that's a series of the addition molecule 1 and that and um omega 3 was able to reach those levels and we know in the lab we know that V KM1 is a major role upstream of pericite uh detachment so again it's um there's a lot of things that can be connected uh I think it's very interesting and just another word on V KM1 is Tony Whiscoray in uh 10th birthday university uh one of the big lab working on proteomics and all these uh fancy homics uh techniques he looked at arsems and um and uh healthy controls uh he looked at their plasma and he has looked at using proteomics looking at different proteins which which for arsems are in normal aging and what he found I think the most striking finding was normal aging he found um I think very plus uh proteins in the plasma that were elevated with normal aging that were related to blibbin barrier and if you look down I think uh the total five candy dates were uh cellar proteins that are part of the uh on the teal cells obviously the number one that stood out as the number one protein that is elevated with normal aging was soluble decamant so everything um uh you know if you put some studies together it kind of makes sense and are very a bit more to dig but uh I think it makes sense and it might go well with also what omega 3 omega 3 is doing to the to the vascriture so that be nice to leak further it's very interesting that you mentioned uh Tony Wise Cori as well because uh if I recall correctly he's also been involved in research where he's transplanted um young plasma into into you know older mice and it's sort of rejuvenated in the brain and it's like well are there proteins I think the opposite was done as well where it's old plasma was transplanted into younger mice and it's sort of accelerated and I think if I recall correctly blood brain barrier breakdown was part of that um and so it's like identifying those proteins that it's causing it is he's doing a fantastic work and uh and yes correct uh he's doing he's looking at the proteins that we have in the young blood that will help not only uh brain functions or anything like uh to help enough aging too fast but also we found a few key proteins that are involved in the maintaining blood brain barrier as we age so I think it's very interesting and he's using oscodepara alright by osy's model where he can uh link-pronged aging young mice but I think right very important studies uh yeah I and you know the other interesting thing this kind of brings me back to some of your work where um you know I don't know if if I think you mentioned this very early in in our discussion about you know blood brain barrier when it becomes quote unquote leaky you know this allows molecules that usually don't pass into the brain to then pass and uh you had a paper where you had published a couple of years ago with I think it was with your postdoctoral mentor Dr. Slovavik about uh protein called phybrinogen which interestingly enough is also like when I go and get my inflammatory biomarkers measured I like to look at phybrinogen as well as as well as high sensitivity sensitivity to your protein it's an inflammatory marker I mean it's involved in blood coagulation but um you found this in the brain what is the significance of that? Yes um yes and it's not only two years ago I think there's uh in the first report it's probably ten years ago but uh the first report was on again brain tissue samples very valuable tissue samples from the donors where we see that uh in if you compare a control brain uh someone cognitively normal though though issues which so ever and another side was brain or small this will be this brain you start seeing what we call this um extravascular deposition uh phybrinogen is one of the it's one protein that is supposedly in the blood it shouldn't be in the brain at all but we start seeing this extravascular uh deposition of phybrinogen which means that to cross it has you have to have some degree of breakdown of the or the barrier um so it has been found in parisam disease we also found that in animals that either do have our zm disease or have some sort of preventative issues and we know that this protein um that is um important for blood coagulation as you said and information has nothing to do in the brain and it's toxic it's just toxic and we found that it's neurotoxics or toxic to neurons it's also toxic to all the good endrocytes uh where we found that um the the or the good endrocytes are basically cells that are making up myelin and make sure that the white matter is intact and we can function properly and those those or equals are crucial in the brain and we show that when you have the leaky barrier and your phybrinogen going in the or equals are very sensitive to that uh to that phybrinogen so they take it up so they internalize phybrinogen and they die by what we call auto-fagy so it's almost like a suicide test and which leads to white matter disease and if we go back white matter disease is a common feature of Alzheimer's, smallness of disease and as I said earlier also it's the source of white matter disease is likely a preventative brain break down so phybrinogen might play a role in this formation of white matter uh disease so yes it's a very important protein that we found we um interestingly we in animals we were able to reduce uh phybrinogen levels systemically in the blood of course at a level that you don't want to increase uh to have some coagulation problems or increase readings and things like that so you have to reduce at a level that you don't start doing uh bleeding or clotting but just by doing the read just by reducing the phybrinogen level in a mouse model that you have blibbrin bar issues we were able to to demonstrate that very less so we speak mixing let's try to reenegin going in to the break let's wait minute that damage and also interestingly by reducing phybrinogen we were able to to partially restore uh vascular functions in terms of blood flow and also uh integrity of the barrier so phybrinogen has probably different roles that are in the coagulation and inflammation probably a bit more but that's I think that's uh that's one other way we can target toxin things in the blood uh to avoid doing damage to the brain I think it's far easier to fix the uh I don't know but fix the blood vessels rather that but at least it's another evidence that leaky barrier is leading to uh damage to the brain and you don't want that to be seen and the last thing on phybrinogen is just remember going up phybrinogen can activate uh the brain resident immune cells that's all microwave cells uh through CD 11B so that's a specific receptor so when phybrinogen gets in it can bind to micro via so it will induce an over reaction over inflammation of the brain which will be detrimental for for many things for the functions of the cells surrounding and that reminds me that there is a fantastic researcher uh Katarina Kastudhu she's a plat-glat-stolen university you see a set barrier where she I think she developed an antibody that blocks the interaction between phybrinogen and micro via to avoid that over uh because over expression of information or over activation of micro via cells because she's also as Tom Billy ver that that's good at this option though very early and the major contribute to the ledge so that's a very interesting research it's it's very interesting again like you said it's it really um shows the importance of maintaining the blood brain barrier so that it doesn't allow you know things like phybrinogen which is involved in blood coagulation to cross into the brain again as you mentioned the inflammation it's activating microglia cells and it's causing them I mean that whole process you described earlier the inflammation and parisite detachment perhaps and all that um it also as I was reading and doing some background research on some of your work and because I knew of the inflammatory role of phybrinogen you know I had already been familiar with that protein you know separate of uh what happens when it gets into the brain I um I was looking up omega 3 because I had remembered coming across some studies with it and interestingly uh people so air particulate matter so when you have um like air pollution particulate matter when people are exposed to high amounts of it it causes their phybrinogen to go up right it's again an inflammatory marker as well but people that were taking in high amounts of omega 3 it blunted the increase in phybrinogen in plasma and so it would be very interesting to see if in some of the animal models you were discussing if omega 3 could blunt you know the white matter dysfunction caused by phybrinogen getting into the into the brain so again it's another prevention more you know an easier low hanging fruit thing that people can do now right I mean they make sure they're taking in an alpha omega 3 yes exactly um no I cannot agree more um we don't want don't need to repeat what we said but yeah there's this uh kind of vicious cycle where omega 3 may play a major role into uh that skill of functions of course it's not even made play I think that it does play role and it might play even a more important role in people that's risk for us and it's possible like the apoi phybrinogen areas that we've talked about and you mentioned interesting you mentioned airborne particles like pollution right and each I think it it's linked to what we've said earlier so various as I was to keep it simple if we think about as I'm ready to some multifactyl of disease so you have genetic risk possibly you have you have life time makes a size and everything which is also what we've learned very on mental, on environmental factors and pollution is what and there's multiple studies as you know showing that if you're if you live in a city big city you're more chance to develop some sort of dementia and I'm part of two studies that we've published four to five years ago maybe where we we exposed my studio bones particles from Los Angeles were taking from the the highway the particles and giving it to the mouse to see what's the impact of the pollution on vascular function because there's some evidence also using scans those people have tend to have more weight better disease and seeing the like that so we started looking into that and we found very interestingly we we found a high peak of a vascular it's a longitudinal disease but we very rapidly a few days after giving the particles to the mouse we were seeing blibbering by a breakdown and pericycle generation very quickly one of the first sign that we could see of course now there's debate on the mechanisms whether the particles penetrate into the brain through the dual-sactory area or whether it's directly the particles in the bloodstream that activate maybe as we said the under-tillium a bit too much which will indirectly cause some vascular issues that I think there's a more studies going on but definitely on environmental factors and pollution is a big thing to take into consideration when it comes to dementia and especially vascular function because we breathe that everyday right so this has to to to something with vascular so it's another factor but I guess it's not good I guess if you have a happy four and not doing exercise and living in a big city you probably have much more chance to develop some sort of vascular problems as we know but we try to understand how this is happening yes I I remember reading a study where babies you know in Mexico City post-mortem they found in unfortunately in babies they had like all sorts of amoloid plaques in their brain and don't think that's normal and Mexican stuff like yeah yeah it's highly polluted yeah yeah it makes it makes it wonder about filtering out the air I mean if there's some happy filter or something that helps a little bit as well as omega 3 has been shown I know I keep going back to that but it's been shown to help a lot some of the air pollution I know it's it's you know it the research has it you know so yeah I mean the I don't know I mean if we that be nice to I'm pretty sure people are working that but there is some countries or cities that are wearing masks things like that in China for example so that we I guess it's hard it would be a long study but I guess we could compare highly polluted cities and people wearing filtering and masks things like that to see whether they can pre-tive preserve some mask better mask reforctions and things like that but yeah I guess there's probably on Goex studies that yeah going back to the apoi for you know because it is such a a big genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease and you know as you mentioned you know at least about a quarter of the population has one allele I know you had done some some research we talked about how blood brain barrier seems to break down at least you're able to measure it you know in earlier in or not cognitively normal individuals but you also mentioned in one of your papers there was a protein cyclophilin a matrix metalloproteinase as a as a protein that seems to be really involved in you know it's an inflammatory protein but how does affect the blood brain barrier? Yeah those so in the same paper we were mentioning earlier that people carrying at least one allele of apoi for the tend to have more leakage in the major temporal lobe that we can see with MRI and biomarkers but of course it's a great descriptive study but we went deeper to try to understand how this is happening and what we found is the people carrying the apoi for a leal so apoi you have to know that the major source of apoi are astrocytes so when astrocytes makes apoi so if you have apoi three makes apoi three she has four makes apoi four we know that there's a different affinity to one of the apoi receptor that is called LRP one on parasites so astrocytes and parasites are close to each other they are here to maintain the the vasculature as well as the owner function and your vascul coupling but if you so the apoi four is I don't want to say anything wrong but there's a different affinity to the LRP one receptor you have less chance to buy to LRP one which will induce a cascade we win the parasites that involve NSKPB to be completely complicated cyclophina which then will lead to expression of MAP9 from parasites and other to yourself so basically if you have the apoi for team you will induce much more that cascade for 10 people having the apoi three because it doesn't bind to the LRP one on parasite it doesn't trigger the cascade of expressing cyclophina which will release MMP9 and MMP9 is the matrix METALO proteinase NIE that is basically is doing two things that you don't want number one is disrupting and the tight junctions between the endotield cells so all the endotield cells are tightly close to each other and there's tight junctions in between so this MMP9 will eat up those tight junctions so if you think about this you're going to get some gaps and that's what we call breakdown the barrier so you're going to start to see leakage and the other thing is there's a basement membrane we haven't talked about there's a basement membrane wrapping around the vessels and wrapping around the parasites and MMP9 is also eating up this basement membrane so two things that will basically break down the the integrity of the the membrane ferrie and interestingly MMP9 it's good to go back a bit she years back it's a very nice marker when it comes to the membrane barrier leakage we know as the stroke when you have a blood clot in your prey you have weaving to the next few hours you have a breakdown of the membrane barrier and a big East chemical agent and six like that and we know that this breakdown is correlated with high levels on MMP9 there's a perfect correlation of these breakdown but they're interestingly when you have a the NISCANIC stroke you have a second breakdown a few days later so it's a what we call BPhasic a bi-phasic or B-cyc, C-E-Z, M-O, that's my friend Bphasic breakdown of the barring two hours and two days and and same thing for MMP9 two peaks of expression so it's a very nice marker that goes very well with a pre-branded bi-pop it so we found this in a Poi4 and both MMP9 and cyclophinae levels were elevated in several spinal fluid of people carrying the Poi4G so we were we were talking about three to four volt if I remember correctly compared to people carrying the Poi3T so that's a major thing and so and we also found that we've used pure purely put on stem cells so we also used human derived parasites so IPSC is derived parasites in culture and when you look at them these are just culture the human parasites human on the TL cells and different cell types and we did that for donors from MMP4 and donors from MMP3 and just at baseline we were able to also see that the pericides just at baseline looking at that they produce much more of a cyclophinae and MMP9 than the pericides that do have a Poi3 so it's these are the evidres that we put and I think that goes very well with that is we published a photo-op studying vites where we decided to target cyclophinae to block cyclophinae to see whether if we have mice that do have a Poi4 if we block cyclophinae can we restore vascular function and ultimately the goal is to restore neural function and coverage so we did that we used a humanized apoi4 mice this is our mice that have the apoi4 gene of the human so we we have also the mice that do have the apoi3 we follow them as the age we do MRI on them we do tap the oblivion bar function how the blood flow and everything and we we see exactly what we see human is they have reduced blood flow in the brain they have a leaky abridvant barrier they have some behavioral problems also in terms of cognition when what we call novel object recognition of object location those memory issues so these mice are quite you know doing what we were expecting to and we gave every day for one month to the apoi4 mice we gave a non-type an inhibitor of cyclophinae that is called at a debut 025 so that's a drug that is available charging clinical trial for hepatitis C so we gave it to the mouse every day for one month and we checked the same thing we did MRI we looked at brain tissue analysis we did behavior and as we were expecting just by doing that we were able again it's not a fully of school recovery but we were able to partially and significantly restore vascular function so just by protein cyclophinae we were able to restore tydronctions we were able to restore the very side coverage of the vascular and ultimately those mice had less neonol damage and less cognitive problems so it's a good good paper that says she target the vessels you can have a big impact on neonol function and cognition so that's a that's kind of the whole story into two papers regarding the apoi4 yeah is that drug is it a couple of questions regarding it so that is it the same as the Alice poor of your I think it's when yes yes okay how safe is that I mean is that you know something I mean first of all like I mean like if you have an apoi4 allele it's like you know like could you take that prophoralactically would you have to take it like your whole life like is it you know like that would be interesting yeah I mean these are good question I don't know easily expect to address these questions but I'd be sure if you did say so first of all I wouldn't say it's safe but so they had been shooting equal trials and unfortunately some of them have been stopped and I think it was for design for epititisi it's also currently used by the way it has been used a year ago for COVID-19 in France we're too to kind of for the long people having very long like a lot of long information uh things like that actually but I again I haven't checked recently but I know the this stopped the trial falls one person that had some cardiac issues after the treatment so I cannot see it safe for it's not safe what I think is we need to design the trial and give it to the right people I think rather than giving like this I think you have to go through criteria before being able to give it I don't know if targeting cyclophine is the best approach at least we know it partially work in animals but it might be another possibility might be to target MNP9 so these are close to each other this has been also studied quite a lot in context of stroke but as you know there's thousand compounds that failed in stroke for many reasons but I don't think anyone has tried targeting MNP9 to look at more subtle driven by leaking essence see whether we can kind of seal the bark yes I'm not yeah so basically there's a whole purpose of what we are doing right now is we are we know the if she targets that might not be the safest of maybe not the best target but we have the list of other targets that we are studying which will hopefully do the same thing we want to restore pericide function we want to restore on the tail function and make sure the driven part barrier is not that he pushing the floor as you need to for your brain and make sure also something we haven't really talked about the transporters of the brain barrier if you start having a leaky barrier you're going to have some transport issues so it comes back to leaky or oxygen but also I'm you know it if you have a leaky barrier and you have your vessels that are not functional there is a few receptors rage LAP1 there's a few others if they don't work properly you're going to you won't be able to waste I mean to clear your your waste from your brain while you sleep and things like that so you won't you will have the tendency to accumulate more aminoate or ecomers and possibly the replacing so everything is interconnected but again yeah I think fixing the blood vessels whether side to a few nays or right target I don't know but I think it's promising we just have to see who will benefit from getting the drug so if you if you're having a dysfunctional blood brain barrier you know if you're basically having blood brain barrier breakdown everything you've been describing the glimfatic system which is when you sleep it squirts the cerebellisinal fluid into the brain to clear out the amoloid plaques is that is that also impaired somewhat so there's active research in this area obviously but that's that that's fair to say yes of course if you have because the you know at the arterial level you have the perivascular space which is a large when you sleep just been shown and and yeah of course if you have disruption of these vessels obviously the perivascular space will be the properties and the cells being around the perivascular macrophages and everything will be highly disturbed yes it's fair to say it's just the glimfatic system it's it's a very controversial node as you may know we don't really know whether I mean the the fact that we clear out of things from the arterial level and then it gets fairs a convective flow that trains the interest to show through it back to the veins that's kind of the theory of the system but I think it requires a bit more work to prove that this is truly happening in my opinion but this is also all the system there is the iPad so that's the intramural peri arterial drainage so there's basically either the kinphatic and all the iPad system to clear out stocksings out of the brain again I'm not the expert on that but it's fair to say that of course if you have a vascular dysfunction the the clearance of of toxins not on the amilloid but I fast-neutling or all the things will be highly disturbed yes so and my opinion that that sort of puts of course the the vascular function and blood brain barrier integrity upstream of amilloid in a way because you'll you know having that dysfunction first will then lead to more you know amilloid accumulation you know if you're not able to clear it out right I mean so what do you think of a lot of so there's been a lot of failed attempts to target amilloid beta plaques amilloid soluble soluble amilloid although recently there's the licanumab which is targets the protofibro fibro so it's still a like a soluble form of amilloid but there's some positive results with that drug do you have any thoughts about it do you think yeah I think I like to be optimistic and I like to be positive so yeah I think it's good that we have drugs for not only for yeah for research for people so it's for people so the semi-neus affected it's good that we have a drug that can remove some extent the plaques we visit evidence of that what is the best the best a bit less a bit more controversial is the the impact on cognition so there's some some you know improvement but it's not what you would hope for so which goes back to okay targeting amilloid on this probably not the way to go and sparmine not sufficient or maybe too late also so it goes back to our important research if you tackle things and and target things much more earlier than that you would have a bit of chance yes so I don't have much let's to say I think I we see more like as a cocktail of treatment if you give something that will make your blood vessels working as this should work in terms of pericite function and clearance on the tail function plus the drug of like an entire milloid any four I would bed that you would have more chance to to have a bigger impact bigger positive impact very positive impact on cognition but again this has to be done very early shea shea shea shea shea shea her brain is full of plaques it's probably too late alright so that's the importance of the research we do right now but I see that as a cocktail maybe improving the blood vessels because we know we need those blood vessels to be functional to cheer out amilloid and yeah so the combination would be probably a viable solution in the near future maybe so on the opposite end of treatment would be prevention and I think looking at dementia and Alzheimer's disease more as a vascular disease sort of opens up the doors for a lot of preventative measures you know one you know blood pressure so it's actually very common you know in at least in the United States almost 50% of the US adults have hypertension and 20% of younger adults do age 13 18 to 39 so how does high blood pressure affect the brain and dementia risk? no that's that's very important so Vesa I would see this three at least the three major to at least in my research I'm not saying major is all the three major cardiovascular aspects I pretend to be one but there's diabetes I pretty pity but in terms of hypertension and I think you've sent me a few papers but I think it's very interesting to you to know that if you have early hypertension you have hypertension it's possibly more harmful than if you have it later in life and I guess it's just a question of duration if you have a sustained like if you have hypertension stain over many years you speak it can impact the stiffness of your blood vessels it will impact as we talk with the very site function at some point so yeah I mean a lot of line is yes hypertension is known to impact the brain and very like the basal ganglia and those deep structures that serve for quite a lot from my hypertension where we see also a vasopo is an association when people have hypertension it tend to you have more microblidings also in this area of basal ganglia so yes he does impact to brain and we know there's a few studies that shows that hypertension also trigger triggers a preventative barrier leakage and pericite loss it's not the most story because in terms of small vessel disease if we come back earlier we we are sad that one of the cause or maybe the major cause of small vessel disease was hypertension but nowadays we know that's not the case because to give you an example here maybe a third even more of the coat of swan vessel disease patient that we follow they don't have any hypertension first of all so it tells you that there's a big chunk of people that can move to your small vessel disease so meaning adding white metal disease that's where it's sought to be due to hypertension and how the damage vessels but it's not the case so that's a bit more complicated but obviously it's not good to have a hypertension as we know for the brain and there's some studies showing that the giving on type pretensive drugs as a positive impact on cognition as well so it tells you that no matter what if you have hypertension you have to try to reduce it obviously to pharmacology because it will have an impact but interestingly to just go back at the beginning of my answer if this it's a bit controversial but she has heraly like 30 40s the 30s 40s she has heraly hypertension you you will have a likely good and more chance to develop community kind quickly as compared to a normal like a normal intensive person at the same age and interestingly they were showing also in the paper that each other potential during this year 70s if I remember correctly it doesn't impact you will likely to develop so it goes back to you I think the just the final point is I think it's very important the duration is the crud the crud the part of hypertension is very critical if you have that for many years same thing for inflammation as you age you have a crudnik slow low grade inflammation as we'll disrupt your vessels very slow probably the same thing we have pretension if you have too much hypertension your terrible stiffness will be you know disturbance and damage of the time and this will up the gradual prevent barrier value much faster than a normal tensile person and this has the regional specificity and different sensitivity in the brain but yes but that's an active area again we have tools now to measure these brain regions how the leak and try to compare to you people with hypertension but the difficult part in clinical research is no one is hypertension and nothing else right i-contensive in the fingers there's always comorbidities or bgte other things so it's hard to disentangle what pure hypertension is doing to the blood vessels because there's always other things you can try to correct statistically with covariance and things it's quite hard to do to study so does seem like last you mentioned cumulative exposure yeah seems to be the the more important thing here and again people that are probably in there 20s 30s 40s aren't even if they have high blood pressure aren't probably thinking it's a big deal and in fact that's probably the biggest deal because they're starting early with the high blood pressure that's my thought that's what we've read yeah same thing with exercise i think what we hear from these recent studies is the critical window is I don't think I'm correct you may know better than me but it's like 4555 something like that where you really had have to exercise and to come come back to the small vessels you have to open them up and make sure they are functional that's the critical window is that I think it's partly true for sure the tell you you may know a bit more than me on that question but yes I think that's the time that's it yeah certainly it's never too late to start exercising and there's been there have been studies showing even the 70s you can have cardiovascular improvements of course in this back earlier is better you know and and exercise as you mentioned it is one of the best ways to improve you know cardiovascular function and improves blood pressure or territorial function all those things and interestingly the sauna also does that the heat stress a lot of the physiological aspects of elevator and you know that the test yeah just and there's a lot of research in fact there's of course with you know observational data it's and you never can establish causation as you mentioned there's all sorts of acoustic covarious and things but there are studies showing that you know do independently sauna uses a society with like a 60% lower dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk if you're using the sauna 47 times a week if you use it you know two to three times a week there's like a 20% lower risk after adjusting for other factors as well but we do know sauna like there's there's intervention studies I mean it's it's comparable to moderate aerobic exercise in in terms of the effects on blood pressure okay heart rate variability and stuff so also sort of just interesting but exercise being a really important one for you know prevention you know dementia and Alzheimer's disease prevention as much as you can do how does alcohol affect the blood brain barrier? Again I think it's a bit controversial with a case where I know from the literature is a chronic consumption obviously is not good and interestingly we can see I don't know if you've seen that but there is a gender effect with sex effect so the male's tend to have if you're a chronic drinker of alcohol you tend you you will have some best-cubler issues it has been linked so you're chronically a trickle you have a leak here but Brebren barrier it has been shown but if you're a woman drink the same as age miles and everything they will they will have almost preserved vasculine function that's very interesting again but it's again a few studies but the hypothesis that they bring you are your estrogen and all these that have on time inflammatory properties and triglyctopes but so obviously drink too much does impact your vasculine function so what is a bit more controversial is like moderate drinking so there's a you can see things showing that moderate drinking is up is impacting your brain function but not only brain function but vasculine properties of the brain and there's also other studies that show that moderate drinking doesn't do anything it's it's even positive sub case so I think it's I'm not an expert on that subject but I guess if you go in details into the design of the studies you may find the the reason why these are different results but that's the the results they put that short so yeah I you probably know better than me what what it does but yes to some extent did just the alcohol itself impact preventive functions just by increasing the level of cytokines in the blood blood and which will increase the inflammation of the blood vessels so yes and if we go back to dementia and in some aging if you do that chronically obviously if you sustain if you have sustained level of inflammation of your blood vessels we know what it does you know it's it's it's currently in per per side functions and all the time it possibly leading to leakage which yeah it's a bit bad so chronic drinking is of course people will have a more chance to develop dementia very quick so but yeah I don't know if you know more than me but that's what I know about that yeah I know that the the same guy's very kind it's there's a lot of conflicting data yeah and you'll find again as you said some studies showing moderate alcohol consumption protecting against dementia and I'm showing it not as I sort of tried to dig deeper what I was finding was it was protective and people that were not April before positive yeah okay and and so you know and then of course it all comes down to each study how they defined moderate or light drinking actually different as well so it's not yeah and some in some cases it's like okay well light drinking is less than wondering cadet yeah or then in some cases it was like the study that weekly so it's like okay less than three drinks a week well that means some days you're not having any so there's so many variables here that it seems challenging to that's an interesting area because I mean I'm just thinking when when we tell me drinking I think about red wine and pratch and red wine our full of slavanoids that you know from the grapes which has been shown to be very important for brain functions and and also for vascular so there's also the positive of thinking that way she take a little bit of wine I don't know how frequent because I don't know the studies and how much she should drink but at least one glass every now and then right should be helpful and good for your break that's another thing so I think void daily drinking sounds of course um do you know about you mentioned like you know obesity and and tap-tube abd's and these things also I mean does obesity accelerate the blood brain barrier breakdown or weakness? so yes so I've seen a few studies showing that but also interestingly I don't know she know that William Banks one of the he's not the one of the most I've the yeah the most highly society researcher when it comes to bliper and barrier I think he is the incaliponia he also brought a recent review that bliper and barrier leakage will trigger obesity and not the other way around as we as we age so it's very interesting I haven't read the region details but yes I found studies that shows that obesity of course these people tend to have higher levels of in print-fametery markers, cytokines, chemokines in the blood and things like that which will have an impact on barrier function we know that but the other way around I didn't know I've just found that recently we've William Banks so interesting but I think he's claiming that very some sub like epitome is a barrier that are basically you know controlling starvation and the way you should eat and things like that and if the vasculature in this area or kind of leaky that's where you're gonna start having some of this function in this starvation and footing take and things like that so people will start to eat too much and so I think it's interesting I haven't read the review but I can send it to you make it so interesting idea but a few ways when data is supporting that sounds like a vicious cycle I mean I thought this ending is he was like obesity visceral fat I mean that's inflammatory you know environment so it makes to me it would make sense that it would affect the blood barrier in a negative way what about homocysteine high homocysteine does it's a cause of one of many causes of high blood pressure I don't know much yeah yeah just curious yeah because I did see you know like it's also associated with brain dysfunction and dementia and there was like at least one study I saw where yeah I've seen that it's a classic I mean look classic it's a mockery that is often looked at but I'm not very knowledgeable and the past ways that are involved we've almost stayed yeah you know if you don't study that yeah if you have some I'll be to read more about this yeah yeah there's a paper I linked you to and some of the notes I sent that in people with that had high homocysteine when they were treated with a b6 b12 fully sort of concoction to help lower their homocysteine it improved their their cognition and also markers of bloodbremberia so interesting but I mean I know it's not the focus of your research it's I mean I think this is really great actually like looking it's it's there has been a lot of paradigm shifts in people's thoughts on Alzheimer's disease with them thinking about it being a metabolic disease and a lot of it type 3 diabetes so here but like I think this vascular dysfunction is it's so crucial and you know I think me go hand in hand with the metabolism maybe you know at the root of it but you know identifying some of these early biomarkers that you were mentioning even in plasma I don't know how early or if they're even available to people to measure are they it's till at the research phase so there's a I don't know you know but there's a new technique called editorial chemoly mini-sense and there's two major platforms worldwide one is called mesoscal discovery MSD here's the one it's the c-mole c-mole platform and the beauty of these two technologies is you can use a small amount of fluid and you can get a lot of data basically to make it simple and and so these particular failure new vascular biomarkers are currently being you know validated and everything in those platforms that will be eyes through put and where you can imagine to to do a lot of the patients at the time right eyes quite the work flow right I quite long and difficult for the toy which I asked anybody markers we want like same as we heard from Japan if you can get same as you get your blood glucose right from the finger you can get your amino it status right I'm your age 42 levels now and she's like that and get diagnosed with a she has Alzheimer's or not from just a drop of blood so that would be the idea basically having this but this would require probably a few years obviously but it's available at the research level but not at the clinical level as of yet what about the cyborg platelet derived growth factor receptor when you mentioned so it's it's and it's ongoing in clinical trials in the U.S so I guess it requires it has been done in hundreds of patients participants now they try to build up go to thousands you know you need some validation step with bigger cohorts and and make sure that this is truly elevated let's say we've up before we veging in a much larger cohort of patients but yeah I think it's much closer to to be available hopefully talking about months you're you're to hopefully yeah but I'm not well a lot of that validation step but hopefully this will come quick because I think it's a very very very valuable tool for for us yeah I'm I'm very thankful for the research that you do in your lab axle and and others you know Dr. Slobobick and and some of the people you mentioned I mean just that people are out there trying to identify new biomarkers of dementia and Alzheimer's vascular biomarkers and new treatments and also opening up more preventative measures and you know understanding it in a different way so thank you so much for all the research you do for coming on the podcast I I know you're on Twitter I follow you on Twitter your Twitter handle is at a xl and then underscore m o n t a g n e for anyone that wants to follow axle and Twitter he tweets interesting studies related to the stuff we talked about today you also have a lab website which I was perusing a very nice one and montain lab at dot com so that's m o n t a g n e l a b dot com and a willing to those as well on our episode but really I learned a learned a lot today axle I really appreciate you taking time to to educate to educate everyone on on this important role that vascular function plays in cognitive function in preventing neurodegenerative diseases and just healthy brain aging in general so thank you very much for invitation I really enjoyed it so I hope the listeners will will do

Dr. Rhonda Patrick here. Today we're going to talk about psilocybin. psilocybin is a compound produced by certain types of mushrooms. These mushrooms often called magic mushrooms due to their psychoactive effects have been used by humans for thousands of years, often for ceremonial purposes. Now modern medicine shows that psilocybin may have therapeutic benefits for clinical depression. Researchers first began studying psilocybin in the 1950s when it showed promise even back then as a therapeutic drug for several mental health conditions. But psilocybin use was banned during the 1970s, which meant it was incredibly difficult for scientists to continue their research. It wasn't until several decades later that researchers were able to start investigating it again. In many ways, the progress since then has been a bit of a psychedelic renaissance. This time, a little bit closer to the standards expected of mainstream science. The effects of psilocybin on our brain are complex. The effect most people may be familiar with is its distinctive auditory and visual hallucinations it causes when ingested. Scientists think psilocybin does this primarily by interacting with receptors in the brain, particularly in the thalamus, a region of the brain that processes sensory information from our environment. Things we see, touch, and hear. It decreases thalamus and it can be found in a sense of the lack of activity causing sensory alterations or hallucinations. psilocybin also seems to have positive effects in treating mood disorders like depression. In one small study involving a dull to had depression, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine found that after just two doses of psilocybin combined with psychotherapy, half of the study participants achieved remission of their depressive symptoms for at least one month. Years ago, I had the privilege of speaking with the senior author of this study Dr. Roland Griffiths, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins. When discussing a previous study, he explained the clinical protocol his team uses and some of the qualities of the experiences that he believes may underlie the antidepressin effects of psilocybin. And so one of the first studies that we've conducted looking at therapeutic effects is to look at cancer patients who are experiencing very significant anxiety or fear in face of a life threatening cancer diagnosis. And it turns out that this kind of very disquieting existential anxiety and sometimes depression very often accompanies these life threatening cancer diagnosis as you might expect that it would. On the session day, they take a capsule. This is synthesized psilocybin. It's not the, it's not mushrooms. And they're invited to lay down on this couch with eye shades and headphones through which they listen to a program of music. And then they're invited to direct their attention inward on their inner experience. So this isn't a guided session. There are two people present here who just provide reassurance if it's needed. But really, are there just for safety purposes and to make people feel that if anxiety or fear arises, that they can just be reassured that despite what they may be feeling, they're going to be back to consensual reality by the end of the day. So this, this is the context and it's very hard to pin down the specific nature of the, of the experience because it can be really quite varied. The central feature is this sense of the interconnectedness of all people and things. It's a sense of unity. And that's accompanied by a sense of sacredness or reverence for that experience. There's something humbling about that experience. And also very important, the experience has an authenticity to it, a truth value to it that people will often say, it's more real and more true than everyday waking consciousness. And interestingly, these people experience very large and sustained decreases in anxiety and depression. And there was effects occurred really quite promptly after the administration of the drug. And although the design of the study was such, it was a crossover design. So people were crossed over between essentially an inactive dose of psilocybin to an active dose or vice versa. So the strongest conclusion we can make comparing our placebo condition and our active condition. This effect lasted out to five weeks. But in fact, we followed people out to six months. And there was no evidence that there was any significant rate of relapse over that period of time. So in other words, most people who demonstrated a large therapeutic effect remained having low levels of anxiety or depression out to six months. So there's suggestive evidence that there's a long duration of treatment after one treatment. Yeah. Several other small studies have also shown psilocybin to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression. And in one study from the Imperial College London has gone even further. The small study concluded that psilocybin treatment combined again with psychotherapy produced similar results compared to traditional SSRI antidepressant treatments. But these are small early stage clinical trials and much more investigation will be needed. As clinical research continues, it's still poorly understood how or why psilocybin works in the brain to counteract depression. But in a recent study from Yale University, researchers attempted to answer this question. They found psilocybin creates new and lasting connections in the brain, or at least in mass in this study researchers examine the neurons in the animals frontal cortex, which is a part of the brain implicated in higher level cognition, memory and decision making. You can think of a neuron like a tree with a trunk, roots and branches with leaves. Neurons receive electrical input from other cells through their dendritic spines and pass along electrical signals to other cells through their axons. This connection is called the synapse. In particular, the researchers were focused on the animals' dendritic spines. That's because these tiny membrane protrusions may be significant for those suffering from depression. Though we're still not entirely sure why people become depressed, researchers believe the condition may be associated with low synapse density and certain areas of the brain. This makes researchers think there may be a link between dendritic spine density and depression, and that potentially by increasing spine formation, we might be able to combat depression. So, back to the mice, after the researchers gave them a psilocybin dose, they studied their brains to see what happened. They found that the single dose of psilocybin increased the formation of new dendritic spines. A 12% increase a week after exposure, and some of these new connection sites were still there a month after the mouse's psilocybin dose. The researchers also noted that psilocybin improved stress related behavior in the mice, and it promoted excitatory neurotransmission, meaning it increased neuron activity in the brain, which combat at the decrease and neurotransmission scene when mice were subjected to chronic stress. This research only shows how psilocybin affected mice, but it's still another step in understanding how this compound works in the brains of humans. Though there is one clinical study showing that psilocybin does seem as effective as SSRIs in the short term, we need more research to fully understand how psilocybin works against mental illness. We also need to learn more about why depression occurs, and how it affects our brains before we can truly figure out how to combat it. One particular area I hope to see converge is what role psychedelics may also play as immunomodulators, even as a secondary effect, particularly in light of what we know about the role of inflammation in the listening symptoms of depression. There's still a lot to uncover on this topic. Research on the role of psilocybin as a depression treatment is still in its infancy. It does not yet meet the standard needed by modern medicine to be called a bonafide treatment for clinical depression. Will that change? Only time will tell. I'm Dr. Rhonda Patrick and I'll catch you next time.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick here, today I want to talk about exercise and addiction, and why vigorous exercise might be the perfect thing to start doing when taking a break from something addictive, like alcohol, for example. It's long been known that exercise causes many measurable metabolic changes in the body. For example, our muscles produce lactic acid during intense anaerobic activity, and this feels the brain as lactate. Another substance that is released both by muscle and the liver during exercise is a hormone called FGF21. A recent study found that giving FGF21 as a drug reduced alcohol consumption up to 50% in mice and vervit monkeys that were addicted to alcohol. FGF21 produced as a result of exercise particularly vigorous aerobic exercise can cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to receptors in the hypothalamus. It also alters dopamine signaling. Dopamine is used in reward pathways in the brain which play a role in alcohol seeking behavior. FGF21 is normally produced in the liver and fat tissue in controls many aspects of our metabolism. Glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity, blood-lippid cholesterol levels, and our body weight. While FGF21 might have an effect in our behavior that relationships seem to go both ways, increased blood levels of FGF21 have been observed after acute exercise long-term fasting, very low calorie diets, excessive carb intake and drinking alcohol. So with that basic understanding of FGF21, let's dive into two recent studies that hint at FGF21's role in regulating addictive behaviors and how exercise could help treat these behaviors. In the first study, a small randomized crossover trial, 10 healthy active young men were randomly assigned to either bike or resistance train for one hour. Then, six to ten days later, they switched programs and did the opposite workout. They biked at 70% of their VO2 max and exercise intensity roughly equivalent to a steady run and then engaged in resistance training involving a specific sequence of weighted exercises. Scientists found that FGF21 levels were elevated 15 minutes after exercise, peaked around 60 minutes later and then returned to baseline two hours after exercise. This study found there was a rise in FGF21 after biking but not resistance training. However, a separate study published in 2019 found and increased from both aerobic exercise and resistance training. In the second study I want to focus on today, researchers used several different animal model experiments to try and tease out FGF21's role in addictive behaviors. They found three main things in mice. First, they found that FGF21 is released from the liver after alcohol consumption. This has also been shown in humans. Second, they found that mice lacking the ability to release FGF21 consumed more alcohol than those that could release it. And finally, they found giving mice an FGF21 analog as a drug decreased alcohol consumption by as much as 50% compared to those not given the FGF21 drug. In addition to the mice, researchers also conducted an experiment with vervitt monkeys. Some vervitt monkeys will voluntarily drink alcohol sometimes in excess when they're given the option. The researchers gave half of these monkeys the FGF21 drug. Those given FGF21 reduced their alcohol consumption in comparison to those given not given the FGF21 drug. This implies that FGF21 is involved in telling our brains whether we should drink more alcohol or not. It also implies giving FGF21 as a drug may decrease alcohol consumption. Additionally, the researchers identified what they called a homostatic liver-to-brain circuit, involved in regulating alcohol consumption. This prompted the studies authors to make two interesting comments. One is that the FGF21 pathway isn't working properly, it could contribute to alcohol dependency. The second is that they believe that there's potential to target FGF21 therapeutically to help treat alcohol dependency. However, there is more to this story. These two studies taken together suggest that some types of exercise particularly aerobic exercise could play a role in helping treat alcohol abuse disorders and potentially other substance abuse disorders. And there is data to support that link. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials using exercise interventions for the treatment of alcohol abuse disorders, exercise reduced alcohol consumption individuals with alcohol abuse disorder. The exercise interventions included all forms of exercise such as aerobic exercise, resistance training, and compared them to standard treatments. Other studies have also shown exercise is a useful adjunct of tool to combat alcohol abuse disorders, possibly by acting on hormones and other neurotransmitters involved in the mechanisms of addiction. Exercise physiologies incredibly complex and substance abuse disorders are hugely multifaceted. So much more research is needed to understand the connection between the two. Ultimately, FGF21 might play a small part in a much larger story. The biggest story of all however is and will continue to be exercise frequently and vigorously if possible. The benefits for the brain and even behavior are enormous. I'm Dr. Rhonda Patrick and I'll catch you next time.

you know, the series of papers, bribed in between a mid-Aufus group, I think with a landmark papers in this field, they were the ones that did the showing there's an enhanced protein synthetic response to amino acid infusion with omega-3s and they replicated that in younger people and all the people. If you look at the difference that the omega-3s had on the point since that's a cross-punch of thinking there's no way like that is, that is huge. And then they followed it up with another study in younger people, the kind of let a lot of credence to it and then they followed it up with a longer trudinal feed and I think it was six months of two grams per day of EPA and DHA and the changes there were quite significant I believe it was in, I believe it was mass, a multi-shore strength and at that point you're like wow okay, we now I need to see that warm lab, it's a really strong lab, very well respected, high quality work, well still a great then published the paper with acrylic, similar participant cohort, similar duration and replicated what had been shown by potato-mitten-dolphins groups and then you think okay there's something really going on here and then we've seen the protection against issues, archafean in your women. So there's now this growing body of evidence that suggests that omega-3s are on a ballic and they seem to be on a ballic particularly in older adults not just from a protein synthetic point of view but also from the perspective of kind of mitigating the declines in muscle, muscle and size. Today's episode will cover something profound, something a little unexpected which is yet another role for omega-3 fatty acids. We are not going to talk about brain function, cardio-bastula-risk and surprisingly not even that much about inflammation. Instead we're going to dive deep into the world of omega-3 fatty acids and they're impact on muscle health and the role of omega-3 for disused atrophy and perhaps even a role in building muscle. Picture this scenario, you've injured your leg or you've had a surgery and your leg or legs have been immobilized for weeks. As the cast comes off or as you're able to walk again you notice a significant loss in muscle mass and strength. Even if you're otherwise young and healthy as little as two weeks could result in nearly 15% loss in the cross-sectional area of your quadricep muscle. This is devastating but even more so if you're an elderly person. This kind of event can trigger a downward spiral and a crossing of a disability threshold. A point at which physical function has become so severely impaired that it now undermines the daily activities that ordinarily would prevent even greater muscle loss. Once this threshold is crossed it leads to a catabolic crisis. This state perpetuates the body's breakdown of muscle progressing catastrophically towards mortality. But consider if in that same scenario you could cut that disused muscle atrophy nearly in half. This is where the research of Dr. Chris McLeory on omega-3 fatty acids and muscle mass could offer a potential solution. In this episode we'll explore omega-3's impact on muscle mass, protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. We'll be exploring the potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids for enhancing muscle protein synthesis, especially in response to protein consumption. This process can be diminished during periods of disuse and becomes particularly important as we age. We'll discuss if this effect could improve muscle protein synthesis even when dietary protein intake is less than ideal. A situation particularly relevant for many older adults. As we age, our protein intake tends to decrease and our ability to respond to dietary protein and amino acids through muscle protein synthesis weekends. These factors contribute to sarcopenia which is characterized by the loss of muscle mass in older age. Omega-3's potential to enhance muscle protein synthesis in response to suboptimal protein intake could be especially beneficial for older adults who often experience both insufficient protein intake and a reduced ability to effectively respond to it. A phenomenon known as anabolic resistance. Dr. McLeory's findings may be applicable to anyone experiencing muscle disuse, but they may hold particular significance for older individuals. His latest research aims to figure out what the optimal dose and duration of omega-3 supplementation is for muscle health. His new trial will examine muscle protein breakdown and the effects of omega-3's on mitochondria, potentially leading to exciting clinical applications for those experiencing age-related muscle loss or periods of disuse. What is also exciting is the part of this discussion on how omega-3 may improve muscle strength and walking performance in older individuals, especially when combined with resistance training. In other words, it's possible that omega-3 rather than just fighting disuse atrophy may actually improve our overall muscle protein synthesis response and thereby enhance our muscles' ability to grow. Yet to be determined, this effect could be general or might better apply to specific situations where dietary protein intake is slightly below ideal. Even temporarily. If so, omega-3 might not only be anti-cathabolic, but potentially actively anabolic in these contexts. Now, let's be real in a world where the recommended daily allowance for protein intake could be 50% higher and still not fully optimal for hypertrophy, any effect that makes sub-optimal protein intake a bit less sub-optimal would be appreciated. And what about those days when you're swamped or forget to refuel? All of these scenarios, whether ongoing or temporary, might be relevant. While we need more evidence to back the exciting possibility, it opens up an intriguing new area of omega-3 research that Dr. McGlorie is exploring. So whether you're an older adult looking to maintain muscle mass, someone recovering from an injury or anticipating some planned downtime like a surgery, or simply curious about the latest breakthroughs in muscle health, this episode is packed with invaluable insights. Join us as we explore the power of omega-3 fatty acids on a whole new frontier, which is their ability to enhance muscle preservation and recovery. Before we dive into this conversation, one last thing I want to mention is that the doses used to demonstrate the impressive anti-attrophy effects we discussed today were relatively high. As this is an emerging field, the optimal dose is still under investigation. Just to give you a little context in Dr. McGlorie's 2019 study, participants receive a total of five grams of omega-3 per day. This dosage is approximately one gram per day higher than prescription omega-3 used to treat high triglycerides, and roughly three grams per day higher than the amount of omega-3 most people in the United States would need on a daily basis to achieve a higher omega-3 index, which is around two grams per day. It is thought that between 80 and 90 percent of people, especially in the United States, would benefit from higher omega-3 intake. All right, I'm sure you've had enough preamble, so let's get to this interview with Dr. Chris McGlorie. Hi, everyone. I'm sitting here with Dr. Chris McGlorie, who is an assistant professor at Queen's University. He researches the influence of omega-3 fatty acids on muscle mass, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial function. Chris, thank you so much for coming on this show. I have really been looking forward to having this conversation with you. With sort of fires me up about the opportunity to chat with you is the fact that your work brings together two fields in a sort of surprising but exciting, converging way. So I've had the great privilege of having on the show some great minds and muscle biology and exercise physiology, such as Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, Dr. Stuart Phillips, whom you trained with. I've also talked quite a bit about omega-3 fatty acids on the show, and your work brings together, basically, these two fields by showing omega-3 fatty acids, they have a role in both preserving and supporting muscle. So I'm really happy to dig into that with you today, and I don't know maybe we can kick things off. You can kind of talk a little bit about how you ended up here and perhaps some of the work that led up to your current investigation, looking at omega-3, and it's prevention of disused activity. Yes, sure. And thanks for having me on. I've been pretty excited to talk to you about this. It's an area that's obviously very close to my heart, and I enjoy talking about it. So really I kind of started off with my research kind of career, so to speak in Liverpool, John Moじ University, where I worked under the supervision of James Morton and Graham Close, where we really looked at kind of a plight sports science and looking at nutritional inventions in that context. But my really interesting was in muscle protein metabolism, and James was suggesting to me, you know, if you really wanted to dig into this area, you kind of need to learn how to use stable isotope traces. And at that time Kevin Tipton, who many of the listeners may know who's an expert in protein metabolism, he just got a job in sterling in Scotland, and how to a PhD advertised to where he was going to train somebody to use stable isotopes in the context of human skeletal muscle. So I applied and I was very lucky I got that position to work with Kevin and somebody called Stuart Galaway. And essentially what my wanted to do is to look at how protein ingestion can affect skeletal muscle. And you know, some of the classic work that you know, Stuart had done with done more where they looked at those responses. And I wanted to kind of expand and learn a little bit more about that. But when I got to sterling, I had a meeting with Kevin and Stuart, and what they said to me was, you know, we've got the Institute of Aquaculture here, and this is kind of like a European centre for the analysis of lipids in fish basically. In aquaculture, and you were interested in looking at how different lipids in a meager three, the fact skeletal muscle in you can use stable isotopes and that context. And I actually thought, you know, I've read the proposal that they wrote. And I thought, you know, this is really interesting. You know, it's a new angle and you way of looking at skeletal muscle at different, you know, nutritional intervention. So with a specific focus on a meager three, so we did a couple of studies. The first one, you know, was a time course change in muscle lipid profiles. And then a study using traces to measure muscle print synthesis with a meager three intake and exercise. And I really enjoyed my time, though. We learned a lot. I think we did some good work. But then, during the time that I was in in sterling, we collaborate with Stuart Phillips to do the the isotope analysis on his mass specs. And I came to Canada. And whilst I was here, I was really impressed with the lab and and master as a whole. And Dr Phillips, the time was moving towards a clinical setting with muscle loss, muscle discusen aging. And I thought to myself, you know, I'd be really interested to see how a meager three, you know, are influencing the response in a clinical setting, not necessarily in just healthy younger people. So I was looking enough to be afforded the opportunity to be mental by Stuart. And he invited me over and was like, yeah, let's, you know, I'm willing to support you in your Omega three work. And, you know, we can look at some studies and designing some studies with specific focus on, you know, Omega three's and muscle loss. And at the coincidentally at the same time, Graham Holloway, who is a Gwell-Fuiser and expert in mitochondrial biology, had done some work in Omega three's as well. And at the time, and this was around 2014, it was a growing literature that might be a congerer, which I at the time, you not much about at all, was regulating some of the processes and muscles. So I thought, you know, well, why don't we team up with Graham as well? So essentially that kind of led to the study where we did the Omega three feeding with immobilization in young women and teamed up with Graham and his student Paul and meata where they took the mitochondrial angle and we published those two papers. So that's a very long-winded answer to your short question, but hopefully that gives you some insight into how I ended up hearing. And then when I finished my postdoc at JobCable for Queens and I applied for it and luckily got it and now we've set up the lab to really take the work forward and to expand our on what we've already done with Omega three's and human scale at Omosil. No, that's really interesting story. And I wonder if you hadn't had that aquaculture sort of that little exposure there where, you know, that was part of the story, like would you have come across Omega three, like, was it even being studied in the literature? I remember way back when I gosh, I mean it was maybe I was a postdoc, maybe I was finished in graduate school, I don't remember, but it was a study I'd read and I think it was like horses and muscle mass or something and old study. Yeah. Yeah, is that bringing about like so basically wondering would you like would you have come across Omega three, like studying Omega three in a troll and muscle? Do you think that's something you would have just come across just by reading, you know, the literature? I may have come across it, but I didn't think it would have picked my interest like it did because Kevin and Stuart were very, Stuart gallery at the time as it started, they're very passionate about the topic and, you know, it was a natural link with aquaculture and I think the study may not be horse, it may be horses, but the one I can think of is in growing stairs and it was out of level where they fed growing stairs, the Omega three's, the infused them and and shown how it affected a whole body protein balance and that was the first study and then the second one was by Petita Mitten, Dolphins group and in humans and they were the two key studies that were in the proposal like Kevin and Stuart had put together and got funding for with aquaculture. So whether I'd have gone in that direction, I don't think so. I think it's thanks to those guys and Sterling that I really started to jump on this bandwagon and just become fascinated. I think the other element was when I was training at John Mors and doing sports science, it was hammered home to learn metabolism as an integrated approach not just, protein by itself for carbohydrates, how lipids carbohydrates and proteins interact in performance against that backdrop. I really was very interested in understanding how lipids specifically Omega three fight acids interact in older protein metabolism in human muscle. Well, I'm certainly glad you ended up where you are today. I grew with you 100% it is extremely fascinating and as I think we both agree, also quite important for a public health standpoint. So leading up to the muscle disuse atrophy, can you talk about what that is, what are some of the mechanisms underlying it, and what circumstances can it be actually life threatening? Sure. So I think most people who've had a cast or a brace on my arm, you apply it and then after six weeks you get it cut off and you know, if you're like me, after after you've got a skinny hairy arm and you've got a quite an obvious loss of muscle air and also muscle strength and it's a point of, maybe not as a point of attention anymore, but you know, one of the reasons that we think that occurs is because there's a reduction in the rate at which we create new muscle proteins in the form of muscle protein synthesis. So when you reduce muscle protein synthesis in both the faster-dandin response to amino acids, it leads to a negative balance of skeletal muscle over time that kind of reduces the size of muscle that you have. So you know, for younger folks, it's probably, you know, it's not nice to have a cast or to have an injury, but we can recover from, I say, we, but generally the younger folks can recover from that relatively quickly with some rehabilitation of exercise and adequate nutrition. I think it becomes a little bit more of a problem as you get older, particularly for all the adult, particularly for all the adult who are going into surgery or who have had surgery, because you know, that rapid loss of muscle may not always come back to baseline in the older folks. And I think, you know, I've heard this before, I want to be all podcast, I believe with the jurors that, you know, when it's called the Catabolic Crisis Model that was coined by the late Doug Pagan Jones and Kirk English, but essentially if the more insults that older people have with those periods of inactivity and immobilization, they lose the muscle, it may not come back and then they lose a little bit more and all of a sudden you reach a threshold beyond which, you know, can't perform activities of daily living, you know, you just don't have that muscle or that muscle, muscle, muscle strength to be able to perform things like going for a walk or going to the shops or being able to, you know, go to the bathroom independently and essentially you lose those activities of independent living, which is not really good for older people. And we also know that, muscle strength in and of itself and to some degree, muscle size is a predictor of our course mortality and disability. So losing muscle in those situations is not necessarily a good thing to talk. So you mentioned something really important and, you know, in the case of, you know, for me, it was quite educational that the loss of muscle protein or the decrease in muscle protein synthesis seems to be the major driver of this, you know, disuse muscle disuse atrophy. Why is, or is, let's say you could take in an optimal amount of essential amino acids that are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, is that enough to prevent muscle disuse atrophy and if not like why? No, it's not, I think the main message share is that you really can't out-nutrition physically, in activity or mobilization. It can mitigate the decline so it could take the edge off. So increasing the overall dose and quality of protein nutrition, particularly the essential amino acids may protect against the decline to some degree, but it's never going to completely, you know, debate the decline. It's only going to be partially protective and one of those, we still don't really know the reasons as to what we know that there's a decline in protein synthesis, but we don't know at the molecular level exactly why it is that the body can't mount that adequate for instantetic response to feeding and it's also down in the faster state as well. So simply consuming higher amounts of essential amino acids may be partially protective and is a particularly loosing and the branch chain amino acid loosing and essentially it may be partially protective against the decline to muscle muscle, but it's not entirely effective and it certainly isn't entirely effective protecting against the decline and strength, which is oftentimes what we really care about. So it's, you know, but the issue there is, you know, you can, if you can certainly perform some kinds of contraction or activity, if you're sick or you're well to some degree, but if you're going through surgery and you're lying in a hospital bed and you're really sick or you're in ICU, for example, you know, you're not going to be performing contraction there, the nutrition is the only real way that we can target, um, protect and not decline and muscle muscle again. It sounds the question, it's only partially protective, it doesn't completely block a block the declines and muscle. But you kind of brought up another interesting point and that is, so you're talking about this muscle disuse in response to basically maybe a surgery, perhaps illness, bad rest, I mean, this is like a prolonged type of immobilization, right? What's the difference with respect to disuse after-feet when you're having a prolonged type of immobilization like you described, maybe you have a cast or a bed rest or surgery, illness perhaps, but or just like reduced physical activity. I mean, there people go through these periods where life, you know, work, load, you know, children, like things happen where your exercise routine, your physical activity goes down. And I mean, the pandemic would be obviously the biggest example of that, obviously we're in the pandemic anymore, but it's a good example of reduced physical activity. How does what's the difference between like the disuse, atrophy, how it's affected basically between those types of immobilization periods? Yeah, that's a great question. So we've recently just published a metronauticic, Nick Purie-Presentsky, led that and we looked at the decline in muscle, mass and size and healthy people and, um, I'm what Nick did is he looked at, you know, differentiate between not to seven days, seven to 14 and 14 onwards and this isn't generally healthy people. And what we found that there was a rapid decline after seven days, a great decline or further decline from seven to 14, then it tapered out. Now, this is in in healthy people. And then in in in people who are compromised or, you know, are actually going through surgery, these declines can even be greater. But what we do know is that the clients would complete in activity, um, almost of the shoes. They curve very, very rapidly within the first seven days. You can see upwards of, you know, sometimes up towards a seven to maybe even 10% loss and size and mass. But something that is not as often studied is like you just said those periods of in activity in which you're not completely immobile. But you are reducing your say daily step count and as you said the pandemic is a great example of that. And we've done a couple of studies that did the studies that is a postdoc with with Tana Stokes, um, when we were in Stu Phillips's lab where we subjected all the people to reduce daily step count. I believe it was below a thousand steps per day and that kind of mimicked what people would experience during say the pandemic, um, when they were being quarantined for two weeks or, you know, influenza or the step count typically experienced in hospital. And what we found was that there was a downregulation of protein synthesis. And this was in all the pre-diabetic populations. And it wasn't fully recovered after two weeks to return to activities. So, you know, we had a baseline period for around five days and then it was a two week reduction to below a thousand steps per day. And then, you know, back to normal recovery levels of step count and the pre-insynthetic response hadn't managed to recover to its baseline. And we also noticed that indices of insulin sensitivity and internal resistance have been compromised and weren't coming back. And this paper was published in 2017. So it's kind of prescient that we then have you know, the pandemic come in in which rightly so is, you know, we're being told you could quarantine for two weeks to mitigate the spread. But I think one thing that's been missed there is that the may well have been some negative effects that they might not be as great in magnitude as better as to complete immobilization. But there's certainly penitutes in nature and that they are imposing a negative, certainly metabolic effect on a downregulation of protein synthesis. Now certainly they would recover if you extend the measurement out to six weeks. But if you go back to what I said at the start about that catabolic crisis model, maybe the decline in it is not as great. But it's still another insult. It's still another contribution to that kind of staircase downward staircase pattern. And then if you think, you know, I moved to Canada nine years ago and the winters here, a certainly not as warm as not as mild as they are at home. And, you know, when you're in minus 20 and all the people are a little bit scared to go outside, they don't go walking outside like they normally do this stay inside in their home so, you know, their step count is reduced and so anyway, to call a kind of long story short there is they're negative, they're not as bad necessarily as complete to choose. But they may actually occur with more frequency, time complete immobilization, which I think is an important point as well. Yeah and you brought up a really good point there with the season all effect because I think it's probably people are probably at least experiencing some to some degree of this to use after-free without even really realizing it because, you know, if you think of muscle to use after-free, you think of it as being like severely immobilized, at least, you know, typically I think that's one of the most people are thinking about where they're just in a cast or they're injured, you know, bad rest. But they're not thinking of, oh winter time when I'm not going out and doing my outside, you know, activities as much. And that is actually a really good point because I think it's common even in places that do have more mild winters. People get, you know, they basically just don't go outside even when it's, you know, not quite as cold but just a little bit colder, you know, I know myself included. Fortunately, I have got indoor cycles and stuff that I like, you know, think are just, I think their life-changing and life-saving, honestly. But you talked about this catabolic crisis and it kind of leads into the disability threshold. What is that and how many periods of this inactivity or mobilization does it typically take for a person to get there? Yeah, I think it's difficult to provide a, like, a quantitative number on this of like, you know, new to meet a strength or, you know, size of muscle or volume of muscle. I think it's a kind of a theoretical constructive. We all know there's probably a threshold of muscle mass and strength that I would require to get out of this chip or to, you know, walk from here to the end of the road, unassisted. And, you know, when I require a assistant or somebody would require a assistant, I would say that that is that threshold where you require help to get around. Now, you know, you could start off with a fair bit of muscle, but over time, you know, with those repeated insults, that is when, you know, an an an an an an an adequate recovery. The more that they occur within a in the space of time, the quicker the trajectory is going to be to bridge that time at which you are not able to perform activity if they deliver. And, like I said in the younger folks, it's not too much of an issue, but, you know, you could imagine as you get older, we have soccer pinia, which is, you know, the loss of muscle mass and strength, more function. And when you super impose physical inactivity onto the biological decline and muscle mass and strength of the soccer pinia, you can see how it can really accelerate, you know, the negative effects of muscle loss and strength as we age. So, I think putting a number on it will be very difficult. I think the message will be very much, you know, try to stay as physically active as possible throughout life. And, you know, we really can't avoid. Sometimes you go out your place, but you get injured. If somebody goes out and they walk, they slip, they fall, they may need a knee replacement. I think it's just about, you know, preparing as best as you can for that insult, you know, like a surgery as essentially an insult to your body, you know, so, you know, it's, it's a challenge and to prepare yourself for that, not just recovery, but also going into that situation to make sure you're in the best possible shape that you can be into the help you recover when you come out. Well, there's obviously a need for investigating, you know, additional nutritional interventions to perhaps, you know, help mitigate some of this disuse atrophy, which leads to the omega 3, the role of omega 3 in this. And, you've investigated the effects of high dose omega 3 fatty acids supplementation on muscle disuse atrophy and young women. This is a, I mean, at this study was extremely interesting to me, but I'd love if you could share a little bit about the study that you did, maybe the protocol used and describe some of the key findings of that study. Sure, yeah. So, it kind of maybe just a little bit of brief background, as, you know, as we, we knew at the time, that, you know, the decline of muscle mass with inactivity was due to the desensitization of muscle to the provision of amino acids, so that, you know, the normal proteins and synthetic responses declined in their fall leading to a loss of muscle mass. A paper being published by Bettina Mittendoff is group shown that if you feed omega 3 fatty acids to all the people then infuse amino acids, it can enhance the sensitivity of muscle tissue to the provision of those amino acids. So, somehow, you know, omega 3s were being incorporated into muscle and rendering muscle more atobocally sensitive to the provision of amino acids. So, we thought, well, you know what, if that's what's happening in that situation, maybe in a period of disuse, in which desensitization of the muscle, we could restore that feed at a normal protein diet and see if we can mitigate the decline. So, using a protocol that we'd worked on in Scotland where we, we knew it took around four weeks of high dose omega 3s to see a substantial increase in omega 3 profile of the muscle. We loaded young women up in either control or they omega 3s for four weeks, and then we subjected them to single leg immobilization. So, basically, one leg was put in a brace. And then after two weeks, we allowed them just to, you know, go and recover, do it normally did. So, it was, it was no active rehabilitation. It was just passive recovery. And throughout the protocol, we took measurements of muscle size by MRI, you know, before, after immobilization and in two weeks after recovery, we took biopsies to measure changes in protein synthesis, the expression of genes, and also some of that muscle went to Graham Holloway's lab with Paula where they did some mitochondrial analysis to see whether there's any kind of link. And what we really found was it was very surprising to us. You know, it was seemed that the omega 3s were completely protective, at least from a mass point of view, and they took the edge off the decline in muscle size as measured by MRI. So, those omega 3s have been incorporated into the muscle of the participants. There was no change in omega 3 content and the control group I should expect, because there was real omega 3 fiasis in that supplement. And, you know, there was that protection. And then the important thing, I think, when we look at it, is that actually it helped the people in omega 3 group recover their muscle earlier than the people in the control group. So, if you kind of think about that catabolic crisis model where we've got that decline and then failed recovery, and this is not all the people, maybe we could actually increase that trajectory back to recovery. And this is kind of where I think the omega 3s may be very important. And from a mechanistic point of view, we used duty to assess rates of muscle protein synthesis, and consistent with the previous work by Petitimate and Dolphaz group in Gordon Smith. We found that in the omega 3 group, there was higher rates of protein synthesis, which would kind of again corroborate the mechanisms of action of omega 3s, which is to enhance the praise and that it corresponds to daily protein feeding. This is such important, like research in my opinion, I think, so my question, I have multiple questions, but one is if omega 3 is sort of lessening the decrease in muscle protein synthesis during disuse. In other words, like I guess sensitizing in a way, the muscle tissue to the amino acids for muscle protein synthesis. Do you think that could be extended to conditions perhaps that are not just full out in mobilization, but just where people are taking in lower amounts of protein? So do you think that perhaps you could get more bang for your buck with your protein intake by potentially also taking in higher dose omega 3 fatty acids? Yeah, and again, that's a great point. It's something that was so we, I think, mean you've talked about this, you know, our ferris, that we did a paper in younger people in Scotland where we hid fed them with omega 3 fatty acids and then gave them a dose of protein. And we didn't really see too much of a fact. There was a bit of a trend, but it was statistically non-significant. It was a proof of concept study more than the Nathaniel, so we may have been on the powered with the design. But looking back, we actually gave the participants a saturating dose of protein. We gave them 30 grams of protein, which we know maximally saturates the response. And so that we thought about was maybe if we'd given less protein and given, you know, and allow the or provided an opportunity or, you know, we didn't hit the ceiling with the person that a response would support it. And just when we dropped it down and gave an opportunity if you didn't make it three fatty acids to work, maybe we would have seen an effect. Now, the question then becomes, so why don't you just take protein, which is a legitimate and question we don't need to take omega 3s, but if you are somebody who's elderly and you don't want to consume or you can't consume large amounts of protein or if in fact you're in hospital and we know in hospital they are typically protein protein malnourished. It's not, you know, you don't go to hospital for a dinner, you know, it's a place where, you know, the quality of the food is not necessarily as good as it could be. Maybe in that particular situation is where we could see the effectiveness of the omega 3s is just to potentially the normal response to low dose protein and take, but to my knowledge there's no studies that have actually addressed that particular question. I mean, hopefully, you know, what that'll change in the future, you know, like if you were to give the, you know, essential amino acids or protein, you know, in the form of protein, you know, with the omega 3s at what, like would there be even a more robust effect, perhaps that not the saturating effect, like the 30 grams, but maybe, you know, 20 or 15 grams, like would you, it'd be interesting to see how the muscle protein synthesis response in skeletal muscle is affected by that. So, you also mentioned that your study examined, you know, the expression of genes associated with the skeletal muscle protein turnover in amino acid transport. I think it's a very interesting area when we, when we dive into mechanism, I'd love to dive a little bit further, but what were your observations in that study? Yes, so, you know, the first thing I want to say as well is that, you know, the study we did with the, in the facem jay paper, you know, it's the, I think the first one in humans with complete immobilization. So, you know, the jewelry still are we'd like to see a corroborated in different laboratories with different populations, but in and of itself it's still exciting. I think that where there comes to the, the amino acid transport mechanism, you know, we see these effects of the protein synthesis, no, the sodium agon, wow, how is this happening? Like, what's going on? And I did notice a paper in actual pigs where they'd seen a meager three firecited altered the gene expression of an amino acid transport called a LAT1. And we thought maybe actually this could be one of the mechanisms that we saw in explaining the enhanced protein synthesis and protection of muscle loss in our paper. It was a secondary analysis, so it wasn't a primary outcome, but we probed for changes in in LAT1 gene expression. So that's a amino acid transport for branch chain amino acid loosening. And we, we didn't, we found a trend for an treatment effect, which essentially was that there was a trend for an increased neemaker three, but again, there's some caveat there, one, we're on the powered secondly, it's the gene, not the protein. And also, you know, you can have an increase in protein content, but is the protein functional? You know, is it, is it working more efficiently? So we don't know the answer to those questions. I'm not too sure, the amino acid transport is the mechanism. I'm, I'd be, I'd first, I did, but I've become less convinced of that as times gone on, but it's something that we, we did see a trend of a treatment effect. Yeah. And I think, there's, there's a little bit of a tangent I'm going to go on, but because the part of the, like, I know we've talked about this, you know, the accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in the cell membranes, the lipid membranes. Yeah. It does change transporter receptors that are embedded in those cell membranes. It changes their structure and function. So I'm a lot more familiar with the research in rodents looking at transports more in the brain, you know, and if you, for example, like cause DHA deficiency in rodents, you will significantly alter at the protein level. The trans, like the gluten one transporters that are responsible for transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier. And so it's interesting, you looked at the gene and not protein because I would think that protein level would be more important if you're thinking of a sort of cell membrane fluidity where, you know, the effects have to do with, you know, the transporters function and human structure and levels in the actual cell membrane. So it's kind of interesting. Yeah. I'd be honest, at the time, I think we did, I cast about my mind. We did do some, we did measure the protein. But the antibody for human scale at most all at the time is terrible. So, you know, I think most actually a self-indamored work on this, when I first came to Canada, using like positive and negative controls to try to, you know, look at the Latin one protein expression in human scale of insulin. And it's certainly improved recently. They've certainly improved the antibody and all that. But at the time it was a bit of a nightmare to tease out. So the antibody for human muscle was very, very difficult to get working. So I think it's certainly improved now. The ones that are out there, but we looked at the blood when we were working with the protein and it was just something that is, you couldn't really hang your hat on at that stage, but maybe in the future, you know, with some more work we could probe that on in muscle visual. Yeah, that would be interesting. I mean, obviously, only as, so it is good as a sensitivity of the technique and techniques and tools you're using. Do you think that so has anyone else looked at whether or not omega 3's have an effect on disuse atrophy in males or in older adults where disuse, disuse, atrophy can be more catastrophic, as you mentioned? Not to my knowledge in terms of disuse atrophy. There was one study with intermittent arm mobilization and mixed co-hop, but with intermittent arm mobilization, I don't know really what you control from a conclusion. In terms of older people with a mobilization omega 3's not to my knowledge, I only, the only other study that I'm aware of with this is in rodents where they've fed with a high-fifacial diet and they protected against disuse atrophy in that context and that was one of the reasons that we decided to pursue in humans. But certainly in men know and one of the reasons we chose women is firstly there's not a lot of research out there in general and women's secondly, they're more susceptible to ACL injuries. So it's a risk population and thirdly there was some evidence that the omega 3's were more effective in women done in men. Instead of jumping straight into a study in older women where, it is a bit risky, we've said they don't recover, we thought we'd start in younger women. So the next logical extension is again to follow this up in potentially older women and older men who are actually going through surgery, not just the partner brace on them. I have another question to kind of related to one of my previous questions about the sensitization how omega 3 may be sensitizing skeletal muscle to essential amino acids, through whatever, whatever combined mechanisms. Do you think that with respect to older adults and the anabolic resistance that they basically have, so they become less sensitive to the amino acids? Do you think that there may be a role for omega 3 in perhaps even anabolic resistance by enhancing the response to amino acids in skeletal muscle to an older adult? I think the jury's still out very much so in this regard, there are a couple of papers that have shown you know if you feed omega 3's that improves muscle mass. There's metvenal disease support in this but the exact mechanism I'm not exactly convinced of yet. In terms of you know the effective omega 3's I think if it depends upon omega 3 status as well of people. So if you've got people who are already got a higher omega 3 status say, you know, their EPA plus DHA composition of the blood is around 8% or more something like that. You know, is the effectiveness of feeding omega 3's really going to be detectable but compared to people who have less than 4% in the blood. I think in my mind it's you know with the designs and things we've talked about is it's contact specific. I would suggest that you would have more of a chance of detecting an effective omega 3's if they had a lower omega 3 status and they also had a generally lower protein diet. So the synergistic effect of increasing omega 3, phospholipid membrane content or muscle content or composition in combination with the increased protein intake would potentially be additive or or have a synergistic effect. More so compared to people who have already have a higher omega 3 status. It might be the you know, if you've already consuming around 1.6 grams per kg of protein is really increasing that to two going to have that much more of an effect when you're training probably not. So I think you know what if you're in the lower amount or you're deficient that's when you're likely to see the effect. I think and most people most people are not getting an F omega 3 like that's that's pretty pretty well known and also most people are you know that with the protein intake too. I mean I think I think especially older adults as you mentioned it just becomes more difficult to like chew and you know they're just not as hungry and there's lots of reasons why they're not consuming as much protein. What do you think? What do you think it's going to take to get more studies on omega 3's role and disuse atrophy in you know different you know and men women across the lifespan and but you know getting this into clinical practice. Like what do you think it's going to take? Like is there more research on it? The show answer was money like and you know these studies cost money and they end at a day like you know you could to do the high quality RCTs in these populations you know requires you know obviously good research team but also we need we need obviously support them with the fun and we've been very lucky and that we've you know been quite successful with a few grants recently but I think what we would need is a high quality of evidence where we're starting to produce the real strong well-designed RCTs that then you know will feed into good high quality meta-analysis and then when we start to see the you know the changes or the potential benefits that have derived from meta-analysis related to then maybe that will alter prescription or how we approach you know nutrition and those particular settings but in terms of you know doing the studies obviously it's just just one isn't it you know to be able to conduct them and making sure you've got the appropriate techniques and and research personnel. So to kind of shift gears a little bit more into looking at omega 3 in skeletal muscle skeletal muscle mass and strength also maybe function very interesting that as well you you talked a little bit earlier about looking at omega 3 you know changing the skeletal muscle lipid profile. How long does it take for those changes to occur and do you think that's important for designing a protocol for example like if it's taking a certain amount of time and you're looking for an effect that you need to at least you want the skeletal muscle lipid profile the change before looking at the effect. Yeah that's an excellent question so you know some I don't think the omega 3 is in part our efficacy via the acute ingestion. I think the the way in which they impart their effects is through you know modification of the composition or the lipid composition of the target tissue and in in in skeletal muscle we know say after fart if you take around five grams of omega 3s three grams of EPA two grams of DHA say is a combination you'll probably see a small change after about two weeks in the muscle you see a rapper change in the blood but it takes around four weeks before you start to see that kind of big difference and you know with that dose it typically will level off we've seen it in the facet paper we did with tissue surgery it wasn't you know the primary aim of the paper will between six and eight weeks it seemed to level off and this is in the muscle phospholiproprophal and we did a time close study in in Scotland and Sterling where you know that was whole muscle but it seemed to track the phospholipid fraction relatively well is essentially four weeks before you know you see that kind of significant change and then it platoes off between six and eight weeks so you know it does take time and I believe the mechanism of action is the there's the modulation of the lipid profile and at least you know certainly the phospholipid membrane but also potentially inside the cell itself so it's not something that happens in hours it takes time for it to to be incorporated into the phospholipid membrane of muscle so that seems really important if you are looking at the potentially anabolic effects of omega three on scouts of muscle protein synthesis because if it's taking four weeks and you think the mechanism is more based on the phospholipid you know content in the membranes cell membrane that condol membranes both that that seems like you know people that are doing trials so I noticed in I think it was in your facet paper the tried didn't you do like a pre-loading the retaking omega three before the immobilization yeah four weeks four week lead until we used we did a time custody in younger men when I was installing where we just basically fed young men omega three's and dipiopsies a you know zero well minus two zero so the actors there are internal control and then I believe it was one two in four weeks and we didn't see anything one week but we did it too but the the the GC that we used to measure the lipids is a very precise instrument so whilst you may see a statistical increase the change is probably clinically insignificant but then you know after four weeks is when we start to see a substantial change so you know we use that information to say you know what like let's not head your bets with a two week loading period let's make sure we see a substantial change in the muscle so well there were four week load and then they'll go through a two week period of immobilization I think this is really important because you know notoriously in clinical trials particularly nutrition how you design the trial is so important for the outcome right and it makes all the difference so do you think that people that are going to be repeating these studies are repeating these studies are doing similar studies do you think they're aware of the effects of you know how the the basically how long it takes for the omega three fatty acids being incorporating this all membranes and how that is important in terms of their designing their clinical trials because the last thing you want is all these different protocols and then you have different conflicting results and then everyone's confused right yeah and I think that that's it's a question to get a lot as like is there with those response could you give more in a short period and you know I mean it would be interesting if someone gave an acute you know we start the omega three supplement you know and you see it like and then you see an effect quite immediately you know that would suggest the mechanism of action is not what I'm proposing it is so you know I'll be relatively surprised if that was the case but I think if if we are going to suggest if we are a griable that it is the modulation of the lipid profile that is driving the effects well the modulation of that profile takes weeks at the doses that we typically use so I think from my perspective is if you really if people are going to try to look at the effect it's better off to maybe do that loading face and then titri buckets like why people you do you know you do the cell cultural the rodents where you knock it out knock it at the gene in you know and then you start you you've got this effect you've got the biggest potential chance to see the effect and then you bring it into a more realistic situation is it a case where we you know we do these studies where we do longer longer feeding where we we try to induce a big change in the omega three profile and then you know once we've established that that is the driver mechanism how low can we do you know can we can we drop the change in the in the muscle composition lower and if so could we do a short feeding period or at least loading period you know these are questions that still need to be asked but answered sorry I think a lot of you know because that when most people think of omega three there's there's the anti inflammatory component you know where the metabolites the resolve ends the marisons you know all the SPMs protectens these these are involved in resolving inflammation and that can be quite quick so I mean there's there's some clinical satision that you know these SPMs are you know they're they're in the bloodstream pretty immediately after taking them and they can last like 24 hours so you know people might be looking more at the anti inflammatory hate calling anti inflammatory because it doesn't work the same way as like the typical NSAIDs do right but more of the inflammatory role you know anti inflammatory role of omega three which obviously there's there's a role in you know muscle muscle mass with with respect to inflammatory conditions right so so that also is one one reason why I was thinking why people might just you know be be doing the you know short like they give that they start the immobilization and then they give the omega three at the same time because they're thinking more of the inflammatory effect right versus the the change in the composition of the actual you know skeletal muscle lipid profile so yeah very important to bring up um do you think that so I kind of want to get into the differences between you know gaining muscle mass and gaining muscle strength and why you know it's why is it so difficult for older people to gain muscle mass whereas they can really gain more strength from resistance training so for example like their resistance training right they can get big increases and muscle strength but not as big in mass. Why is that? Yeah I actually to be honest you don't really know the answer to that question um I think my guess would be that older people typically don't engage in exercise that are resistance exercise that often so when they initially begin was training they do see those initial quick quick gains in strength and but what we do know is that older folks tend to believe not just resistant to the anabolic influence of protein or amino acid and gestion or central amino acid and gestion they they seem to be anobocally resistant to um resistant exercise or an acute bowel resistance exercise across like a wide range of loading spectrum so there's one paper out there that has looked at the present that's a response across that and all the people and and seeing it somewhat diminished but you can you know people up to the age of 90 can certainly gain strength when engaging with resistance exercise and I think you know as you get to that age you probably care more about your strength and your functional abilities than you know having a lot of muscle so to speak so um I think why that happens I think it's maybe just because that they don't engage in exercises which resistance exercise so it's detectable earlier um and when you combine that with the fact that there's anabolic resistance uh potential anabolic resistance to training in anobocally itself that may explain why you you can detect these bigger effects of strength or gains and strength compared to mass in in those populations but again it's really not my I would say um not an expert in that area but it would just be a small of an educated guess is there any role for nutrition in gains and strength like amino acid that's an interesting question yes so I think from amino aspect of the I'd say the gains and strength that will be uh for the three amino acids in gestion may well be just fed through increases muscle muscle the small increases are muscle muscle mass that occur and you know I know that there's like a little bit of disconnect between you know changes in mass and strength per se but the gains and strength in that capacity in that role may be because of um the the change in mass but I think if you think about um omega three there's been a couple of papers out there where a strikeries paper that comes to mind from from Glasgow where they fed omega three's to all the people uh during resistance training and found only in women that it enhanced the the strength response um uh to to our period of resistance training in women and that was omega three's there's been all the papers as well one from a group in Brazil again looking at the effect of omega three's with resistance training in all the women showing that it potentially it potentially the strength gains exactly how that works or how that happens that we're not too sure think it may be related to incorporation of DHA into the Milan sheath or into the neural networks that can enhance that strength adaptation but I think that's one of the exciting things about omega three's is that we see this phenotype change but when you look under the hood we don't really know what's going on so I think for a man from an omega three perspective that is something that I think is uh is a very interesting where these studies mostly in older older women yep older men and women for um uh yeah so both both women older people and and there wasn't the strength wasn't uh you didn't see the strength increases in men older men uh not and not well wants to the best study in Brazil other was believed by a redaki in colleagues and that was in a JcN and that that was a female only cohort um so there's no real sex differences there but the study by I think it was the boy and her sugarigress the senior author and students and some excellent work in the series in Glasgow um they found that the effect was more pronounced in women compared to men but you know after talking to a straight it's a case of you know is it you know is it is it a real effect you know is it because the women may not have been um they may have been less trained in the male cohort so that when they engage there was a a bigger responsive that was the case that you'd expect to in both the controlling your omega three so you wouldn't see an effect of omega three so it would suggest that the of the omega three is a haven't an effect there um and I know Stuart has followed a little bit of that work up with um krill oil so it's not just like you know omega three's per se or fish or or Stuart's done some work Stuart Gray with krill oil that is replicated some findings from Bettina Mittendorf's group with increases in strength with omega three sublimitation or size sorry I think there's some exciting work there and it does seem to be that at least the omega three's themselves may be a four-dinger conferring some strength benefits whether it's alone in the absence of resistance training or with resistance training particularly in women. Are there so the sex differences with respect to gaining muscle mass and gaining muscle strength just generally speaking like what what are the sex differences? Well in general and then the next question is about omega three and like I mean I know there is a sex difference with respect to converting the plant omega three the you know plant when you get from plants a a a into EPA and DHA so estrogen really plays a big role in increasing the conversion of into EPA and DHA but I don't know if there's I don't I'm not aware of literature showing specifically if you start with a marine source if you know converting for example EPA into DHA like if there's a role for estrogen in that but yeah off the top my head I really don't know I do know that this bit the ptsip SNP is on particular genes in women that may actually enhance those the conversion of EPA to DHA there's a group into answer that I've done some excellent work there but I'm not off the top my head too familiar I know that you know women or females can convert them more efficiently than then men but how that would feed into you know an improvement in muscle muscle muscle function I'm not too sure and in terms of the gemmel trading adaptations between all a younger there's no difference really from my knowledge in terms of younger men and younger women with the gains despite some dog more out there is that the gains are pretty much quite similar where it comes to all the folks I think the to me it doesn't seem like there is either in that particular and again I'm not a particular expert and I don't believe there's too much of a difference between women and men I think a lot of it may well be driven by you know who typically trains or who typically is engaging in those types of exercises versus who is not so if you get somebody who's never really engaged in resistance exercise and then start in that regiment they may gain a little bit more than people who don't and I think that may explain some of the sex differences if they do exist in older folks but I think the differences are very minimal generally what about muscle performance so you know does omega 3 or do you know if omega 3 plays a role in like performance? um maybe a folder of all sorts yeah I think one of the one of the issues those types of measurements is that you know with the SPPB is they generally secondary outcomes and you know reliability them is you typically the largest number of people to detect and affect but there was a meta analysis recently published suggested that I think it was either gate speed or walking speed was improved in older people with a with omega 3 supplementation suggestion not suggesting that there may be an enhanced effect in terms of functional to great question because you know sitting on a diner moment or a leg press and improving your strength that may be great but is it going to help improve those activities of daily living and I think that's the key question for older people and the meta analysis data I think you know you shared with me and we talked about before it was seem to suggest that omega 3 is not population could you know enhance either gate speed or walking performance and I think that's kind of important for that population. Yeah so I think I think we're in agreement that we just you know we really need you know larger well design trials and studies to repeat and confirm what has been shown in a variety of you know other smaller studies although there are some meta analyses out there again it's like you said well the quality of data I mean we just there's always there's always a need for for more especially if you want to get this into clinical practice I'll share an act with you so a couple days ago I was in an elevator in a doctor's office and a guy came in the elevator his wife pushed him in in a wheelchair and he had just had surgery he just actually just had a knee replacement and I told I said oh well you should you know you should go home and make sure you have some omega 3 fatty acids in the inform of like fish oil because there's some evidence it may play a role in helping you maintain muscle mass you know it's called disuse atrophy and the older gentleman said ah those those don't do anything and I said well I you know I'm a PhD scientist and I'm actually you know you know you know been reading some literature and gonna talk to an expert and he goes well I'm an MD I'm a rheumatologist and I'm gonna tell you I really could have a conversation about it but and so you know I think the take home for me was you know how do we get this into clinical practice like it it seems like you know yeah that I guess they are they're smaller studies that we're talking about here and so one work needs to be done but um I I truly believe that omega 3 is our playing a role in especially in the disuse atrophy and as we're going to talk about in a mincercopenia and it's it's a shame that it's going to take such a long time to get that into the clinical practice you know yeah and I think you know uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh the jury still to some degree is very much out you know we need more work and uh uh uh uh to really to study how it may be working and also in the larger populations whether it's working but I think the first thing is do you know harm and you know if you know if it might as long as there's so much of a good quality supplemental especially if you get it from food sources you know oil efficient there's good quality proteins in there if you're going to increase your omega 3 content if you diet you know I don't really see too much harm and if you use an quality supplemental you're taking it particularly from a food first approach with oil efficient I think that would be a good idea of around you know especially if you get common or you're a coffin from surgery so sarcopenia as we age really is muscle mass we're the strength uh this is called sarcopenia and there's all sorts of problems it's associated with the 2 to 3 full increased risk of falls frailty disability I mean on and on as you mentioned mortality yeah um obviously protein intake resistance training most important here as you've we've already mentioned but there seems to be emerging evidence that omega 3 fatty acids again EPA and DHA being the major players here um are playing a important role so in the context of sarcopenia you know there's like there's a disequal ibrem it's mind to understand there's a disequal ibrem muscle catapulism and muscle anobalism so um is there evidence that it can shift it towards anobalism in the context of sarcopenia yeah so that it's certainly evidence it's definitely by no means a short case so essentially the the reality is that the older folks as they you know as we age there there is that uh unabolic resistance to protein and gestion that will contribute towards the the negative protein balance that mainly to that decline that's independent from physically in activity which would accelerate that natural biological decline so the first thing is I would always say that exercise particularly resistance exercise like I said at the very start you can't outnutrition physical in activity you've you've really got to make sure that you've you've performed an exercise and sticking to the guidelines and especially resistance exercises as we know a very potent means to enhance or all mean teens go a little muscle muscle muscle strength but in terms of omega 3's to supplement that approach um I think there is a margin evidence and I think the you know the series of papers biperton and bitina mittendorf's group I think with a landmark papers in in this field where you know they were the ones that did the showing there's an hands protein synthetic response to amino acid infusion with omega 3's and they replicate it that in in younger people and older people and that's like the landmark study that really got me interested when I was in Scotland studying this and and that was published in AJC and with Gordon Smith as the lead author and then you know you're looking at those that you know if you look at the difference that the omega 3's had on the protein synthetic response you're thinking there's no way like that is that is huge and then they followed it up with another study in younger people the can't let a lot of credence to it and then they followed it with a longer trudinal feeding I think it was six months of two grams per day of EPA and the changes there were quite significant I believe it was in I believe it was mass a multi-show strength and at that point you're like wow okay we now I need to see that's one love it's a really strong love very well respected high quality work but you know just to you know confirm you'd like to see all the people doing the group well Stuart Gray then published the paper with krilloyle similar participant co-hole similar duration and replicated what had been shown by bipetit and bitendorf's groups then you think okay there's something really going on here and then you know we've seen the protection against issues after feeding in your women so there's now this growing body of evidence that suggests that omega 3's are on a ballach and they seem to be on a ballach particularly in all the adults not just from a protein synthetic point of view but also from the perspective of kind of mitigating the declines in muscle, muscle and size and I would encourage anyone really interested in the soccer peony element of this is to look up Gordon Smith's paper in a jcn and also Stuart Gray's work with krilloyle because the results are from two independent labs across the Atlantic different supplements put the living still delivering EPA and the results are very very interesting and quite encouraging. Do you think that because sarcopenia has also has more of an inflammatory component to it at least my understanding is there's a little more of an inflammatory component to it to sarcopenia perhaps also because inflammation goes up as you age and people people have more inflammation. Do you think there's like a sort of dual role like in addition to this anabolic effect you've been talking about with sensitizing skeletal muscle to amino acids perhaps an entire inflammatory role as well? Yeah that is a great question and an important talk and point in the field as well because the studies that I just talked about from the Tinnomit and Dolphaz group with Gordon Smith is the lead author they saw these changes in absence of any real change in insurculating inflammatory markers so you know people were thinking well actually this is normally when you think of a meager three-fiat acid you think of heart health and then anti-inflammatory effects. So that's a natural mechanism especially because low-grade inflammation or inflammation is an inflammation. There's the concept in older people is there's a bit of a difference between what's circulating in the blood and what's going on inside the muscle and you kind of low-grade inflammation can actually impinge your petitions on proteins that regulate protein synthesis so one for example is the AF2 alpha so when that's phosphorytory to the can impinge on the ability to mount a protein synthetic response so by resolving the inflammation particularly inside of the muscle potentially this is one way in which you may get three fiat acids in all the populations may be working. Very very interesting let's dive a little more into the mechanisms like I think you know we we already talked a little bit about you know this cell membrane incorporating E.D.A.J. and the cell membrane fluidity perhaps you know I brought up the the transport you know the transporters function structure and how that could be put potentially linked to loosing and perhaps I guess it's called the lat transporter you mentioned. Yeah that one yeah. Can you actually measure intracellular amino acid concentration from a muscle biopsy? So you can you can measure intracellular amino acid concentrations the difficulty there is there is some evidence that with muscle tissues there may be an increase or a change at least in intracellular amino acid concentrations if they're not being used to build muscle they may build up inside intracellular space now that's very limited evidence but there is some there at least a glove of when she was working with a student fellow doctor Phillips in they published the paper I think it's in J.F. and if you look at the branch chain concentrations in the intracellular space in one of the tables there would suggest there may be an increase so I think in in the context of you know amino acid transporter one of the reasons I kind of changed my mind a little bit on whether omega 3's were working via transport mechanisms is because Luke van Loone's group with Ben Wall as the lead author did a paper were they labelled with stable isotope they labelled the drink people were consuming before and after a mobilization and what they found was that the enrichment which is basically the ratio of the tracer compared to the tracer so it's a carbon tracer which is labelled the ratio actually was an alter too much in fact it was higher on the after a mobilization in intracellular space which would suggest that there's actually not an impairment in transport across the membrane and that the impairment in protein synthesis with tissues is actually intracellular so that doesn't mean that omega 3's would in may work by improving transport across and potentially enhancing the protein synthetic response put to me it would suggest that the mechanisms that are resulting in the decline in pre-synthesis with tissues are intracellular not a lack of an impingement on transport across the membrane so we I mentioned a little bit about the glucose transfer glute one transporters at the brain do you know anything about whether or not omega 3 has any sort of acute or long term effects of exercise on glucose transport into muscle and is glucose transport into muscle also anabolic is that I don't know no not to my knowledge I mean above base levels of insulin concentration it's pretty much a permissive for pre-synthesis but in terms of the literature is really mixed so if you look at the of the rodent literature it seems to have quite positive effects in insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation the work in humans is not as convincing so that's where it how the like I said the lack of high quality RCTs and in the field of the omega 3 is the primary outcome of glucose the sum but the literature is very mixed and I also sometimes think in a you know what it work and people who are compromised with a lower omega 3 state as first as people who are already healthy you know I don't know how of effective being those particular context you know if you've already got a relatively high omega 3 content in the membrane is giving more going to be efficacious and in the respective transport for glucose across the membrane I'm not too sure but my understanding is that literature and humans is very mixed when it comes to the management of the say type 2 type B T's or glucose handling with omega 3's and those populations. I see again then it also comes down to was there pre-loading did they you know was was it four weeks did they have four weeks of omega 3 before studying anything if these effects are you know being regulated at the at least through the changes in the cell membrane fluidity and then you would assume that you'd have to at least have four weeks of omega 3 loading in there down to protocol yet again but cells are not the only you know structure that have membrane so phospholipid membranes so mitochondrial membranes both EPA and DHA accumulate in mitochondrial membranes you alluded to mitochondria earlier is there a possibility that omega 3 modulates mitochondria in human skeletal muscle? Yeah there is and you know the mitochondria is something I've just started to really get into in terms of in my lab and settle by I learned you know some of the techniques from Graham Holloway when I was a coalfa's a postdoc and that's like an arm that I'm trying to develop in my lab now to address some of these questions and I do think that's probably the most exciting area for me right now with omega 3s and how it links to the regulation of protein synthesis so for example Graham had shown a number of years ago that feeding omega 3s in younger people can affect 80 piece sensitivity or 80 piece demulated respiration in the mitochondria in human skeletal muscle and then in our tissue subtrophy study again it seemed to affect a dp respiration but then you know that's nice in terms of a concept but so what how does that then feed into skeletal muscle? Well there's now a emerging area so we into pre-insensus now there is emerging evidence that there seems to be some kind of mitochondrial systolic crosstalk whereby you know if you think about the mitochondria of the primary site of you know where we produce anodry and muscle pre-insensus is a very energetically expensive process so if the mitochondria are not working properly then there may not be the anodry to you know mount a pre-insynthetic response and you know vice versa another caveat with the mitochondrial malice is it depends of a time you know what substrates you are using to stimulate respiration you know if you're using a carbohydrate or a fat base substrate but nevertheless is what we're trying to investigate now is whether you know there there is this crosstalk between the the the translation or the initiation and translation factors that regulate pre-insensus and you know mitochondrial protein synthesis and mitochondrial respiration and there's been some papers in worms and pre-chlorical models show it not you know mitochondrial translational the translation of mitochondrial proteins in and of itself will feed in as a signal to whether we to the systolic factors that regulate protein synthesis and an ATF or dependent fashion so again this is pre-chlorical it's very early but what we're studying here is is whether that occurs in humans we've got a so studies and surgery in the hospital going on now with the mecha threes and we're doing the biopsies and we've got the respiration measures and we're going to try and tease that out so I do think that might accondra a very very interesting area for research when it comes to a mecha threes and and protein turnover and it's something that we're really looking to to explore a little bit more but exactly what that link is I'm not too sure at this stage well that's very exciting I think I would be interested also just seeing what not necessarily in skeletal muscle but like you know looking at the broader broader scientific literature like what's known about how omega 3 dha EPA affect the mitochondrial function mitochondria structure their dynamics all those things would be you know obviously interesting to kind of be able to see well if that's going on other tissues perhaps something similar also in skeletal muscle and so that that's all that's really exciting I so there's there's a few studies like limited I'd say limited evidence showing that dha and EPA can increase the metabolic rate of both resting and during exercise in older women yeah and these effects are we're even more profound in like fat oxidation so it was like a 19% increase in in resting metabolic rate in 27% increase in during exercise for fat oxidation do you think this could be attributed to a mitochondrial related mechanism yeah potentially incorporation into the into the in and out of the control you know membranes of the mitochondrial potentially all the 80 dp handling and oxygen utilization and again this is not exactly my particular area of expertise but I've seen some work of like you know for Australia where they've shown like you know feeding omega 3s can I think it was particularly dha can reduce the oxygen cost of exercise and reduce heart rate again this is this is something you know where you kind of read one piece of literature it that is slightly related but not related and you try to use it to feed into to generate these hypotheses with know how it affects muscle mass regulation as well as the mitochondrial but from my understanding is that I really wouldn't know how that actually works in terms of you know changes in substrate oxidation with omega 3s one kind of natural for is when you're giving people high doses of omega 3s 5 grams per day which is a lot more than typically what we would consume maybe it switches the you know the substrates that are being oxidized or it may induce a very small shift towards the oxidation of fatty acids as opposed to carbohydrates and there is a little bit of evidence that you know that might not in the context of you know glucose homeostasis that might not necessarily be a great thing because if you're if you're shift in from you know oxidizing glucose too fast than in diabetic patients or people with high levels of if of circulate in glucose it may actually even bump those levels so kind of going back to what we talked about before in terms of substrate utilization with these reading protocols but I wonder if just the sheer effects on increasing gluten three transporters in skeletal muscle would you at least be getting the transporter muscle and out of circulation if that were just in the other cell for some beneficial yeah yeah and yeah and I'm not aware of any evidence that you know there is increase in gluten four transporters with a in skeletal muscle with omega 3s and maybe there is a and just not aware of it and sometimes I think with the transporters and makes me think about the the lot one work is you may have more protein content but is that protein content functional you know is is it actually more effective and more efficient you know I don't know you mentioned something about the the dose as well and I think it kind of to go back to the importance of protocols you know how long does it take omega 3s to accumulate in mitochondrial membrane so you mentioned four weeks you know for you know the the change in the the skeletal muscle like lipid membranes but like what if it's something similar for the mitochondrial membranes and you know the dose as well you also mentioned sort of food food first approach and you know eating fatty fish of course salmon and Matt and Sardine and Matt Coral being sort of the best sources of omega 3 but you're not going to get you know four to five grams a day and first of all people aren't going to eat fatty fish every day like they're just not like as they don't they don't even eat it weekly like it's that's that's like we have we have and hang study on the studies on that they're not they're not eating fish a lot of a lot of especially in America in the United States but you know so the question is is like the 45 or even perhaps they would have if it's even higher dose like what if we don't even like there's not there's a Ben No dose response studies right to even know no so do you like how feasible obviously it's good to get omega 3 from food sources like for many reasons but if we're looking at the accumulation like you know some of these effects in the mitochondrial membranes in this you know the cell membranes and skeletal muscle how feasible do you think it is to only get it from food? Um again it just the so I think this is it kind of leads me to a slightly separate kind of answer if you don't mind is you know the omega 3 index which has been established in blood and is related to the CVD risks um we haven't really got something similar in skeletal muscles so we don't know what is the level of omega 3s or EP and DHA and there's even our evidence that the two may have opposing effects but what what is the amount or relative contribution or composition in the muscle membrane that has then linked to a clinically meaningful cutoff or outcome and I think that's kind of something that you know will take a long time for us to establish and this is where it comes to getting it into the clinics is is case of like well how much do I need to take what is a clinical cutoff in terms of the muscle or the blood and how is that going to help the patient and I think the you know thinking back of well it would the answer is it would depend upon what is the level in the muscle that we need to get to to see these effects so then we can work back through a dose response so you might be able to take a large amount in a five day period and just top it off with like one gram a day so do you take five grams a day and then just top it off with one gram a day and it stays in that range minus two calories doing looking at some work like that at the moment or is it a case if you just take one a day or two a day and you just do that all year round and then you're going to see a level of change in the muscle phospholipid membrane I just don't know the answer to that question I want to think the next steps for us to really start convincing people of you know omega 3s are important is to link the mechanism firstly and then what is the change in the in the composition of the membrane and how does that relates to important clinical outcomes right with the mechanism you know when most people think about so we talked about mitochondria and mitochondrial membranes you can think about muscle mass you think about the antabolic signaling pathways like mTOR the p70s 6 kinase 1 does omega 3 affect those antabolic pathways in humans it's a complex question so you know I think this feel is evolving more more you know like when I was you know really into this with the molecular work which have kind of moved away from a little bit now is mTOR was the be all lendor and it's it's target s6k1 the 3-89 residue I think we now know there's a little bit more going on a lot more going on in terms of the regulation of muscle mass muscle pretty sensitive at least but in the studies in which there was the potential of protein synthesis both in vitamin and over working humans but also going back to you know the the stairs that we talked about the the cows at the very start of of the podcast is it seemed to be affecting at the mTOR p70 pathway now is that an independent effective EPA and DHA directly targeting those proteins or is it the fact that it's potentially to the amino acid response and it's the amino acids so that that are enhancing and so you know mTOR is very sensitive to changes in losing concentration is an indirect or is it a direct effect and again we don't we don't really know there is some work in cell cultures suggested that EPA may have a direct effect but exactly how that works I'm not too sure but my guess will be actually that it's just the general modification of the lipid or the lipid omo lipid profile of the muscle but then enhances the effectiveness of amino acid so the potentialation is driven largely by the amino acids which is influenced by the lipid profile of yeah that's a really I think that's a really good point and I make it makes a lot of sense as well I mean obviously more work to be done yeah kind of going going back just to the inflammatory because omega threes are so well known in that in that world how does high inflammation effect protein turnover in skeletal muscle? Well I think that the highest-to-even inflammation can trick out some of the some breakdown pathways but we know that from the perspective of muscle protein synthesis which is the predominant arm that we generally focus on in humans one reason is it is largely that the arm that dictate the size of muscle muscle muscle also measuring breakdown with in vivo is very difficult but essentially the inflammation or you know low-grade inflammation in the muscle can some more put the breaks on protein synthesis maybe the better way to put it and like I said some of the initiation factors one of the misii f2 alpha can be affected or at least phosphorylated by inflammatory state or the inflammatory state of the cell which would impinge upon protein synthetic pathways so you know there's a little it's not too clear the literature to me at this moment but it seems like if having a higher state of inflammation inside of the muscle cell can negatively impact some of the initiation factors so you know you've got you know protein initiation elongation to you know for pre-insensus and some of the initiation factors can certainly be affected by higher levels of inflammation inside of the muscle. That's interesting I didn't know that before this discussion with you we talked a little bit about sarcopenia which has an inflammatory component in cancer caxia being probably one of the big ones that that there's definitely really I think major role of inflammation in cancer caxia where muscle you know atrophy if you call it breakdown I don't know what you know is just pretty devastating predicts for survival do you see a role for omega 3 in cancer caxia is there any evidence there is I think it's slightly mixed but there certainly is evidence that EPA treatment may protect against cancer caxia or a loss of muscle with cancer and again I do know that the evidence is a little bit of mixed and it's obviously very difficult most populations to get those high quality RCTs but there is some evidence there that you know the omega 3s can kind of mitigate against the decline in muscle there's a very mass-arex in our butter in Canada has done some really excellent work about looking at how omega 3s can actually protect against the negative impact of chemotherapy so we know the chemotherapy and another self is toxic can have a negative effect on muscle and in pre-clinical models what in rodents what a very assuring is that actually feeding omega 3s and those animals may actually protect against the negative impacts of chemotherapy or muscle and we are currently collaborating with with a rare to see whether that might be occurring in a mitochondrial dependent fashion where there are any animals and you know she's not a butter so we're only really a we can't do the in vivo respiration measures of mitochondria but we all look in some of the the new new mitochondrial factors and mitochondrial translation factors that like I talked about before that may actually be feeding into the protective effect with omega 3s against chemotherapy induced. Autrophe. Very cool. Well we've covered a lot of ground with respect to the role of omega 3 in muscle skeletal muscle before before I kind of shift gears and ask you one one other question um can you you're doing you have an ongoing trial right now can you can you describe a little bit about what the trial is and what the sort of hypothesis is and the goal. We have a we have a number of ongoing omega 3 trials we have for sex differences and muscle with omega 3 feeding and that's led by my master student Sydney Smart and then we've got a large bed rest study in the hospital that's led by Emily Ferguson who's a PhD student with me and she's going to be looking at the effects of high dose omega 3s in combination with essential amino acids and gestion to kind of mitigate the loss of muscle mass and strength in people going through a period of bed rest and that's unhealthy people but it's going to generate us a lot of important tissue well we're going to do the most of the measurements of muscle size with MRI muscle strength and dynamometry and the you know the respiration measures with mitochondria but also using the trace of approaches and proteomic and lipidomic approaches to try to really get a mechanistic insight into how omega 3s affect an muscle in in in that setting but you know a common criticism of those types of studies it's it's not actually reflecting what's happening in a surgical setting so we've also teamed up with the hospital here in my PhD student Danny Niamon's leading a study where you know we've got people going through ACL surgeries so this is young and middle-aged people who are going through ACL and we're going to provide them with high dose omega 3s and see whether you know in that particular set and there's likely going to be hyper inflammation so our omega 3s more efficacious and that's situation in which they can you know take the edge off the inflammatory response and have those independent actions on protein synthesis as well so we have a number of trials going on but we're obviously really trying to dig into the serium and make heads of the next few headways or over the next few years but primarily we've got the sex difference study the the bed rest study and also a surgery study going on as well with ACL injuries or surgeries is there any reason to not do I mean I guess the immobilization studies it seems like they're mostly done in young people because you know of how devastating they can be in an older population but what if you find people that are older and getting a surgery like is it like you're doing with your middle-aged you know younger ACL type of study yeah and that's certainly something not so that's the next step that we're looking to do is to certainly is to do this with older people either you know with surgery or some ICU patients but like we talked about the start you know I need to write the grants for that so it cost a bit of money for a lot of the the analysis so we're looking to you know write some grants and try and follow up and some of that works that'll be the next phase after we've completed this work to you know try to tease and we try to take like a a mechanisms based clinical approach to studying omega 3-5 assets and muscle like we know that patients and we know that physicians care about clinical outcomes right so we're not going to go to them and say all the improves that might contribute to the exploration that like I don't care does it help my patient recovery and does it affect their ability to move so we've got those primary outcomes and then you know to kind of you know keep us you know really interested in the mechanisms and how it's working and keep the biochemists happy we really try to tease into what all the mechanisms in muscle and that's what the muscle biopsy is afforded in allowing us to do that well it's very important work and it would be very interesting to see if these effects are even more robust in an older population so you know lots lots to do I did want to kind of just shift gears and I had one sort of area of interest that sort of has been on my radar rate are recently and it's this idea because I've always been sort of more of an endurance you know training kind of person I'm certainly not an athlete but I've always you know been a runner and I like to do more endurance training types of activities although since last summer when I started to really get into the muscle biology and had you know stew on and I'm Brad Chownfeld yourself I you know I'm a lot I see how important resistance training is and I've really tried hard to incorporate a lot more of that into my routine however often I do do a robotic you know training in the same session as resistance training and so there was a reason said you contributed to your co-author on about the role of a robot conditioning in muscle hypertrophy and I think there's been I mean I've just heard from you know the echo chamber that there's this prevailing belief that a aerobic exercise might actually impede gains from resistance training so I was wondering if you could clarify how a aerobic exercise could actually even potentially promote muscle growth and maybe discuss some of the potential mechanisms behind this phenomenon that was identified by the study you were part of yeah sure and as at the disclaimer this is certainly not my area of expertise but my understanding at least is you know the classic work by Hicks and a while ago we're suggesting that there may be an interference effect between performing both particularly with strength gains and and since that work you know people were asking the question and it followed up with some of the molecular work in cells and animals suggesting A&P may inhibit mentor and you activate A&P case or A&PK with endurance exercise it stops and tall be an activate with resistance and I think whilst that may be the case in cells and rodents the human work really hasn't that's not but it's not washed out in the in the human work at all doesn't seem to be an interference effect at least when it comes to muscle hypertrophy and there's been some good work by some scan and eating groups there Tommy Lomburg being one of them and we are Matt Preston some molecular work as well and of fact as you've suggested it it may actually have an opposite effect where you precondition or you perform aerobic exercise and that may enhance capitalization so you know facilities in blood delivery to the muscle cell and then when you perform resist, resistance exercise the muscle is primed to receive more neutral you know interlain and and amino acids to enhance the response the principle response to the resistance exercise so essentially it's potentially promote and greater nutrient delivery to the muscle so that I can build and another factor is satellite cells so satellite cells will no donate their nuclear material you know the transcription factors and to enhance the ability to grow so there's some evidence that satellite cells and it's growing out strong evidence that satellite cells play a really important role in the remodeling of muscle and the contributions towards hypertrophy with resistance trading and in the enjoyment and endurance exercise may not only enhance nutrient delivery but also activate satellite cells where they can donate their nuclear material to support the growth response to resistance trading so essentially you know I think there there is some evidence it certainly doesn't seem to be even you know if you're not doing high levels really high levels of exercise it seems that the average every day person it's not going to do harm at all to do some aerobic exercise with resistance and if anything you know we know that it'll be able to max in an in and of itself and exercise capacity is very is a predictive of mortality and it's also important to maintain cardiovascular health and function so I never really think it's a bad idea to incorporate in endurance and resistance but I will say in echo what other people have said is the majority of the research out there in terms of health is on endurance and there's not as much on resistance but I do think that you know there's certainly a role for both and I would like a little bit more resistance out there than endurance maybe that's just my bias is but I do think a combination of both of them really are beneficial and they may even be synergistic as you've just suggested. Do you think doing the aerobic exercise are training after the resistance training could also be similar because you're also you're still increasing you know capillary and basal dilation and you know stuff yeah you think so okay so I mean obviously if you're like going out and running 10 miles you're not going to be able to like you're going to be too tired but I'm talking about a 10 or 15 minute to bought I which is typically like what I'll do when I'm doing the resistance training as well but these days I do do it my my tobadas will be in the morning and then I'll do resistance training later on in the evening actually so but it's still like in the same the same day yeah but I don't see much of a problem with that at all I mean it's it's it's it's very I mean people like yourself are very active it's it's maybe a consideration what I think the majority of people just need to get out there and and do do exercise and novice self and the the slight you know small chance that there may be an interference effect between it to which I don't think really does exist is certainly are weighed by the benefits of engaging in in the exercises in novice self you know so I think that's that's just kind of a bit of a red-haring thing with the interference effect I think it's more likely that it has a beneficial effect in anything else engaging in both resistance and endurance and endurance is going to confer it independent effects you know you do a lot of endurance exercise the central adaptations you know there's this cardiovascular adaptations and then the peripheral adaptation is also a current and they may feed into enhancing the the synthetic response or at least the hypertrophic response to resistance training and there was a meta analysis out there by I think Tommy Lomburg suggested that you know like certainly at least with cycling it doesn't seem to have that much of an effect you know it also kind of raises this the opens the door of like when you look at protocols for these trials that are being done looking at muscle hypertrophy fill in the blank whatever they're looking at in many cases the control equipment and what control group will be like passive recovery but the passive recovery is them on a you know stationary cycle doing some low wattage but you think they're going wait a minute maybe that's not so inert maybe that's actually promoting more hypertrophy in a way right I mean potentially maybe I think the other thing is a new set of before but precision and and sometimes when I see the word hypertrophy I like looking at the devils and the details when people say hypertrophy it's like did you use an MRI did you put a tape measure on the lake did you use dexer did you do immunohistochemistry to look at tape one type two fibers which very variable so I think a lot of the times you know like I said the devils and the details and the paper just be on the abstract is how did you measure hypertrophy and I think that's also a key question because you know I wouldn't just hang my heart on on cross sectional area of individual fibers alone I would like to see you know maybe some MRI data and complemented with some other actual measures of hypertrophy so yeah I think I think reading the papers in a little bit more detail can can reveal more that's good to know do you mind if I send you some paper sometimes ask you a question or two you're definitely much more points to look at that stuff than I am and there's there's like when you when you see the conflicting data like if I had more of a handle on that what you just mentioned like the types of procedures and stuff being used it would probably bring more clarity to why there's a you know conflicting data for example but really amazing work that you're doing Chris with respect to the omega 3 and it's roll in you know potentially being in a ballac as you said and how this may be you know very relevant obviously for muscle dysu satrophy and perhaps circumpine but maybe just in general like low amino acid intake or optimizing sensitizing as to our amino acid so all of it very exciting much more work to be done very thankful that you're out there doing it and hopefully others are as well and more more studies to come high quality studies if people want to learn more about your research if they want to read more ask you questions what's the where can they find you well we've got a lab website just in the building right now but I think the best ways to research gate where I put all the papers and I'm not on Twitter I've done my best to

Dr. Rhonda Patrick here, today we are going to talk about the brain and metabolic effects of cold exposure. We all want to reduce stress and make our life easier, but is that always the best approach? What if the best medicine might just be a little low-dose stress? This idea harnesses hormesis, a biological phenomenon where a low-dose, short-duration stressor, in this case, cold temperatures triggers a cascade of adaptations that protect us against future larger stressors. Basically preconditioning our bodies against stress. This isn't a new idea. Humans have used cold exposure often with the expectation that it promotes health for centuries. But habitual cold exposure can have far-reaching beneficial effects on our bodies, metabolic health, and possibly brain function. Many of which converge on a chemical released in response to the cold, Nora Epinephrine. Produced in the adrenal glands and central nervous system, it can act as both a hormone and neurotransmitter. Because of Nora Epinephrine's unique effects, cold exposure may influence aspects of physiology relevant for fighting metabolic related diseases and parameters of brain function associated with mood, neurodegeneration and depression. These studies in both mice and humans have shown that cold water immersion increases levels of PGC1 alpha in skeletal muscle. PGC1 alpha is approaching that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis. The production of new, healthy, young mitochondria. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis is an adaptation to exercise and is associated with greater aerobic capacity and the lower risk for developing many diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and type 2 diabetes. When acting as a hormone, Nora Epinephrine causes your blood vessels to constrict, which helps you retain heat. But retaining heat isn't the only way our bodies maintain their temperature. We can also produce heat, a process called thermogenesis. There are two types. Shivering thermogenesis, as the name would imply, involves shivering to produce heat. It relies on the energy produced by ATP hydrolysis during muscle contractions to generate heat. Useful but somewhat inefficient. But the body also has a more efficient way. Non-shivering thermogenesis is direct metabolic heat production and Nora Epinephrine plays an important role here too. It acts on key proteins such as UCP1 in fatty tissue. These proteins disconnect the normal electrical processes within our mitochondria that produce chemical energy and instead allow them to directly produce heat. But there's a catch, not all fat can do this equally. This type of thermogenesis is mostly a quality of a type of fat known as brown fat. So called for its darker coloring, which reflects the overall mitochondrial density of the tissue. Scientists once thought brown fat was only present in newborns to provide protection against body heat loss. But we've since found it in adults as well, particularly falling cold exposure. And that is because other types of fat can take on thermogenic characteristics of brown fat. A process that also involves mitochondrial biogenesis that is regulated by, you guessed it, the release of Nora Epinephrine in response to cold. How much can we increase brown fat activity? A study in which healthy young men wore a cooling soup at 50 degrees Fahrenheit, found that their brown fat volume increased 45 percent from baseline. Why does this matter? Because the oxidative metabolism in their brown fat increased more than twofold, suggesting that cold exposure can increase energy expenditure, which could have metabolic benefits. Another team of researchers exposed participants to a temperature of 63 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours a day over six weeks. Their thermogenesis increased by about 58 percent, and they saw a mostly negligible decrease in fat of about one and a half pounds. The control group experience none of these changes. But there's further evidence to suggest that cold induced brown fat activation affects metabolic health, improving glucose and insulin sensitivity, increasing fat utilization, and protecting against diet induced obesity. One study looked at men who underwent prolonged cold exposure in a cooling vest. Their energy expenditure increased 15 percent, but only among those who had detectable brown fat. Roughly one-third of this increased was due to oxidation of plasma derived glucose. When the men received an infusion of glucose, only those who had detectable brown fat showed a further increase in glucose use. That's important because it indicates that brown fat plays a role in glucose utilization, essentially providing an alternate pathway for glucose. On fact, for healthy young people, this type of glucose uptake after cold exposure exceeds the insulin-stimulated uptake rate in skeletal muscle, making brown fat an interesting potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. So it's clear that acting as a hormone, nor up enough are released by cold exposure, can have wide-reaching positive effects on our bodies. But it can also act as a neurotransmitter and may influence brain function. The most normal studies have found that chronic cold exposure also promotes the release of Norepinephrine from the locus to the earliest region of the brain. In the brain, Norepinephrine is involved in vigilance, focus, attention, and mood. Low levels are associated with decreased attention, cognitive ability, energy, and poor mood. Norepinephrine depletion may even lead to depression. In fact, both ADHD and depression are sometimes treated with Norepinephrine re-eptake inhibitors, which block the re-absorption of Norepinephrine, increasing the levels around our neurons, but these drugs carry some risks. Increasing Norepinephrine through cold exposure, while not completely risk-free, shows promise as a way of addressing these aspects of mental health. For example, in a prospective randomized control trial, participants received 10 sessions of whole-body cryotherapy, short exposure to extremely cold air, in addition to antidepressant medication. It is a pair to the control group who are exposed to cold, but not cryogenic temperatures, the participants showed marked reductions in the depressive symptoms and improvement in their quality of life, mood and acceptance of their diagnosis. Sounds pretty good, right? So how can you try out cold exposure for yourself? The most common methods are cold water immersion and cryotherapy. They differ in their ability to reduce body temperature, but they both seem to induce a robust release of Norepinephrine. In one study, women either swam in 35.6 degree Fahrenheit water for 20 seconds, or underwent cryotherapy at temperatures 166 degree Fahrenheit for two minutes. They did this three times per week for 12 weeks. Both groups of women showed two to threefold increases in their circulating Norepinephrine after each exposure session. And temperature does matter. In study, where healthy young men underwent one hour head-out emergence in three different temperatures of water, only the coldest of the three increased Norepinephrine by 530% and dopamine by 250% compared to their levels before immersion. Not only that, but the coldest water increased their energy expenditure by 350% compared to pre-emergent levels. The duration matters, too. A separate study found that neck-deep immersion in 50 degree water for up to an hour increased Norepinephrine. The longer they were submerged, the bigger their response. So exposing the body to cold for prolonged periods may have a more robust effect on Norepinephrine release. However, other studies have still found significant effects with less time. When I previously mentioned had women immersed themselves in 35.6 degree Fahrenheit water for only 20 seconds and still saw big jumps in plasma Norepinephrine. While we can't strictly equate all adaptive benefits on that basis alone, at the least we do know a lot can happen in even just 20 seconds, which is encouraging for those of us that just need mixed use to get our feet wet. There's still a lot to learn about cold exposures effects on health and the mechanisms that drive them, but the early evidence is promising.

I'd love to get your take on training while fast-ed. You should be able to not eat any calories for 24 hours and still exercise. You don't have to have protein powder ever. This is a great one. So the turn metabolic flexibility has been hijacked. It's great because it is not a stimulant. So you can take it in the evenings and it doesn't compromise sleep at all. CO2 levels rise above 9 and a part per million. This will significantly and dramatically affect everything from sleep onset, to quality. Next day perceived fatigue. Next day arithmetic ability. How mad do you want the internet to get at these following statements? Hey everyone. I'm super excited to be sitting across the table from Dr. Andy Galpin, who is the director of the Human Performance Center at Parker University. Andy and I have been corresponding for at least the last 10 years. I'm pretty pumped to have this conversation. He is an expert in muscle physiology. But also has published a wide range of exercise physiology related topics from muscle health to nutrition, recovery. He also coaches athletes, Olympians, MMA fighters, just all around. Got a lot of experience and the science behind it. I'm really excited to have this conversation with you today, Andy. You and I've talked about a lot of things via X and Twitter at the time. I think email as well. Thank you so much for coming on the show. It's just, I can't even explain how much to honor and apply for this. I've been telling you for a long time now how stoked I am about this and my wife is tired of hearing of it. So I'm finally excited to get here and do it. Well today it's kind of interesting because you've got this vast publication history in muscle biology and exercise physiology. But I'm kind of taking you in a direction where you've also published and you have a lot of knowledge regarding nutrition, supplements, recovery. I'm super interested in the role of those in helping people meet their fitness goals. When it comes to nutrition, this is obviously a field that's constantly, there's no agreement ever. Whether we're talking about performance or longevity. But there's a growing number of athletes and people that are like myself, which are, I would say, committed exercises that I'm very interested in health, not as much in performance although I'm becoming a lot more interested in performance these days. But I'm interested in longevity for sure. That's my primary interest. So there's people trying to figure out what kind of diet they could, what kind of diet they could eat to sort of meet their performance and longevity goals if that's even possible. Is that something that you've thought about? Yeah, I get the question of performance versus longevity or health when nutrition a lot. And I think as you've done so well over your career, there are tenets that are going to agree and then there's going to be distension. And so I think it's easy to frame this as what are the flags we can put on both sides of this equation? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So if you want to live your longest healthiest life, number one, we're all going to agree on probably five, seven, maybe eight different things. And if you were to look, I'll just do this one. And if I said, okay, great, because we deal with these clients, I deal with high performance athletes as you mentioned. And we have a lot of our clients that are like you. They're not athletes never were, do not care, but they're wanting to live their longest healthiest life. And if I threw their diets in front of you, I'd be stunned if you could tell me which one was for which person. I don't think you'd have any chance, right? So you'd see what's going to look like. We're going to center around protein. Right? You've talked about that endlessly. It's going to be high in high quality. We're going to have a lot of a variety of food. We're going to have a lot of a variety of colors. Turns out, micronutrients, vitamins and minerals are pretty important, right? Like your entire career. We're going to have some attention paid to fiber. The work intake will be managed. We're going to distribute carbohydrates in fat in some way that helps them hit their needs and goals and personal preferences. We could go down the list. But the easiest way to think about it is how much overlap is there? Almost all. What are the small differences between these performance and longevity goals? Well, depends on what type of performance. So we're talking about a lot of chloric expenditure. We're talking about a power event. Or what do we? Then yeah, we're going to find some differences. And we can chop that up all day if you want to know like exact numbers and hours. But the reality of it is both of those people, performance longevity, you have to manage calories one way or the other. You have to do all the other things. It's not that different. You can make some arguments of maybe you can get away with certain things. If you're not interested in performance, you can do some different things with food timing, food frequency. You can play with some different stuff where you wouldn't want to do that with a high performance athlete. There's a lot of fun differences with those things. But at the highest level for the average person, if you're eating like a high performance athlete, the most part, you're also eating for longevity. Only big, fundamental difference there might be chloric balance. Yeah, that's the top layer. But other than that, it's pretty similar. I was kind of thinking that was going to be your answer. I do. I'm very interested in the intermittent fasting time restricted eating, training, training while you're fasted, depending on the type of training. It's something that I do for certain types of training. So, you look at training fasted. Well, I like to train fasted if I'm going for a 30 minute run. Yep. Zoom to kind of run. Sure. And the reason I do that is because I mean, this was years ago, I read a meta analysis. And maybe I would love to hear your updates on the literature because I know that you've been keeping up with it. But there was a meta analysis looking at people that were training fasted. And if they were doing endurance type of a aerobic exercise training and they trained, it was less than 60 minutes. It was less than an hour. Yeah. And this isn't a zone to kind of below the lactate threshold type of training. Then they had better adaptations in mitochondria, mitochondrial enzymes. Obviously fatty acids being oxidized. So, whereas if they trained when they were fed, again, it was less than an hour. Some of those adaptations were blunted somewhat. Yep. And for me, it was like, oh, well, I kind of want those adaptations. So, I do like to train a little bit fasted. Now, I don't do hour-long runs anymore. That was like a thing of my fast for me. I do my strength training. I do not like to do fasted at all. I have to have like something like a banana. I have to have some glucose or something. So, I'd love to get your take on training while fasted. Yeah. There's a lot of things to think about here. I know that I sent you right before we started here, our pre-print of our fasting studies. We just got published. So, we can go into that if you want. But in general, the biggest way to think about this is is to magnitude of benefit with the intervention, exceeding the magnitude of preference. And what I mean by that is when I coach people this morning, like literally this morning, I'm dealing with putting together a program for the number one quarterback in college football. Right after that, I have to deal with one of our executives who's 60-year-old female. Right, right after that, I'm also dealing with a guy preparing for a 900 mile hike. And so, that context is important because as I'm answering questions like this, all of these avatars are in my head. And I'm thinking, what is true for a person one, two, and three? And then what is true for the other person who does an exercise at all? And if something's not consistent across those four, then I have to modify and contextualize the answer. So, when it comes to training fasted, great. If you are going for an event like you're talking about, and you feel better when you do it, that matters to me in that particular context more than the physiological benefit, because the physiological benefit is not fake. It's just not huge. So, is it more beneficial for your mitochondria? Yes, potentially, but if you look at the amount, it's not that much. Now, if you're liked it or didn't care, fine. But if you're like, I hate it, my performance is worse. I don't like it, I'm feel good. Then we actually don't do it. And so, my first layer answer to all that is, number one, what do you actually performing best in? What are your personal preferences? Are you training in the morning? Are you training the evening? All these other factors that are now, again, contextualize, are my true answer. And I hate to be wish-washy on that, but that's the most honest answer, because I deal with a lot of people with different goals and different scenarios. So, the science can lead us in one direction, but the actual layering on top of what would I really recommend a human do? That in this scenario matters more. So, if you look at the research, very specifically on fasting exercise. Always depends on the type of exercise. You mentioned you were really careful about saying, like, I'm under 60 minutes, right? I'm under 60 minutes. Like, I know you're aware that that answer will change, right? What am I optimizing for? Am I optimizing for performance? Am I optimizing for feeling better that day? More focused that day. Am I optimizing for the happiness? And there's so many different reasons why one would exercise that you have to answer all those questions to figure out, well, what lever am I trying to pull here? What am I trying to get out of it? So, do we have people, am I, I'll answer this way? Do we ever take somebody and say, hey, you need to start doing your endurance work in the morning fasted? I can't think of very many times when we've ever done that. But if somebody shows up with that, well, we don't have any strong reason we're not gonna pull them off of it either. What if someone says, I'm interested in fat adaptation. I'm interested in mitochondrial health. And I'm not an endurance athlete. I'm just, you know, these are my recovery days. I do strength training on other days. These are my recovery days, so to speak, right? In a way. Then, would you still kind of, but what are your thoughts on that? So you mentioned my, mitochondrial adaptations aren't, it's not, it's a subtle difference. But what about like, polices, like, what about, you know? Yeah, so the way that we was framed this is, we need more information on them to determine whether or not that's gonna actually matter for them. So if they're saying, okay, I want to enhance fat burning, I want to enhance oxidative capacity. Great, what we actually need to look at their capacity for metabolic flexibility. We need to test that. I need to see that number, right? If you're just saying you want more, I'm gonna say more from where? Like, where are you currently at? I don't know. Well, then we don't know if we have anything to actually gain here. So we could do that intervention, and I don't know if we would do anything for you. If you're already pegged on that, if you're mitochondrial already functioning very high, if your ability to utilize fuel independent of food is strong, then we're not gonna get anything from it. If you're really weak in that area, then we would get something from it. So our first answer is data, right? We have to run some objective test. If you don't wanna do that or can't do that, you wanna give that a try, sure. Like fine, it's probably not gonna hurt much in the short term, so go ahead and do that. So my answer to somebody who asks that question, like I want to optimize mitochondria. Okay, great. Starting off with faster cardio is not the place we would go, but we might use it eventually. If you can do a whole bunch of stuff, and we could do this objectively. Okay, when you go out and train, how do you feel if you don't eat before? All I feel terrible. Okay, well that's like an easy litmus test to say, maybe we have some stuff we can do there. There's way more we can do it into and detail. I wouldn't only ask that question, but that's how we would actually think about that answer. So it could be everything from yes, like I'm not super worried about it. If they're really, really stoked to do it, I'm probably gonna say yes. Just for that fact alone. Like yeah, let's give it a go. But I don't necessarily think you would have to do that to have healthy mitochondria. If that's another way to answer the question. What about people that are doing strength training, resistance training first thing in the morning, and they don't have a lot of time, they're getting their kids ready for school. And it's like they want to feel with something. Like what's the best option? Personal preference in terms of feeding or not feeding. The literature would be fairly clear here. I would say our personal experience would match that. Some people are fine, some people are not. If you wanna go just like practical recommendations, Abenan and approaching shake, super easy. A little bit of yogurt, maybe in granola. We have a lot of our athletes that will train in the morning and that's a really common thing. So I'm gonna hold a yogurt, maybe honey, maybe some berries, small six to eight ounces. Right, really small servings. You're talking probably 300 calories, maybe 50 grams of carbohydrate. Like in these rick rough neighborhoods of things, some a little protein 10 to 30 grams, depending on their physical size. Remember some of our athletes are 115 pounds. Some of them are 350 pounds. So like the numbers, very small sizes. It's different for those people. So personal preference, but yeah, our recommendations would be things like that. We don't have too many athletes or clients that we'll intentionally ask them to not eat before they train. Like we sort of talked about. But the easy quick, just get out the door stuff. That's what we're gonna lean on. Like very simple, easy, digesting, small amounts of food. Probably not as much as your full breakfast, but those things will tend to work pretty well. Yeah, I think athletes are less interested in that. And people that are more interested in body recomposition, they're wanting to lose fat, gain muscle, are more interested in, okay, well, perhaps that kind of person that their liver glycogen takes more hours before it depletes. Yeah. And then it's like, well, if I then eat before my run, then I didn't fully depletes the liver glycogen. And so they're not gonna be perhaps undergoing lipoluses and oxidizing patiacid for energy. So what about people that are interested in that are fit and they're not really athletes, but their exercises. And they're interested in just sort of fat loss, body recomposition. The acute timeframe pre-mid post-exercise for those people probably doesn't matter that much. It really isn't gonna have a huge impact. What matters is the days and weeks, the total caloric expenditure throughout the day. This person, if you're training in the morning, you probably have at least 24 hours to recover, right? Even if you're training hard every single day. Most of the time when we get really specific about nutrient timing, it's because a lot of our clientele are training twice or more a day. That's when timing really is critical. Whether you're talking about timing of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. So when we hear people say things like, oh, timing doesn't matter, for the average person, not a huge deal. But for some of our people, it really significantly matters. But what you just described is not. Instead of their person, it was like, I'm exercising, let's just even say seven days a week. Probably most people are doing like five. So even in between that, you've got a lot of recovery time. So what you have before the workout, doesn't matter a huge amount. Whether you have it immediately post, doesn't matter a huge amount. The total end throughout the day, the only caveat is actually what you asked a little bit before. It's personal preference. I don't feel as well. Okay, great. I'm stomach, awesome. That's the context. It's not the physiology of the biology that's to mattering there. It's now personal preference. Or objective data that says we're getting less performance out of this is your recovery slowing down, or in the cases. So overall, I would say do what feels best for you there. And there's not a significant thing you should be worried about. The productivity you're leaving on the table, progress you're leaving on the table, or compromised results from no matter what choice you make. There are whether it is fats, the protein, or the carbohydrates. What about people that are doing time-shroted eating? And the worry of time-shroted eating would be losing muscle. Yeah, perhaps if you're not getting in your protein intake or resistance training. What are your thoughts there? You have a new publication now. You've published in this area. How do you feel about time people that are doing, let's say, a 16-8 time-shroted eating? Yeah, so we actually ran this study. It started in 2019, and we just published it this week. That tells you how that goes. COVID-19 killed us. We had a big cohort study going our last two groups. I was literally days away from doing the final biopsies. And we got pulled out of the lab. And I was begging our people, just let me one day going in biopsie, 10 people. No, they wouldn't. So nonetheless, we ran this study. And one of the things we're interested in is, with time-shroted eating, 16-8, all the research on that area for the most part is chlorchristriction. So how does this thing work for fat loss? And that's fine. Grant Tinsley, I don't know if you know Grant, but he's done a ton of work at Texas Tech. And lots of other groups have done it. You've talked a lot about DREs, 16-8, okay, great. What I was more interested in is what's the opposite? What about the person who's trying to gain muscle? If I do 16-8, what's actually happening here? And because of the way that I operate, I don't care about just a molecular mechanism. I don't care just about body composition. I wanted to ask questions about sleep, about personal preference, about digestion, about how hard the diet was, how likely are you to do it, physical performance. Because when you go into the real world, that's how you make decisions. I want to be able to tell people, hey, this is 16-8, maybe it is better for body composition, but it's harder to follow, or it makes your sleep worse, or it's better for everything. Like whatever combination the answer is going to be, I don't really care, but that's the full context people have in the make dietary decisions. So that's what we did. We took people that were very well trained, and we did eight weeks of strength training with them. And the lab supervised all that already, again, previously well trained, men and women, college age, that was normal. We did biopsies, we did muscle imaging, we did questionnaires, we did sleep stuff, we did blood, we did a bunch of different things. And ultimately what we wanted to see was, okay, we're gonna put them all the same protein load, and we're gonna put them in caloric excess. So hypercloric, not hypercloric. We know the answer what happens with TRE, if you're trying to lose weight. What happens is somebody actively trying to gain muscle. So that's the very unique twist of it. And it was super interesting. The take home message was it didn't matter a ton. As long as you hit your numbers, the results were basically the same across both groups. So standard, four or five, six, feeding's a day versus theory. Now we actually like doubled down on the question, because we actually made the people train in the TRE group in the morning, and then they had to wait at least an hour before they fueled afterwards. So they trained fasted, they didn't recover with protein, or anything like that immediately afterwards, and they stayed in that state until the afternoon. So even despite of that, it didn't significantly compromise muscle growth, or performance, or really anything else. We saw some subtle differences. The TRE group actually looked like it didn't gain as much body fat, because you're gonna do that when you go hypercloric, right? You're gonna, especially if you're well trained, you wanna add muscle, you're gonna bring some fat along the route. I don't know if it was a enough of a different say, and we, I spent a lot of time that day to set. I don't know if that's a real finding to be honest, or if that was just a little bit of an artifact. The counter to it was, as time went on, fatigue got higher in the TRE group. Legs got heavier performance, the legs started to decline. Again, so much so, what I suggest TRE is gonna be bad. No, nobody was like, okay, I think there's something happening here. I think potentially, if we were to change the study design a little bit and give them fuel closer, that would have made it, not exactly sure, we would have to run a separate study design for that. And so if you torture the data a little bit, you might find some subtle differences between the TRE two groups, and they were, this is the significant and the effect size and all those things there. But looking at it from a real practitioner perspective, my general take-home was, it didn't matter a ton. If you're trying to maximize leg strength and maximize leg growth, I probably wouldn't go to 168 TRE, but if you have other reasons to do it, you're still gonna get gains. They still got stronger, they didn't get as strong. Some other issues that happened, but either one of them works. But do you think, again, if they were allowed, I mean, most people after they're done strength training, they eat within an hour, like I immediately, I'm getting protein in me because I need, I just, like, body wants it. So do you think that maybe would negate some of the performance deficits that you found? I think it would honestly, it was more of a carbohydrate issue. Carb of hydrates. Yeah, I think that was the bigger issue because they were going so long without carbohydrates and they were training so hard. And they were doing the same workout multiple times per week. I just think over time, we were also progressing them. So they were being tested every time they came in the lab and the training got harder, right? Like, the traditional progressive overload. I don't think they, I wish we had actually biopsy data for their muscle glycogen levels. But if I had this respect, I think that that was starting to leak down. And I just think the legs were getting, we would say just getting heavier over time. Like it just wasn't handling the volume, because that's actually what happened to the volume that the TR Regrew did started to come down at the end. They just couldn't do as much volume as the other group could do. Okay, at the end of a workout, not like at the end of the end. No, it's the end of the week. Oh, okay. So because we tested them pre-mid and pulse. When were they working out morning or evening morning? Yep, where they were all working out fast. Fasted. They're doing strength training fasted. Yeah. So the bottom line is from your study, which is going to be published soon. Depending on this comes out, it may already be. Nice. Any, any damage. Any dish. Stunned it actually has a high-end. Congratulations. I'm excited. I'm, you sent it to me. I can't wait to read it. You can gain muscle on a 16-8 time restricted eating schedule. It sounds like if you're, if you're doing the training fasted, I mean, there's ways to do 16-8 you can stop eating earlier and not have to be fasted in the morning. Well, so actually, that's super interesting because when I looked at this, I was like, man, I think that's just the better approach. Maybe if they would have done their fasting in the evening afternoon, there's all a bunch of other arguments we could make that that's better anyways. That would be a really cool follow-up. And I would, I'd be willing to bet they wouldn't have had such an indirect, indirect markers of fatigue over time. They just didn't have fuel for a really long time. I could also tell you these things behind. And this is like the veil of people that when you run actual studies, you can make comments about things that are in the paper. The people had a really hard time with the carbohydrates. That was the complaint. And so when you had a whole bunch, you remember, because you're getting some of these people at 600 grams carbohydrate a day. And you got to get that in an eight hour window. It was GI was just destroyed. Like it was a lot of people were like, man, my stomach is just blowing up from 600 grams of carbohydrate. Because you imagine eating 200 grams of carbohydrates, a couple hours later, you got to know that 200 or 200. It was just a lot. Was it so high because you were doing this hyper-colloric? Because I mean, most people aren't doing that many carbohydrates unless they're like endurance athletes. And when we have some big people, right? So if you're 110 kilos and you've got to be at a high-collar, and you're at six grams for kilogram body weight, like those numbers get high fast. So in order to get there, that stuff got there. Even the protein got a little tough as well. So we didn't see how we should have had more subjective questions in those areas. But that would, I would say, it was just hard for those people to hit their numbers. Most of them got there, but there it is like, whoa, I just wish I had another hour. Like give me another two hours. Could I get 50 of this grams of this protein a little bit earlier that I'd make my life so much easier? So I just think from a practical perspective, it was harder for them to follow. It was harder for them to hit their numbers, waiting the whole day, then to start and hit it in a caloric surplus. So if you're not in caloric surplus, different equation here. If you're in a caloric deficit, different equation here. But for people that are pre-trained, pretty well trained, and they're actively trying to get bigger and stronger, it wouldn't be the first approach I would take. But it's still plausible, clearly it worked. They still got benefits from them. But switching the order I think would be cool. Would you say that if they were, let's say they're in a slight caloric deficit, still getting their protein, meeting their protein needs, would they be still gaining muscle, you think? I don't think good again as much. They would have gained some. Right, if you look at, again, all grants work, and a lot of that, high-pricular work state, stuff, sometimes I gain muscle. It can happen, but can they gain it at the same rate as when you add more calories? I don't think so. And I don't think so, because in our particular program, the training program was really aggressive. They were training hard. For really well trained people, I don't think the recovery would be there. I just don't think it would be there. When did they stop eating and how was their sleep effected? So we let them choose their window. So some of them came in at training like seven o'clock in the morning, because I want to start their eating window at 10. But they're college kids. So most of them trained like 10, 11, 12 o'clock in the morning. And they would start their eating windows between one and two o'clock, and they afternoon, like something like that. They panes on if they work or whatever they're there. So we let them shift a little bit. The time domain's had to be the same, but we didn't make them start at noon. Like, you know, they're paying their life schedule. Sleep didn't really change that much. I wish we would have had some of our newer sleep technology. We could have really objectively looked at it at the time. We just had basic questionnaires. So we'll see there. What we did notice is the perceived fatigue and naps increased over time in the TRE group. And so again, a little inclination there of saying, I think fatigue was setting in more. Didn't, some of that didn't land, such as a significant. You start to see sort of multiple things in the same pattern you go, all right. If we run a follow up study there, that might be interesting to focus on. Why is it important for people to have carbohydrates before they're doing strength training? You don't have to. If you can get away with it, you're fine. It's not the thing we're super concerned about, depending on where you're at. If you can get through it, if you're total clerk and take throughout the days fine, if your carbahiter didn't take through it, then it's fine. And depending on how often you're strength training, if you're the typical person who's training the same body part on non-consecular days, then carbohydrate pre-exercises not a big deal. It's totally fine. You can get away with your strength training. It'd be a personal preference again. If you're training though the same muscle group in multiple days or multiple times per day, that's when the carbohydrate timing will matter most. So you can have it before, generally people feel better with it. Performance is usually better, but it's not always. Or if you're someone that is on a more of a hypocoloric diet if you're trying to lose fat or perhaps maintain your weight, you're kind of really kind of watching your calories. Then perhaps you're not having a huge total caloric, totally calorie calorie intake per day that you might want to have carbahiter to not. And we will generally as it's just a high level rule, try to get more of our calories around training. Just period. Regardless of what we're doing, regardless of what type of training, regardless of the person. As a first level thing, that's our preference. We want to either do it pre-mid post. In your example there, if we're trying to bring calories down, we're going to go somewhere else if we can. It doesn't always work that way. People don't always like it, but that is our default position is, yeah, we're going to do more calories in and around the training to support better performance. You perform better, you get better adaptations. That's generally how we look at it. What about people that are more endurance type of athletes? They're out running 10, 15 or more miles, or cycling, biking, what about those individuals? Different equation now, right? So whether you talk about strength training or even endurance training, but as you're talking subs 60 minutes, that kind of a moderate to low intensity, carbohydrate before training for most people's not gonna matter that much. Now you're talking about something different. Really high-intensity exercise for a prolonged amount and or moderate exercise for a longer amount, right? So we'll define longer by plus 60 minutes. Now you will very often see performance improvements with carbohydrates. That said, we have some of our people, some of our friends, a good friend of mine that I will never stop giving him the business on this one, camhains, you know, cam? Oh, yeah, cams great. The worst performance nutrition, you could just possibly dream of, right? Like, he will intentionally not eat and drink water and then go run 18 miles, right? And you're just like, what, like, what are we doing here, right? I've made the argument like, I call PR him and every race he's ever done if he would just like let me tell him, he would just follow what I tell him to do, but he refuses. So you can do these things. This is not a matter of it's impossible, if it's logically, but are you gonna get your best out of it? Probably not. Our dehydrates before exercise, probably three or four hours before exercise, if possible, if you're trying to maximize performance, generally looking at something in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 grams of carbohydrates, that's a huge plus or minus range there, three or four hours before, we were generally looking at starches, slower digesting, like give it time, amount of big spike. Some people, we will tinker with 30 minutes before, something in the neighborhood of 50, 60 grams of carbohydrates, maybe a little bit more. Some people though, kind of deal with the glucose double whammy if you do that, so you gotta be careful. What I mean is, if you take a whole bunch of fast-respawning glucose, things are getting your blood's really quickly. Right before you start exercising, in insulin starts pulling glucose down, muscle starts pulling it out as well, and so blood glucose actually dips. This is like I had a banana and honey right before I started my race, and then I got two miles in and I felt like death. Like, okay, you had two mechanisms at the same time that are independent, that are bringing it down, and blood glucose actually dips quite a bit. Until it lever has a chance to kick in and bring it back to normalized. So you'll feel that response pretty often, so you gotta be really careful with easy digesting carbohydrates right before the event, and depending on how long it's gonna last. But those are like rough numbers to start with. In the exercise itself, the numbers you're gonna see here, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 grams, up to 100 grams of carbohydrate per hour, which is like if you wanna maximize performance, you'll see the data will show you like 80 plus, 80 to 100 grams. You don't want that easy stuff right? No, now you want the fastest possible. Oh, you do what you're in a race, right? You're moving, right? This is when the goose and the packs and things, it ends. So you're trying to smash it in there as much as you can. I actually just had a guy named Jordi Sullivan, a dietitian in Australia. He was just on my podcast, and he actually coached a guy named Ned Brockman, and Ned did a thousand mile race on a track. So you ran on a track for a thousand miles, and he could took him like 11 or 12 days, something like that to finish. Did he, I mean, how was the sleeping, what was the sleeping life? The sleeping life was the sleeping life. The sleeping life was the sleeping life. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was just like laid out and crashed her a little bit, and then he'd get up and just like run again. And he just kept going. He, Jordi went through the exact details, exactly what he fed him, the amounts, the concentration. And when you get into things like that, when Michael's getting ready for this 900 mile hike thing, six, Steady 80, 200 grams of carbohydrate per hour is awesome in a lab. And I put you on a bike, and you're in my research facility, like those are the numbers at work. When you cross over into humans, you start getting really tired of go. Like don't want a taste sugary drinks anymore. And so when you get past a couple of hours, a vector size thing you actually start really paying attention to texture and flavor profile and mouth feel. Because that stuff starts to matter, and you can't hit those numbers. They're just not realistic. So if you're going to try to do something like this, pick your poison in terms of the carbohydrate source. This is the past sugars. But if you're going to go for more than a couple of hours, you got to really think carefully about, are you sure you're going to like that taste of that for six hours? Because you probably won't. It's just incredible. I can't believe people do things like that. What about carbohydrate replenishment after a long endurance type of workout? Do you think that's important to replenish the glycogen stores? Depends on what you had started with. So did you feed before or did you not? That is automatically a context. If you fed before, then we don't have to worry about as much directly after. If you're fasted, we've got to worry about more. The other context we have to pay attention to. Again, what's our total cloric intake with our carbohydrate intake throughout the day? And when are we going to train again? Some of our folks, again, training multiple times per day, we are going to go absolutely out of our way to get 100 grams of carbohydrate post-exercise. If it's a hard training session, rough number. Again, that number scales up and down with physical size and cloric expenditure, things like that. If you're going to get into a plane and drive and you're going to do something else for the next two days, carbohydrate post-exercise, like the amount, doesn't matter. It's not a big deal. You're up against a race of replenishment time. If that matters, you want to, again, look for 100 ish grams of carbohydrate, pretty close to finishing. And unlike protein, timing matters. The faster you get that carbohydrate in, that the faster you will replenish muscle and liver glycogen. Protein, as you've covered many times, like timing and a ballach window, like not a big deal at all. But carbohydrate are different. You got to repeat that performance again soon, faster, more, better. If you got a lot of time, then your recovery windows, plenty, then you're going to be fine. Or even if you're just training for a race, right? If you're training like every day, you're probably going to want to get that replenishment in right away. Well, in that case, actually, that's a great point because it's not only necessarily just about recovering for your next workout, but you actually need to train that system. So one mistake we will make when they do endurance events like that is they will forget to mimic the race and training. So then when they get in a training, they try to do something. They haven't done it before. And their body can freak out. This is when you get a lot of GI distress. When you get a lot of your tapering and the week before, all of a sudden your performance is down, you're like, what's going on? When you're doing something different now, then you were doing the last eight weeks. And so yeah, I would actually strongly encourage you to treat your practice races like your real race. So do your pre-mid post-fueling strategies and preparation for that. So then when you show up, your body's like, yep, this is exactly what we do. This is exactly how we handle people for the Super Bowl, for world championship events, for the Olympics. You try to make those big events where they're so incredibly important and there's so much pressure and stress in that, you want to make it feel like a normal practice. This is just what we do. So while most of you aren't going to be on that stage, I get it, when you go around that first five K, like that's still going to be really exciting. It's going to feel like that. Your body is going to know, wow, this is something I care about. Or you go and you finally get to surf that wave that you've been wanting to do. Or whatever the thing is, you go on that hunt that you've been wanting to go after. The thing you can control the most is making your day feel like you've been training. It's a normal process. This is what we do. This is how we warm up. This is the thing we take. The more you can do that, the more consistent response you're going to have, the more predictable response. And that way you can check out of those things and let your body just do what it's been and great to do. So yeah, we definitely recommend that post carbohydrate, after that individual simply for those purposes. What kind of effect does that have on performance? Is it pretty noticeable? I mean, if you're, yeah, it is everything from I bumped what happened. I felt flat, what we like everything went away. What's going on to now I hit the PR. Like if you play with these things correctly, you should feel your best on competition day. There's some of our sports, like this is not possible because of weight cutting and other dumb things we have to do. But for the most part, this is the top of the matters. This is the like there's nothing worse than when you PR a week after competition. Like there's just nothing worse. You're like, all right, PR the week before or the week after. These are little details that make you land on the right day in the right time in that one race, that one event. That's how we help people smash those things and they don't just go, well, we're just going to train kind of hard. And we hope that you show up the day and perform. We want to take all those questions out of it. So yeah, it'll make everything from again. I tanked. I bombed. I failed out to, I had my best performance ever. To kind of go back to the original question about eating for longevity versus performance. Now we're kind of talking about. He or her own question. One still. Well, no, I just kind of wanted to circle back because if we are talking about someone that is racing, right, they're competing, they're trying to PR. They're, you know, all of those things. Then the carbohydrate sources that they're eating aren't going to be what I'm eating. I'm not going to be, I'm certainly not going to be trucking the goo, but like the the fast, like during like intra workout, right, while you're while you're racing or even perhaps like you were saying right before, you know, eating, eating the the quick, like the the stuff that's going to spike your blood glucose quickly isn't typically stuff that people that are eating for a long-javity type of. Like my my carbohydrate sources are typically vegetables, you know, fruits that have a food fiber matrix. Most of the time, I mean, some fruits can hit your your body a little quicker than others that grapes, for example, but, you know, you know, most of the carbohydrate source are more complex carbohydrates. Yeah, so fair point. This is that small sliver difference at the end, right. So again, if we look at your, um, we actually have probably, I don't five females right now that we're coaching that are plus around your body size. So we'll make just equivalents to you and those individuals. We take both your diets for you and all those different girls that are in different sports. They're going to be almost identical, right. So they're going to be heavily focused on vegetables and starches and fruit and all those things. What would that difference be? Well, okay, some of them post training might do, um, a powdered glucose source. So we might give them a carbohydrate supplement. Then we might use a Vittargo or something like that where it's like a scooped carbohydrate where you're probably never having that. You're not having it throughout the day. You're not having it pre-imposter work out. You don't need 60 grams of carbohydrate. That's easily that. So that would be different, right? But what are they going to have post workout? I don't know watermelon. Like they're going to have things that you're probably eating to. Do we have a little more liberty with them to add some more grapes? Sure. But you could also probably grapes, too. You would just take something else like out or move it around or you would have more protein when you have the grapes or whatever different strategies we do. It's really small the amount of goods and powders and things like that that we're doing. We're going to eat 95% of their calories. It's whole real food. You got a little bit of supplements on the end and things like that. But we're not going to spend too much time with low quality foods, even for those individuals. I want them eating real whole healthy foods. So that is it's a really small difference, I guess. So yeah, in some of the situations where for the most part your diet and their diets would be very identical. So fat often gets overshadowed by protein and carbohydrates. Where does that come into the equation of meeting your fitness goals, whether you're in a Durance athlete or strength training or not in a daily in athlete, just someone who's interested in being healthy and exercising and looking for the longevity aspects of diet and exercise. Yeah, so I would say, you position it pretty well. Most people will start with protein, lock that thing in. And then you'll play with carbohydrates in fat as a way to adjust overall Clark intake. And because we know the role of carbohydrates and exercise performance, we will usually go to that second and then fat gets the third consideration like, okay, fine, whatever calories we have left, we backfill with fat. And as long as your fat isn't too low and it's too low chronically, then you're not going to really run into too many issues of having insufficient amount of intake of fat dietary fat. That said, this is something I've changed my tune on a lot. Right, like I come from the classic exercise physiology, academic background, and all those people are carbohydrates first, carbohydrates second, third, fourth, and you're like, fat was always shunned. And I don't think, I don't think I believe that as much anymore. I also, we've experienced a lot. A lot of the people we worked with, they're fine on moderate to low carbide, even high exercises, non-athletes, but they just train a ton. You're talking about guys and girls running 60 miles per week. Right, like, like, like, real high energy expenditures and trends of performance, and they're at 100 grams of carbohydrate a day. They're not in katosis at all. They're not even trying to be, but they just like are fine at 150 grams a day. We're two in a grams of carbohydrate a day, right, for a hundred and twenty to 190 pounds, like individuals kind of about that, just as some frame of reference for numbers there. In that case, their fat intakes are way higher. And they're fine. We're not seeing any performance to increments. They're not having a hard time recovering. Their sleep isn't going down. Like sex hormones are fine. So actually to see enough evidence now anecdotally and empirically, be like, I think actually you're fine. There, I think you're okay. If you're giving yourself a if you're in dodgeiness recovery is sufficient, I think you're going to be just fine there. So what we do with carbohydrates and fat for that person you're describing is, we let personal preference drive us a lot, right? We also will change it just so that you can have some dietary changes, like fat tastes delicious. It's really hard. It's really bland when you don't get to have a lot of fat in your diet. So sometimes we'll bring carbohydrates right down for a while and let them have more fat if we need to manage calories. We don't generally see that much for the average person. Like we don't see that many consequences performance wise. So I don't think most people are going to have this huge like, oh my god, I'm not recovering anymore. If you're doing a normal amount of exercise, I think you're going to be just fine. Some people think if they're eating a high fat diet, low carb diet and they're doing endurance type of exercise, more they're more heavily biased towards endurance training. Yeah. That they're going to be more fat adapted. They're going to be more metabolically flexible and their might of control adaptations are going to be superior. I would not support that statement. I would disagree with that. This is a great one. So the turn metabolic flexibility has been hijacked. And the way that it is described now, locally is not what that phrase ever started to be and it's not what that is intended to be. It's so crazy because metabolic flexibility has gotten, got turned into maximizing fat burning. It's supposed to be metabolic flexibility, which means you have the ability to run the whole gamut. I get it. If you pluck the average person off the street, they're probably less likely to be good at burning fat than they are carbohydrate. So on aggregate, we probably need to get more people better at burning fat. I'm with the on that one. But metabolic flexibility is not just maximized fat burning. Those are not the same thing. And that's how people will often describe that. If you go too hard on one side of the other of the equation, you'll see a whole host of adaptations that compromise the ability to do the other things. That's not metabolic flexibility. That is still specialization. You're specializing the other side of the equation. If that's what you want to do, fine, we're all for it. But we generally like to see people truly flexible on both sides. So if you want to go higher fat in your performance, because you feel better, you like it. Great. If you can demonstrate no issues, we're all for it. But if we're doing it for a theoretical idea, and you don't actually have information behind that, then we're not going to do some more of those ideas. You want to go higher fat? Great. We have had some people, where we've changed around with some number of people. Like we've changed around with different things. We try a higher fat diet, and they actually do perform better. So we stay with that, right? Like even independent of any metabolic flexibility data we've got in them. Great. We're going to stay in that. And then we've had others that are the opposite. So these are these really long, long duration endurance folks that are out there, and they just don't do well when carbohydrates get low. And so we have to have room for both of those realities. Some people will perform better on a higher fat diet for more fat oxidizing, lower intensity things, and some will just do a lot better on those. And to finish up the point, I'm talking about a long duration endurance events that are both fast and slow. So if you look at, to be ridiculous, like we were talking about cam earlier, you look at some rub, you know producer, these guys are under two and a half hour marathon times, right? Cams higher, but you know, rub's a two and a half hour, he's fat, he's going to be burning, I don't know, I don't have metabolic data on him, but 70 to 80 percent carbohydrate in the marathon. So that's a long duration endurance event, but that is not a fat burning event. That is a carbohydrate game, right? If you want to run a marathon fast, that is a carbohydrate game. If you want to run a really, really long one, and you don't care about speed, you're still going to burn a boatload of carbohydrates. But now we can afford to go slower with more fat oxidation. And so when we say endurance, there was also like another level of question, it was like, okay, fast endurance or just like endurance for the long term. So all that goes into our calculus of thinking about how we're going to fuel somebody, how we're going to ask them to recover. To get to the, like, to go back a few minutes earlier, Jordi was talking about this with Ned Brockman, 1000 miles. He's not giving him fat only. He's not on an 80 percent fat, like that is his most fat oxidizing, oxidation, possible thing you could come up with, 1000 dang miles, and he's still relying heavily on carbohydrates to get him through. So I don't know if that actually answers your question, but you can think about like, that's the stuff that we framed against. Well, yeah, it doesn't answer the question. It's basically like, no, you don't have to. You don't have to be eating, eating a higher fat diet isn't necessarily going to make you better at burning fat. Oh, no. And definitely not. I certainly think that, you know, when it comes down to that metabolic flexibility, exercise again, like when you're, when you're doing a lot of exercise, you become your, you actually are becoming met about more metabolically flexible the exercise in my opinion. Absolutely. That don't anything else. Actually, the one thing that's kind of interesting here that does get left, the way that we think about metabolic flexibility is more of an innate human skill rather than an exercise performance one such that I think you all, we all should have the ability to go for six hours and not have any food and still perform cognitively. You shouldn't be angry and cranky because you missed lunch, right? Like that is now you're in the kind of like, you're not super resilient. Whether this is a metabolic flexibility issue or not, if that's happening consistently with you, I would say we have some room to grow with metabolic health, likely, right? You should probably be able to go 24 hours and maintain cognitive function and maintain physical performance. If you ever, you've done some fast and longer fasting stuff, right? You should be able to not eat any calories for 24 hours and still exercise. You're not really able to really have a very much anything. If you're the person who is the like, I can't do anything, I skip lunch or didn't get to then I think we have some stuff to do. But this is more of like you have probably are lacking some innate physiological skills that are going to help you in multiple ways. But past that, the metabolic flexibility thing is not often packaged correctly in my opinion. What do you think about, I've had Marty Cabala on the podcast, I talked about high-intensity interval training and obviously when you're doing a lot of people think when you're doing hit, that it's like this all, I'm only burning glucose, right? If I'm doing so into I'm only burning fat, only oxidizing fat and using mitochondria and they don't realize there's actually a lot of gray going on, like you're doing high-intensity interval training types of exercise, your, yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you know, going above the lactate threshold, your, you're using glucose as fuel, but you're also still using your mitochondria, right? I mean, yeah, we're pushing them hard and there are, there are many things to say about poor understanding of metabolism is, is how to say that. There is no way to fully metabolize carbohydrate without oxidation. You just can, right? Like you can run through and you can do it, it's probably not the most interesting thing, but you can't get very far anaerobicly with even carbohydrate. You have to finish that story a rubically. Does that mean you're fuel in the exercise itself? Is the same as the total net expenditure? No. So in the case of Marty's work and high-intensity yeah, in the actual exercise about itself, you're going to be well above anaerobic threshold. You're going to be well above an RAR of 1.0, right? You're going to get really, really, really, in fact, we have seen many times 1.3s, 1.4s, right, for RAR's or RQ's. That's mathematically impossible. 1.0 means 100%. So what you're mean is like the the the carbon dioxide expenditure is so exceeding aerobic or oxidative intake that your numbers get like a astronomically high. So yes, but that said those anything you just burn there that's sitting either in lactate or in pyruvate or some other intermediate form there, it's going to be finished in the mitochondria of oxidation. You want to recover faster? And I'm talking about within the minutes to hours post-sexual size as well as a couple of days. Now this is a aerobic capacity issue. That's how you handle these things. For RAR athletes that fight in five, five minute rounds like on the UFC, or we do 12 rounds in boxing, whatever the case is, there is a huge aerobic component to that huge. Just despite the fact that they are going as hard as possible, they are pegged, heart rate-wise, and other things, getting them to recover, especially from session to session. The morning work out to the evening work out. The higher functioning aerobic capacity we have there and I don't mean VL2 max per say there. I truly mean aerobic capacity. That is a huge component of their ability to recover and it not be completely trash the next day. The ones that are really, really smashed and aerobically like really high, they can't train as much. We have to back them off more. The volume has to be lower. We have to be really strategic. We run into injuries more frequently. We run into physiologically running into the ground. Our recovery metrics get lower. The taper has to be longer. We have to just make adjustments with calories. They can't handle as much. The ones that are higher in aerobic fitness, like a handle things more. There's consequences to that too, but yeah, that you can pick the highest intensity that you could possibly do. And there's still an aerobic is not two different things. It's the same gear. It's the top-side and bottom-side of the same gear. There's not different units. They're just the front side of the backside of that. So they will always complement each other. They're not distinct things. Look at all of George's work on lactate. We know these answers now. This is not a one system. These are not different systems. These are just the different side of the same coin. Right. Now it's true. I mean, people like to kind of put this, I think Lane explained this and a good way how people like to put things in bins. It's like this bin or this bin. Well, there's sometimes there's a lot of there's not bin. So they're just kind of just overlap. This rarely health physiology works. Right. We have a redundant systems on purpose. I kind of wanted to ask you just because we were talking about the timing of we talked about the antibiotic window for carbohydrates. They're truly, it does seem to be an importance there with respect to at least if you're doing more endurance or retraining. And you want to be ready for the next day. But protein, you know, Stufelips has been on the Cleveland, Lune, your in agreement. They're really the antipolico window is more of a, it's more of the total daily protein intake. Is that? I mean, I guess, you know, when Lane came on the podcast, he said, maybe there's a little something you can squeeze out if you're like top level. Yeah. You know, total growth. Yeah. Power lift or muscle bodybuilder, whatever. Yeah. And honestly, that comes down though to practicality. It's just simply because I said earlier. It's just really hard to get 400 grams of protein in a day. Mm. You just end up having a new protein like all that like yeah, right. Yeah. Just look at Mike Orm's piece work at a Florida state. He's done all that pre bed carbohydrate or a protein ingestion stuff. So it's like 40 grams of protein 30 minutes before bed. Now in all that stuff, he hasn't shown these huge mass of benefits to it. He actually doesn't show any consequences either. So you don't compromise fat. You don't gain more fat. You don't reduce fat oxidation by having this big bowls of protein right before bed. And so the way he will package that is to say, if you're struggling to hit your total protein numbers, this is just another window to get you there. If your protein numbers are fine though, there's no out of benefit here. There's no huge win. So that just is another example, I think, of this point when it comes to the protein game, probably what Lane was saying, like, if this is just maybe a way if you just smack in 15 more grams or 20 or 40, then great. But outside of that, there's no magic benefit. Yeah, Luke and Lune actually did a few studies. I don't know if he collaborated with the person just mentioned, but also on this pre-sleep protein loading where it's like they're giving people protein, of all the protein right before bed. And it does increase muscle protein synthesis while they're sleeping. And again, I think the way he also framed it was, you're getting more of your total protein. You're getting more of that total protein for the day, but also it seems to make a difference for elderly people who are just terrible at making, meeting that protein requirement. For whatever reason, and I know it's just hard to chew food or their appetite isn't it? They don't have a appetite hormones or kind of disregulated whatever the reason. So what I wanted to ask you about because it was kind of interesting, I saw a study where a co-author on with respect to protein, kind of on that sort of same token, people meeting, it's hard for some people to take in 1.6 grams for a kilogram of body weight or more. So they're taking protein patterns. They're during the protein patterns. It's the easiest thing, right? What are your thoughts on Whole Foods versus Pouters? Now you publish an interesting study on egg white powder versus the whole egg. Yeah, yeah. But I'd love to like to know your thoughts in general. Yeah, that was actually a pretty cool study. Whole Food is always the answer. Right? That there's always our default position if we ever have to go to supplements or even supplemental food, like a protein powder or a powder to carbohydrate. That is our second choice. Full stop right there. That particular paper and actually set a studies on the found basically the same thing. So whole egg versus egg white. And it turns out potentially we don't we didn't have mechanisms behind this, but potentially some of the stuff that's in the egg yolk itself was contributing to additional muscle growth. My cronature, it wise might have indeed read a course and like any number of things are called absolutely right. Whether those actually were the case, I don't get we didn't have mechanisms on those. It was just sort of like, why do you think this is happening? I'm even when you match it for calories. Seems to be the case. Nonetheless, the back-eyed your question. Yeah, it's a whole food answer, right? If we can get there with Whole Food and I will say this, we have many of our professional athletes that take almost no supplements. And they definitely don't supplement protein powder. Someone don't like it. It doesn't set well with their GI. You don't have to have protein powder ever. I can't think of a compelling reason why I outside of practical, easier, flavor, taste, whatever. So protein very specifically Whole Food. Muscle growth, Whole Food. There are other use cases for other supplements and things that other strategies, but that is our answer. And I think that the that paper you're referring to showed the same thing. Yeah, I was kind of, I was a little shocked to be honest because protein was equated, calories were equated and they were training and it's the people eating the whole eggs had increases. I guess it was slight in muscle mass. What is strength? Strength also, right? Yeah, but you would anticipate it to be slight. How much of a benefit would a couple of eggs yolks a day plausibly give a healthy person? It shouldn't be much. Had those data come back and it was more than that, I would have been like, I don't know about that. Well, it's a little interesting because you always think about, well, Lucy is the major signal for protein synthesis, muscle protein synthesis. And you would think, well, if it's the Lucy and the egg white powder, it should be, why is there, why is there difference, right? I mean, well, again, this is what like, I just actually funny because when the reviewers came back, it was like, I knew it was going to happen. Everybody knew. And it was that, right? And you're just like, okay, how? We're like, why don't we don't have this? And so you just start making, I get as you mentioned, colonel, and you start making, like, well, plausible this, and then you make, plausible that, and then plausible that, and then plausible that. When you're trying to roll this, there's also some omega-3s in eggs, and you might think, well, the cell membranes, and not maybe the transporters are getting more Lucy-nin who knows. Oh, no, it's right. But I personally, you know, I don't like protein powders, deonist, and it's a processed food. I mean, you look at protein powders, and it's like, never just protein. And so I have every reason to be motivated to eat my turkey burger, my homemade turkey burger. Yeah. You know, versus the protein powder, but I get it. I get, like, I have these like pre-made homemade turkey burgers, you know, they're, they're food, food prepped, and they're there ready to just microwave. I'm not scared of microwave. So easy for me to do, but there's a lot of people that it's like, they're not going to cook something. If they don't meal prep. Totally. Then it's, it's the go-to, right? You know, going, I don't like protein bars. Same thing where it's like, it's processed. It's all, it's all this stuff. Like, you know, so I kind of liked the, um, little extra motivation to say, yeah, go for the whole food. Yeah. Go for the whole food. You know, I have had a love hate relationship with those things as well. Spent many decades, like smashing many scoops of protein powder a day, and then probably went a decade or more with like almost no protein powder. Now I'm back on a little bit more for for other reasons, like they're getting better with some of those things. But if you're asking me what I'd rather do, have a candy bar or have like a piece of whole food, I'm always going to take the whole food for, for, preference, just flavor preferences. Like, I like eating food more than I like supplements. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. Now, back to the episode. So we talked a lot about, uh, macronutrients. I think there was, you know, I didn't know if there was going back to the fat, just before we move on to the macronutrients. Is there, is there really an optimal fat ratio or timing, I mean, or is it mostly come down to if they perform better, or if they, if that's what they want? Are do you think that it's something that's just not as important as? Carmel, I'll answer the two ways. I'll be short. I actually think it's an interesting question. I think people spend a lot of time studying. I'm open to the possibility that there is way more important in different timing scenarios than we think, but that people just have not done that work. So that's an open-ended question that's never been there. The other way I'll say it is, because of that, I guess, yeah, like I just don't feel like at this point we have any compelling reason to think that it is a critical thing to pay attention to in terms of timing and stuff relative. If you just think about plausibly what these different fueling sources are intending to do, it makes sense that fat is probably the thing you should be third concerned about. You have backup stores of it already. It can be mobilized when you ingest it or you're using on a dodgenous fat. It still happens at roughly the same rate. So on and so forth. So with all that, I think that's our answer, but I'm open. I'm open to other things. What about, you mentioned earlier that you're mostly concerned if people aren't getting enough fat. I'd love to you to explain to people why that is. But also, I'm interested in your thoughts about the quality of fat or some fats better than others. Do some fats hinder performance? Yeah, this is actually a whole category of questions that are super interesting. We grew up in the same nutritional generation. Low fat, low fat, low fat, and then we saw those consequences. Okay, if you are really low fat for a long time, there are a cataclysm of problems that can happen with that, especially if you're combining that on top of hypoclorism. And your conditions, sleep disruptions probably long-term health disruptions in many areas. It's going to be a huge issue. What does low mean? I don't think we have a great definitive number on that, but if it's less than 10% of your calories, again, combined with hypocloric for a long period of time, then you're probably running into all kinds of issues from cell membrane. You don't have the basic building blocks to keep cells together. To the other ones, endocrine health, organ health, a ton transport or health storage health, like it has so many rules in our body. So you don't want to, you want to stay away from those things. Now, pass that terms of fat quality. Boy, how inflamed, your audience is probably a little bit better, but how mad do you want the internet to get mad at these following statements? Right. The truth is all that matters to me. So I can't go with matters to you. You've been clearing your career of how you approach things, but there's just not a lot of compelling evidence that whole fat in itself can be disregarded as always healthy or always bad. Right. So animal fat, vegetable fats, seed oils, right? Well, throughout there, hmm, when managed under all proper situations, we're okay here. Like we're really just okay. You're fine. We're going to handle these things, but you go exaggerating any one of those areas. You're going to run into problems. Right. So if you're eating copious amounts of saturated fat and combining that with low physical activity, hyper, hyperclorism, you're going to have problems. Same thing with seed oils. Right. You're cooking. You process them. You do all those things. You combine, you're going to run into problems there too. So what does a quality fat mean? I always default back to the same thing. I don't want to eat anything that's processed. I don't care. Animal plant, the U-picket. I'm trying to eat whole food versions of everything. And that is true for my carbohydrates, my proteins and my fats. So we don't approach the fats that differently. So I don't deal with it that much because rarely are we going out of a way to give people process foods. Process fats included. So when we're eating for most of our people, they eat animal and I'm a source of it. So we're going to be getting fats from animals in a reasonable amount. We're paying attention to those other factors, vegetables, protein, Whole Foods. So because of that, animal fat doesn't come in huge quantities. We don't have the physical space. It comes in a normal amount and we're okay. At the same time, we're not having to be so guarded against seed oils. Because we're not consuming most foods that come with seed oils. We don't have to worry about that. Right. It's the company. It's the company. Like, this is things are not critically. Some people get so fired up about it. What about olive oil? Great. Albicado oil. Albicado is nuts. I mean, when we make it three fatty acids fish, like, if it's in a whole food, we're going to, like, we have no issue with it. Right? You have to be little bit careful with the exogenous oils, just because of as you're wearing a claw, it can take just to get really, really high there. But do we have our people eat nuts? Yeah, Albicado. Yes. Like, all of the above, whole foods are almost always going to be on our list. You just be careful with additives. You put something in an oil and locality and the sunlight, you know, fill in the blank there. Same thing with nuts. Right? Those can come in locality as well. So we always try to get those things in the appropriate standards and then we don't have any issues past that. So I don't know how much we've successfully dodged or didn't dodge any landlines on that one. But, man, I just don't have a lot of aptitude for the, I mean, we haven't just been hours talking about it because there's so much new ones. You know, that would be a whole other. Thank you. A whole other episode. Thank you for saying that, rather than sort of not to say it. That's one kind way to put it. But my goodness, people. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of emotions involved in nutrition for sure. That was a great way to put it. There's a lot of emotions involved. So micro nutrients, this is an area that, as you know, I'm very passionate about and I think it's a good segue into some supplements that I'm interested in talking about. But, you know, exercise doesn't increase requirements for several micro nutrients. How do you, how do you approach that so that people are more intentional about their diet and trying to get some of those. Maybe talk about some of those micro nutrients and then, yeah, and how. So micro nutrients, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals. If you're doing your job with nutrition, those things are mostly taken care of. If you're eating the variety of the foods, the type of foods that we've been talking about, the big basic stuff, you're in a really good spot. Now, do we need to go on top of those things and supplement particular vitamins, minerals, nutrients? Context dependant here. Magnizium is one that jumps off, of course, as the one where if our food quality sources were, I don't want to say how they used to be or what we would like them to be. And we had adequate amounts of those in our food, then we would literally just not have to worry about supplements at all. But that's not always the case. So because of that, you can look and you'll see all kinds of numbers about things like magnetism deficiencies, whether that's clinical deficient subclinical or dissuboptimal. I don't know. Some papers, 40% of people, some people, 60%, like those numbers can get really, really high. When you look at athletes because of chloric expenditure and because of sweat and because of how much tissue breakdown that's happening through, then the needs are even higher with them. So I would say magnesium is a supplement. It comes in probably 90% of the people we work with. It's really, really, really common for us to add magnesium is a supplement. We try to add higher magnesium by available foods more. That is our starting place, but we're probably going to add supplements on top of that in addition because it's just hard to get there. You got to be careful with this a little bit though because if you were to look at your magnesium levels in a like a classic blood draw, that's a terrible place to look. The magnesium that comes on your blood work that you get is not an indicative of all of what's actually happening in your body. The vast majority of it's going to be stored in bone anyways and it's super transient. Now there's good information you can get there and there's other ways you can look at it. Markers of it, but I always like to flag that because people get really freaked out. They go in for blood work for whatever reason. They see that and they're like, oh, I'm super high. I don't need it. I could not. Like that's not a good way to interpret your overall magnesium status. Let me talk more about that. But in general, because of those things, we end up adding magnesium is one of our top line micronutrients to pay attention to. So I'll go on for more, but I'll stop on magnesium if you talk more about it. Yeah, no, it's it's I know your fan. Yeah, for sure. I'm glad you mentioned the plasma levels magnesium, which is mostly what's being measured in standard test, I guess. You would get from like a routine physical or something like that. Yeah, you pull it out from your bones and really it's kind of like this, your bones are this reservoir. But the time someone reaches older age, like 50% of their magnesium has been taken out of their bones. It's incredible and it plays a role in osteoporosis. A huge rule. But people aren't really focused on that as much. Yeah, so about if it have the country isn't, as you mentioned, depends on the paper that you're reading and what's being defined as magnesium insufficiency. Most of the time it's looking at what the RDA is. Yeah. So for women, it's about 320 milligrams per day for men, about 420 milligrams per day. And so people aren't meeting that requirement. So they're considered to be getting insufficient magnesium. And so you're talking about half the country, basically. So you've got to want into chance of whatever athlete that walks into your door. There might be not getting enough, right? So that's kind of, I would say that it's good insurance. But then as you mentioned, you know, these athletes are sweating magnesium, they're breaking down tissue, they're, you know, urinating more. I mean, there's lots of like it's coming out. It's coming out. And so they can require up to 10 to 20% more than the RDA. And so if you're not even meeting that RDA, it makes sense to supplement. Now I've heard you talk about different magnesium supplements like magnesium citrate, being one that is often preferred for recovery. Well, magnesium source is different. Back when we were kids, you had to be really on top of this because of ineffective forms of magnesium and because of gidistress, most supplement companies have cleaned that up. So now you can look at, uh, this glycinated is a really common one. That is fine. Citrate's fine. Obviously three nights become more popular now. Any of those are generally okay, or it's the old forms, the oxidates, the different ones like that that you like really had to be careful of. But you're generally okay there. They've also, in large part, uh, dose these things so that gidistress is not huge anymore. So this is actually something we would we would pay a lot of attention to way back in the day. But for the most part, you're okay as long as your dose is reasonable. If it is giving you problems, then you can go down a little bit or you can try different form. But we haven't seen, uh, did huge differences between various forms. Um, they're all basically getting to the same spot. It's like most of our people coming in, the closest accuracy you can look at is like it's not uncommon for us to see people below 250 in terms of their intake. So like you said 3, 2, 1, 400, like, and that's not an athlete. That's that's the standard person. Athletes can be four. Sure. 100% more. Yeah. So we actually if generally found our non-athlete are normal people population, it's generally higher with magnesium intake. Our athletes tend to be lower. Um, that's a little bit of, well, that's a lot of selection bias. Someone's coming into work with me. They're probably pretty health conscious. They're eating more meat, less greens. The athletes are not like always health conscious. So it's a little section of my say a bit like really common. I'm like so much so to be candid. I barely look at it anymore because I'm like, I just know. Like I assume you're going to be low until you prove otherwise. But yeah, the forms of it. Um, yeah. What kind of dose do you typically and and have you noticed, um, it affects performance or do you already are they are de supplementing with it? It's not really. No, most aren't actually surprising enough. Most are not taking with it. Standard dose juice. If you look at the big high quality brands, 150, 200, something like that in that range, right? That's going to usually take a scoop of scoop and a half if it's a powdered three pills, capsid, it's capsule like something like that. So those would be sort of our starter dosages. We have gone double that plenty of times. Again, context, we deal with many 300 plus pound people. So when we're doubling it, I'm not doubling it for the 100 and you know, something, nothing pound, uh, individual. So we can get high there. The only real drawback in general, as you know, when you start tinkering with vitamins, you have a range of like, okay, not a big deal to like really big deal. Final chemicals, antioxidants, send there, minerals are different. You got to be careful with rocks, right? Magnetism, those are pretty nerd. It's okay. You start tinkering with iron. You got to really be paying attention. You start tinkering with other rocks. You got to really understand that magnesium seems to be like pretty okay. Like the worst thing we're going to deal with is GI distress. And as I talked about like most people are okay now, it's not a big deal. So I'm not super concerned with going a little bit aggressive with magnesium because of that. Because we also are asking so much other men in other areas of performance or movement, it's one I'm saying like don't worry. Just a ton about the dose of GI on that one. If you're a little bit high, you want to go a little more aggressive. I'm fine at that. We will see some people bit respond very well in terms of physical recovery. Totally subjective. They feel like their legs are not a sore anymore or they're not getting as much. I don't know if that's actually happening totally honestly. I don't know. We will see pretty pronounced improvements in a bunch of sleep metrics, that seems to be in that's all very objective. Our safe technology is incredibly advanced that we use. It's not just a consumer wearable. So we have a ton of metrics we can look at there. And that one seems to be a really clear jumping off point. And it doesn't seem to matter which form we use. That was my next question. Yeah. Doesn't seem to be surprised. No. There's been actually probably two or three papers in the last six months on three and eight specifically. We're finally starting to get human trials. Need more work. But we haven't noticed a big difference between forms. Most people are on three and eight right now. But not a big deal for us. What about, so omega threes. And I do want to talk about we're going to get into recovery and supplements for performance as well. But omega threes is another one. I personally, as you probably know, think that most people are not getting enough omega threes. In fact, if you look at data on omega threes index, people are mostly not. They're in the low range. And there's a lot of longevity reasons. And a cardiovascular health information, why getting up to a higher omega threes index would be ideal. And most people, there's been studies showing that taking around 1.5 to 2 grams a day. We'll get you there from out 4% omega threes index, which is low to an 8% omega threes index. Hi. And how do you approach omega threes from performance perspective? Have you seen the data on omega index and professional athletes? No. I think the total quote me here, but you know, make the point. I think that the NBA data was like 50% or below five. It's still low five. Yeah, it's just like very low. Stunningly low. No, nobody is at 15. Like it's just like you just don't get enough. The numbers might even higher. It's outrageous. So yeah, magnesium is a pretty big staple. And unless we have strong contraindication, pretty much everyone's going to be getting omega threes as well. I know, again, another like we'll throw it out there. Yes, I saw the aphib paper, like everybody is aware of the omega threes and heart flutter, heart palpitations. Great. Um, if you are a cardiologist, you can treat that however you'd like. If you're concerned about work with your cardiologist, do whatever you want. But outside of that, there's so much other information, so much benefit. So many rational reasons for omega threes that we use it very consistently. We always start food first, blah, blah, blah, all the things. But because of that, I'm moderate to low dose of omega threes. Yeah, I'm safe place to go. Yeah, on the on the aphib thing, um, there's, you know, it seems to be at a foreground, super high dose range, foregrounds, ethylastore form. Yeah. And also the recent paper that came out the, it was a correlation paper. It wasn't a wrong way to control. Bill Harris has had publishing and response to that. It was a like terrible statistics and all this stuff done. So anyways, you see the attitude for that. By the way, yeah, it was like extremely low. Like not take it. Yeah, no, it's it's not so I think it was just creating a lot of anxiety. You know, no, no, of course, there's people that maybe have a family history or prone, maybe shouldn't be taking five grams of ethylastore, you know, high vissita, whatever, a day. But um, and I got torched for that recently. Really. Yeah, I was talking about somewhere people flew off the hand. Oh my god, like you have to pay attention past line, the top line. You do. And the absolute effect is like again, it's like one of those things where you're going to have to spend a little bit of time talking about all the nuance to like really convey everything. You can't just do a little like, you know, sound bite. It's just not people are going to have their emotional response and that's that. There's also like just the humans are weird. You can't pick a exercise, a supplement and nutrition thing that we've ever done, where somebody of the seven billion of us won't throw their hand up a go. Oh, I did that. And I had this crazy negative response. Right. Like, yeah. Yes. Like totally happens. And I believe you. I trust you. I can't explain it. Right. Physiology is wild. There's new ones here. People respond differently. Not to mention that maybe it was something else. I mean, like you never really know, but totally have you. So I had a young professor on the podcast, Chris McLory, and he's been doing some pretty pioneering and interesting work. He trained with a couple that couple of the big guys, Stu Phillips is one he trained with. But he does work on on high dose omega 3 and disuse atrophy. And he's done a couple of randomized control trials showing has to be preloading because it's completely independent of the inflammatory effects and time inflammatory effects of omega 3. Right. Where it seems to be, you have to like get these people on omega 3 for at least a month. Right. They're doing like four or five weeks before the track, before before the trial starts. So they have to be loaded up. That's how long it takes to lay in some memories. And it's accumulating in their cell membranes and their muscle and people then have a disuse event. So he'll cast or whatever on them. And it cuts disuse after for you like in half. And he's like, you know, trying to figure out what's going on. But it appears to be sensitizing muscle to amino acids. So it's almost like what exercise is doing. Yeah. So which is of course when you're having a disuse event, you're not exercising. And so but anyways, it's something interesting I kind of want to throw out there and get on your radar because it's kind of in your world. And yeah, look, when you'll see a cornacopia of things like this. When you take people, I was soon, I don't know his population database in that trial, but I would assume it's fairly inactive on healthy people. Women, young women. Okay. Only reason I'm saying that is you just seems to see these type of crazy things happen. When you go from like somewhat suboptimal to poor health and you just get them back to baseline. Wild stuff just starts happening like this. I have no idea we could probably get a whiteboard out and start tossing up mechanisms to figure out what's positive happening there. But you could inferred as, okay, a healthier cell membrane probably then can do a bunch of things that it was trying to do. But what wasn't healthy enough to do, however we want to turn healthy. And now what can could be a reactionary response? Could be all these things? Yeah, awesome. That is quite different than going from already pretty healthy. There. So I would imagine that case if you take people who are already pretty healthy to the same thing, you wouldn't see as much a response. But that goes the point of saying, okay, now given the fact that most people are not already pretty healthy. These were healthy women. I think I think that generally speaking healthy, so we're looking at the effects of omega 3. They weren't high. They didn't have high levels of omega 3. Right. So the idea is, you take someone that's already eating fish, they're supplementary with omega 3, they're exercising whatever. So you put them in the disuse event, whether if not moving a limb for four weeks or whatever. And healthy or not, they're going to lose muscle mass. So it's kind of interesting that you take some like omega 3s which are known to affect transporters, receptors, anything embedded in the cell membrane and makes it better. It means making it functional. So when you have a deficiency of it, they're not as optimal. So it's kind of interesting because it kind of for... Yeah, for me it's not just important for elderly people and perhaps a surgery or an event, a disuse event you can plan for. But I think just injury, like in general, having these omega 3s in our cell membranes built up to that level already would be important. But also, what about recovery? Have you looked at omega 3s in recovery? At all. Not in my lab ever. Yeah, I don't think... I don't think I've spent a ton of time outside of the obnoxious again going from deficient super low just to back to a standard number going from good to high. No, I don't think I have anything super interesting to say on that stuff. Well, to be determined some other time, I do want to get into some of these performance enhancers and this is kind of, you know, it's an area that I'm interested in myself. As we were chatting earlier off camera, I had recently had Darren Kando on the podcast and he's been a lot of research in the creatine world. So I'm kind of curious. I take creatine now. But I wanted to ask you about the top sort of performance enhancing supplements and then we can kind of get into some of those, just kind of what your thoughts. I'm sure creatine's at the top of the list. Yeah, of course. How's that not going to be on the top of everyone's one? The way that we would think about supplements in general is number one, remove, reduce, try to eliminate any physiological insufficiency. Whether that is coming because of chlorocrystription. So we have dealt with a lot of people whether this is again as our athletes or non-athletes where chlorocrystription is a thing. And I'm saying that because that's why supplements tend to be helpful. I would prefer you to get all your stuff from food. But when food is limited for a bunch of different reasons, now we can use supplements to backfill vitamins, nutrients, minerals, and a much other stuff. That is our top line performance enhancement. When your physiology is in a healthier spot, it will perform better. So we can get into betaalanine and other things for sure. But that's really important for me to state because that is where we have actually seen by far the most enhancements in performance and recovery and sleep and cognitive function. You name it. It's by just making sure we call them performance anchors. You don't have any anchor behind you. Nothing's just like dragging your physiology down. We get that thing solved, get it up back to normal. And then for the most part, I want to step away. I want to let your physiology just run how it wants to run. But if we have big holes, we plug them first. Whether you want to pick your metric is again recovery, muscle growth, testosterone levels, like pick your thing that's going to get your brain most excited. That's where we see the most impact, like by a landslide. If your house is cleaned up there, now we can get into creatine, betaalanines. You can get into fatigue blockers. You can get an stimulants. You can do it in a whole bunch of things like that. Adaptogens is a whole host of things we can cover there. But that part of the equation is where you will most all of you will most likely see your biggest benefits. Right. So pretty much the things we've been talking about. You want to make sure you're optimizing your diet, making sure you're getting your micronutrients and magnesium, vitamin D. I'm sure. Yeah, we do this actually quite differently. We spend a lot of time on a bunch of biomarkers. So we take a ton of blood, a ton of urine, stool, and saliva, and we get really precise with vitamin mineral nutrient recommendations. I wait, we target getting into that on the podcast without exact examples. But that's where we get. So yeah, we can start off with general recommendations. But being precise to physiology, we're able to paint pretty good molecular portraits of people and figure out what's happening with them over time and then get really specific with recommendations. Pass that then is when we get in like our direct performance answer. So that's how we handle that equation. Yes, some people are really into measuring and trying to to, you know, quantify their deficiencies and their efficiencies and see what's best. But not everyone, just not everyone's going to do that. Right. So some people, you kind of put them in that in that bucket of, okay. Yep. If you're sent to the country, it's not getting enough magnesium. Yes, people, not any, you know, omega-3s, the vitamin D again, you know, more than half the countries, not getting enough because we're spending all over time indoors. And so you kind of, you kind of go for the the biggest ones that you're like, probably going to help. Right. Yep. It's always better to measure things, though, right, especially with things like vitamin D, where you can measure it. It's a simple test and most doctors will do it. Yep. And like a vitamin D is a good example of. It's also one where I feel pretty good with you just taking vitamin D without a test. I trip in if you just like, I want to take vitamin D. All right. I'm probably cool. Like, what's the worst is going to happen? Not much. Very limited downside. Strong likely, hood your low. Even if you're not low, very little harm here. So there's most of the things we've talked about. You don't need any test at all to go do. Some things I'm going to say, like, we want to see actual markers on this before we start tinkering with that. We consider like minerals in particular. Be really careful of you have big downsides in them. But yes, most people, the big stuff we're going to put you in a better spot. And that's what the pay attention to. So the minerals that are sort of not as risky would be the magnesium. Now, iron you said iron is something that probably more focused on with male, sorry, females that are menstruating, right? Yeah, premenopausal females. Yep. A lot of them can become low iron. And in red, like, reds a really common thing to pay attention to. So this is a concern you have with relative energy deficiency. Right? So if you're not only combining being female as well as a lot of cloric expenditure and calories are moderate to low, then we have all kinds of problems we have to pay attention to there. So there's this a whole bunch of other factors that go into that. Iron gets really complicated really fast. So we can come back that one on a different day. But don't you also, like, as an athlete, you're kind of like you're losing your, you know, tear down like red blood cells are being torn down and so you're probably losing even more iron. No, okay. So there is a thing that we will talk about for many decades now, called heel strike comoluses. This is exactly what it sounds like. If you run a lot and your feet smash the ground, when your blood is going past the bottom of your foot, just normal blood, moving through your body, and that blood is between your foot and the ground and then you smash it, you will smash your blood cells. We see this on our combat athletes, right? So you have physical things hitting your body. You will physically smash those red blood cells. You will smash that iron. And so yeah, it's not just menstruation. It's not just breaking down a tissue. You will actually physically smash around red blood cells. So it is a huge concern for not just females, but young old. Like it's a whole thing. Iron is, but it's also insanely related to sleep quality. So you will see numbers go all over the board when you are having twin contractors that night because you're having mild sleep out now or other disturbances. So the numbers that you're paying attention to there, they really throw people for a loop when they're blood work. So you got to be really careful and paying attention to that. And as I said, that's not an innocuous supplement. You can't just smash it and just be like, oh, just take some more. Not a good idea at all. So, so you definitely want to measure your iron, your ferretine, like what are the main things? Flaunch ones. Yeah, I would say that there's probably at least seven markers that we would pay attention to before really truly understanding what's happening with your overall iron status. Everything from hematocrit to hemoglobin, ferretine, of course. But then you have even like red blood cell magnesium concentrations. And maybe probably the closer to 10, actually, I would pay attention to. Mean corpuscular volume. There's a bunch of different things that we would look at. So yeah, we'll come back to that one just because I'm I'm stopping myself from going. It's going to be a 40 minute. God, part, right now. Okay. Because the reason why I don't want to do right now is you can't get your toes deep in this without just making more confusion than not. Yeah, God, it's one of, okay. Well, you mentioned stimulants, cognitive enhancers and that's something I'm interested in starting with, of course, caffeine. Sure. And that's probably one of the most widely used stimulants globally. And I'm sort of there's I've come across a few studies where caffeine, if used before exercise, seem to enhance fat burning. Like pretty significant, you know. And now this is not, and some of that's already an athlete in doing long amounts of endurance exercise is not going to make a difference. But someone like myself, I'm running like a 30 minute, doing 30 minute run or I'm doing a 20 minute hit. I don't know. This might make a little bit more of a meaningful difference to me. I would, I would be skeptical on that one. The caffeine works. No question about it. It works as an organic benefit. You will perform oftentimes better. That's it. So there you go, right? Like if you burn more calories, train harder, what faster? Yeah. Now, will it have a leipolitic effect? Yeah, you take it right now. You will see free fatty acids go up in your blood. That will happen. You don't do anything with it. There will be restored and placed right back in their position. So if you look at the research on even fat burners, you're not going to really significantly aid in fat loss, right? Stimulants, caffeine, combinations of them. They are in acute effect. If they are used, then to train better, more frequently, more motivation, work harder, great. Sometimes they have an appetite suppressant effect as well. But that's how they're getting to any substantive fat loss rather than the actual mechanism itself. Absolutely. Yeah. So it's essentially just you're working harder, kind of like with creatine, right? You're more volume training, total growing better. And so whatever the reason motivation, what about the dose of the caffeine? Is that, yeah, I mean, typical dose was you're going to look at something like most is 150 to 400 milligrams. Iish on those things. We way back in the day, people were tinkering with like 10 grams per kilogram. Millagraph per kilogram. So you're getting really high dosages and you're like, you're in these trials and you're just sitting there and you're like, your head is going to explode. Like these numbers are outrageous. 4 to 5 is like more of a standard. When now, which is going to equate to that, you know, like 2, 300, 400 total milligrams depending on your body size. You start crossing past like 500 milligrams caffeine and like you might have an existential event. Like you're going to be like, what is happening? And I just remember saying there with other students and stuff just being like, I just want this to be over with. You just do not feel good at those high dosages at all. Yeah. So the downsides would be at a higher dose or I guess depending depending on the person some people are presensitive. But how can someone know if they're, it's actually affecting their performance. Like, okay. So that's actually there's there's a lot of conflicting research as well on adaptation. So there used to be this idea that you want to desensitize yourself to caffeine. So even if you're a normal habitual caffeine user, let's just say an average dose of caffeine and say a coffee or an espresso is 200 milligrams, right? Like whatever t is less and you get the idea. So if you say you do two those a day and you're like a three to 400 milligrams per day user, you would come off of it entirely for a day or five days or something like that and then you would reintroduce it and you would have this like super response. You will feel that. But the question was, is that actually then doing anything for performance? People would do this in like the power lifting away lifting worlds, any even in the endurance worlds for a long time. But there's more recent data that suggests that it probably doesn't matter. There doesn't seem to be a correlation well, it doesn't seem to be a hundred percent crossover between your perception, your personal stimulation of it and the performance benefits. Those seem to be disentangled quite a bit. So even if you're normally at 400 milligrams a day and then you take your normal 400 milligrams dose and you don't feel anything different, you might still have those performance benefits. You don't have to feel like you're you know like super stimulated to get that thing. So that those data have changed over the years. It's gone back and forth. This has to be novel or it looks like doesn't really matter that much. So that game of like do you run a resensitizer, desensitizer yourself? I leave it up to people. Whatever you want to do, generally we don't worry about it. But it seems to be the performance benefit. So how would you know if your performance is getting better? Do you have to have some objective marker of performance like are you lifting, are you running like what are you doing? Are you are you either going more? Well back, the two ways we would typically do this in the lab is like a time trial, right, or maximum performance. So you can play the game. So you can say we're going to lock this in at 30 minutes and say how much work can you get done in 30 minutes? Oh you got more work done this time than you did without the caffeine. Or the opposite. We're going to run a 5k and does your time get better. Like those are the kind of like the two ways to pay attention to it. And you'll generally see benefit in both of those scenarios. What about, um, what about music as a performance enhancer? Yep, you'll see that. Like pretty consistently. You'll see that actually even with muscle growth. So intentional playing of a music generally will give you a small benefit in muscle growth. Mechanism there being obvious. Like probably are happier. You're probably training more. Probably training harder. The type of music doesn't seem to matter. That much seems to be pretty independent. What are you everyone like you want? Death metal? Cool. You want to play jazz? Cool. Really? It doesn't seem to matter. I'm not to doesn't have to be. The only thing you'll kind of see here is tempo. Generally higher tempo better. Like you don't want to be down, slow. I don't know like what those beats would be actually. But anyways, past higher tempo stuff would generally be like a we actually ran a study in my lab years ago. Where we had professional drummers come in. This is totally unrelated. But we ran a bunch of metabolic equivalents. Like we have put on a metabolic cart. I looked at VO2 Max during drumming. I've a bunch of different like songs things like that. I looked at the clerk expenditure. But yeah, nonetheless, music pretty good idea for most people. So I first talked a little bit about you and Andrew Hubertman talked about Rodeolo Rosedea. Yeah. And I've been sort of interested in this as a fatigue, reducer, cognitive enhancer. I'm kind of interested. How does it work? How does it compare to caffeine, you know, dose? All those things. Yeah, Rodeolo has been around for a long time. I've probably been using it. I don't know. At least a decade or more. It was always hard to get and you were like scared of where you're going to get it from kind of thing. You really know. Now we have enough data on it. There's quality providers and SF certified places and such. More research is coming out muscle endurance in terms of how many repetitions can you do of 30 reps versus 35 reps? Like that kind of muscle endurance. And then we're seeing benefits. Otherwise Andrew talks a lot about he feels cognitive stuff from it. I don't really personally there. But to each their own. How is it working? Nobody knows. We don't really have outside of like stuff in yeast and I think there's just some fruit fly data. There's not a lot of mechanism here. I could guess. I could spout out in a adaptogen. What is it? Well, polyphenol. What is it? We both. Right. So you have both of those effects. But the only little bit of mechanism data is maybe cortisol. Right. Maybe something HPA access, maybe dopamine, maybe serotonin like something's happening here. What you will generally see is if you look at markers like heart rate variability. What will often happen with rodeola is the same dose of high intensity exercise. When you use rodeola will not drive HRV as much. That's why we say it's like an adaptogen. That's why it mitigates the stress response. I have not seen any evidence that rodeola would do something like improve baseline resting HRV over time. So it's not like a recovery agent. But it seems to make harder higher intensity exposure things, not as damaging. Without compromising performance. Right. Okay. So it's not compromising adaptations. Correct. In fact, the some data like I've indicated that, the most of the research suggests actual performance and enhancements from it. We're just now with the cortisol and stuff we're speculating. Because at some point if you actually block cortisol response, then you actually inhibit stimuli. Right. Which you don't want. So our hands are up in the air. I haven't seen anybody really do a lot of human trials and figuring out definitive mechanisms. It's hard to get funding for these sort of things. That too. But yeah. What dose do you need to get the performance enhancement? Is it like dependent on your body weight? Always. Right. But most products are going to be something like 150 or so is like a reasonable starting point. I haven't really seen like we've tinkered with really high ones. There's some of some papers. I think it's done like 800 milligrams. Like weigh up there. All at once. Like one dose. Yeah. I'm not good at lighting and so we haven't tried that too. Does it make? Does it have a caffeine effect or is it totally different? No, no, no. So you don't feel like no. Yeah. No great question. It's not a, yeah, not not stimulated like that. We actually have a scene like changes in sleep or anything like that. I will always take it in the morning personally. If I'm going to use it at all, we generally come in the morning just in case. But no, not stimulated. That's it. It's generally the good thing to think about it is you take it. If I already put you in a placebo controlled right now and gave it to you, you wouldn't know. I don't think you feel like on it. If I gave you beta-alanine and if I gave you caffeine or you'd be like, well, you know there. But we could blind you to wrote it almost really and you wouldn't know it. And what about in terms of like you said you said taking the morning just to be safe, but like if you're wanting a performance enhancement, you can take it a night. No problem. So it's like it's like something that's in your system for a certain amount of time. It doesn't have to be like right before you work out. Yeah, we will use it chronically. Okay. Yeah, but again, we're speculating here because we don't know where we have mechanism. We understand at least roughly how a beta-alanine or sodium-bicarbonate are working or caffeine. I don't actually know. So I should back up. I don't know. I have to get a question. We are not super worried about it that you have a right before your work out. But I guess it's plausible that we should. But we're not. Yeah. Today we don't. Well, 150 milligrams. I guess I'm going to try that out and see. I kind of want a little performance enhancement in my, especially in my strength training. My CrossFit stuff. Yeah. I think that is a pretty good place where you would likely to see some benefit there. That would be a good place to try. Okay. You mentioned the beta-alanine, I want to get to that in a minute. But before it, because we're kind of talking about performance enhancement, there's this whole category of these blood flow enhancers. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And there's like the beetroot juice, beetroot extract. And then there's the citrillion, arginine. Yeah. So I'd heard of the beetroot juice and, you know, these nitric oxide beasters. But the citrillion, arginine, or something that I haven't really, I mean, arginine, I know about for blood pressure, but not for this performance enhancement. And so wondering, and Durans type of exercise or high-wrap type of exercise, I mean, is this something that actually can make a difference in someone that's already well-trained? Is it like not well-trained people? How much? Yeah. Talk about what it's doing. Sure. There's actually a lot of research, right? And Jones has done so much stuff here. He's done a ton of work on it. And there's a lot. Like you're talking about a solid decade or more in lots of populations, lots of different stuff. So it is really well-study. It's funny to bring it up because it gets no love. Like people don't talk about it. I'm much despite it's not a small amount of research here. If you want to especially stack up like rotiola, you have a mountain to go on with beer, reduce, and you have a pebble on rotiola. We like it. We use it a lot. We use a ton of different forms over the years. It's great because it is not a stimulant. So you can take it in the evenings, and it doesn't compromise sleep at all. We will use it a lot for our individuals who are either exercising a night or training multiple times for a day, and they're stimulants coming in but they still have high fatigue until they want to use it in the evening. So that is our common use case. You see it a lot in the endurance world, particularly the steady-state endurance world. So cycling, swimming, running, things like that. You're talking about nitric oxide. This is a vasodilator. You're going to open up blood flow. You will feel it. If I were to put you in that blind test right now and I gave you any of those forms you mentioned, you will be like, something just happened. There's no blinding to those studies. So this sounds like if it's increasing blood flow, I should make your cognitive new, make you cognitively more sharp as well. Yeah, well, yeah. You'll, I don't like that. We're talking beetroot juice or we're talking citrilling and arginine. You're going to have a same answer for basically all the above. There will be noticeable effects. There are differences between all three of those. If you were to take literally beetroot juice and concentrate it in like a three ounce shot, you could see the same stuff here. Most of the time with like citrilling and arginine, though, you're getting really high concentrations. I don't know typical dosage of those off thought my head to be honest, but what you're going to normally see there is a very pronounced stimulant effect. Like it's not going to be caffeine, but you're going to be like, especially citrilling. Like you're going to see that right now. You will see, if you go to the gym and you take any of those forms, particularly the arginines are falling out of favor. They're not as popular anymore for a host of reasons, but even the beetroot stuff, like you will see a pump, a physical pump, like you will see. I was reading about that. Yeah, yeah, that's not, let's not fake at all. What's better beetroot juice or beetroot extract? I mean, I typically go for the low sugar, which would be the extract. Yep. But does it matter? Does it matter? We use extract more. You could make a compelling argument, though, that juice is better. You could do that. So it kind of depends on multiple parts of that equation. We use the powder, though, for a bunch of different reasons. A lot of them are practical. A lot of them are travel related. Right? You don't want to take a whole bunch of juice with you and your plane and you're flying all around it for places and you're just like, all right, I can take the powder supplement. It lasts longer shelf stable. If we're talking about like antioxidant polyphenol properties, but we know we're losing them the powder. Like we're probably losing some of that relative to the juice. Okay. But then we're going to backfill that with whole foods and other things there. So lots of research on both of those. I would say a lot of people would say would prefer juice. I would think is a fair thing to say, but I'm not fully against powder. Well, if you're going for the powder, what kind of dose can you, do you have to take it, how have, have soon before exercise? Can you take it chronically? Is it going to stop working? Can I start taking it before my podcast and we like how does work? You can, if you put a scoop in there right now, you would know that you did it. There's no question. So you can take it, you're talking about five minutes to take effect. Like it happens fast, like really like like caffeine. Like you're going to have a pretty acute effect of it. And it will last, I think you can think of it like caffeine. It will last probably three hours. Yeah. Some people are going to metabolize a fast or some people are somewhere. So it is not a short lasting thing. It'll be there for quite some time. So if you're going to use a for performance benefits, whether it's in the podcast room or in the weight room or dealing with the assembly at your kid's school or whatever thing you got to get through, yeah, right before would be the time to go about it. We will sometimes use it hours before exercise. When we have high fatigue, high motivation issues, right? So you're like, you start having these associations like, let's say for example, we have somebody training like four clock after noon. And at two o'clock, this is when we start having problems with like, I'm going to train today, my non, or whatever. All right, let's give them a little hit right there. And we don't want to go to caffeine. We don't want to go to other stimons like that. So we'll simply use it as like an afternoon, pick me up, if you will, for even on an honor, exercising day. If we're trying, especially if we're trying to get caffeine out of somebody's equation or lower it in the afternoon. So use it. That is just simply like a, okay, motivation's back up. I'm feeling good again. And I'm ready to go. You'll feel it. Can you use it with caffeine? In other words, like, okay, so what are the downsides? I mean, it affects blood pressure, presumably, the right. I think I remember reading studies about that years ago on at least beat route. This is nitric oxide, right? Right. So this is your primary health concern is going to be anything related to blood pressure. Right. So you handle those equations. Our downside, GI, like GI distress is going to 100% be there with with beat route or with citreline. All the above, particularly the beat route. So the juice there. If you eat beats and you forget and then you go to the bathroom. Like, so like, that's the part of your like, oh, you like, you can freak people can freak out and they forget that they took her to the on a wire. So you can have things like that. But as long as you're not GI issues, I'm very minimal concerns outside of if you have a gen medical conditions that you gotta pay attention to. Do you have a preference to citreline versus beat route? We will beat route. Why? Yeah, generally we're going to be there. The issues issues is a strong word. The slight things we've had to consider with citreline is power. Like, it's just too powerful for some people. They're just way like, whoa, like, this is too much for me. I don't like it. I don't feel it. So you can titrate those dosages down. The other again issues around the world. It's used to strong. But the other like little bit of like, ah, we've had is, why can't I just get this out of close something closer to whole food? Okay. So if that is your preference, then we can go back up a little bit to beat or beat reduce. But that's not a strong argument. Yeah, what about just baking some beats? Would you get a similar effect or would it not be concentrated enough? Probably, like 15 years ago, I had a friend who, you know, actually you met before who did this and he would blend beats like in a blender. In a smoothie or something or like, you could call it a smoothie, but he would like juice it and blend it and he would do a combination. It was probably like 8 to 10 whole beats. He would consume pre workout and he did it about three times I think and two or the three times he's just threw up everywhere and then he's like red, but you can. It's a dosage issue, though. Like, right, will you get a small benefit? I can't, like, I've never personally felt like a blood flow benefit for meeting a bunch of beats personally. Some people say that they do, but you wouldn't get the dosage. That's why they're juice. That's why they're concentrated. Now, you said, Argentine is falling out of favor. Why, why is that? Okay. So like you're probably pretty aware of nitric oxide metabolism. You can't just consume nitric oxide. Nitrite nitrate like me to even it like you toast, right? So then the argument is, oh, come, come, you go back up the chain. Like can we go up to origin? Can we go back up the thing? So the first up on that train was Argentine and then the issue you're going to fall out there which is almost always the case with supplementation was bi availability. Like, how can we just get enough of it? And that one just seemed to fail. I'll just, it seemed to get better once we started going there. And then there's other concerns, cold source and things like that that started popping up that people were like, not super stoked about it. So, citrillene seems to be the better approach to that. Right now. That's the short bird. Okay. Got it. Yeah. The the Argentine is used for viral replication. And I think that was kind of an interesting, I mean, I've never tried, but I was reading a little bit about the cold sore things. I guess if someone has herpes, colds or whatever, that might flare them up or something, but I'm going to try the beetroot. It's totally worth it. I experimented with it like 10 years ago for blood pressure and I was giving it to my mom. But I just, I couldn't, at the time, I was, you know, more low carb and I couldn't find a quality sore. I'm sure now it's probably there's like great sources of it. But yeah, so now I think I'm going to, I'm going to go back, circle back and try it out again. I love how you experiment on your mom. That's great. I mean, I'm, you know, try to do, you can do. Yeah, I'm prejudicial. I don't, I don't, I don't like do all the crazy stuff. But I told you she's doing CrossFit now, which is like amazing CrossFit for seniors. It's fantastic. I love it's definitely a tone down from what I'm doing. But yeah, but you're getting jacked. I love it. Yeah, and confident, too, for sure. And I'm also interested in all this stuff to, you know, I'm going to kind of play around a little bit. You mentioned the beta alanine and, I don't know if sodium, by carbonate's it, but beta alanine, I'm sort of interested in. I've never really heard of it until I heard, you talk about it. I didn't know anything about the fatigue buffers. Yeah. What, what it's doing. So how does it work? Tell us a little bit about it. It's been around for a really long time. Really simple strategy with this one. So enzymes work in a certain pH range. Right. If you come to a citric inside of the muscle, we have a hard time running any metabolic process. A robotic anaerobic strength doesn't really matter, right? Contracting muscle power. We start running into a citric environment. We start running into problems. So enter then a whole cascade of supplements designed to buffer fatigue, which is a way to say, like, let's keep you within that citric range. Now you can do this by starting off more alkaline, or you can just do this by putting intermediators in there that say, like, we're just going to keep you within that certain range. So you don't get too high. Beta alanine was a great stop on that, because we're looking at interested in their car racing. That's what we're trying to do, right? So you're like, saying, hey, this is our limiting factor beta alanine being the amino acid limiting factor. So if we can give you more of that, you can build up more car racing than we can buffer or effectively. And it works. There's a good amount of research on it. It worked with the things that you would anticipate it working for. Doesn't do much for maximal strength. Doesn't do much for speed or power. Doesn't do a lot for long duration endurance. Again, you can see some positive benefits there. Where it mostly works are things of really high intensity. And by that, I mean cardiovascular intensity. Right. So high intensity of strength training, again, just not super relevant because you're doing two reps. Acidic prop is not the problem there. So beta alanine is something that you would take chronically. You will feel an acute effect certainly at some of a higher dose. But you need three to five weeks for this to build up intracellularly before it makes a difference. And so much like caffeine or creatine rather, unlike caffeine, this takes a while for you to dose it. So you can do a bunch of things to mitigate that. But you will see a pretty classic, across what would be a great example. Like you couldn't basically couldn't engineer a supplement better for acute or for cross-fit performance outside of beta alanine. And as I mentioned, it's been around a really long time. It's just in amino acid. It's not a stimulant. It won't affect energy. You can you can take it right now. And again, you wouldn't notice. You wouldn't be like, oh, I'm fired up and ready to go. You wouldn't feel anything different. But you would just feel the burn is not as bad as you're training. What would be the optimal dose? Man, I'm blanking on doses right now to be honest with you. Okay. So we can look that out. But I did read that there's some kind of tingling effects. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So can you mitigate that by, yeah. Back in the day, we would say like this is an Iacene dump. That's not seem to be the case. There's actually a couple of papers that came out. It seems to be something to do a sensory input. So there's some sort of sensory receptors that are being clicked on and tingled and it kind of feels like a fire. It feels like you're itching. Feels like you rolled around and grass a bunch, right? Don't tell anybody this. We would we would give people beta alanine a bunch like our friends as a joke. And they're like not paying attention. So you're like put some like we're younger. Because you're like sitting there doing work, whatever else. I just like start itching everywhere. You're like, what the? We would do this a bunch. I did this to my wife one time. Actually, she was like, what is going on? She's like something. Yeah. Yeah. You get it. But that's like a higher dose, right? Not even like a moderate dose. You'll feel that out. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Can you just can you you say it's a nice super fast? It'll be so it's really like not something you're going to continue feeling. Yeah. Once you're you can also just back those who down like you just go down a tiny bit and you'll find that level of like, okay, I feel fine. And as soon as you start training, it typically goes away. So 30, 45 minutes before or so you take it. You'll start feeling those like itchy kind of crawly feels a little bit. Generally, as soon as you start training, it goes away. If that's still bothering you, just lower the dosage. What we'll do a lot of the time because it's not an acute stimulant is we'll just put the dosage up throughout the day, half the morning, half the night. A couple of grams, the morning, a couple of grams, the night. That is a general place that will go. So like if the four grams is like killing you, we don't like it or three is better than again, split them up throughout the day and they won't have any effect. So we will do that. You will develop a little bit of a tolerance to that though. So this is one of the cases where we actually want to build that dose over time. So when we get within like eight weeks of competition, we will start strategically increasing that dosage to get that as high as we possibly can. Where other things we don't have to worry about dosage going up? What should you, is it like a cycling kind of thing where you want to cycle in? You don't have to cycle it because there's no feedback loop here. It's just going to mean a lesson. So there's no like creating like there's no you're not shutting down any endogenous process by doing it, but we will tend to bring it away just for if we don't have a particular purpose up, I mean we don't take them. For that purpose alone we're like, okay great, we finished, we competed, we did something, we're pulling it back down. So for the people who are not in competitive sports, we will tend to just use it when we have a bigger priority or we're training really hard. So we're using the six to ten weeks and then if you want to like come off of it, but you don't have to cycle it. We have some people that are on it permanently and they just don't come off of it. I haven't seen anything to suggest that you need to pull it away if you don't want. And it's pretty safe. He said it's been been well studied. Super well studied. I haven't seen outside of the acute tingling, I can't say if seen any like side effects that have been documented that are a problem. So again, it's a mental acid. It's a pretty straightforward. So anything else that we didn't talk about the creatine dose? I mean, yep, I mean typically, I mean like I said Darren Kando just was on the podcast and talked about typically for muscles like five grams, but yeah, reasons to go up for cognitive. Yeah, I mean Darren's published so much in this world. We don't use the five grams number at all for the most part as I've said a couple times now. It's because we deal with humans that are literally triple the size of each other. A point one gram per killer. But anyway, is what I think he said exactly right? What's translates to a lot of people is like three to five grams. Right. We probably spend more of our time as like seven and a half to 12 and a half grams. Most of the time, we'll go those three. No problem there. Like I'll go five. No issue there. You want to use five as a starting place. Awesome. Tight trade up from there. Really no downside of going higher. So we would like go quite a bit higher, quite often. The answer is actually done some stuff at 20 grams a day. Yeah. For years. So as long as you're not getting nauseous like the number one thing we get, matters is like I got nauseous. Okay, great. So if you're not getting that, we run that train pretty high pretty often. Your people get GI distress. Some people get the I don't. Yeah. Yeah. Any other supplementary symptoms? Quickly, I think it's probably worth sodium by carbon it. Yeah. Okay. Same idea. Different mechanisms, same idea as betaalanine. So sodium by carbon it, making yourself more alkaline. Right. That's all you're doing. So if you want, if you don't like betaalanine or don't want to use it or some like that, you can go the sodium by carbon around. That is that you can get that at the cheapest price possible baking soda. Right. You can literally do that. We have done that many, many, many times just take baking soda and put in water and drink it. Way again, many, many years ago, it's a little bit off-color, but when we would have to run these studies of sodium by carbon it, we would have to do it really close to the toilet because this will have a very pronounced acute GI effect on you. And so like there's many times of wheeling over carts and you have like an IV and somebody or something you're like, get em over to the toilet, not a good situation. So because of that, most people have modified the delivery mechanisms of sodium by carbon it, but it does work pretty well. If you're concerned about that, you're like that is least appealing thing I've ever heard in the podcast of my life. You can just use creams. Momentists make PR lotion. That's exactly what PR lotion is. It's just a sodium by carbonic cream. So this is local. So if you're using your arms you can put it on your arms and has nothing that you don't have to put it through your GI track and all you can put it on your quad or whatever you're doing. So that is the best work around that improves your high intensity performance. Yeah, sodium. You're also, you're putting sodium directly intracellular as well as it'll get into a get into blood flow. But this doesn't have to, this doesn't take weeks like beta allining. It's a due to effect. Yep. So you rub it on right before you take it right before 30 to 60 minutes before training would be what you're looking for. It takes some time to get in and get into tissue. But yeah, this is an acute effect. And this is definitely something I would generally only use on training days. We're beta allining you could take and probably should take on non-training days because it takes a while for that to storage to come up, creating the same thing. If you're going to use the sodium by carbonate or equivalent, this is only like a pre-workout strategy. I want to get into recovery and some other things. But Tarring, have you ever, yep, messed around with Tarring, comes to my mind. I've come across the literature. Also, my late mentor Bruce Aames called it a long-javity vitamin. So he was taking a gram a day and this was for long-javity reasons and there's a lot of evidence for longevity. But I remember when I was looking into it, I was finding a cross and performance stuff. It seemed a little mix. But I was kind of curious. We don't use it. No, okay. It's good for mitochondrial health. But again, more longevity, I think, then performance wise. The closest you'll see is this will come in a lot of pre-workout cocktails. So what do you think of those? Okay. I prefer people having least amount of artificial ingredients as possible. That's our default position. If you want to use a stimulant, we'd rather you use coffee, tea, so on and so forth. If you're going to use a pre-workout combination, the major downsides are we can't control those of individual ingredients. For most of our people, that's a problem. For me, as a scientist, I hate it. I want to know what we're dosing. We're going to run experiments. We're going to try things out. We have a pre-made cocktail. I don't have any influence on what we're tinkering with so when something I hate it. I'd like precision. I'd like detail. I don't like the fact that we have a whole bunch of things coming in that we don't know. I don't actually know what's in there. I don't know that they're dosed at that level. We don't have there's all these variables that we don't like. I'm also not ultra-concerned that if somebody really wants to have a fill in the blank drink before they train and that makes them train harder and better. All right, like we can live with that. I can handle that if that's your one thing we're dealing with. But if it's up to me, we're not going to use them. You'll never see me program mode ever. If someone already has it and they're going to fight against it, okay, I might let that slide, but it's never going to come out of my mouth. I don't like them because it might have a one or two compounds that I'm interested in, but then it has a whole host of things that I don't want. I can never find something that doesn't have something I don't want. Speaking of which, supplements that we don't want to take. I don't know if there's ones that actually inhibit performance, but I'm interested in the ones that are blunting adaptations. Maybe we can talk a little bit about. Are there ones that are actually you don't want to take for performance? Caffeine. If you go too high on caffeine, you'll actually see performance increments. Like endurance performance increments, way high. Like that stuff, like it would have been said earlier, eight to 10 grams per kilogram. You'll start to see performance come down. That's insane. I mean, as well. You have to be taking some kind of powder or something. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you'd be drinking like that. Okay. So high dose caffeine would be something that's going to impair performance. Of course, you could like some people live at that level, so that would be fun there. But yeah, that's one of them. I think where you're probably referring to is things like acupious and excessive amounts of supplemental antioxidants. Yeah. Anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatories. Absolutely. Um, lab-ousin is a graduate student. Did some of that original work on a sea of metafine and things like that. So I was around for a lot of those those programs. And then stuff came out on specifically things like vitamin C combined with vitamin E. Um, vitamin C in general, vitamin E, we want to default to food. If we can get it from there, we do. That's where we're looking for all of our of our nutrients. Clear evidence in my opinion at this point that anti-oxidant consumption from food has no detrimental effect on exercise adaptation. Eat your blueberries to your heart's content, right? Eat the cherries eat whatever you want. Never seen evidence suggest that will blunt performance. There is some evidence to suggest though when you take those as a supplement. Very again, the couple of studies that we're vitamin C vitamin E. But they're, are they always combined? Have you seen a vitamin C by itself, blunting like, and what dose? If you have, it's a great question. I know. I don't have anything. I've seen a lot of combat vitamin E is a very powerful and out of it. It's like getting the high burns. Yeah. So I'm always, you know, it's something I'm very interested in because there, there's definitely a good amount of evidence that taking vitamin C in the dose range above 250 milligrams a day can help prevent some upper respiratory tract infections, particularly in high volume training endurance athletes. Yeah. We use vitamin C very judiciously not to get us back there. But you start actually looking at iron. What it does when you co-enjust iron with vitamin C. If you're going to go after iron, you probably should bring vitamin C along. You want to bring in collagen, probably should bring in vitamin C. Super low or dosage, like 50-bage, right? Like way down. You want to actually start doing anything to prevent someone getting sick when they're on when they're traveling. Again, especially when they're traveling in a six to eight week hypercloric state. And they're going to be on a plane and then they're meeting greeting and they're fans. Okay, we're going to go certainly going to go for any kind of immune support that we can have. I'm not, I do not hesitate to go to a gram of vitamin C. Right. You can go way up there for three days, five days, seven days, two weeks, whatever the case is. Not super concerned about that. We're not going to live at that level. Like 500 milligrams of vitamin C is a very reasonable dose. Like what about? So do you think the timing of it? Like would you, let's say someone works out in the morning and they take your vitamin C like with dinner. What's actually, what do you think a half life is on 500 milligrams of caffeine? A lot of caffeine. A lot of caffeine. It's not very long. No, it's going to be super trained. It's like a couple hours in the plasma. Bring that because I don't know the answer to this. So really good question. Right. I don't know. I'm just, I'm, what I'm interested in is, okay. So you know a lot about adaptations in terms of muscle adaptations. There's the cardiovascular adaptations. There's neural adaptations. Right. That are happening in response, that are, as a consequence, to the inflammation and the oxidation that we are causing from exercise that are important in those adaptations. And so what you're wanting, you're not wanting to blunt those anti-oxidants and inflammatory signals that you're making. So here's, in the case, I'm trying to make. I don't think people should be supplementing with anything above the RDA for vitamin E. It's alpha to cipheral in general. Yeah. It's just, you don't need, you know, 400 I use of, of alpha to cipheral. But all these studies that are coupling vitamin C with the vitamin E, it's like, hmm, well, are we seeing this because the vitamin E was there? I think there was like one, maybe one study I recall. I have a topic page on vitamin C. I think it's on the topic page. And it was maybe 500, maybe it was a grant. I don't know. But I don't, I just, again, it's like, it's good to know because for one, I like to take high dose vitamin C when I've been exposed or when my son has been exposed. It helps me. And so it'd be nice to know for athletes as well. It's like, okay, can I take that, you know, high dose vitamin C at a certain time? I don't even remember the last time we recommend in vitamin E to anybody. So we rarely, we rarely dose it for all those reasons. I'm also, the reason I asked you that half of the question was, I was thinking the same thing. I don't know, I don't know anybody that's actually run any even light trial on timing of vitamin C for action as adaptations. So I don't know. I don't know if you took it later in the day and you trained, took it 12 hours away. I don't know that it would have a different of, hey, it could, could. Dance your question. Here's how we handle vitamin C. We're not just giving it to people. So I like a standing like like magnesium or omega 3. We would use it judiciously in different things. But I'm also, I'm not worried about it. If you ask me what am I concerned more about the small amount of adaptation that I miss versus not being sick, that that's an easy exchange for me. Catagorically, here's how we think about it. Again, athlete or non-athlete doesn't actually matter. There are times when we're trying to induce adaptation. When we're doing that, we're going to want to let those stress things happen. And then there's times when we're trying to peak. We call this optimization versus peaking. If I'm peaking, I don't care about adaptation. I'm trying to maximize performance in the short term. In that case, we are going way up on anti-oxidants. We're going way up on vitamin C. Don't want to get sick. Want you to feel great. We want you to perform what you're best right now. If that compromises some adaptation, fine, I don't care. Because we're trying to get the max performance right now. If we're concerned about long-term optimization, I cannot utilize this enough. Even in people are not competing. This is still a thing you should play with throughout the year. You should have phases of optimization. You should have phases of adaptation. You should be pushing this boundary. If not, you're going to run medium all the time. And so that's how we will. I will have no problem putting it there. If we have some reason to think somebody is in a really high-oxidative state. Because of really poor nutrition and environmental exposures. Any number of other things. Then we might just kind of pro-flectically give them vitamin C. Probably a 500 milligrams. I wouldn't be, I'm not worried about that. I'm not super concerned. The other thing to pay attention to here is when we say adaptation at a attenuation. It's not blocking. It doesn't mean you're getting zero. It's you're getting 5% less. 10% less. Some amount that matters, but it's not zero. It's not like absolutely zero. I did nothing. No, it just means you got 90% of where we thought we're going to go potentially. Yeah, it would matter if it's every day. Maybe you're getting 5% less over 20 years. The way I, if I remember correctly, and people can go to my vitamin C topic page on my website and see there's a graph. Your plasma levels peak. It goes pretty close back to baseline. I want to say after three hours or so. If I'm taking it, I'm taking it. I'm taking it at night. I'm sleeping. When I work out in the morning, my level should be normal by then. But that's the way I approach it. Antoinne flamotories. How do you feel about people taking things like NSAIDs for pain or as an anti-inflammatory if they're working out too hard? That also blunts adaptation. Yes. It's the same like you're running a cocky. What are we trying? What are we worried about? Did you take them every day? Probably not for many reasons. Not a good approach. My wife actually just started a new training phase a couple of days ago. So she added a new couple of new exercises she hadn't been doing. And she tends to do this just went way too heavy. So much pain. She has not been able to move for two days. Bad. She's just like can't move without really, really substantial amount. I couldn't make my heart happier. I love hearing her in physical pain just makes my joy there. Because she's not like her. She's just like, oh my god. The kids are just terrorizing her. Just wanted to play with mom and she's just like everything hurts on my body. Yeah. We're like, she's using a lot of NSAIDs. There's no wind here. There's no positive benefit. There's no adaptation we're missing with you being an extraordinary amounts of pain. In those particular cases when you overshoot it or whatever happens, yeah, like use them. No problem. If that's what you're using just to get through your training, then our training program is probably poor or something else in our physical process is depleting our recovery bucket. We need to go fix that problem. So if it is something we have to use, the exceptions there are our athletes. Of course football is really hard sport. And if you got to take it to get through a football week, because that's your job, then that's what we're going to do. And there's some other things there. But for the most people, yeah, we're not using them very often. I like to look on your face by the way when I said my wife is in so much pain. It brings my heart to me. I was just smiling. I mean, it all. I'm just wondering where she did to be in that much pain. That's not crazy. She normally does a bunch of her training home and then she was actually happened to be a gym where had some other equipment. She's able to load stuff more. And she was like, just too happy at the moment. It was like, yeah. So she's doing some dead lifts, some oddials. I think she's more ready to press some lap pull down. It's like not really stuff. I love being sore too. I love waking up the next day. It's the best. It's the best recovery. Let's start with some supplements for recovery. We're going to get it into recovery as well. I hear a lot about people have been asking me a lot about tart cherry juice, which when they're asking me about that, I was like, oh, you mean for sleep? Yeah, because I'm so used to like, people taking tart cherry juice for sleep. But apparently it's being promoted for reducing delayed onset muscle soreness recovery. So can you talk a little bit about, yeah, there's data. That's not, there's data there. This is a port muscle soreness muscle damage. Um, could I, could I make a strong argument that you wouldn't get the same thing if you just had a really high similar food source? I think you could actually, I don't think there's anything magic to that. Not surprised. Right. If you think about what's in dark rich colored fruits? Probably females. Like, we know that that's there. It's the same thing we make when people talk about like blueberries for cognitive performance. Yeah. It's also the same probably in strawberries and probably in raspberry. Like, it's, it's not like magic to the cherry or the blueberry. I don't think. It is a super high concentration of polyphenols in a bunch of different areas. That's probably doing most of the work here. Um, but yeah, you will see that there. We, we take it with it for a few years. We don't use it very much. Honestly. Is it, does it, you know, like I said, I want to get into recovery and typically, you know, when I have delayed onset muscles or nissor doms, I go for a run and I'm good. Yeah. Like, I mean, it hurts when I start running and then as I'm going throughout the run, I start to feel better and then the next day, I'm much better. Yeah. Um, so, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, is tart cherry, cherry juice something you think I should try experimenting with? I mean, is it probably not? Okay. You're not getting that sore that off to your mind? Who's, who's, the kind of target person that may benefit from tart cherry juice or you are blueberry polyphenols supplement or you're polyphenol booster supplement won't ever fill in the blank. What dose? Yeah. Again, we don't use it very often. Um, so I'm probably not the person to make the case for people wanting to go out and try it. Cool. Um, it's fine. Again, the research is there. I've seen it. It's compelling. You also mentioned sleep. That's another compelling reason. So if you're getting, if you're wanting to use a kind of a double combo and you like, you like it for sleep, where this is most popular is in like the bodybuilding communities for those exact reasons. So I can take it a ton at night. It'll help me sleep and I'll be a little bit less sore. I'm kind of getting a double win. Is that because the melatonin in it that sleep or combination of plausible and plausible probably all the above, right? Um, and again, that research is actually there. You'll see it. And I have seen a lot of people who will anecdotally say, yeah, help my sleep a ton. But again, I probably haven't recommended it in five years. Or more like we kind of did the bunch. Um, okay. Great. Yeah. I just I've had multiple people asking me about it. And so finally I was like, okay, what is this? Yeah. Yeah. Like, there's got, when you start to have multiple, you ask news, or to look into it and say, like, okay, we generally don't honestly favor recovery supplements that much. That's just like probably the bigger answer here is supplements for recovery is not that great. It's not as good as other things that we're going to, I hope we'll discuss in a minute. Exactly. What about glutamine? Yeah. You can do that. So we won't use glutamine conditional. I mean, I'll ask it, right? So in our populations, when I mean, I'll ask it, need is really high. Again, you're combining it with caloric reduction. And you don't have that much room go like, I just can't give you more food. I can't give you more chicken breasts. I can't give you more turkey or elk or whatever we're doing. Okay, fine. So we have some argument for the conditional actually coming into practice with those people. Then you have the kind of area of glutamine with gut health stuff. And then we actually see that a little bit transfer over to even brain health. And you specifically, like post-concussion protocols. That whole line then starts coming together and you're okay. For our population, there's one, two, and three, likely hit of all that stuff. Okay, pretty reasonable. At on top of that safety profile, no real downsides here. We're not worried about any other effect of it. We use it quite a bit actually. That's the, that's, so I have a few thoughts on glutamine. One, that's interesting TBI because yeah, glutamine is, it's like it gets converted into, you know, it gets used by mitochondria as well as a source of energy. Totally. And in fact, I did a lot of research in graduate school with glutamine and T cells and activated T cells. And this is kind of where I got into this, I mean, I now take glutamine for immune reasons. Yeah. And I got it. I don't know if you've seen any of the literature on long endurance athletes, you know, they can glutamine it. Yes, I imagine you're taking milk by taking it two times a day. Are you splitting up your dose? I'm not. Of some time. If if there's an exposure, I'll take it three times a day. Like so if my son, all of a sudden, sneezing, I'm like, okay, you're just scooping. But, um, so glutamine is used by, by activated T cells and it just dawned on me. I'd like to know all this research. I'm like, you can take glucose out of a cell culture as long as there's glutamine there. Those cells are fine. They are fine. Because they consume glutamine as an energy source. It's used. It's used as, you know, off of a glutamate. Yeah. So basically it gets converted to that. But I started taking it and this is a total anecdote, but, you know, for a long period of time, I never got sick. Then I became a mom. I still didn't get sick until my son started school. And then it was like insane how often I was getting sick. I was like, I was wondering if I had cancer. I'm like, what is wrong with me? And then I started to glutamine and I don't ever get sick anymore. Really? I'm serious. I'm serious. Now I'm sure if the flu came up or something like, I don't know, but, but, upper respiratory tract infections like, if I get a little bit of anything, it's a tiny bit of a runny nose for like a couple of days. And like, I haven't, I haven't been sick in months. And that's really unusual as a parent as you know. Oh my God. So, um, that's why I take it. I take it. Not for recovery reasons, but for I take it prophylaxeely every day. Now, five grams, 10 grams. So, like I said, so I right now I take five grams. No, five point six. It's almost six grams. It's about six grams a day. If there's, if I have any inkling suspicion that it's coming, 25 grams. I'm, yeah, I'm like 20 grams. I'm like up, up, up. And the only downside for me is I can get a little gas when I start going my dose. I think you're talking about no, no downsides. I would say the only downside is if someone has cancer, they have, yeah, yeah, colon cancer or liver cancer or something like that. Cancer cells like glutamine. I was talking about T cells, but cancer cells can thrive with glutamine. It's an energy source. Totally. And people don't realize that. And so I was thinking about the TBI thing that I'm totally, you know, going on off of a, you know, tangent here. But I'm wondering if the TBI thing, if there's an energy component to it. Oh, no, they're absolutely yes. There's huge. I covered this, I needed a whole, we published paper a few months ago. Myself, Tommy Wood and Federica Conti works with me at Parker now, as my research scientist, published a review on preventative as well as post-brane injury concussion, all the supplementation dosage timing, all that stuff as well as whole food equivalents. And that whole paper is open to access. So you can go through that whole thing. But yeah, this came out as a pretty clear one. When you start then poking around into the gut health literature as well, you start going, okay. Demion stuff you just brought up. This is such a clear connection between this entire chain from being sick, the brain health, the energy, you pay attention to how it's working, what it's doing. And you're like, okay, this is one of those times when it lines up and you go, oh yeah, now I get it. Like this is why it's having such cross benefit. Right. Absolutely. In the gut too, it's like it's being converted to energy. Your gut cells are using alpha key to glutera. I mean, it's so interesting. I think there's just, there's so much to be discovered with glutamine. Yeah. That I hope people are going to, you know, research that more. But we do almost always 10 grams to my today. Morning and night. Like that's a pretty thing, especially if we have any inclination or direct evidence of actual gut issues, that's a common one. If we want to drop it then back down to 10 grams, total of a day, like we will do that. But we will generally live at least 10 grams a day. That said, I'm going to, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do your protocol because I'm not on it. And if it is every day, if I ever get sick again, I'm having a lawyer send a letter to you. I'm, I'm, I'm everybody. I gave it to my son as well. And he's not getting sick like nearly as much. It's, it's, it's, it's real. So I was thinking it was placebo. It was like, oh, it could be placebo because, you know, honestly, if it was placebo, I don't care if it works, it works. But my son doesn't know that I'm giving him glutamine. What are you giving the three grams? I'm no, I'm, I'm giving him full five almost five. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, it's been a pretty night and day difference in terms of the effects on the immune system. I mean, I'm saying immune system. I don't know that it's actually, I'm just saying. That's a matter. Yeah. Bringing illness into our house. Not getting a cold. This is in has been unbelievable. And it's, it's funny because this season has been the worst for all of my friends. Like everyone's been sick rushed. Yeah. Everyone's been sick. We haven't. My wife probably has had one cold in a decade. Like it doesn't matter. You could soak her in a bath of 16 cold viruses. She will get nothing. I'm so envious of this people. Nothing. My, my daughter is like, okay, but she gets a lot. My son and I just, you bring it home at all. Like, it's a wrap. I'm so done. And I get so mad because I'm like, I know all these things. I do this whatever. This is my job. And I can't, but I've never tried this at this level. So try it. I'm so like a fire. I put it in my coffee or, you know, my tea and it does, you can, the coffee, if you put like monk fruit or stabby, I, you won't taste it, but it does have a taste. As you probably know, you're probably not probably remember it. I'm just pretty sure. We put it, I just put it like a soft water. Yeah. Right. Down. Yeah. And we just dose it with all the rest. Like put cream, put it all in there, deal with six ounces of the light and just get it out. Now what's it supposed to do for muscle recovery? Well, if it has a conditional effect, if it has any they immune effect, it's going to have the same there. So you'll see muscle soreness as the primary outcome to pay attention there. Like, is it doing anything unoballically? Um, and Kexie, maybe or like some other situations are a company, but for a normal people. Now, why we do it is the other for the most part. Like, all the good health. I just wonder how much of the glutamine, you know, because I remember it, it's been so long. I did some of these like substrate labeling studies, and it was like, you know, a lot of it's getting converted into glutamate and alphacetic gluteraite and abuse is energy. Yep. So it's, it's, it's fascinating. You, you kind of wonder how much of the glutamine that you're taking in is going as an amino acid versus the energy source. So um, that's a great question. So you're not really big on recovery, supplement. As I got too more to asking about one, and we can kind of lump them together as well. But the hydrolyzed collagen powder for joints and tendons, and this is where I get into, you know, it's high in originine. It's actually really high in originine. I take it mostly for skin, because I've been pretty convinced by this skin data. But I was, you know, what are your thoughts on on, I've changed my tune in this one. I was not compelled by this evidence for a long time. I was also not compelled that as long as you're protein intake, whole food is high or higher than ish, you know, like higher than basic numbers, it's not no compelling evidence. I don't care about skin. So like, whatever. I've changed a little bit. I had more and more research has come out and it looks like there's something actually happening here. Where this gets sticky is the still the argument of organ specific conversion. So if you are consuming it, how do we actually know your consuming collagen and that's getting into collagen? Well, the argument would be, if it's all being broken down into its individual constituents, and it doesn't matter. And then there's some talk of, well, there are the special kind of conditional ones where it gets crossed through as these combination of amino acids. So therefore it's going to be more targeting collagen. Well, wait and see if that holds true or not, I'm not entirely convinced of that either. But that said, when you go to the end of the story, it does seem to be doing stuff for connective tissue in legaments. This study that convinced me of that very question that you were asking was actually a while, published a while ago over a decade ago, and it was an animal study where hydrolyzed collagen powder was radial labeled, and peptides were making their ways to the tendons. And I was like, okay, I mean, yeah, it's a rodent, but you're really going to say that an intact peptide is going to make its way to the tendons. I mean, maybe it's not going to happen in a human, but it seems encouraging. And yeah, I would say, I think it's just an area where we probably don't have the answers yet. Like, we don't have all the answers. It may be something else, it may be it's that maybe it's not but something's happening here. And so now we will very often recommend it, prophylactically, even if you're not injured. Certainly, if you have any soft tissue injury history or you're compelled to that, 30 to 60 minutes, pre-exercise seems to be the time. So timing dosage does seem to matter with collagen. I mentioned earlier, co-conjusted with like 50 milligrams of vitamin C. Yeah. Seems to be the thing, this is all Keith Barnes work, like many other people, but he's the one who's pushed this for many, many years now. So, scientifically, so he gets credit for a lot of this work. And again, I was on the other side of the fence like that. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. It's got very different amino acid profile than protein, I mean, completely different. Totally, and hydroxy-proling. Yeah, I mean, it's well, this was the argument against it for many years. Well, for muscle, yeah, but like for a connective tissue and now pairs potentially, it matters. Right. So, yep, we'll do it. As you've heard me say many times, I also like to run like, well, what ifs? What's the downside? There doesn't seem to be really any downside here. So, cost money, sure. Physologically, we're not blocking adaptations. We're not struggling. Something else out. We're not doing long-term damage. We're not shutting off a pathway. Okay. Worst, we spent some money. All right. Most of the people I'm around, they'll take that exchange. Then you start adding with something like collagen. Hair, skin. Other potential benefits? Like, okay, I'm getting potential benefits in multiple areas. There is some human research on this. It might work. Very little downside. Yes, it's pretty cost intensive, relative to protein powder. And if that's your barrier, fine, I get it. No problem. But for the most part, it's not that expensive. Yeah, there's enough competition now that there's some reason quality brands that you can find. What are your thoughts on glycosamine, um, condorate for tendon joint? We don't use it much. No. No. Honestly, I would have to dive back into that database. I haven't looked in many years. Kind of makes evidence as far as I last saw. Same. Sometimes all like if I have an issue, it's like, okay, let's try to throw it. Let's throw it in the bucket. I don't see a big downside. Just in case. I give it to my dogs. That makes Philly better. That's the only thing we give them. They're old. But yeah, we don't use it. There's just, I think there's more compelling ways to go about it. If we're having consistent injury issues, um, we're doing other things. That's not going to be our first second or third line of defense at all. Yeah. Okay. Well, that will hopefully get into some of that because I want to get into recovery. Um, this is a, this is an area where it's very important. As of course, you know, but I don't know that a lot of people focus on recovery. Although it's becoming, I think, more increasing. It's more awareness is, I think, being generated now. But, um, I was thinking maybe you could kind of just start by walking people through the physiological process of what's going on during recovery. Why is it so important? How are you defining recovery? How are you labeling? I guess, you know, you're talking about the shifts in inflammation and immune, immune response and cellular repair. All the things that are happening in response to the workload that you've applied and the inflammation that you've generated and the, you know, oxidation that you've generated. Okay. The reason I asked that is because we answer this differently depending on how people are thinking of recovery. We think about this in terms like a muscle soreness. Are we thinking about this in terms of a, my energy's low the next day? Are we thinking about this in terms of, I felt fine, but my actual performance was just a little bit lower. Those are three different types of recovery. Are we thinking about this more chronically? Um, man, I've just been going down for several weeks and several months. Like, depending on how we frame this, my answer would completely different. So is there one or more of those that you would want to focus on? I think I'm thinking more about adaptations that are occurring to improve muscle mass and strength and your cardiovascular fitness, for example. Yeah. Okay. So in that particular case, you've laid out the basic framework for us a second ago, right? In terms of the three big processes that happen there, it is not the case typically where you're actually tearing tissue down. In the case of strength training and muscle, we hear that all the time. Like you break the muscle down, you have these micro tears that would then have those cascades you're mentioning. That actually doesn't happen as much as people think. Um, most of the time muscle tissue is fine. We're certainly not tearing down a lot of tissue in our cardiovascular system. This is more of a signaling issue than it is a damage issue. And we know that because you can induce those same adaptations. If you count those first parts of the equation out. So I can give you things that simply ramp up adaptation that don't require damage at all. I do not have to have inflammation to induce adaptation. That is the primary signal though. Same token. If I give you inflammatory agent without any tissue damage at all, I can get similar adaptation. Right. So we can cause physiological responses with an inflammatory marker that comes in rather than an actual tissue damage. So those things are independent of itself. It's not there. But you laid out the basic cascade, some sort of inflammatory immune response there, some sort of tissue, a deemus swelling, and then some sort of back cascade. Why supplements? Why different tools? Why different recover protocols work? And why they matter is because they can target any aspect of that, the front side or the back side. The insult coming in or the adapter response. And you can play a game any part of that area. We would use different solutions based on why we think that the thing happened in the first place. So that is our overall framework if how we set up recovery in this context. Okay. So then let's take a step forward and talk a little bit about what you were asking me and that would be like how can a person and athlete sort of know if they what can they what could of metrics can they look at? To help signal if they are if they're normally sort of recovering from their training versus not. So then muscle soreness, the injury, like what's what of metrics? First, most important metric is how are you feeling? And I'm saying this because if you look at actually the data and we've done this across millions of data points, like literally millions of heart rate variability data points and things like that. Subjective perception. How you feel today? We'll stack up as tight as almost any other biological metric we can pick. It's really, really important. If you're feeling good, if you're making progress and you don't feel terrible, then I'm not worried about your recovery at all. That we're done. So when you ask me what's your people measure, most of the time may answer is nothing. Don't worry about it. You making progress? Yeah. You in a lot of pain and suffering. No. Good. We're done. You want to do a metric behind that. Sometimes it makes things worse. Like you sometimes we're looking at data and it's not the right way to go about it and that can cause problems. We end up pulling technologies away from people a lot. We pull sleep trackers away from people a lot. We do those things. So I'm bringing that up because that is the metric you should care about. Progress and pain. We're going to both those, we're done. Like this is the only recovery equation we're happening. If we're running into issues with one of those two things, now we'll have a conversation. Okay. So let's say you have muscle swornists again. We're back to the muscle swornists. Easy. No problem. Muscles are sour. Step number one input. What's your program look like? I told you the story earlier, wife getting super sore. That was there's not a supplement there that we can do to fix her. That was a training to program error. And her case was not it actually chooses to break contourses program. Not breath full. That was her dumb dumb fall. Like that. She did a training boo boo. She calls them and okay great. That's not a something we have to go fix. I was just like, all right, like don't do that again or suffer. Let's just throw that one out. Let's go to the backside. Let's assume your training program is good. And just for the sake of speedy conversation here, let's assume sleep and nutrition and mental health and all that is okay, right? Because that is all going to be part of our real equation. Let's go to the end of it. What do you do? Got to super sore. How do you fix it? Supplements again would not be our route if you need to take pain relievers because you're there. Fine. What's going to be more effective? Now you're actually starting to talk about things like blood movement. You actually mentioned earlier, you'd like to move a low level of physical activity on in terms of magnitude of effect is almost always going to be your biggest impact. Can you get something? Can you get out and move a little bit? Thermal stress is another big favorite of mine. Sana, great. I like direct contact though. So if we can get in warm water, I prefer that. So this is jacuzzi bath. Things like that. If you want to go to and we've run a couple of actually Dom studies, two of them using Norma Tech boots, right? And compression boots, air boots. Things are going there. That is fine as well. We've done a muscle stimulation stuff. So yeah, a muscle STEM unit and things like that. You'll you'll find data that supports all of those things. If you want to sled chamber things and use a combination, we will do that too. We will say, okay, great. We're going to bath today. We're going to do Norma Tech boots. We're going to do hyper ice stuff. We're going to do compression stuff. You can do all of these things. They probably are working on similar mechanisms. But again, no downside. And if you're in that much pain and suffering, use them all. Like really try to use everything because what you're basically doing is you're doing low level physical activity for many, many, many hours of the day. We'll use firefly that little tiny device you can put on the front of your leg. It's a little strip. Make your toe being kind of up now. You can do it for hours a day. So you can put that thing on. You're on a playing your working, your toe and your your foot is flexing at a high frequency, right? Then the bobo, bobo, bobo, and try to today. That's been shown a bunch of times to be super effective for recovery. So there's tons of little tools we can do, but all of it is basically doing the same thing. It's low level blood flow for a long period of time. So pick your tool, pick your poison, you want free, you want expensive, you want combinations. I can give them all to you. But it's all again, basically the same. So the level of blood flow and you're saying for the long, a long period of time. So what I'm doing is a short. I'm doing 30 minute run. What's going on here? Is it delivering just oxygen and nutrients and inflammatory, you know, things are going to the right tissues, like, or what's the mechanism? All the above, right? All the above. I would have bet to after you do your run, you're probably a little more physical active because you're not a sore. So you're probably going to be walking a little more. You're going to be getting up. You're going to be doing things more with the active throughout the day. So your 30 minute run is still getting a net on aggregate, get a lot more blood flow. Yeah, more blood flow in, more nutrients and more waste products out, all the above. You also have indirect signaling. You went a lot of pain to go back a little a lot like muscle soreness pain is neurological. Right. So you have pressure, likely happening on the nerve endings in that specific area. So you can get some of that fluid out of the area of less pressure, you have less pain receptors. You also have decentenization that's happening. Right. So you're moving in sodium potassium pumps. Like on the cell membrane, that's moving stuff back and forth. Right. We're seeing that adaptation there. So it's going to be a combination of all that. I don't know if I've ever seen any particular set of papers that say like this is the exact molecule signaling property that that is like explaining all of muscle soreness. So the best answer we could say would be all of those things are likely contributing on some level. At the end of the day, most of the time exercising due to muscle soreness is a cellular pressure issue. And so the more that you can get that out there, you have to get the inflammatory signal out of there because that's going to keep putting you back into tissue swelling. So get the fluid out and then stop the signal that says stop putting more tissue in or fluid in there. And then eventually you're going to get yourself back to normal. What do you do if someone's feeling asorness that isn't necessarily going away? It's kind of sticking around. It's not like a really bad injury kind of thing but it's enough to affect the performance. It's enough that it's like there's something going on. Now this compression thing, I have kind of been experimenting around with it. Voodoo floss. The Voodoo floss. So I guess this is blood flow restriction. And you wrap it around something like for me I've got this forearm thing. It's like the 10 tendons or something. And it really is what I'm pulling. Yeah. You're probably actually looking more of a fascist you then your blood flow. That's what the Voodoo floss stuff is going to do. So you're pinning and twisting and moving. So it's connected to tissue glide. It's light. So you're connected to tissue is supposed to glide actually. People don't like actually realize this when we're off the. But you should be able to pinch your skin and pull it away from your tissue. That's not just fat there. If you are pinned down constantly, that's a connected tissue-fascial issue. And so what you're doing with that is you're rubbing it both horizontally and vertically. And when we typically think about like massage, it is a vertical compression, right? I'm pushing down on the tissue. I'm down on the tissue. When you'll see often, I'm more of a bit of it, it's actually horizontal movement and pulling away. This is if you're ever seen like cupping, people do that. You're pulling skin away from fascier, other than smashing fascier back into it when it's kind of not a down already. So any relief you're getting there is not probably for the blood flow. It's the fact that you're pinning that fascier and then you're moving the tissue around the fascier and getting that kink if you will to let go. So completely different mechanism of action there. That is acute and chronic, but mostly that is an acute issue. If you're dealing with things like runners, we'll get a lot of like side leg pain, TFL pain, IT ban, a lot of times same issue there, right? So like you're getting more glide and slide that fascier can move appropriately and that's where the pain signal is going to be. People don't realize that there's a load of nerve endings in fascier. There's a ton. So if that stuff gets irritated and aggravated, that's going to be pain. That's probably not a muscle issue. You might not necessarily be able to tell. You can't tell their fascinators are muscle, but more likely the knot is connected to the fascier issue. And what is the best way to for fasc? Is it something like a budoo floss? You can. I mean, conceptually you just want to move it. So if budoo floss does it for you, awesome. If you want to roll out on a lacrosse ball, cool. If you want manual massage, great. Coughing. Infinite ways to do it, but what you want to do again is not just compress. The only thing traditional like a foam roller or any other self-mile facial release, generally people are smashing down. What we want to think is actually pulling away, so pulling the fascia away from your body rather than smashing it into the muscle, and then rotating it moving it horizontally, gliding up and down versus just smashing together. So the compression thing that you were talking about the boots. Yep. So that's working through blood flow restriction and then it has that working. So there's a whole host company that make this normal tech. It's the one that's been in the market for a long time. Actually, recently got acquired by Hyper-Eyes. But these are boots that you could sit and they make them for the upper body too, but you can sit in them and imagine a pair of pants and the pair of pants inflates with air all the way around it. And so it goes on and it flates, entire leg, it's crushed, and then it deflates. And then it's crushed and deflates. So it squeezes back and forth and back and forth. So you get a little bit of hypoxia, a little bit of blood flow, a little bit of hypoxia, a little bit of blood flow. And they can do it for 20 or 40 or 60 minutes or a higher of a long you want. It's basically simulated exercise. A little bit of blood, a little bit of blood back. So blood flow, yes. You will actually see really compelling evidence on water immersion. Yeah, not only cold water. I simply mean water. No, but oh, really. Yeah. Well, heat, I would say for sure, because you're also increasing blood flow, right? Totally. But it's the orsocytic pressure that comes with being in fluid that will do the same thing. This is many, again, one of the many reasons why I'm like, like, sauna is not the only answer here. It's great for a thousand things. But the water itself is playing a little bit of a magic role. And we know this because there have been trials where we've actually controlled for temperature and you still get those benefits of just being in that fluid environment. So if you can do that, you can gravity changes in the equation. Things can move in and out of tissue. And there's actually pressure that comes from being in the water. It's a low, level pressure that smashes up against your tissue. Now, if you want to change temperature and you get some of those other benefits, that's great too. Yeah. The water itself is fantastic way. So I would strongly also recommend people getting into water if they can. Let's talk about that. Let's get into, okay. So for recovery, you hear, I mean, you know, probably know I'm super into the deliberate heat exposure through also jacuzzi and sauna. Yeah. There's cold water immersion. I'd love to talk about how, so with with the heat exposure and jacuzzi, sauna, it sounds like jacuzzi might be might be the winner with respect to, as my water favorite. The water, yeah, worth the static part of the water as well and helping with blood flow. Yep. And also the, was it, does it help with the facial tissue as well? Or probably not. You might be, you might be, yeah. Yeah. There's, there's, I mean, there has been, you know, some evidence on, on sauna improving blood pressure, but there's a lot of literature out there on hot baths and, you know, you know, he's doing it. Totally. I mean, it's probably a lot more robust in in ways. Yeah. I mean, you have the pressure she talked about, and then we have all the other heat related mechanisms that you've talked about for many, many years now that that happened to. So you combine those two. It's, it's a big win. And it's not really like, you don't have to worry about the timing as much around exercise. In fact, you can get in a hot jacuzzi or a hot sauna right after you lift weights. In fact, there's some evidence that it's beneficial. Right. That's like supportive. Yeah. We do it a lot. We do it a lot post exercise. Do you, um, do you both in endurance and yeah weight training both? Yep. The only thing you got to be careful with is, um, if you did something that you really went over the edge with in terms of training, if you get into a sauna, sometimes it feels like a delays recovery a little bit, because that actually kind of feels like an exacerbates the training. Like you've continued to train particularly if you've gone really hard like if we've had a, our folks have um, played like a five hour round of golf in Georgia and August. Probably not hop into the sauna afterwards, right? Because like fatigue is high. Fluids are already low. So in a soap world, we're not going to add that on. And then that particular case where like walking your way. So when you, you've got to think through this stuff a little bit more when you're saying, all right, we were actually are pretty fatigued. Let's not add that I bought a, like a normal exercise session. Yeah, hop into the sauna jacuzzi afterwards. It's like, we're all, we're all game for it. Totally here. Where do you, um, this is a couple of things I want to talk about with the sauna. One, what do you think about some of the, I would still say preliminary at this point literature on using deliberate heat exposure as a way to improve endurance like adaptations and improve performance? So here's how we will frame it. It's not a substitute for exercise, of course, but it's better than sitting on the couch for most things. So training is first, if on top of past that or we have an injury or fill in the blank there, then we can use sauna to keep maintenance to keep pace to keep some cardiovascular adaptation going. So if we're pulling training down like oftentimes we actually have to pull high intensive exercise down for people. If you're dosing high intensity stuff like truly high intensity endurance work too often, that can put people in really bad spots. So what we can do sometimes is pull them off of that and insert sauna and they still can kind of feel like a little bit of I worked really hard. And some people need that, not for physical reasons, but for other rational. So we use it in those particular cases or we're deloding or we're doing any number of other things where we can't get as much exercise we want or we're ring it down. So we use it in that particular context. If we then take it into an individual athlete and we're trying to use a four specifically performance benefit's gains, I would only be okay doing that if training volume is pretty low. All right, because anything that takes away from training in an athlete, like there has to be a really big payout because specificity wins. So if that means we're doing less miles on the road, well, some people can afford less miles. Sometimes that's a good thing, but we got to be really careful with maintaining always training specificity. That's in that context, that's a whole hand or that thing. So we would be really time dependent and whatever else is going on our life. Have you seen some of the data? There's only really one human city that I've seen lots of animal studies looking at local heat. So on humans, it was like local heat applied and it had prevented disuse after free, like four years. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's course tons and tons of animal studies. In fact, I was talking about the animal studies before the human data came out and I got a lot of pushback for that. But I do think it's again in that sense where you can use it on the days where you're not training as much to help with not only the cardiovascular adaptations that you mentioned, but also helping prevent disuse after free, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I love heat. The field's good. Of course, it feels way better than cold. We rarely have a hard time convincing people to do stuff that involves a heat. It's like, okay, put a hot pad on your legs. All right, I mean for that one, high price makes a bunch of stuff. I don't have any connection to them at all, but they just make a much little easy things to put on your legs and your arms that get hot really fast or super easy to use. So we will do those things again quite a bit. Whether or not they're making a benefit in our high-performers or something. I don't know. But if they're like that felt good. That's a win. Blossomely helping. Cool. Yeah. Well, it sounds like even for recovery. It might, I mean, that's a benefit if it's increasing the blood flow and helping with the late onset muscles orness and things like that. Yeah. Cold water immersion on the other hand. Yeah. This is something it's funny because it's really, it's become popular in as a recovery tool. And I don't, there's a lot of people that I've spoken to, friends that didn't know it could blunt adaptations, particularly muscle hypertrophy. Yeah. And like what? I'm getting into it after I live right now. You finally convinced me to do it. Now you're telling me to screw in myself. You're fault. Let's talk about that. Yeah. Muscle soreness. It seems pretty clear based on the data that is available that cold water immersion is more effective than something like Crout Therapy or cold shower. There has been some papers that showed Crout Therapy's self did help with muscle soreness. But if you stock them again against the cold water immersion, the water wins. So we really never use Crout Therapy. If you're going to use something like a cold shower, then there's, there's other reasons for it. I don't think I would be, I wouldn't put my money on cold showers doing much for muscle soreness. Again, many other reasons why one could do it, but that would not be the primary goal if we're using it for that. So, right out the gates. Now it does work. And many studies have been done and I would say our anecdotal experience, my personal experience, our coaching experiences with support that. Generally, people are going to be a little bit less sore when they go in it. Do we do it immediately post work out for people or what we're trying to grow muscle? No. Many in studies now and I feel like every couple of weeks another one comes out and I'm like, good, good, gracious. We know already. Like we know already. Stop doing this. Stop doing that work. We know it. Not a good idea. The questions that come up then next usually are, okay, so how long post exercise do I have to wait? And no one knows. That's the study they need to do. No, yes. Like stop doing the basic one. We know that answer. There's like seven studies at least now that have done it. We get it. I don't know, right? If you look at our time core stuff, we've done on like GeneXpression. That happens within seconds. All right. Signaling happens within seconds and is ramped up for minutes to hours post exercise. Depending on the marker and you're like that. GeneXpression typically peaks three to four to six hours. Again, depending on the one you're looking at for muscle and amulism. Muscle protein synthesis, you're at 48 hours. Okay? So like I don't know because people always ask like, what if I lift in the morning and I, I don't know. It's probably better than lifting and immediately getting into your ice bath. Probably. So is it four to six hours? Because of the, that's what that number comes from by the way. It's like all the time course research on GeneXpression. You're also talking about like four or five genes that were in that study. So it's not like it is exactly like complete mapping of the entire anabolic genetic response. So I kept few of the markers some of them were out for, but they went off. Someone peaked it an hour. Someone peaked like seven hours later. So like the four hour window thing is like a, it's not exactly what people think it is. So nobody has any idea. Like I have no idea at all. I can, I'll tell you how we typically handle it. But yeah, we don't know. Yeah, let's, let's talk about how you typically handle it. Also, you know, you mentioned when you're talking about adaptations, the different, different things that are happening. There's the inflammatory response. You know, there's the hormonal responses that are happening. There's a lot of things that are happening, right? And so those things have different time courses. We're talking about muscle proteins synthesis, right? You're you're talking about it's elevated for 48 hours after exercise. And I know I had Luke van Loonon, you know, not long ago. And he's done at least one study. I think too. Looking at cold water and muscle proteins synthesis. And he was saying, yeah, I mean, you know, because the cold water immersion causes vasoconstriction. So not only are you not getting, you know, the inflammatory mediators to where they need to be and all that signaling, you know, molecules and things like that, amino acids are not going to muscle either as readily. And so he was saying, you know, you might want to, you know, wait 24 hours, like basically. I'm like, so that sounds like a recovery day. But some people are training every day. Yeah. Some people are training every day. I mean, I don't know if they should be training seven days, you know, maybe six days and I don't know. But I mean, I guess a recovery day can be your endurance aerobic day. Because I don't know if that's really been shown that it's planting any adaptations. In fact, there's been some performance enhancements, right? Yeah. Have you looked into that literature? Yes. Yeah. Not a ton to go off of there. But yeah, like one thing can do that. The quick answer there is you're looking at mitochondrial benefits. Like, which is okay. Like, then there's some plausible thing there. We don't use cold water immersion a ton. I used to use it more. We do it. When we do it, when we do it, rather, it's for other reasons. And somebody really over cooks it and they're super sore. Great. Okay. The other reasons we use it are generally not performance based. Okay. We're not using it for longevity or lifespan, anything like that. We tend to use it for things like stress and occupation for nervous system resilience, for breathing mechanics. That's the rationale we typically go to cold water. That said, we have pulled cold water away from people a lot because there can be serious neurological, not nervous system problems that come with cold water immersion. There can be sleep issues that come with cold water immersion for some people. So, those people, we tend to like back it off because it's a stressor. It's a very big stressor. And if your your alicotic load is already over the brim, some people cold is great, some people are pushing past and making things worse. So, we'll wind it back. That said, I love it. I have multiple at my house. I've been doing it for a very long time. I had a deep freezer in the back of my house for many, many, many years than I used. So, but it's not for everybody. It's not the danger, though. It's not like block all your adaptations. But it's not probably not something you have to be doing every day to live a great life either. So, lots to say about that. So, mostly, mostly, people can use it for their muscle soreness and other reasons. Presumably, yeah. I mean, a lot of people use it for like you said the neurological benefits. I mean, it's something that if I use it, I don't use cold water immersion unless it's summer to be honest. I know all about the science. My husband uses it. Right now, he's like, we had to get a new pump, which we got, but then he had a clean in all this. But he typically uses it every night. He uses it at night. He uses it at night. He uses it at night. We're just funny because a lot of people use it when they wake up in the morning for like that, like wake up, response and feel like the nor up in the front, you know, you're feeling focused. He uses it night because it helps him sleep. Which, you know, I guess the coldness, maybe. I'm a bunch of reasons that you would explain that. So, we've actually plotted this. We did a bunch of stuff probably four or five years ago. We didn't publish it. We were taken around with stuff. We started looking at HRB. We brought it up just in case people aren't aware. It's a marker of overall recovery. We'll kind of keep it at that for now. And when you go into the ice, whether this is anywhere between 30 to 50 degrees for a minute to five minutes, you're generally going to get out of that ice and you will see some of that drive, fight our flight is elevated, like pretty consistently. That said, we plotted this every 15 minutes for up to three hours post and you just continually see a rise in Paris that did a drive for up to three hours post. So, I don't know when he's using it, but I would be, I would be willing to strongly bet. He is far more down regulated going to bed when he does the ice for that exact reason. You got a time at appropriately, because again, when you get in the ice and immediately somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes post ice exposure, you'll be more sympathetically driven. But after that, for several hours and most of the people, they were far more. And I'm talking about like 20 to 50 percent reductions, our elevations rather in HRV, many more pairs of that for many hours. And we stopped actually collecting the data at three hours. So, I don't even know how long that thing lasts. But I'm not surprised. Yeah, we have an anonymous small amount of people who liked it in the evening as well. Yeah, interesting. He does it at least an hour before. And I'm not surprised at all that he likes it. Yeah. But yeah. Does he shower then before he goes, the bed is hot again or does he? Yeah, sometimes he does shower, but it's like a really quick yeah. Like, no, I don't know that he gets hot. He's actually, he's cold in bed. So, doesn't really make a pot. There you go. There you go. But he does, he does hot to before getting in the cold. Oh, he likes a pot of person getting the cold. They get hot and then get in the cold. I hate, I do the opposite. I go straight cold. I'm like, I hate going hot. I don't hate it. But like, I'm like, all right, just get cold. Just like do the cold and get over it. But a lot of people like it that way. I don't really prefer, I don't like doing hot to cold. I get blood pressure changes that are like, or the same. Yeah, for me, I'm just like, I have to wait a little bit before, especially if I'm like hot tub into the cold. I have to, I've had like some scary times where I'm like, like, just, I didn't like it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, understood. Okay, so you were talking a little bit about HRV. And that's it and you talk about heart rate variability. And I wanted to talk about, we were talking chatting a little bit about this before we got in camera. And for measuring, something that people can like, you know, maybe on there wearable advice, measure a marker of recovery. Now you said subjective how you feel wins. Okay. And it seems to be the case with almost everything. Like, like, how harder you going, do you feel like, what's your heart rate going up to? Or do you feel like you're perceived exertions? Oh, you're perceived exertions going to win, right? Yeah. So Ben Leven was on the podcast. And he was actually arguing that heart rate variability is extremely variable. In terms of the way it's measured and, you know, he just sees tons of variability, like plus or minus 25 percent constantly, depending on like the variety of factors the time of day, they're breathing just everything like that. And he likes to look at resting heart rate, like first thing when you wake up in the morning, what you're resting heart rate as a good marker of recovery. And if you're resting heart rates higher, then it should be then it's kind of like, okay, maybe you're getting into this over non-functional overreaching, which I want to talk about overtraining. Yeah. But nice but new spot. Thank you. But HRV. So do you think there's, you know, if there's some way people can kind of follow this consistent measurement protocol, same time of day, same posture, same controlled breathing or something that they do at a controlled breathing thing before they measure it, something that's giving them, you know, consistency. Yeah. The big ones in this particular area, these are all respiratory related, what you just described. There's lots of ways we measure readiness, performance, fatigue, like to many of which spectrum you're in here, people will call these different things, load management, there are performance-based ones. These ones you've all mentioned are in the respiratory physiology side. So that's great. We'll just check right there. Now HRV is one of them resting heart rates and other more commonly though that we use our respiratory rate. And then you can look at something like C2 tolerance. Let's just disregard those for now. We'll focus on respiratory rate. We'll focus on, yeah, and HRV and heart rate. Resting heart rate is a good sign. If conditions are stable, if your resting heart rate becomes elevated, probably more than three to five beats per minute for more than a couple of days, that is a good sign something is happening. In this case, not a good thing. Right. So we're starting to become elevated as you said earlier, generally indicates you're getting overcooked. Right. Too much training or elastatic load total, sexual recovery, non-an effort recovery, calories, something's going on there. The issue with that is resting heart rate is incredibly unsensitive. It takes weeks, but that to happen. You're well into that problem. And when you start seeing changes in resting heart rate, you are so far down that road that you've, like, we should have saw this week's ago. Even first thing in the morning, resting heart rate, you're talking about 100%. Yeah. You will not see a change in first thing resting heart rate for a very long time into problems. The reason why people like HR be more is because it is far more stable. It is also like resting heart rate non-specific. So you don't know what's happening, but that variability that you're mentioning that Ben talked about earlier, that's also the benefit. Once you establish somebody's standard deviation, what are they normally fluctuate? Some people are going to be really neurologically, or nervous isn't really super stable. Some people nervous system is really unstable. That itself is a marker. How why you range under daily HRB is incredibly telling to what's going on in your system. Because of that, that sensitivity, I can see things happening really quickly. Now, some of the common mistakes with HRB are looking at the flat score. You know, if I said right now, like, run over what's your resting heart rate? And if I said your resting heart rate to 100 beats per minute, you know that's bad. If I said right now, your HRB is 100. You have no idea if that means anything. I wouldn't know. I'd have to be like, okay, what devices that on? What conditions? I still don't know. So the benefit of something like a heart rate is it's clear and defined for the most part good and bad. HRB is not. It's really a moving target. So it's more sensitive, but it tells us information, the variability, like I said, tells us a lot. In addition to that, once I established your normal standard deviation, when you start exceeding one, especially two standard deviations for more than a couple of days, something is happening. And I will tell you right now, you will see that way before you start seeing changes in resting heart rate. That problem is going to occur a way before. You don't want to overreact to a single day, as I mentioned. So you wake up, you know, HRB and your devices will pick a number. 70, normally. Some people will stay within 70 to 75 to 65. So their standard deviation would be like five, no seconds. Some people's normal standard deviation is 20. How do they, how do they establish their normal standard deviation? 30 days. 30 days. Measure for 30 days. And try to keep things stable. Take the average, right? Most of your tracker devices and stuff will like give you these numbers anyways. If you're more than outside that standard deviation for one day, whatever, don't really care. Right? If it is three plus days, I typically am looking for five plus days. Five plus days of a continual pattern and one direction or the other, something is happening. Now it's non-specific. So there will be a lot of noise in the system. But again, I think this is like, this is a feature not a per kind of downside. Because we're going to see, like, okay, did you change something in your food and your sleep in your environment, you know, feeling the blanks? Everything can take care of there. We, we will use HRB a decent amount. Some people do as I said earlier, they get so obsessed with those numbers. We take it away. I'm going, hey, just how you feeling today? Right? Because of those exact problems when I mentioned it, like there will be a ton of variability. People can't get this faster. I literally was dealing with a client. He's like, we'll just say, sold a company early in life. He's in his 40s and just has way too much money. Right? This is obvious. He serves. What he does. Everything that we measure on him is fantastic. He's been in the program for probably a year and a half. So he's super dialed in everything. And he just can't get this HRB score out of his brain. Like, he can't get it because he's just like it's down, it's down, it's down. It's not down. Right? For him, this is a normal number and also, by the way, these technology companies, if you're using that stuff, they change algorithms constantly. So like, your score is kind of there. So those are all the reasons if you're like paying attention to commercial HRB stuff, that is right. You should be super skeptical. Don't over interpret those things. If you see something like resting heart rate change, that means something. There's no accident there. That wasn't because you had a bad night of sleep. And if you're consistently seeing an elevation of heart rate, one day difference in HRB could be nothing. It could be completely irrelevant to what you're doing. But that doesn't mean necessarily that that it's a bad marker. When you're using it appropriately, there's a ton of information we can clean out of that. Specifically, again, where we find most of the value is even things like biofeedback training. Right? We can develop more resilience within your nervous system and you can objectively see that. And so we can use a whole bunch of different tools where we can give people and we can say things like, okay, can you calm yourself down? Can you? Oh, yes, I can't. Great. Well, then show me in your physiology. And you can see them looking at HRB data and going, oh, it's not moving. Oh, great. This is why we want you to go do A, B, and C, or they can like a bunch of different ways you can do it. So that's a lot of value in HRB in the pattern of just my single one ultimate recovery marker. In my opinion, respiratory rate is even better. There. When you see changes in respiratory rate, this will happen way before changes in resting heart rate. And this is self will influence both resting heart rate and HRB. If you start breathing more, something is happening. There's actually a really interesting paper, Laura Bloomfield did a couple of papers where she conveniently she measured all these things resting heart rate, sleep, HRB, and looked at stress. And one thing she found in her second actually two studies in the second one found that you'll see something like, you're likely to experiencing moderate high stress. One beat per minute increase in resting heart rate gave like a one to two percent increase in risk. But a one breath per minute change in resting heart rate was a 20 to 30 percent increase in likely to experiencing moderate high stress, which is a way of saying that's that stuff will flag way before resting heart rate. Resting heart rate didn't do anything didn't tell them anything about it, but HRB and specifically respiratory rate shot way up. You can see a cute stress. If I look at someone's data in the morning and your normal respiratory rate is say 12, breath per minute overnight and you're at 14, I'm like, whoa, something is going on. If you're at 14 for two days in a row, boom, you're going to get sick the next day or you're already sick or something like, hey, it's going on around you. Okay, like what's going on? Like, oh my god, like something's happening. And so for me, when we're coaching people like we're coaching them, I don't want to wait six weeks to start seeing problems happen. I need to go like, hey, this happened right now. What the heck is happening? What's going on? And for our opinion, HRB and respiratory rate will jump off the charts way before resting heart rate. How accurate are respiratory rate devices? Like, that are measuring respiratory rate. Um, depends on the device you're using, uh, if you start going out to the wrist in the hand, we start losing accuracy. Right. If you're actually using a chest strap, we're getting better. When we really care about it, like, and we're actually like, sleep testing stuff, we're going to have a device directly on your chest. We're measuring not only respiratory rate, but we're measuring the amplitude of change in your chest. We're measuring the direct movement of it outside of that though. respiratory rate is pretty easy to measure. But I mean, if something's, if someone's doing this at home, are they going to be wearing a strap like, you can't sleep in? You can't or you can wear your wearable, your watch, your wearer. You can do that. You can do that. You can't. You can wear your watch. Um, for respiratory rate, okay, for HRB, we start to lose accuracy. But respiratory rate is actually pretty easy to pick up from a tracker. So you'll be okay there. HRB gets tricky. And, and, and the respiratory rate, so you're talking, you're mentioning the studies how stress, what, I mean, it's, it's very sensitive to stress. Yeah. And that's not just like psychological stress. It's just exercise. It's any type of stress on the body. Nutritional stress, environmental stress. Again, you'll see, if you remember a few years ago, we all remember COVID. There was a bunch of different devices that came out where, uh, NFL, NMBA, actually, they did it with aura. They were really, they had these like pre COVID flags. And we had a bunch of professional athletes. And I'll, like, I'll get more of some credit here. It was pretty good. And what I'm saying is, we would get an alert. We're like, boom, it's like somebody else COVID. I'm like, what? No signs, no symptoms. And then days, body temperature go up. Boom. Well, it's, it's combination. respiratory rate, body temperature and handle fluid things. And they had this like fancy algorithm. They just opened it up like publicly last year's. My friend, actually, actually, Mason's the one that's Susan Bobber with all that studies with that. Do you just fantastic? Yeah. Like, all that's tell you, like, I didn't look at the data. I didn't read the papers. But for our athletes, that gives pretty much spot on like, damn. And you like, have a data prepared, like, okay, great. You're going to get COVID tomorrow. Like, we just knew what's happening. So those things can be pretty sensitive. Even again, that's a wearable on their finger. And they were able to get good enough with their data to figure out, you're going to get sick the next day. So it can be, yes, stress, it can be nutrition. It can be actual, like bacterial viral infection, environmental exposure on allergens, tons of things like that can flag by the main people. Breathe more. Now, with this change in respiratory rate, indicate someone is transitioning from, like, functional overreaching to non functional reaching. Maybe you can explain what that is. Yeah. And then we can talk a little bit about, like, if that is a good indicator, with the best indicators are that. Yeah. Right. I mean, I got the way you feel as well. I don't know where that comes into, you're able to determine that. Yeah. Okay. Great. In order for you to create adaptation, we have to put in stress. That's how the body moves. Minovers itself. The more stressed, the more adaptation. At some point, though, too much stress overwhelms the system. And we start having negative adaptations. We start going backwards. We stop making progress. And eventually, actually, things get worse. You get hurt. You get injured. So I want to support. At the end of that station, that is overtraining. True physiological overtraining is very rare. It tends to take weeks if not months to recover from. This is not, you're not overtrained. If you're like, oh, I had to take Saturday off. I feel way better today. That's not overtrained. Overtrained is I couldn't exercise for two months, and then I finally started feeling better. So it's really uncommon. It does happen. Uncommon. Before that, you get into what's called non functional overreaching. So you're overreaching. You're pushing your body past where it should do. And you did it so much that when you actually recovered, you didn't get any positive adaptations. It was not functional. It didn't produce a benefit. So if you were to go this in the spectrum, right now, if you were not to go train, we got done. We would go left. Our acute performance would be worse because we're tired. Great. But then we rest and we come back tomorrow. Next day, our performance is better. If we keep doing that, though, we keep training, and we don't give ourselves enough time to recover, we'll eventually go down and perform it down and perform it down and perform it. And then if we take some time to recover, we should have this super compensation. That would be a situation when in which we overreached, but it was functional because it produced a benefit, produced performance at hands with more model congenery, more muscle, you know, filling the blank for whatever you want. So we have functional overreaching. That's what we're after. It was functional. We have non functional. You'll keep going either train too much, you underrecovered or both. And then you had to take weeks off, typically days off or weeks off, and you got back to baseline. And then overreaching is past that. That's the foundation that that's what we're really getting at. We want to spend as much time in functional overreaching as we can. And when we back out, we have, again, ideally a super compensation. We got the adaptation we're looking for. If you really get an overtraining, it's hard to define because there's no marker of. We actually have this really cool um Philip Larson, his lab in Carla's Institute has published a bunch of really cool papers. This is a handful of very specific model congeny markers that they've identified. They can actually see overtraining happening before any other signal of them. There's like six or eight different metabolites they've got that they've published. It's really interesting stuff. I actually think they're on a something pretty smart there. But because of that, like this is one of the exercise science problems. Like what are the signs of of true overtraining? I don't know, you're tired. You're hungry. Maybe you're sleeping more. Maybe you're sleeping less. Maybe you're not hungry. Like it's kind of like everything. There's no this. It is just like, well, we saw people that were overtrained and then some of them had less energy. Some of them had more. It's all over the board, right? There's no class. Like there's there's these classical literature on things like testosterone and cortisol ratio and cortisol DHA ratios and there's lots of other little market. But there's no one specific biomarker or performance marker or subjective marker or sleep marker that is like the definitive, yes, your diagnosis with overtraining. Like that doesn't exist. So it's a combination of all these things that we're looking at to try to determine whether or not somebody's in that spot or whether they're functionally overreached or non-functionally overreached. So it's a pretty messy situation to be told beyond us with it. So we don't exactly know what we're doing. All that then our line saying, all right, how does somebody know? I don't know. Take it a off. Do you feel better? Yeah, I feel way better. Okay, probably functionally overreached or non-functionally overreached. That's good. Good position to be in. Took a week off. Still feel terrible. Okay, now we might need to deploy some more aggressive solutions because you may have actually pushed way past that limit. So that's that is really the best way to think about overall overtraining. What happens to someone's hormones like testosterone, for example, when they're in non-functional overtraining and then. So generally what's going to happen along that entire cascade in all that you're going to be less than a ballic? Good. Good. Good non-functional overreaching. Yeah, yeah, no, I got you. It's it's it's it's it's going to be okay. So you're going to so you're going to start off and things get worse testosterone will go down. If you stay it there, if you're not getting back into the functional overreaching. Yeah, like so let's just say we start we're not working out. We haven't trained in in a month and then we pick it up again. You and we get after we're going. The first couple of weeks we might see a reduction in basal testosterone. We've overloaded the system a little bit. Do things might get worse, right? Your physical performance might get worse fatigue is setting and this is a stressor. This is actually good. This is why you wouldn't want to come in and give yourself an anti-inflammatory. We wouldn't want to come in self give yourself like you're actually trying to induce that adaptation here. And so when you see markers that look like they're bad, this is just a signal that says you're overloaded right now. Wrestling heart rate might go up. HRV goes down. That's okay. This is the offseason for athletes. We expect these things to happen at the beginning of the offseason and we just start training again. Normal. If we continue past that, I'm sorry, I was up. If you were the word a stop and you were to start recovering more, then you'll see testosterone come right back up. Potentially almost likely not go back any higher. But it'll come right back up and performance will go higher. So like an acute and I'm defining acute as like a couple of days or a couple of weeks of something like testosterone going down early in a training phase. It's very normal. It might stay the same, but it might come down a little bit. And if it does come down a little bit, I'm not stopping training. I'm not backing off unless we're seeing signs of like extreme fatigue or pain or whatever. But that little bit of like short term, what looks like a negative thing is not. It's a normal physiological response. If we were to keep going though, we didn't bring you out of that. And then we got into something like non functional overreaching. Then the testosterone is still going to be down or potentially lower. But then you'll start seeing the things of, now my performance has been down. It's been down for three weeks. It's been down for five weeks. It's not coming back up. Okay. Sleep issues, hunger issues, or a motivation issues. You continue to go and you get it to intro over training. Now almost surely antivalacharmones are down. The few studies directly on actual overtraining suggested that that something like a testosterone recovery might take a while. It can really struggle to come back typically when somebody's like a little bit overreached. Even if their testosterone is down, a couple of days off comes back. Like it flies right back up. It's not really a compromised endological system there. It's just an acute fatigue. What about in women? It's the same thing. It's obviously testosterone total amount of the lower. But same exact curve, basically. Okay. So most people probably aren't. I mean, there's athletes that might be consistently in non functional overreaching, especially if they're, they keep that vicious cycle of their trying to train more to get better and they don't recover or they don't allow for enough recovery. I'd say we've seen it more non-athletes and athletes. Really? Yeah, way more. Because an athlete's generally pretty entuned. And they're like, oh, I don't want to do this thing of whatever. You'll get feedback from them. It's oftentimes the hard charging CEOs. This is the like, I'm burning the bridge. I'm I'm on oftentimes a lot of stimulants or other things. I'm running a company. I'm doing this. I'm traveling a bunch and then, oh, yeah, I do all I do is high-intensity exercise training. And then because of that, I'm on a lot of stimulants, like I said, and then all you have them, my sleep's not great. It's inconsistent. I'm in different time zones. I don't see my kit. It's that whole thing that goes, woo. Elastatic logis gets through the roof and there's no payback. That's the people we've seen more in the non functional overreaching. And then they wonder why they're plateaued. Yeah. They're not getting anywhere. I only, like, there's a few times while I get like, like, like, like, okay, I got to just not work out today because I just wake up and I feel tired. Yep. How much do you do when you're on training days, when you're working out hard, do you require a more sleep? That's actually, we didn't, okay, I'm on laughing here because that makes intuitive sense, right? And we have a number, like, we work with, um, I have a company absolute rest and we have the most famous, you would know the name, sleep scientists in the world, right? The most published ones. I've asked that question so many times. Nobody has a direct answer. It makes sense, right? I burn more calories today. I should sleep more. There's no compelling scientific evidence to suggest that caloric expenditure is directly tied to minutes of sleep needed. That said, like, Jeffrey Jermer has done this for 30 years. He's like, there is. Like, he just, he's saying, I'm telling you clinically, that happens. So I'm like, very much laughing, and you see that because I'm like, man, I know what the science says on that, but my experience is different. And Jeff is like, no, the higher output sports need more sleep. High volume people need more sleep. People that are like professional athletes, but they don't have a lot of chloroquist expenditure. Don't seem to need as much sleep. I defer to Jeff on this one. I'm like, I think he's actually right. I think they same. So it's very funny in question. But is that like true in a day to day basis? I don't think so. I don't think just because you train really hard today. You have to have more sleep tomorrow. I think on average over weeks, that might probably line up, but that's the best we can answer it. Because you know, the opposite is true, right? If you're not getting enough sleep. No, yeah. Then it's going to affect your performance. It's going to affect your adaptations. I mean, everything, right? So there is nothing we can do to enhance performance more this so there's no supplement. There's nothing that's even close. Right. So sleep is like the best. I mean, and it's part of the recovery, right? Again, recovery is so important for performance. When you ask about recovery earlier, that's our first step. How does how does a person know if they are really getting enough sleep? Because as you mentioned, all these sleep trackers and this is that. I got, you know, I'm clearly very biased here. This is what my company does at a very high level. Right? So I have a vested interest in a different answer here than probably most. Well, we spend a lot of time. I've been fortunate to work with many of the highest paid athletes in the world where we had unlimited funds to do anything. And we know what the same time sleep is so critically important. But the best thing we could do is send them in like a sleep clinic or a consumer wearable. And it was like killing me. I'm like, how is there not better sleep solutions than these? That's why we went and built up suit rest. How do we know if it's enough? We do it differently. We actually have a bunch of direct measures of follow-up cognitive and physical performance. So we determine high quality sleep as a function of how you actually performing. So that is a different answer for everybody. It can be a time domain. It can be, there's actually one of the markers we use is actually called sleep quality index. It's FDA approved tons of evidence behind it. That metric alone is an okay single number. If you want to use it, but that has a lot of validation behind it. We start there. But like I said, sometimes it is a numbers game. It is a total amount of hours. Past that it's way more interesting stuff than sleep staging. Sleep staging is is like not a good way at all to think about sleep quality. More interesting are things like fragmentation. Sleep stability. Sleep range. The amount of time you send in those arbitrary sleep stages varies wildly by cognitive demand. Your body is not asked to do the same things on every day. So it's not going to have the same sleep architecture every day. So the way that we define high quality sleep completely different. What we are working on right now actually is direct testing of next day cognitive function. That's how we backfill sleep quality. And sleep timing. And so we want to actually develop methodologies in which we're like we will actually test a whole bunch of different cognitive functions and we can determine what is actually effective for you based on your actual functionality rather than an arbitrary set of numbers. If that is like what the LZ talking about back all the way up into sleep. How do you define the quality sleep for you? How is your daytime function? That is your thing. Are you fatigued? Are you sleep without the day? Everyone is going to be somewhat sleepy, particularly in the afternoon. Right? But is it detrimental to your performance? How are you performing cognitively? How are you performing physically? Right? And then how much strain are you under? If you're happy with all those things, then I would say you have good sleep quality. We don't have to, we don't have to get any piece of technology past that. If you're failing or you're like slightly subopting in one of those areas, then we might have to do some tinkering might have to do some follow up. But if you're like I wake up, I'm a little bit tired in the morning but like that's normal. Yeah, I like I have a coffee and then I feel fine, a little bit tired in the afternoon, but I train, I feel good. You probably say pretty good. That's a pretty good marker. It's not that let's talk with. I don't know. You don't need to go out and get yourself tested. This kind of, I feel like all those things like how you feel, I used to do all the sleep tracking and or ring and I do have an eight-sleep bed which tracks my sleep well. And the only time I use it, I mean, I use the cool thing all that, but the only time I look at my data is if I'm like I go out with friends and I'm like I'm like I just I know I got like six hours sleep or something like curious, you know? I feel like the next day too. Then it's like that's when I use it. But you know measures my resting heart rate too. I'll look at that. Sure. It's not as probably as good as wearing the or ring, but yeah, I think that there's a lot of benefit in calibration in awareness, in accountability. So I actually don't even care which tracker you use or the accuracy. Because for those three things, it's great. Here's examples. Some people have no idea other sleeping. Like oh yeah, I sleep six hours and I sleep five hours and I think you're looking like you sleep eight hours and I think you know no idea what good. So a tracker accurate or not, it's good for accountability. When people know they're being watched, they make better decisions, right? It's good for awareness. So pick your poison. I have it multiple eight sleeps actually at my house. They're great. I love them. Awesome. Use that. Use or use whatever you want to do. If you're actually trying to get into the nitty gritty of sleep details, then like you need to take an appropriate look and appropriate set of technologies, not not those ones. But if you don't care about that, there's tons of benefits from people just like getting somewhat aware and being held kind of accountable. People generally make better decisions, especially again, the folks that we work with, we're, they know we're going to look. They know someone's going to be like, what did you do? And then they have to answer that question. They just tend to make slightly better decisions. What are some of the highest impact behaviors like adjustments to improve overall sleep quality? I mean, I heard you're talking about hydration in for hours and learned a lot. I talk about everything. Yeah, I look around. But what I really, what I realized, you know, I like to drink hot tea, especially in the winter time, like in the evening. Yeah. Orble tea. And it is just detrimental to my sleep, because I'll have to wake up and pee once or twice. If twice is like the worst. But I've been convinced that I have to like starve myself of water or go to bed, like hours. Like, you know, I like in the three hours before bed, it's, it's water fasting, like little, little bits of water. And then I can make it through the night without getting up once. And it's amazing. So I'd love to know. I mean, there's a lot of sleep hygiene. And of course, you can talk about that. But like some of the high impact behaviors. Maybe things that people don't realize. Yeah. You know all the big stuff. I'll skip past it. Okay. You got it all cold, dark. You know, blah, blah. Past that hydration is one of them. My expectation is for people to wake up at most ones per night. I would like to get you zero. It's not always realistic. Past once per night now we have something to fix for most people. If you're causing the damage by drinking too much water at night, then let's stop that. I drink tea pretty much right before bed at night. Generally, I'm okay with it. If it's not, then then back it off. And if that means you have to go back to three hours, then that's what you got. I have the tea at four o'clock in the afternoon. I guess. I don't know. I have a back there. Okay. No problem there. Other stuff that people generally don't think about a couple of things. Feteague and falling a sleep at night does not necessarily equate to down regulation. So we have something called a wind down index. I have a whole bunch of metrics we can look at. This is very common for the person who wakes up at two or three in the morning. Any of that happens all the time. Or when they wake up at two or three in the morning, they can't get back to sleep. Really strongly tied to lack of wind down index. And so what does that mean? Just like with your kid, you probably have a 60 to 90 minute routine that that person goes through and you even realize it. But that is really critically important to getting you to land in the right spot. Your routine is probably 15 minutes. Right now yours, but you don't even. And so having a more appropriate game plan of what that is, it doesn't mean to have to avoid light. Doesn't mean you have to avoid TV. Doesn't mean you have to sleep with your phone in a different room. You can do all those things. You don't have to. We have tremendous high-resolient sleepers that do all those things. But it is about a consistent routine number one. Just try to do the same thing as often as you possibly can. We'll work out switching out behaviors a little bit later. That's another one. A ventilation in the room is critically important. People don't pay attention to this. One of the biggest reasons people wake up at the night is because they can't breathe through their nose. One of the biggest reasons you can't breathe through their nose is dander, pollen, allergens, something like that. Start to blog it up. Whether that's completely blocked or not, but then you open up and you start mouth breathing. Mouth breathing then means your tongue is a bigger issue. As well as your mouth can get dehydrated or get dry rather and you have a little bit of dry mouth and you need to have a drink of water at night. These things can happen. This will wake people up at time. You want to make sure that you have proper ventilation in your room. One of the things that also happens in this is CO2. CO2 levels rise above 9 and a part is per million. This will significantly and dramatically affect everything from sleep onset, sleep quality. Next day perceived fatigue. Next day arithmetic ability. CO2 getting too high in a room can happen because your doors and windows are all closed. If you have multiple bodies, you and your partner, your dog is in there. All of you are now kicking out CO2 into the room. You're exhaling. If that room is small and again lack of ventilation, that number starts to rise. If you are particularly sensitive to CO2 as well, which many people are, then that kicks off that entire cascade. You get pushed way more into sympathetic drive. And again, the biggest issue is you will see a subjective and objective massive change in fatigue and energy and cognitive function the next day. People rarely think talk about CO2 concentrations in your room. This is a classic case of like I do all the things. I've listened to Matt Walker. I do all of it and I still suck at sleep. You start thinking about what's going on in your physical environment. Okay, so CO2 monitor. I have one. So getting a CO2 monitor. What's the number? 900 parts per million. So you don't want to be above that. Yep. You will see typically 1,200, 1300 in people like really consistently. That's not that bad. Most of the problems happen at like 2,000, 2500, 3000. So if you're freaking out, you're like, oh my god, I only said 900 and I'm at 1000. Okay. Don't worry about it. So what do you do to improve your airflow? I mean, just open a window. Okay, you have tons of combinations of things you can do here on both ends of spectrum. Number one, you can actually just become more resilient to CO2. So if you work on your CO2 tolerance, this will help, especially if you're CO2 intolerant. Outside of that, lower the amount in the room. If you can't open up windows at night, that's great. If you can have less bodies in your room, that's great. Those two things are generally not very much of an option for people. Awesome. Can you get high ventilation in that room before you go to bed? Have your doors and windows open? Get that number down. When I used to live here in LA, our house was probably, I don't know, 2400 square feet, multiple level. And we're in LA, so our doors and windows were closed because their quality is just, it is what it is here. It would not be uncommon for us to just, by the time it's like 7 o'clock at night, have 2,200 parts from moon, like, oh my gosh, it's up there. And it would take us hours to open up windows and just let the CO2 clear in the house. You're talking about 4 humans, 2 dogs, and even in a pretty big place, that feels up pretty fast. So can you start that process earlier? As early in the day, can you open up windows in the house? If not, at least open up your sleeping space so that air flow can get in and out of that. If you need to turn a physical fan on to do that, that's another option. And it will drop pretty fast by doing that. Okay. What about people's nose that are closing up? I mean, you know, if you have a lot of pollen, let's say you have pet down to her. I mean, do you have to get these allergen pillow cases? Like how do you, how do you stop your nose from closing up? Okay. So a bunch of different things there as well. One, same exact answer. Try to get as much of that clear out of there as possible before the night time starts. Right. Now you'll particularly see this with people who are like, my nose is fine throughout the day. And I just wake up at night. It's only happens at night. Only happens in my bedroom when you lay down or start. Part of that's gravity. Part of that's physically gravity. Like you're laying up here or standing up here and you go backwards and then it's going to sit there. Like part of is that. So number one, do all the things I just talked about, cleaning the air out of there. If you want to get an air filter and then specifically put it in or above or around your bedroom, that is a great option. Do you can go there's an next step. Third step is you can just use flownAs. You can use a very simple nasal dilator. Right. So whether this is actually like a nose strip that you can put on, use a bunch of different companies for this or an actual like injection. Like again, like a flownAs and you can squirting your nose before bed, dilate your nose. You can stop having problems that way. So there's three or four different things you can try. We've used and we'll use all those things pretty consistently and they're all pretty beneficial and they work pretty well. There's there's some amount of just like like morning gunk you'll have. That's normal. That's okay. But if this is consistently waking up with dry mouth and nose completely clogged, then now I would do all those steps. Pass that. Then you got to really start thinking about special pillow cases and different solutions like that. But those are more expensive. The rest of stuff I mentioned is cheaper. So if you're going to, let's say have the three highest impact behavior changes to improve sleep. Yeah. I'd say like have a consistent approach. Timing system, whatever you want to be, routine number one and I want to be really clear. I know I'm running out but that doesn't mean like 45 minutes of breath work and meditation like that's not the routine. The routine can just simply be, I do the dishes and then I brush my teeth and then I check my, like that is fine for the routine. It doesn't have to be this big like 90 minute. My phone's gone and like that's not what I'm referring to. Just do the same thing as much as you can in the same order in the same routine. Number two, make sure that your physical environment past temperature, past sound, past light, like you're taking a caution that. If you don't have a CO2 sensor or an environmental scanner, we send that out to everybody so they always have those just open up the ventilation anyways. So you can do those steps regardless of the testing. So that'd be my second biggest one. Another one that I would maybe say pop off that's abnormal. Yeah, honestly like the wind on in the X is pretty popular. So making sure just because you're fatigued and you're going to fall asleep quickly that you're still doing something to make sure that your peristimbed that system is actually turned on. That's a little bit different. So we always say like turn on the off switch. We want to do so. Whatever that takes for you to do it. Some people that's reading. Other people that's not. For me, a reading doesn't do it for me. Brother work will not do it for me. I actually have to have something that physically triggers my brain of like gives me permission to let go for the day. That means I'm doing something that is so unproductive. I'm probably like reading some blog that for other people read about what the CLC did with their 12 string wide receiver. Like something that is like clearly not work related for me that is what I feel like is a waste of time. That is just a trigger for me to go. Yeah, it's your time. You don't have to be productive. You don't have to answer anybody like all the input. Everybody wants something from you all day. Your space. So I'm doing that. I'm watching something non like inspiring or motivational on TV. Whatever the case is, right? Like a tonting videos for me that's like outdoors stuff. I'm like watching cool things like that. They makes me super happy and I check out. That doesn't work for me for Natasha. That doesn't work for it all. Whatever it is that cues you that your day is over. You give your brain permission to be done for the day. That's it. So that would be my three big areas that people can try. I love it. It's funny. That's um, I do those things and I didn't realize that the routine really is when I break my routine. I have a hard time falling asleep. Yeah. And and my routine is like a simple thing. You know where it's like, you know, I I brush my teeth, I wash my face and then I read the non completely non work related thing as well. It's got to be like, like I never get on Instagram. I don't get on social media. Like I can't it's too work. It's work for me. It's hard. It's so yeah. It's got to be like completely separate from work. What do you like relaxing music? It depends on books or or no, no, no, no. So I do like I haven't been reading books at night in a while now. I read them during the day because the light component. Yeah. But no, I'll I'll just read like new stuff or on your phone on my phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Um, it oftentimes will be um, I will read like some cool science stuff. But it's not necessarily like health. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't feel like it's, you know, my work. Yeah. Yeah. Technology or whatever other fun stuff relaxing music. We play. I like hear some relaxing music that also helps like yeah. But um, no, this has been super awesome. Andy, I really appreciate you coming out. And let's let's talk about you've got this podcast perform. You talk all about, I mean, it's you and also other guests you have on that are experts. Yeah. The um, it's seasonal. So we did 10 episodes of first season and then we took five or six months off. And then season two was out now. No guests season one, just me going nuts. And then we brought in some guests this season and uh, we're actually going to finish up filming tomorrow. We'll be done for this season. We'll take a little break. And then another set will come out later in the fall. So I can't do the, I don't know how you all do it. Like the, the consistent podcast is a, it takes my soul in a good way. Um, yeah, super fun. I appreciate you bring that up. It's um, you know, like performance is naming a game like we want to help people perform with their best. Whatever that means to them, like however that means them. So yeah, I enjoy it. Love it. Uh, and yeah, thanks for bringing it up. Yeah, you've got a couple other things you mentioned throughout the podcast too. Yeah, um, obviously we're building that human performance center in Dallas, which is really awesome. I can't wait to share with people some of the technology that we built inside that thing. It doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. It's like super exciting. The ability for us to conduct research out of their, to do studies that I've wanted to do for decades. You know, it's like, well, that's just not feasible anymore. Um, the, the team down there at Parker has removed those barriers. They're like, make it world class and we're making it world class. We're doing a study right now. Actually, there were actually a lot of people were creating for maybe I can pitch that if that's cool with you. We're uh, my, my grad student zone. He came with me from California and Federica. They're running a study where we're looking at sleep across the menstrual cycle. Studying enough, there's not a lot of research on this and the stuff that's been done is questionnaires and maybe like a PSG, like two days here, two days, two days at the end of the cycle or something. So there's still a bunch of understalled questions about what actually happens to sleep quality throughout the menstrual cycle. And so we're actively recruiting. So if you are female and you are interested in this, I would like love love to have you involved in our study. You can be anywhere. You don't have to be in Dallas. So it's open. We're recruiting work. We're doing an open protocol. You get a bunch of stuff with it. But we're going to run full clinical grade FDA approved sleep analysis every night throughout the entire cycle. Um, so we'll do psychome app and we'll do blood with you urine. We'll do a bunch of cognitive stuff. And so we're really going to see like, is sleep changing in people with the normal menstrual cycle across the window. What age range? 18 to 35. So younger healthier, you know, all that stuff. We really wanted to do it actually. Matt was trying to get us to do this and and manifest stuff. And I was like, I want to. But I got to answer one question, like at a time, rather than do it a time. So it's just cool stuff like that that we can do because of some of the technology we have. Um, but yeah, we're actually recruiting. That's our first like big study out of there. And then we got a bunch of other ones. But yeah, the performance center should be open next year. Hopefully that's exciting. And people come down and check it out. It'll be open to public too. Yeah. I'm heading to Dallas in April. Maybe back again. But yeah, I'll drop you a line when I when I had a back there. Yeah, let us know. Super excited about that. Um, yeah, then grad students too. If you want to come to grad school, we have an online program. So we can get a master's in strength and performance with me. That's fully virtual or you can come in person and then work on our lab where we have a lot of projects. So welcome all the bodies. So bring it. Every time I said that people like, oh my god, you're in blocks. I'm like, I don't care. Bring them all. That's awesome. That's awesome. Well, next time I'd love to, uh, we talked a lot about nutrition and supplements and recovery. I'd love to get into strength training and protocols and resistance training, strength training, hypertrophy training. Yeah. You know, I got to tell you something before you leave and go out of here. I'm so proud of you. The fact that you post those strength training videos and I know what happens in the comments section to that. Like it's everything of me not just be like, I'm like, I'm around everybody on there. But it is really hard for people to post stuff like that. When you know you're, you're, and you know what's going to happen. But you're very courageous putting that stuff up there. I think it helps a lot of women. I think it's dope as fuck. I think it's the coolest thing. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. No, I mean, I'm, uh, you know, starting out and I think I think it's great. And I want to encourage other women too. Yeah. Love it. Awesome. Thank you so much, Andy. Been a real pleasure having you on. Appreciate it. Can't wait, uh, can't wait to chat again and this has been so long coming.

Hello everyone. I'm sitting here with Dr. Ashley Mason, who is the director of the sleep eating an affect laboratory at the OSHA Center for Integrative Medicine at UCSF. I'm super excited to have her here today. She specializes in various different non-pharmicological treatments for changing behaviors, I guess, whether that's sleep or eating behavior disorders or affect disorders. So move disorders. And I've had two of your former mentors on the podcast, Dr. Alyssa Epel, who I believe was your post-doctoral advisor, UCSF, and your former graduate advisor, Dr. Charles Rezon, one of my favorite podcast guests, who's done a phenomenal job on starting this whole body of research on the effects of whole body hypothermia for treating affect disorders like mood disorders and depression. So, super excited to dive into all that with you today, but maybe we can start with some of our overlapping passions with getting hot. Absolutely, absolutely. Well, thank you so much for having me here today. Long time fan of the show. It's really exciting to be sitting here with you. Yes, I'm super passionate about sauna and whole body hypothermia protocols and they're entry into the space of treating mental health disorders. I think it's a really exciting area. So maybe you could refresh the viewers or listeners memory or even people that are not familiar with the podcast we had with Dr. Charles Rezon, where he discussed. People are familiar with the term sauna and they know a lot of people use the sauna or they've seen it at their gym. But whole body hypothermia is a new term for a lot of people. And it's a really important one because there is a, that is what clinically was used or is used to treat, where it's shown to help treat depression. And it's a, can you explain the little blue nuance there with whole body hypothermia and how that's different from just going in the sauna. Sure, sure. So it's, it's an emerging field. And like you said, a lot of people are familiar with sauna. It's at their gym. It's maybe even in their house. It's when they go on vacation. And going in the sauna and sweating and then leaving it is very pleasurable. It is often relaxing, calming people enjoy doing it. They often report that they feel better afterward. Whole body hypothermia protocols are a little bit more intense. So if you asked someone who went into one of the saunas and one of the studies that I'm sure we're going to talk about today, they might just not tell you it was a spa like experience. And it's very intense. There's a lot of sweating and you get very, very hot. And whereas with sauna, you might go in it for 15, 20 minutes. Go out of the sauna to cool down for a bit. Go back in with whole body hypothermia protocols. You're getting heated pretty consistently for quite a while until you're on the other side and you're going to be done. It's not so much a going and going out and going in process. And with whole body hypothermia protocols, especially in studies, there've been a lot more steps to control the experience than say going to a sauna at your gym. And we can get into what some of those are if we want to talk about the specific studies. But they're pretty different experiences, although they both involve heat. And maybe like let's talk a little bit about some of the preliminary findings that got you interested in this research and then in first place. Yeah, absolutely. So in 2016, this paper came out by Janssen and a bunch of other co-authors, where they reported on a whole body hypothermia protocol that they had used to test as a treatment for clinical depression. And this study was impressive for a number of reasons. They recruited 30-some odd participants who had pretty significant depression and they randomized half of them to get a whole body hypothermia treatment or half of them to get a sham whole body hypothermia treatment. And I'm going to talk about what the differences are there in a second. But it was a very good idea for a placebo condition for this study. So the whole body hypothermia condition, the folks randomized to receive this were put into a kind of whole body hypothermia she involved in for ad heating lamps. And this is a pretty fancy machine. They run about $50,000. You only find them in hospitals. They're made in Germany. It's called the Heckl. And it's a pretty involved experience. So these people who were randomized to receive whole body hypothermia went into this sonotent, if you will, the Heckl machine. And they were heated until they reached a core body temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. After that time, the sonot was turned off and they stayed in their anyway for another hour just lying there. And during that time, their temperature actually continued to rise all the way up to about 38.85 or so degrees Celsius. And all during that time, they are sweating, sweating, sweating, they are hot. And what's really important to know about this sonotent is that their head is outside of the sonotent. So you asked about one of the differences between regular sonotent and whole body hypothermia. This is a major one. When you go into a sonot, your whole body is going into the sonotent, including your head. With these whole body hypothermia protocols, in many cases, your head is not in the heating element. It's outside of it. So you can be drinking. The person can be attending to your head, putting cool cloths on it, and so on, like they did in that Jansson study. Now the other half of the people who didn't get the whole body hypothermia, they were actually put in that same machine. But it wasn't turned on to be very hot. And they, the lamps turned on. And they got a little bit warm. But they didn't get anywhere near as warm. I think it was like 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, that they, that the control condition got into. The other half of the body hypothermia is that the authors of the study actually asked all of the participants. So what do you think you got? Do you think you got the real deal, the whole body hypothermia? Or do you think you got the control condition? Some 71% of people in that control condition thought they got the actual sonotent treatment. So why is that exciting? Because when you actually look at the change in the depression scores for these people, it was pretty remarkable. The drops in depression within a week were pretty impressive. And what's more, those drops were maintained six weeks later. And this was one whole body hypothermia session. And so the difference between the groups was pretty notable six weeks out, and especially one week out. And this study caught my eye for a few reasons. One is that as a whole, in this country, many other countries were not just great at treating depression. It's a big problem. And I depressants work for many people, therapy works for many people, but we still have a long way to go and developing treatments for depression. And when you see a treatment like that, with that strong of a control condition, and those effect sizes and those reductions in depression, it catches your eye. So I got really excited about that. Started looking more into what else has been done with this, and it turned out there was one other study in 2013, the Hanush paper, where they just recruited depressed participants. They gave them the sonotent session, and then they looked at them afterward. And there's some really neat striking findings about that study as well. But it was a single arm study. So there was no control condition. But those two studies got me really excited and started me down this path, in particular with looking at temperature. You said, for the, there was a couple of things you said, with, with, you know, Dr. Charles Razon's study, 2006 study, with this Hekel machine, with a body help with the army. That are really important. And, and those are that one, you said that there was an effect within just a week of treatment, which is quite quickly. It's soon. I mean, like, if you think about classical like serotonin, re-uptake inhibitors, which SSRIs, which are used very, you know, widely for, you know, depression treatment, they don't work that quick. They don't work immediately like that. So that was one thing. And to get your thoughts in too, the fact that they did one session and it lasted six weeks. Like they didn't have to keep going every day or even every week. I mean, they just did it once. And it was a six week, like there was a, a lasting effect. Yeah. So what are your thoughts? Oh, it was, it was pretty, it was a big moment for me. And what I realized when I was thinking about that very SSRI thing was that, well, wait a minute, what do SSRIs have in common with all of this? And I went back and I looked at some of the SSRI literature. And it turns out that one of the most common side effects of SSRIs is hyperhydrosis. It's sweating. So then I thought, huh, sweating, the, one of the most common side effects of SSRIs. And yet with whole body hyperthermia, what are we actually doing? We should probably actually go back into, into why this, some of the mechanisms a little bit here with this. But that really made me think, okay, wait a minute, do we have actual data now? Has anybody published on whether sweating in response to SSRIs is associated with if they are effective or not? I'm actually not aware of a paper that has done that. It'd be a great paper and a great analysis to do. I hope someone's working on it. I'd love to work on it. There's a lot of data that we could use to test that. But getting back to your question about while this works really fast. Yeah. SSRIs take weeks can take months before they start to work, whereas Dr. Ray's on notice these effects in just a week in his study design. And yes, they did last out six weeks. Now they didn't measure beyond six weeks. So we don't know what happened and that's a key area future research. But maybe we should talk a little bit about the hypothesis underlying why this might be working. And that's where my mind went after I saw that 2016 paper. I thought my goodness, what's going on here. Well, it turns out there is literature showing temperature dysregulation in people with depression back early 1980, the 82 and then 97 are researchers. Dr. Avery published some work showing that people with depression often have higher night time body temperatures. And they're not as good at thermoregulatory cooling. They don't sweat as much to cool themselves down. And what's also been interesting is that there's other work that shows that when people with depression get better, when their depression symptoms lessen, their core body temperature also can decrease. And that's in the context of other treatments that aren't related to sonatryment. For example, electrocubulsive therapy, ECT. There's a paper that showed that with successful ECT treatment, the patient's temperatures dropped alongside their depression. And from that high-neutral paper, that single arm sonatryle, what they found was that the decrease in body temperature was correlated with the decrease in depression. And they measured that decrease in body temperature pretty carefully. They were using an indwelling rectal probe. So they were really measuring it those five days afterward. And that says something about the mechanism here with body temperature. And thermal regulation, perhaps somehow sonatryle is changing the thermos. Turn it on. Yeah. Now, this is when you're talking about clinically depressed people. Most people experience depressive symptoms in their lives because of events that happen via death of a loved one or stress from work or financial stress or relationships stress. I mean, there's a lot of life experiences that can cause people to be sad. But you're talking about something different here. Yeah. Right. You're talking about a clinical type of depression, which isn't just feeling sad because you're anxious because of a certain experience. Being depressed or down most of the day, nearly every day for quite a few days. This is major depressive disorder. So it's an actual mental health disorder. Right. And those people, like you were saying, there's a correlation between not regulating the body temperature like correctly and that type of. In some studies, there are some samples. And again, these are small samples. But what the researchers have found is that these patients body temperatures are higher and that when their depression symptoms improve, the body temperature is decreased. So there's something there. And also that these people's body temperatures just tend to run hotter than other non depressed samples. Do you know if this is optopic, but do you know if stress itself or stress hormones or that something there changes the thermoregatory system? So for example, if someone were to have like some sort of serious stress, like a death death of a loved one or something. Like, and the stress, do you think that could possibly cause dysregulation of that system as or, um, I can't stick off the wall question kind of. I can't speak to the data, but the, because I don't know the data on that, but it seems plausible that if we become really distressed and start to experience some of the symptoms that people with major depressive disorder are experiencing. And we're experiencing them and it's somewhat of a prolonged way that we could develop that, but we just don't have the data right now. Yeah. There's a lot of depression that is situational as you describe a lot, but there's also depression that's biological. Yes. And so we don't know so much which camp that's fine. Right. I think, um, another plausible mechanism. I know Chuck and I are Dr. Charles Resonis and I discussed this and you and I as well, and conversations that we've had, but inflammation and this I know like there are studies that have shown you can take a healthy individual who is not known to have any sort of clinical depression. And you can inject them with lipopolysaccharide, which is, you know, a piece of the out of membrane of bacteria. And it causes a very potent inflammatory response in humans. You inject them with a lipopolysaccharide and they have an inflammatory response. They have activation of the immune system. The body's like, oh bacteria, I got to fight it off. Don't want to get sick. So inflammation's generated. And as you know, and we talked about a lot in the podcast, you know, inflammatory molecules cross over the blood brain barrier. And they disrupt neurotransmission in there, all sorts of things happening. You know, microglial activation. And what's been shown is that people experience healthy people experience depressive symptoms after being injected with this lipopolysaccharide versus a saline control. So people individuals that were injected with salt water to have those depressive symptoms. I think did some sort of questionnaire or scale of which you are familiar with, probably, but not me. But what was interesting is that in addition to that, people were given a high dose of EPA, which is one of the marino megatri fatty acids. That's very potent at negating inflammation. And the people that were given that and injected with lipopolysaccharide didn't experience the depressive symptoms. What I'm getting at here is that, you know, it seems as though that study itself and there's actually more than one that showed this. Could you could, you could cause or induce depressive symptoms in healthy individuals just by causing inflammation. And you could prevent that by giving someone in, quote, unquote, something that's anti inflammatory, which I thought was so impressive and amazing and important because, you know, inflammation, there's so many sources of inflammation, so many different lifestyle factors obviously, you know, sickness. I mean, people do feel depressed when they're sick too. But, but the sauna and inflammation and how the sauna affects inflammation is a whole other interesting area. And particularly because, you know, we know for a fact that lifestyle factors that can improve depression and, you know, your, your specialty is non-pharmaclactric treatments. And so, you know, of course, exercise is one of the big ones, right? I mean, exercise has been shown in multiple studies to help improve depressive symptoms and people with drug resistant, you know, major depressive disorder and or have clinical depression. And of course, that's not it's not easy to get someone who's depressed to exercise. But the fact of the matter is that it does work in some cases, not all the time, but it does work. And the sauna, in, in, there's many different ways that the sauna does mimic cardiovascular, moderate cardiovascular exercise. We have a lot of the same physiological responses, the increase in blood flow to the skin, the, the sweating to cool down the core body temperature, which increases with aerobic exercise. It also increases with sauna, elevated heart rate, you know, blood pressure changes, the blood pressure increases while you're exercising or while you're in the sauna, then afterwards it goes down even below baseline levels. So lots of different similarities and of course there's been head to head comparisons comparing moderate aerobic exercise to sauna use. So there's definitely some overlap there. What are your thoughts on like well, maybe this is also helping depression in a similar way that exercise or specifically cardiovascular exercise would. Yeah, absolutely. I think the pathway is totally plausible, but you hit the nail on the head a lot of times we would love it if we could get people with depression to exercise. But that is just too much to ask in a lot of cases. It's also the case that not everybody can necessarily just go and exercise and that sounds a little bit crazy, but there are actually lots of people who have injuries or other problems that prevent them from engaging in the kind of exercise they would need to do to have that anti-depressant effect, which is aerobic exercise. Right. I think running is one of the most well looked at ones and it works well for mild and moderate depression. I don't remember a bunch of these studies have divided out the depression by mild moderate and severe to look at which ones exercise works for best and I don't quite recall off top of the head at the moment which it was the best for but getting people with mild depression to exercise. I think is much more feasible than getting people with severe depression to exercise. But if we're able to actually capitalize on sauna, if people are more open to using whole body heating practices, then maybe we have an avenue in to get it some of those biological pathways that exercise is triggering, like you just described. And that's why I think it's really important to start measuring those pathways in whole body hyperthermia studies and I'm not aware of any whole body hyperthermia study looking at depression as an outcome that has measured those. So that's unarmed to do list. Right. Yeah, I mean that's something so we have you've got a couple of studies one that's probably like it was like a proof of principle that it's safe. Yeah. It's under review right now. We did a study right before COVID struck. We finished up this 25 person study to develop the protocol that we're going to be using at UCSF for our future trials. Maybe you even talked about why so you talked about this heckle machine and it's very expensive and it's you know made in Germany and but that's not what you're using now. So, maybe we can talk about what you're using and why and your personal story about how you came to it out. It's a pretty funny one. So after that paper in 2016 came out and I got all excited about the study and I emailed Chuck or Dr Charles Rayson about it and started talking about how could we do this. Research will it turned out it actually really difficult to do research with that machine without a lot of money and without a lot of resources and at the time I was pretty junior UCSF. I had just become an assistant professor just got my first big NIH grant and wanted to figure out how how can we do this and not only how can we do this in a way that's feasible in science but how can we actually develop something that could be taken out of the hospital that is actually more accessible that might even someday be able to be in all kinds of settings not just hospitals maybe something that could be transitioned into someone's home. And how can we make this more affordable? There's enough healthcare that's un affordable. What's not adds to that list. So, I decided to see what I could do and gathered a group of friends and said hey guys, we need to go and figure out if we can find a sauna that can get our core body. Temperature up as hot as this machine can. So I went to all greens and bought a whole bunch of thermometers handed about and said alright guys. Here's the list of all the different places to go and try these different saunas and there was a Russian bonia. There were a bunch of health spas. There were some other spas that have started having these infrared saunas. I have some friends who had infrared saunas in their house by that time. And everybody just started doing a bunch of testing for me and we learned really quickly that man can't get to that core body temperature because it can't stand to stay in that long. In these protocols the Janssen protocol on the Hanoosh protocol people were in the sauna for well over an hour. Two hours in the Hanoosh case and I think a hundred and seven minutes on average in the Janssen paper. Those are that's a long time to be in that little device. You'll never be in a hundred and seventy nine to be fair and high sauna for that long. Now, absolutely impossible. Absolutely not. You shouldn't know it would be detrimental to your health. Very dangerous. That idea. So you're going around sticking thermometers in your butt. Definitely. That's a lot of stuff. That was the most accurate way to measure core body temperature. That's when what increase in core body temperature was it a two or two and a half. Yeah, look at you. So on average if people run their baseline between 97 and 99 right a tube degree temperature change could meet a lot of things for different people. So I was really looking to see could people get to 101.3 because that was the temperature in the Janssen and Hanoosh protocols. And it turns out the overwhelming answer was well, no. What about 20 minutes at 190? What does that get you? I don't want 90 Fahrenheit. I don't know. That's my typical that's my typical thought. There was only one place I think that we could find that had a sauna that hot and that was a Russian Bonia in San Francisco. All the infrared ones don't get that hot actually. And so infrared definitely what's like 140. 140 to 16. You can get up there. There's a bunch of variability though. And so anyway, ultimately, I only ever had a couple of friends who were able to get that hot maybe once or twice. And they said it was relatively excruciating. They thought they were going to faint like I, And then I, you know, the descriptions that they gave me would never have passed through the institutional review board. You see that stuff. And I thought, hmm, what am I missing here? What's the key detail? But it turns out that key detail is having your head out of the sauna. So then we rebooted and started looking around for heating devices where your head is not inside of it. And behold, found one of these sauna domes. And got a few of those started testing that out. And it turns out you can stand to be in that thing for a lot longer than this is an infrared sauna dome. It is head out head out. And it's like something you can just buy on the sauna. You can buy one on the internet. There are so many kinds. Now, obviously, we had to pick a kind and then had to do. We had to apply a pliver something called a non-significant risk determination through the UCSFIRB in order to be able to use it. We had to write up a whole protocol, say what I was going to do, say how it was going to work, how I was going to keep people safe. All of these things they had to review it. It took about a year to get the approvals to do that one first study. And you might be wondering, well, okay, so people are lying in this tube. Dr. is on sent me his mind-dray rectal probe machine that I could use for this study, which is a rectal probe that's in there the whole time. It's silicone. It's not a big deal. And no one in the study that I did with 25 people had any complaints or anything about it as soon as they saw it. They said, oh, that's not a thing. I could put that there. And it was no big deal. And in order to keep people able to stand this for that long, we developed a whole protocol where a person sits at the head of the person who's in the sauna and is giving them water when they're thirsty. And most importantly, is using giant ice cubes and cold clouds all over their head to keep them cool and then they're going to be able to do that. And it keeps them cool and they're head. And it's remarkable what a difference this makes and what a roll it plays. And it keeps people stay calm. It helps them stay comfortable. Because we did some test runs with folks with and without it as much. And people were overwhelmingly more comfortable when they had ice on their face. Turns out, you do this protocol. People can stay in the sauna. It's about 80, 70 to 80 minutes. It was comparable to the protocols from the Jensen and the newspapers. And we were off to the races. So we did it with 25 people. And those data are under review now. What temperature was it? The dome? It was about. Gosh. It's hard to say. I think it was about between 140, 450 ish. It was not. It's on the entire 80 minutes. And so that's another really important thing. So I think there's a whole category of things we've discovered from the existing literature. And one of the really important ones is that the time that you are taking to get to that temperature also might really matter. When people got into those sauna tents in those two other studies, they were cold. And then the researchers turned them on and heated them up. And so that's what we did in our study as well. They got in. We turned it on. And then they heated up as the ambience air heated up. And in a recent paper that actually incidentally chance and then hungry should written together, they reviewed some of the studies that exist for looking at whole body height, for therming, for depression. And one of the things they noted is that the effect sizes of the change and depression from before to after the intervention. In other words, the size of the reduction in depression was higher if people spent more time getting to that peak temperature. So longer seemed to be better. And in hindsight, that's not really rocket science. I mean, it makes a lot of sense. If you take a frog and you throw it into boiling water, it jumps right out. It says, this is too hot. I can't stand this. But if you put the frog in the cold water and then you slowly heat it up, it can stand to be in the heat for a whole lot longer. And it's going to get much more of the effects than the brief amount of time it was in the boiling water. So this paradigm where we start people cool might have a multiple effects. One, it might help people actually be able to endure this treatment better. Because if you and I are thinking, oh, getting into our 160 degree finish or 190 degree finish, it's hot. The minute you get in, you are going. But these people don't start with that shock. They're just like, okay, I'm lying here. It's getting warmer. And maybe it helps them with data and be able to do it longer. Because as I said, it's not a spa treatment. It's not a walk in the park. It's intense. I don't know exactly where we started with that, but I got all excited about this protocol working. What's interesting is also because you mentioned, like, for example, I get into this 190 degree, you know, Fahrenheit degree, sauna. And I want that thing hot when I get, I don't want to waste my time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get in there. But I'm also heated to dopeded. And, you know, there have been studies showing that, you know, the more you expose yourself to heat, whether, or the more you elevate your core body temperature, which can be through ambient heat, so like a sauna or hot bath or a steam shower or yoga or exercise, the more adapted you become. So your body starts to sweat at a lower core body temperature to cool yourself down. All these other physiological changes start to happen. Your heart rate availability, you know, proves all those things happen when you're adapted. And when you're adapted it becomes easier. It's like, oh, I'm sweating at a lower core body temperature, so I'm feeling cooler. And I can stay in easier, right? And also heat shock proteins. We'll talk about biomarkers. Heat shock proteins, which are proteins that are, you know, classically known to be involved with, you know, their stress response proteins. So heat is a form of stress, and they get activated with. And many types of stress, but he is one of them. And they basically protect proteins inside of your cells from aggregating and becoming misfolded and forming plaques and disrupting things. They also help prevent muscle atrophy. They play a role in preventing your muscles from atrophy. And they do play a lot of neuroprotective roles and neurodegenerative disease a lot of things. But they also kind of help your body deal with the heat stress and part of the adaptation. So people with like higher levels of heat shock proteins, the people that are heated to acted, they increase their heat shock proteins upon exposure to heat sooner than people that are not adopted. And so kind of what you're saying makes sense, where you're not just shocking them all at once, but they might be slowly adapting in a way, you know, like an physiological level. It could be, and it's their first time. So it's very, it's very new. They're not adapted in any way to that. Yeah, totally. I've noticed like with, for example, my mom who, boy, she can sweat at like the like, my new, this little temperature change where she just, she's like, it's hot in here, where's my fan, you know? So I've been getting her in our sauna. And the first time she got in, it was like five minutes. And I put it, I did it at 165, which is typically what a lot of chimns are at. 165 Fahrenheit. She was like, I couldn't, she couldn't stand it for more than five minutes. Yeah. And I said, okay, that's okay. She first time, you know, like, and then the second time she did it, she was like, she was in there less than 10, but it was more than five. You know, and then now she's like, you know, I mean, she can stand there 10, but sometimes what she'll do is she'll stay in there for 10, and then get out, she'll get on the lower bench, she'll get out for a couple minutes and come back in. But the first couple times, I mean, it was like, I can't do this. Yeah, I'm, this isn't, this is too much, you know, for me. That's why it's so important to develop these protocols in ways that people will actually do them. Right. Because as much as we wish, you know, we could have people do all kinds of things. Exercise or all of you. Eat certain things. If people will do it, then it won't work. Right. Yeah. And you mentioned this also, which is a fairly important point, is there a lot of disabled people. Like, there are people that can't go for a run. Whether it's joint injuries or something more severe. I mean, there are people that can't do like aerobic exercise. And there are also people that have never done it in their entire life. And they're older. And it's like, good luck getting someone who's never been physically active to like, start being physically active in their six-decay of life. It's really hard. So the sauna is like, it's, it's not only like, you know, more applicable in the sense that people are more compliant because it's easier to do to go, it's easier to go to sit. In something that it is to go for a run. But there's, I mean, people that can't go for a run. Like, physically. Right. That's amazing, right? Yeah. Being able to do that. And I think that's where this comes into for thinking about cardiovascular disease, which I know you've thought a ton about and you get that talk about. And it's, you know, it's a big theme. And one of the things we should definitely mention is that cardiovascular disease and depression, those often happen together. And so there's a large group of people who are struggling with cardiovascular problems and also depression for whom this may be a treatment that could have an effect for both conditions. So one of the other aspects to think about when developing a particular book, call like this, is can we use it for other conditions too, not just mental health, but maybe also other physical health conditions that are affected by exercise and heat. Right. So, yeah. So let's talk about the, so you're now doing a study. I guess starting soon. COVID's deleted a bit. Yes. It's laid much research in the world. But let's not talk about that. So this new study that you are, that I'm super excited about and I get to play a very small role, collaborative role with you. It's going to be so fun. Let's talk about it. Yeah. Because biomarkers, which is where I come in with my enthusiasm. Absolutely. And being able to look at how you know, how it's on a may affect people with depression at eight, you know, like a real molecular level, right? So in the cells. Yeah. So let's talk about that study, which hopefully will start. Yes. Very soon. So we're really looking forward to this study. It's going to be a three year project to do this pair of two studies. The first study will be 16 people. And everybody's going to get the same thing. And I'll talk about that as in a second. And the second study is going to be 30 people. And half of those people get one thing and half of those people get another thing. So let's talk about what everybody's getting in the first study. So first of all, in both these studies, we're going to measure all of those biomarkers. It's going to be pretty exciting. You've mentioned a number of them so far. BDNF, heat shock proteins, inflammatory cytokines, gosh, CRP. There's a little bit of a laundry list. We've got gold. So people that don't know what BDNF is, brain drive neurodry factor. And what role does that play in depression? Just like generally speaking. F. My goodness. So I'm not up to stuff. I would say on all of the biological underpinnings with these molecules. Neuroplastic. It's one of the things that exercise has been done to increase. And it's a thought that may help with neuroplasticity. Right. But there's been a whole bunch dating back to Dr. Charles Rizon's paper in 2007, called cytokines, sing the blues, looking at how depression may be quite inflammatory. Right. For some people who have it. And so we know that exercise is temporarily inflammatory when you do it. But it's actually in a good way because of the adaptive changes that follow from that. The underlying inflammatory, yes. Right. So the thought is, well, sauna is hopefully quite similar. And we have a bunch of data that suggests that it is looking in that direction. We still need to do the research though. So in this first study, we will have 16 people with major depressive disorder. We will recruit them. They will all be adults. And in addition to getting a whole body hypothermia treatment, they're also going to get something called cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. So what is that? Cognitive behavioral therapy is a psychotherapy used for depression. It's considered gold standard. It's a first line treatment for depression. It doesn't involve medications. It's just a therapist who provides the treatment. It's pretty structured. It's pretty standardized. There are very specific tools that are often used across all of the different ways of administering this treatment. But the idea is that thoughts impact our feelings and how we feel impacts our behavior. So for example, if you have someone who has, let's say, type 2 diabetes and they come in and they say, I'm never going to be able to get my blood sugar under control. Never going to be able to do it. I just can't seem to stick to this diet. I'm always going to fail. I'm never going to be able to do this. When someone has those series of thoughts, how do you think they feel? Not so great. They don't feel so great. And when you don't feel so great, what you do? Well, the chocolate cake sounds pretty good. Maybe it's a chocolate cake to feel better. But then you eat the chocolate cake, which reinforces the thought, I can't do this. I'm never going to be able to stick to this diet. And so on and so forth. So thoughts feel in behavior, thoughts feel in the field. And so interrupting that loop is a major part of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. And there's a bunch of different ways that that's done. Anyway, this treatment is known to work. However, it doesn't work if people won't do it. And what is one of the major reasons why people with depression can't really get some benefits out of psychotherapy. They can't really engage because they're super depressed. Not with standing, of course, there are huge problems with our medical health care system in terms of being able to get therapy. That's a whole nother can of worms that we don't need to go into. But the point that I'm making is just that if patients can't really engage in therapy, they can't really get the benefits out of therapy. So in this treatment, everybody's going to get whole body hyperthermia, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. Not at the same time, they might be on separate days, and or they might be on the same day, but one after the other. And you might be wondering, well, where did this idea come from? Like, why give cognitive behavioral therapy with whole body hyperthermia? And that dates back to a few different things. And I think this, I think you and Dr. Charles Razon talked about this during your discussion about some of the traditional origins of sauna. It's often been a communal process. Native American sweat lodges. People don't go in those by themselves, right? It's a group or in the Korean kilns or in the Russian Banias, right? It's been a social experience. And one thing that Chuck told me about the 2016 paper and about that study was that during the study, the patients who were getting the whole body hyperthermia often started chatting. I don't remember if you guys talked about this part or not, but I just from personal experience. Yeah, absolutely true. I mean, you become chatty when you're in the sauna. I'm like, yeah, we talked to people when, yeah, yeah, started wanting to connect, started wanting to. And so the research assistants went back to the investigators and said, the patients are talking, what should we be saying to them, what should we be doing? And I remember when Chuck told me this story and just thinking, huh? Well, if whole body hyperthermia is making people want to talk more and one of the major reasons why people don't do well in therapy is that they don't want to talk and they don't want to engage, should we be pairing these things? Could using heat, then cause people to be able to be more engaged in therapy. And so this is the ultimate mind-body type and prevention, right? There's no drugs here. If we can develop something like this that gets around prescribing people medications, maybe this is a good way to go. So, propose this dual intervention with a mind-in-a-body component and that's what we're moving forward with. So we're developing that combined intervention. And then in the second study with the 30 people, we're randomizing half of people to just get the cognitive behavioral therapy, which we know works. The literature, there's reviews, meta-analysis, showing the cognitive behavioral therapy for depression works. Half people will get that and then half will also get the whole body hyperthermia sessions. And we will see, just adding the whole body hyperthermia lead to larger depression decreases. And you might be wondering, well, why don't you do it differently? Why didn't you just do just the sauna versus just CBT or something like this? Well, it's really tricky ethically to recruit patients with depression and then not provide them with a treatment that we know works. And tell them, oh, and by the way, don't do anything else while you're doing this thing. That's a very, very tricky thing to do. The better thing to do is to say, okay, here's what we know we have already. Can we do better than that? The other key gaps that we're addressing is we're going to be giving people eight weekly whole body hyperthermia sessions. Right. So that's a lot. We're going to see our people willing to do this. Do they get more benefit this way? Because all of those other two studies that I mentioned, they only gave one whole body hyperthermia session. And we saw that huge drop one week later. Right. What happens if we give a second session one week later? Are we going to see another huge drop? We don't know. We need those data. So we're going to be doing multiple whole body hyperthermia sessions. We're also going to be measuring body temperature at night during their entire time at their Entreatment because they're going to use a wearable device when they're sleeping, when they're sleeping. Instead of using, you know, an indwelling rectal probe. That's kind of a hard cell to get people to wear that for like, I don't know, ten weeks. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think we're going to go for it. We're going to measure depression symptoms daily using smartphones so that we can actually see when symptoms are changing. We're going to measure all those biomarkers and we're going to have all these in relation to each other. And one of the things I really hope we discover too is how willing are people to do this kind of sauna treatment. And then, you know, obviously seeing how long it lasts. We're going to measure outcomes further than one week and six weeks, obviously. But what my hope is that is that we might be able to develop almost a booster method. If, if in the future, this seems like a good idea after this next study and I really hope it does. But you see on the internet that you can buy all these sauna tents that you can use at home. You know, people with people that are doing a picture of them. You got their hands out and they're reading their magazine and their heads out and it looks kind of fun. You could see them on all the different websites. Well, what, what, what if we actually need to do a certain number of this intensity of whole body heating, like the kind that we're talking about here, but then at home it could be supplemented. And it could be maintained or sustained in this way. And that's a great model moving forward. Would people rather, you know, take drugs that maybe aren't working so well or maybe come with a certain number of side effects. Or say, oh, once a week, I have to sit and sit in this thing for 45 minutes and read a magazine. Right? So if we can develop a longer-term model for maintaining wellness and maintaining reductions in depression symptoms, that would be a huge win. Well, you are really moving this field forward. I know the Chuck sort of moved on to other types of research. And so, you know, you're this, these studies are, in my opinion, opening the door for many other potential research studies. People could start to then start to look at Finnish sauna. They could start to look at stuff that people, well, maybe we don't, maybe we can just, you know, find an effect by going for 20 minutes at 175 degree Fahrenheit. You know, there's all sorts of research that could be, is opened up. You know, where, you know, people just don't even know to study this. There's so many open-minded things. More people will study it. Yeah. And, you know, because, and then can this be applied to, like, a hot bath. Can people, like, or a jacuzzi, or, you know, because there are, as you know, like small clinical studies showing hot baths can improve. Was it, was it, depressed symptoms and people with depressed disorder? So, there was a 2017 paper with hot baths. And they did see that two weeks out that they had improved those symptoms. But the, the reduction had faded some by four weeks. But of note, again, that says something about the temperature. Those people got into that tub at that hot temperature. They weren't warmed up to it. And it was a pretty short hot tub. I think it was like 23 minutes or so. Yeah. So, yes, there are these small studies and taken together. We're starting to be able to see these patterns of what might matter, being in their longer, getting to a certain temperature, staying at that temperature. You know, these things. But there are so many research questions that we need to answer that it, in this field, that it's just positively overwhelming. But I'm so excited about the next pair of trials that we're going to be doing. And I'm so glad that you're on board to be doing all of this biomarker assessment with us. And it's going to be blast. The fact that it's happening is almost kind of like part of believe. And like, wow, this is actually happening soon. Yep. So I can't wait for it to start. But you and me both. Let's move on to another area of really big area of your expertise. And that is helping treat people with chronic insomnia and using non-pharmacologic treatments for chronic insomnia. Maybe we could start with, I mean, so many people have sleepless nights. There's a lot of people that perhaps they drink too much coffee later in the day, or they have a life event that keeps them stressed and psychologically aroused, or they're having too much bright blue light exposure and inhibiting their melatonin. And nice, so they're not. They're sort of becoming these night owls from like an environmental, you know, stimulus perspective. What's the difference? I'm like chronic insomnia. Like people that actually have insomnia versus someone who is has a chronotype, someone who has a genetic predisposition to being like a night owl, where they stay up really late and then like sleep all like most of the day. Like there are people that just genetically are being exposed to that. Yeah, yeah. Can you talk about that? Yeah, absolutely. So I know you covered a ton in your podcast with Dr. Sachin Panda about circadian stuff, and that is huge. And there's all kinds of ways that you can mess up your sleep with light and caffeine and all those things. Chrono types, whether you're an evening person or a morning person, those exist. And I think the data are that, you know, some, it's kind of roughly a third or third, a thirdish of people are morning people, a thirdish of people are evening people, and then a thirdish or somewhere in the middle. And what does that mean? For a lot of people that just means they feel like they think best, they're they're most creative and they feel best at that time of day. It's pretty biologically determined. Now, of course, we can perturb it with lights and crazy things, but it is pretty biologically determined. And the way that our society is built, it's to favor the larks, the morning people, not the night owl, right? Because we've got work, work, kids school, all kinds of stuff starts super early in the morning. And that's hurting the evening people in two ways. One, it's forcing them to get up early, so they're missing out on sleep, because they're already going to bed late. And two, they're not performing well, because the morning is not their time to shine. They don't perform that great then. They perform best in the evening. So society isn't set up so well for these evening people. It's really biased toward the morning people. And a chronotype isn't necessarily a sleep problem. It poses more health risks for night owls. But insomnia is something different altogether. Many people will experience insomnia over the course of their lifetime. A lot of people think, well, wait, isn't it super genetic? Well, there's some genetics to it, like 28 to 45% of insomnia is genetic. But that means that a lot of it is not. A lot of it is due to our own experience, our own behavior. And insomnia is really difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or difficulty with waking up two or really in the morning and not being able to get out of bed. For this to be happening at least three nights or so a week, for it to been going on for at least three months. And for it to be distressing. That's key. It has to be distressing. So chronotypes and insomnia are pretty different. And every now and then I get someone referred to me who says, oh, I'm an evening person and I want to become a morning person in two months. Please, like, that's my goal. I say, oh, dear. I don't think that we can change that. And we can talk about ways to work with it. But changing a chronotype is not really something you can just do. That's pretty biologically genetically determined. But if someone is referred to me and saying, I can't fall asleep. This started like eight years ago when I changed my job and I got really stressed out because now I have to perform every Tuesday at some sort of big meeting or something. Yeah, what does it mean cause is a minstrel. It's stress. Okay. Yeah. So there's a lot of different things that can cause insomnia. A big one is change. It's pretty funny when patients get patients come to me. I always do I get halfway through an interview asking about a bunch of different things about their sleep. And then in the middle of my interview, I say, one of this start, what cause this. And by asking all those other questions first, I get all these other, like, useful details. But you'll often hear, well, you know, I retired. I used to work nine to five and then I retired and I was all set up to play golf, go to brunch, read books, do all these things, but then it got me sleep. Because it was a huge change to their schedule. They didn't have those zeitgabbers anymore during the day things that anchor them to their 24 hour clock. They didn't have a time to get up. They stopped using in alarm. They didn't have to be somewhere at a certain time. So that can be a major change. Other major changes that can lead to insomnia are changes in relationships status, a breakup, losing a job, having a kid raising a kid. There's a lot of different things that can cause insomnia. However, things that maintain insomnia are generally not the same things as what cause insomnia. For example, let's say someone loses their job. It's really stressful. They got fired unexpectedly. Didn't see it coming really upsetting, right? And so they can't sleep because they're worrying about all kinds of things. So my next paycheck and a come from where I'm going to do all these things. And they start, you know, reading and bed and listening to music and bed and trying to do calming things when they're not sleeping. Because I thought, I can't sleep in my as well reader. Oh, I'm eyes a little watched that show. I guess I could just drink my computer. Yeah, I guess I could get into it. I guess I could drink my computer and bed and just start working on some emails applying for some more jobs. And then all of a sudden, they're doing all these things in bed. Fast forward three months, they've got a new job. But you know what, they're still taking their computer in bed. Check and Twitter in bed. Doing all these things. And then wondering why when they put the things away to go to bed, they can't get to sleep. Well, now it's these bad sleep hygiene behaviors that are perpetuated in their insomnia. Not the fact that they lost a job three months ago. That's over with. They got a new job now. So the things that are perpetuating it are the behaviors they actually used to try and help themselves earlier on. Which is that become about behaviors. Huh? Do they become bad behaviors? Would you call them bad behaviors? Okay, so you do something. Okay, yeah, go ahead. I was going to say things like napping things like and I can talk a little bit of napping because it's a double-edged sword. But things like napping things like kind of sleep in on the weekends using sleep pills. Yeah. But over the counter sleep days to try and get to sleep using things that aren't over the counter to try to get to sleep. Yeah. Cancelling activities, cancelling workouts, skipping them because you're just too tired. So starting to do all of these handicapping activities that are actually detracting from what you really want to be doing, which is building up a denazine during the day. And I know that you a doctor Matthew Walker talked about how caffeine impacts sleep and how you really want to accrues sleep drive during the day, so that you can fall asleep at night. Well, guess what? If you're taking long nap during the day, you're decreasing the sleep drive that you have at the end of the day that helps capitulate you into sleep and keep you asleep. And if you never used to take nap because you used to sleep fine because you didn't use to do all these other things. It's kind of this feed forward process. And like you've talked about on many kapod casts, caffeine. I don't have a problem with caffeine, but if you're drinking it later in the day, it's still very much active when you're trying to go to sleep at messes with all kinds of things. Similarly, you might develop patterns of using your bright bright computer screen, very, very late at night when you didn't use to do that before you had a major stressor that happened. So all of these different kinds of behaviors can perpetuate sleep problems. And in the treatment that I do, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, we focus on a bunch of things. We focus on sleep hygiene, something called stimulus control. We focus on something called sleep restriction, which is not sleep deprivation. Oh, I'll mention that in a minute, cognitive techniques and then relaxation techniques. So the sleep hygiene I just went over. Stimulus control is going back to basics with the bed. Nothing in bed except for sleep or sex. That's it. No listening to podcasts, no watching TV, no fighting with your spouse, no wondering where your kids going to play to college. None of that's iPods social media. None of it in bed. Stimulus control. The only thing we do in bed, no phones in bed, no, oh my gosh. I've got stories about phones. No phones in bed. Just sleep or sex. And that means that if you can't sleep and you're in your bed and you're laying there worrying, you are violating the rule. You have to get out of the head and you have to go to the couch or go somewhere else and finish your worrying or finish whatever you're doing. And then you can go back to bed. And a lot of people don't like that. They think it sounds so hard and awful. But by the time someone's in my office seeing me for sleep problems, I basically say, look, Treat me with me as five weeks of your life. How long have you been struggling with this sleep problem? Worth it. I know you've been on my way at least for at least six to 12 months. So if you've been waiting this long to do this, give it a college try really do it. How much worse can it get? And there's a really great book that can guide people, by the way, through this whole treatment on their own if you want. And I can give you the link for that. What the book called? It's called Quatt Your Mind and Get to Sleep. Okay, that's one I just ordered because you mentioned it. Yes, I got three copies. Oh, so I'm giving one of my mom's standing. She's a doctor, Rachel Manver at Stanford wrote that book. And the four were written by Dr. Richard Bootson, who was the professor from whom I learned this treatment at the University of Arizona. So we've gotten through to, we talked about sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction. What that means is we take the amount of time that someone is in bed every night and we focus on that. Instead of just being in bed doing things, what I do to figure out how long someone should actually be in bed is the first week that they are with me. They're given a week time. They have to wake up at that same time every single day for seven days. I always joke with them. Any day ending in DIY, you have to get up at that time, include Saturday and Sunday. Right? And Dr. Panda spoke all about how important it is to not wake up at different times and how that's like giving yourself artificial jet lag and all that stuff. So I have patients do that for seven days. And then, but they go to bed whenever they're tired, whenever they're actually sleepy. And we calculate how much time each night on average are they sleeping. And over the course of that week, we get an average per night amount of time that they're sleeping. Let's say that turns out that on average you sleep seven hours a night and that your wake time is 8 a.m. That would mean that in order to figure out what your bed time should be, I work backwards from 8 a.m. I go from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. And then I add 30 minutes of grace because that's what we do. And so then I would say, Ron, that your bed time is the bedtime of your childhood dreams. Your bedtime is 12 30 at night. You get to stay up all the way until 12 30 and guess what? Not only do you get to stay up that late. You can't go to bed before then. You have to go to bed at that time or after once you're sleepy. And what this actually does is this restricts the amount of time that people are in their beds. The amount of time that they can actually sleep. And and and pretty quickly patients will start to get pretty darn good quality sleep during that seven and a half hours. For the first few weeks it's a struggle bus they're getting out of bed when they can sleep getting back and bed, etc. But eventually they're getting pretty deep sleep during that time pretty good sleep because they're building up so much sleep pressure during the day. And then during treatment we extended back by 15 minutes a week as they demonstrate that they can keep their efficiency at least 85% What is efficiency? The amount of time that you're sleeping divided by the total amount of time that you're in bed. And we have patients keep detailed sleep logs about that. There's an example log on that book that you just ordered. So we do that sleep restriction. Then we do the cognitive techniques where we work with people's worries and thoughts and how those serve them and how they don't. And how reflective of reality they are and how much they need to be changed. I think about that negative Twitter comment. Yeah. You know stress at work. You got deadlines. Yeah. You're going to send your child preschool. Big one. Big one. I've had patients come in and they're presenting problem has been my daughter's majoring in English. Okay. No. So you get every kind of reason for people saying that they have. So how do you what you do? I mean how do you. That's hard to. It is. You deal with isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of I lay down. I mean that's one of my problems is like. That'll come back to it. It hasn't been active all day but when I lay down and I. And it's. You know, whatever we don't have time to do. If during the day or whatever we choose not to deal with during the day. It's going to make an appearance at night. Yeah. It's going to come in and swoop and say hello here. I am like you get to deal with me now when you want to be sleeping. So there's a number of different types of tools that we use to work with thoughts and feelings. If you ever heard the thought don't believe everything you think. Yes. It can be pretty dangerous. Right. So that comes to mind. Working with thoughts in an initial way to think about. These approaches is that we identify what we call dysfunctional thoughts. So thoughts that you know, they're not really serving us and also they're not super true. So for example, lack in white thinking. Right. If I don't nail this interview, my career is over, right? Like these complete black and whites. We've also got personalization type things. Oh, that person left a negative comment in my Twitter. That must mean I am the worst presenter ever. Right. So we can take these things. And then there's also my favorite, one of my fan favorites is shooting all over people or shooting all of yourself. I should be doing this. I should be doing that. I should have that done. Right. So these kinds of thoughts. Whenever a thought falls into a particular category of dysfunctional thought and I have a fun list that I can share with you different types of these. Chances are the thought is not all the way true. And we do an exercise called the thought record where we look at evidence four thought evidence that it's true. We look at evidence that it isn't true. And I mean, we really look. I have spent an hour at a time on one thought with a patient before where we look for all of the possible evidence that it's true. All of the possible evidence that it's not true. And then we have to develop a new thought that acknowledges both the evidence that it is true and the evidence that it isn't true. Can you give me an example? I sure can. Let's pick a flavor. Let's say that you are having the thought. If I don't get a perfect night of sleep tonight, I am going to just bomb my presentation tomorrow. That's a horrible thing to be thinking about right when you're trying to go to sleep, right? Oh, I really need to sleep right now because I'm going to terrible in this presentation tomorrow. Well, what is the evidence that it's true? Well, maybe this person has before not done great the night after and I just sleep. Oh, I've performed less bad after a night of sleep. Or I'm sorry. I've performed not as well as I usually did do after a bad night of sleep. Or, you know, I've gotten feedback that my talk wasn't so great after a bad night of sleep before. But then let's look at it. It isn't true. There have been plenty of times I've performed on a poor night of sleep. I've always looked over night in an airport on the way to a conference and I still pulled off the talk and it was fine. Right? So we have to look at evidence that it's not necessarily true. Also, I can't predict the future. I don't know if I'm going to sleep well tonight or not. I haven't decided. I don't know. And then what we do is we developed an adaptive thought, which is, well, although I haven't always performed my best on poor nights of sleep. There are plenty of times that I've done just well, giving a talk after a poor night of sleep. And the key thing with this is that is that adaptive thought just polyana, no. But it's much more reflective reality than if I don't get it at our sleep, I'm going to bomb this presentation. Right? So we develop a thought that is much more reflective of reality. And then we evaluate how we feel. So for example, when you have the thought, I am going to bomb this presentation tomorrow. I don't get eight hours of sleep. How anxious do you feel on a scale from one to ten? Let's say it's like a nine. Yeah, pretty good presentation. Right. Sure. But then if we have this other thought, if we adopt a new thought that says, I don't always perform my best after a poor night of sleep. But I've done it a bunch and it's gone fine. When we have that thought, our anxiety level on a one to ten isn't like a nine. It might still be like five, maybe a six, but it's not as high. So we're learning how to match the appropriate amount of the emotion, the thought that is more reflective of reality. What do you, what's the, you've listed a lot of things here with got to sleep hygiene. We've got the stimulus control, right? It's a sleep restriction. And then the cognitive thing. Right. And then there's relaxation, like, Things like progressive muscle relaxation, a familiar with this one. So progressive muscle relaxation is a practice whereby you focus on different muscles in your body, Tensing them, squeezing them, and then letting them go, and squeezing them and then letting them go. And then you're focusing on a different part of your body and you're tensing it and you're letting it go. And this way you're getting out of your head and into your body. How like the breathing exercises. It's a lot like a body scan, except for in a body scan, which is more of a mindfulness practice. You're noticing the part of the body. I'm noticing our hands warmer cold. And then I'm moving on to my elbows. Are they stiff? Progressive muscle relaxation is more active because you're actually squeezing them. And what's always interesting to people is when they get to their shoulders and they go squeeze their shoulders and they realize, Oh, wait, my shoulders are already squeezed. Just let them go. That's another major part of this treatment. What I think you're about to ask is what are the most important ones? Yeah, like are they all equal? Do you have to, are there some that are, no, they are not all created equal. And what we know from studies that have been termed dismantling studies, where they've taken this whole intervention and they've taken it apart and they've seen, well, which pieces are most important for good outcomes? We know that the pieces that are really important are the sleep restriction part. Matching the amount of time that you're in beds, the amount of time that you can actually sleep. And also the stimulus control. Don't do anything in bed that isn't sleep or sex. I often ask people, do you sleep better when you're traveling for work in hotels or on vacation? Well, yes, a modification. Well, yes, a modification. And I'm like, well, what about when you're traveling for work? And they say, well, yes, actually, I do sleep better when I'm traveling for work. Why is that? You're not sleeping in your bed. What do you associate your bed with? Sleeplessness, anxiousness, not sleeping being frustrated that you can't sleep. You get all these associations with your bed that we need to fix in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. So we're reducing bed dread. And stimulus control is very, very responsible for that change. So this is a very effective non-pharmaclocal treatment. And so I'm insomnia. I personally know I have a family member that has insomnia. And they have gone to pharmacological treatment. Very common. Ambient is a very common. Very common. So I can tell you from listening to the experience of this person. They are convinced they cannot sleep without an ambient. And in fact, they've tried to quit ambient before. They've done this like, you know, weaning off. And certainly they've missed days because like maybe their prescription was in fill, like whatever. And missing it was like, they can't sleep at all. Yeah. And it's like, well, what's going on if you are completely dependent on this drug to sleep. Like that is terrifying. Not to mention the side effects with things like ambient where you've got. I'll tell you, like this person like they'll wake up in the middle of night and just start eating. And not remember it. And do weird things like like just weird things that they've done the middle of night. And also like memory wise, it seems like it's affecting like they seem to like there's something. And there is a literature there. Like you know, there can be an association with dementia. And so how does a person shift from that to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, C.B.T.I. Great question. Whenever a new study comes out in the news about the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep or ambient or lunester sonata, any of these drugs on sleep, I get a new influx of referrals because people think, I need to get off these drugs. No, I've never mind that I've been on it for 30 years. I need to get off of it this week. And the example you gave is great when people try and quit like just by quitting, for example, they don't sleep. Or if they try and then they don't want to quit. And then they don't want to quit. It's a vicious cycle. It's really hard. And so what I often will notice about folks who want to quit medications is that they're pretty anxious about it. No one's really very calm about quitting ambient. It's not just this easy transition, adding a new vitamin for example. So what I do is I work with providers because yes, using C.B.T.I. cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia as part of your plan for quitting medications is a totally great one. And I'm not a prescribed or I'm not a physician. I'm a clinical psychologist. And so I work with the prescribers, which are generally psychiatrist, sometimes internal medicine doctors, on a taper plan. And you mentioned that your family members tried a taper plan before. The approach that I've taken over the past many years has been what I would call an extraordinarily extended taper plan. Most of these sleep drugs are pills that you can cut with razor blades. They don't come in very convenient small sizes. I think the smallest ambient you can get is five milligrams. And so what I have people do is I have them by gem scales on Amazon or whatever. And these scales can measure 0.0 to like 0.00 of a gram, like very, very small amounts. And instead of going from five to let's say cutting it in half, just a 2.5, we'll go from five to 4.9. For a few weeks. And I challenge people to detect the difference between 4.9 and 5 physiologically, but psychologically, there's something there. People need to get used to this idea that, okay, I can fall asleep with less than 5 milligrams of ambient. I can fall asleep with 4.9 milligrams. Now, some people, I kind of, I always gauge how anxious they are about the change. If going from five to four sounds really stressful, we go from five to, you know, 4.9 or whatever it is. And using this really, really slow process, both reduces the physiologic rebound and somnia that you described, like when the prescription wasn't refilled and you skipped it for a night. So we avoid that. And then we also avoid the anxiety aspect of reducing too quickly, being anxious about reducing it by reducing very, very, very slowly. And it's not rocket science, but that's what I do with people. And it can take six months to get off of drugs. It can take longer. But if you do it in the slow, steady way, you don't get the reactivity with it. And one of the major aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia that we get away from is reactive medication. People try and go to bed and then if they can't sleep, then they get up and take a sleep medication. In CBTI, what we do is we standardize it. You take the same dose of the same medication every night. Period. That way, it's not reactive. You're not, you know, perturbing your circadian rhythm at different points in the cycle throughout the night with medications. And this way, there's removing some of that anxious questioning, am I going to take drugs? Should I skip it tonight? Should I try and did a dirt tonight from the equation? But CBTI probably helps for someone who is trying to taper themselves off a farm collateral treatment for sleep. You know, insomnia probably helps because now they're thinking I'm getting this other thing. And this other thing is works. Yes. It's clinically shown to work. Yes. And it's fixing all the things that they're sleeping medications sometimes aren't. Right. And underlying weak time, cadres, all the other issues. Right. And we're doing the actual insomnia because things causing it, you know, in most cases. Generally, our own behavior that we've actually done to try and help ourselves. Do people, so you mentioned the book again, can you say the title of the book? What was it? What? Your mind and get to sleep. Now, is there a thing like, do people, obviously, like, you have, well, he said you had a weightless, like, six to a month. So people that get treatment. I mean, this isn't, you know, it's a very easily accessible thing for people, where he's people a lot of people have insomnia. So can people do things like read this book or there are other ways they can do cognitive behavioral therapy in Prince Omnile? Yes. Yes. So that book is great. And I should say it's a traditional member and Colleen Carney. And there is a great association and website. And I can give you the link for that where people can go type in their zip code and they can find providers who can do this treatment near where they live. And it's a very well-known, good way of actually finding providers who know how to do this treatment. What's the name of the website? Oh, it's completely blanking on it right now. But I feel like it's like a Academy of Behavioral Sleep Medicine or something like this. So we'll put that on the show now. Yeah. And so people can find that. That book for a lot of people, they can use that book, they can do it themselves, and they can improve their sleep on their own. If their problem isn't terribly isn't super severe. But there are other apps that I'm aware of. I think there's an app called Sleepio and there are it's a cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia app. And I believe that it's, I'm not sure exactly how people can get it now. I think there's some health care plans. You can get it through your provider, your employer. It's kind of a strange way of getting to it. But there are some apps. There's insomnia coach, which I think is maybe still free. I think the VA actually put one out that anybody can use. And that's in Google play and iTunes stores. But finding people who can do this treatment through the website, that website is great. It's unfortunately harder to find than it should be because it has the American College of Physicians did say that this should be the first lying treatment for insomnia before a medication for sleep. It is not. It's not. But it's not because it is difficult to get insurance, all kinds of issues. It also takes time. Time for an effort. And it's not easy. And I always tell patients that they're not going to like me very much in week two and three. You're going to want to make a dartboard of my face on it and just play with it because you're not going to like waking up in the middle of the night, getting out of bed, having to follow these crazy instructions. But I always just tell people, give it five weeks. Because that's how long the version I do is. If you don't give it a shot, you're never going to know if it works. How long does it last? Like, do you have to continue doing it? It's a great question. It's it lasts for quite a while. There's a great paper that I always show. Patients who are particularly worried about biology that shows how people's. See reactive or. HSCRP changes during treatment compared. It's like, Thai tea versus a sleep seminar versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. So everybody got one of those three. What they show is 16 months out. The people who got the CDTI had the greatest reductions in their HSCRP. And the biggest improvements in their sleep lasting all the way out to 16 months. And treatment only occurred in the first two months. It's kind of like Santa Claus. Once you know Santa isn't real, you can't unknown that. Once you learn the things you learn in CBTI, you can't unknown them. And you know exactly. And I'm just doing it. You know exactly how you can make your sleep. So it's so it reduced inflammatory biomarkers like high sensitivity. See reactive protein. HSCRP. When you're sleeping. When you're sleeping. Yeah. All sorts of things get so it's like a downstream effect. Sure. So yes, it can last quite a while. And some people find that they can build more flexibility. And some people find, you know what? I need to be rigid about this. And it's okay. Because I'm rewarded with better sleep. I once had a patient who for 52 weeks after finishing treatment with me. He still did his Excel calculator sleep diary every week. And he emailed it to me. And on the 52nd week, he said, Dr. Mason. This is the 52nd diary entry. You're going to stop sending you these, but you can trust. At any time you want to see one, you can believe me. And I will send it to you. Because he had found that if by just keeping his sleep diary every morning for two minutes, that was the price he paid for improved date, improved daytime function, better sleep at night, and just all around better quality of life. So ultimately, people carry on with it full bore for the rest of their lives. Other people realize, okay, I know how I can be flexible with this program. And I can choose. I'm going to drink four glasses of wine on Saturday night. I know my sleep is going to be bad. It's okay. I'm going to a winery. Make an informed decision about it. Right. Yeah. Well, I know we're, okay, we still have some time. Let's move on to the last sort of area that you're actively doing research on. And that is, you know, also involves the non-pharmic logical treatment for, you know, this sort of behavior that can, you know, in a way, it's like it's a negative behavior. It's like, you know, and so many are not sleeping or, you know, having, in this case, it would be overeating. Mm-hmm. Whether the overeating is due to stress or cravings or some other sort of, you know, reason, as I think we'll get into more on a reward based sort of, you know, behavior. Let's, let's talk a little bit about some of that because it is, I have people in my family. I have, I'm, I'm sure everyone, either is a person that's experiences or no someone that is like eating junk food or drinking sugar sweeten beverages. Like, and it's like, stop! It's bad for you. I mean, can't you just stop doing it? We know it, you know, you're going to give yourself diabetes, you're going to, you know, potentially like lose a limb or have to be on dialysis or you're going to get cancer or I mean, can you just stop doing it? Just stop drinking coke, you know, why can't people just stop? Why? Why is it so difficult? Because it is. I mean, I have gone through every possible, you know, science explanation and great detail on how terrible it is. Drinking soda and it doesn't matter because it gets rid of their migraine. It makes them feel better and there's nothing, you know, or it just makes them feel better. I mean, they have to have it. It's like, don't understand. So, help me understand because it's incredibly frustrating. I'm the kind of person, I've got a really good, I'm pretty disciplined and I've got, like, you know, like, I could stop things. I can pick it up and like keep going and so it like, I just don't understand why can't people stop doing that. Like sometimes I'm like, you know, like, what else do you need? Ironclad or Zal, you have. Well, there's a few really important things to unpack there. First of which is, does someone want to change or not? If someone wants to change, it says, I really want to lose 40 pounds and I want to stop drinking coke for my migraines every day. I really want to stop that's different than someone saying, no, I don't want to stop that. I like my coke for my migraines. I'm not stopping that. Those are very different things, but they're very, they're very, very challenging. Yeah. So let's talk about the first one. Yes, yeah. Because, I mean, a lot of people know drinking coke like, do they want to get, you know, type two diabetes? Do people want that? I guess not. So they know that this, like, could, like, really drastically, you know, change the quality of the life. So it would a big scary thing 20 years away is different. Then a really comforting thing, two minutes. All right. So let's talk about the person that knows it's bad. Would prefer not to be doing the bad behavior, but still just can't stop. Yeah. Let's, let's talk about that first. Okay. Let's, let's start with how that kind of came to be in the first place. Yes. Right. Okay. And let's, I'm going to make, I'm going to try and bring the example a little bit further on the pendulum closer to where you might have been one day or know at least know someone very closely who has been. Let's say you're an academic and you submit a paper that you are just so excited about to get reviewed it at journal. And it gets rejected and you're feeling terrible and you walk by the office kitchen pre-COVID type. You walk by the office kitchen and you see some donuts on the table. And you think, huh? I'm going to have a donut. No. It sounds really good right now. I'm going to see. And you have the donut and it's rewarding. And in that moment where you were just so down from the rejection of the paper, then you're so up eating this delicious sugary, rewarding donut, then you're actually going to learn, oh, all right. I'm going to remember this. I'm going to remember that when I felt bad, I ate a donut and I felt better. And then the next time something bad happens, you do it again. But the point that you're making is that, yeah, although that person is feeling better in that moment, their physiology is not feeling better in the long term. But in that moment, the donut is actually serving as negative reinforcement. Is removing a notchist stimuli. It's removing all of the negative experience that I'm having from that rejection. It's taking away that rejection for that moment. And I'm just enjoying that donut. And so, by doing this, by learning this, I'm learning that I can actually apply this in all kinds of areas of my life. Oh, one bad thing's happened. I eat a donut. I feel better. It gets reinforced. But over time, I realized, oh, my genes don't fit anymore. And also, I don't feel so great. And all of these other things, and I'm realizing, oh no, like, this is how I feel better. I need to change this. But I don't have another solution. You might try eating celery instead. How does that work? If that worked, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about this. Substituting doesn't work. Or, oh, I'm just going to avoid ever seeing a donut again for the rest of my life. That's also very precarious. I don't think it's super realistic. You could probably do a lot of avoiding, but still, then are you going to avoid muffins? I mean, other things might be quite a similar purpose. So avoiding substituting these are difficult. So instead, there are a few different ways we can go as a conversation. I'll go one direction first. One thing that we know can work, and this is outside of the reinforcement thing, is, well, actually, I'm going to come back to that. I think that's a basic with the reinforcement. So what we might do with someone who comes in and says, yeah, I've got this problem with these donuts. I'm just, I'm eating these donuts every time something gets bad. What I might say to them is not just stop it, because that doesn't work. If we just tell people stop it, it's no, it doesn't work. I might say, okay, donut eating. It sounds like it's a pretty important strategy. I say, yeah, super important. It solves all of my feelings of rejection all day. It helps me deal with all of them. So, okay, well, next time, I want you to sit down, but that donut, and really pay attention. And that person might next time then sit down with that donut, and realize, this donut is very good. It's been sitting in the kitchen all day. This little bit of stale. This actually isn't very delicious. And might kind of realize, oh, you know what? The real reward here is not actually very rewarding. And then, as a result, they might get disenchanted with this behavior. Like, oh, I actually don't enjoy this so much. And another example I'll pull for you is actually from quite a while when I was treating patients in a smoking cessation clinic, because everybody knows that smoking isn't good for you, right? And yet, many, many, many, many, many people do it. So, I want side of patient come in and he said, you know what? I love smoking. I love it. And he smoked many, many, many cigarettes a day. A couple packs a day, a cigarettes. And I said, okay, smoking is awesome. I want you to really smoke. I want you to sit at the table. And in fact, smoking is so important. I don't want you to do anything else. No reading, no coffee, no TV, nothing, just smoking. And he said, all right, no problem. And I want, and I told my want you to rate how you feel before and after you smoke. You got to make a whole smoking notebook, because smoking is so important. I mean, he was thrilled, right? Because every provider he'd ever gone to, it said stop it, stop it. Now you're peripheral neuropathy is going to get worse. You stop, right? And here I am sitting and saying, like smoke, I want you to smoke. That's me. Yeah. And so, what he actually found was that, you know what? He did love smoking. But he didn't need to smoke two packs a day. He ended up smoking just a handful of cigarettes a day, four or five cigarettes a day, rather than the whole two packs. Because he found that, oh, when I really just sit and smoke after, well, I really want to go do something else. I want to go read that paper, drink that coffee, watch that game, do those things. So when he separated it out and got really curious about the process, he did discover that he liked it. And he stuck with it. But for every story like that, there's someone who slows down to smoke and says, oh, you know what? This actually tastes terrible. I don't like this. And this is the mindfulness aspect. This is the mindfulness aspect. And oftentimes, once someone slows down and really sees the reward of what they're doing, oh, this actually tastes bad. I don't actually like this. They become disenchanted with it. Because once you don't taste bad these days, or the vapes, there's the who knows. Anyways, but that's why I just tell people, that's why I just advocate for really paying attention to what you're doing. And seeing what really clearly is that reward and what are you really getting from it in that moment. And then also, we can use other tools to think about the future, which aren't necessarily the mindfulness piece, but just getting really clear about what that reward is. Can then help us to no longer be so interested in that behavior. We don't have to use willpower to force ourselves to stop. We're actually using our own experience, oh, you know what? Those don't answer, stale. I don't actually want that. I only know their stale because I slowed down long enough to eat it very slowly and carefully and really taste it. So you're focusing on the reward aspect, right? Because you're kind of changing that. So you're talking about the trigger. Your example was the the paper that was rejected, but there's so many triggers. So many, so many triggers, so many. And then the behavior, which is eating the donuts, smoking cigarettes, and then they make you feel better. I feel good. My microphone goes away. I made it out. But then when you're focusing on it, what is it actually? Is it making me feel good in my right? So you kind of can change that. Is that what you see? You can change that reward. Yeah, feeling. You can see it more clearly what the reward is. And then all of a sudden, it's not so much so rewarding. And you realize that actually there's a different approach that might be more rewarding, which is rather than just eating that donut to forget about my rejection. Maybe I'd feel better if I just really sat down and worked with my thoughts. I know that you work with, you know, many people on, you know, doing this sort of reward-based eating research. But have they looked at, you know, when people engage in this mindfulness activity for, let's say, if it was the eating or smoking at both. And they're thinking about, okay, how does this taste? Is it, oh, it's sweet. Like, so sweet. I can't even, there's nothing in nature that's this sweet. You know, thinking about it and they're sort of, you're getting a more of a negative, instead of a positive reward. You're getting more of a negative thought, right? In the brain and the rewards center, like, does that activation area, like a brain change from the mindfulness, like, during the changing, like engaging in that mindfulness, like, like, or thought. Like, can you, like, actually calm down some of the reward pathway? There have been a number of studies with really serious meditators. And I would refer you to some of the work. I know, Dr. Justin Brueer has done a bunch of work on looking at actual brain activation in meditators and how, during meditation, different, their brain pattern activation can actually change. And when we change our perceived reward value of things. For example, yes, we can change those patterns in our brain. And one of the things that, so Judd and actually did a trial together where we did a mindful eating intervention for people who said they have way too many cravings that the eat response to. And these were, the sample was all overweight women. And we gave them this intervention where they had, where they had to get curious about their actual behavior. They had to slow down, eat mindfully and really look at what is the true reward of they're doing. And we found that people ate and response to their cravings a whole lot less after doing this training. And it wasn't an effortful intervention. It didn't cause, it didn't rely on willpower and trying to change. It really focused just on being curious and being open to observing your experience. And that's what's so, so important. When we use different parts of our brain to be anxious or to be fearful, we're not also, it's more difficult to also be curious and open to experience. So we published a paper, so Dr. Loseville and I published a paper while ago showing that if you ban the sale of sugary beverages, which we did at UCSF all over the campus. And then you also give people a brief motivational intervention where you show them, here's how many sugar cubes are in all of the co-curricular drinking on a daily basis. And you give them some information that's kind of this brief motivational interviewing type. And you have that they actually, these folks will drink less soda over time. Yeah, so it works. Getting rid of it from your environment. And then doing brief interventions that actually communicate information, not in a very judgmental way and not in a harsh way and not necessarily in a super scientific way, but just in a visual way in a way that might be a little bit surprising. Like, oh, this, this many sugar cubes, right? Some things that are different can help people drink less soda. And if people are experiencing immediate rewards with it, I would still encourage them slow down, slow down, gulping that soda. How do you feel after one sip? How do you feel after two sip? Maybe people will find that, oh, you know what? I don't need 16 ounces. I'm really satisfied with three ounces. And that's all I need. Maybe you don't have to eat the whole chocolate cake. Maybe just actually a few bites. If you really slow down and pay attention to your experience, instead of mindlessly eating the chocolate cake while you're watching TV or slurping down that beverage while you're, um, I don't know, driving, right? So really slowing down and getting curious about how your body feels and what your experience of the thing actually is, can help you consume less. In a perfect world, we consume none of the things that are bad for us. But you know what? Like you said, we're not going to find these sort of, we're not going to find a, we're not going to find a Twinkie in nature. That combination of fat and sugar with no fiber and no protein right? These are man-made delicacies that are very hard to resist. So I think it's more of a, well, can we learn how to enjoy these things up into the point where they're enjoyable. Like, maybe the first bite isn't enjoyable, second bite's good, third bite's good. Maybe the fourth bite, you know, feels so good anymore about it. Oh, it loses a lot of the flavor by the fifth bite. And then maybe we stop. And we're not eating as much of it. It's harm reduction, right? Do you think this focusing on mindfulness, like when you're engaging in these, um, quote unquote bad behaviors or things like, you know, lead to negative health outcomes? Is something that can be brought to the applied. So you mentioned two examples like the eating of, you know, bad foods or junk foods or overeating. And the smoking, but like there's a lot of different bad, like, gambling. Is there some, is there like, is this, you know, reward based learning and being mindful during the actual behavior and kind of changing the reward a little bit just by being mindful of it. Yeah, is that something that anything that's going to take a bit of behavior, opening up Twitter, opening up social media, gambling, you name it. So how do you, how would you apply that to, to being like having an internet addiction type of behavior where you're slow down, get on the internet for two minutes and then pause and check in with your body. How do you feel how, how emotionally do you feel is that how you want to feel in that moment. How is how is reading comments in response to something you posted on the internet making you feel right. And then really evaluating, is this how I want to spend my time, is this how now. So we can use those techniques, but they are hard because scrolling on the internet has that rewarding that, you know, that dopamine hit all the people who've studied social media and how our brains. And then the response it's pretty startling and taking this pause isn't really rewarding there isn't a natural reward there in in pausing and slowing down a noticing that the donor is stale for example, right. So that is challenging and I don't know, you know, I don't know therefore that mindfulness is the whole answer to this I think there's a bunch of other ways we can work with these situations. For example, I do believe in environmental interventions. If there aren't twinkies in your house at 2 a.m., you can't eat them at 2 a.m. Right. Right. So it's great to just set up your environment such that it's going to promote the healthy choice. And of course, there's going to be times when you are out to dinner with friends and you're having drinks and you're ordering food and there's loud music and there's conversation and there's all these things and taking a moment to be mindful isn't really in the cards. So it's not going to be all the time. And what we can do environmentally to help ourselves for example, looking at menus ahead of time going to restaurants and making decisions. Okay, I'm going to get this and I'm going to plan on bringing some home where I'm going to plan on sharing some or making some of these decisions ahead of time when we're not in the moment is a pretty useful tool. And there's also some manipulations called episodic future thinking, for example. So if you're sitting here with a plate of cookies in front of you now, how would I feel eating these now, but then also imagining myself in three weeks at, you know, some event that I wanted to look and where certain dress to or something like this. Exercises where you transport yourself in time to times where you're at future health goals or future other events and then using that to help inform your decision now. These manipulations from Leonard Epstein's lab have shown some effectiveness in changing eating behavior. They've had people listen to recordings of themselves talking about future goals while ordering food fast food in in like a food courts in shopping malls. And they've found that it can influence how much they eat. So using some of these kinds of cognitive tools can help us much more than just kind of the stop at approach. There are lots of people though. Well, lots. I don't know the half that's the right word, but there's many people like you who can read a paper and say, this is bad for me. I am not going to do this and you know what I'm going to tell my husband and not do it. I'm not going to feed it to my kid. Nobody's doing it. Right, and you're able to just do that. But it's different for a lot of people, especially when they've already learned that reward process. Right, the positive and negative reinforcement and the type of reward learning and learning that's very powerful. And I do kind of like I've always found it difficult like the mindfulness I'm not going to go into that but like me meditating. It's like, oh, I can't do it. It's hard. It's hard. But I can go for a run and meditate on my run or I can go out surfing and sit on my board and I'm like in moment. But like having to sit down and try to meditate. I'm like, I just, but that's not what I'm advocating. And I, it's, you know, like this curiosity that you mentioned and like getting curious about it like, yeah, I'm smoking this cigarette. What is it taste like? What does it smell? It was like shit. You know, like, you know, that's kind of like a different way of approaching this mindfulness that I'm, you know, I feel like it's a lot more approachable for a lot of people. Yeah, I can sit down and think about, you know, how my cigarette smells or how like this, you know, sweet and beverage taste or this sugar donut taste and just focus on that. You kind of focus it on those things. You might start to like really go wait a minute. Right. And once you notice those things that the owner is still right or that yes or that, oh, actually this taste terrible. You can't unknown that. Right. Yeah. And so you become disenchanted with. It's not the default. Very interesting stuff. Actually, so happy that we, me to had this discussion. We talked about so many different things and I know you are on social media. You're on Twitter. Your Twitter handle is Dr. Ashley Mason at Dr. Ashley Mason. Yeah. And so people can follow you on Twitter and you also have a website. Is it a lab website? And that is the, it's the, is the, is the CLA. Yes. Okay. So CLAB dot UCSF dot EDU. C S E A S E A sleep eating an effect right spell it out again. Was it S E A lab LAB at UCSF dot EDU awesome or dot UCSF dot EDU and people can go to the website find out about what you guys are doing there and eventually you might have a newsletter that people can sign up for to maybe become a future participant in a study of yours. Yeah. That's where you can learn about the studies that we're doing in the lab, the sleep group treatment and how to get involved with lab and the study that I'm a small collaborator with you on should be kicking off soon. Yes. fingers crossed and we'll definitely be informing people about that as well. So yeah. Thank you so much again. Thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun. Totally. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

I unapologetically embrace the view that to some degree insulin resistance is a common root cause for most chronic diseases. Obviously type today, BEDs, obesity's in there. Alzheimer's, fatty liver disease, infertility. So why is that? Insulin is one of the few peptide hormones that will literally affect every single cell of the body. For example, the connection between insulin resistance and breast and prostate cancers. It's not saying insulin resistance is the singular contributor, not at all, but it is absolutely a contributor. I kind of wanted to start out with something a little provocative. Right now, there's a big trend in weight loss that's made very easy by taking GLP1 agonistro. It was like Ozenbeg and Wigovie. GLP1 is a naturally produced hormone. My concern is that the dose of GLP1 that we're using now, it's just a little too much of a good thing. What are some of the best strategies people can do now to really make a difference? The one I like to talk about the most because the evidence is so compelling and it's so easy to get. My one thing would be... Welcome back to the podcast. I'm very excited to be sitting here with Dr. Ben Bickman, who is a professor of cell biology at Brigham Young University. And he specializes in all things metabolic disorders and metabolism. So I'm pretty excited to have a very well-rounded discussion today, Ben. This has been a while. I've been following your research for some time now. So I'm excited to have this conversation with you. I'm too. Thanks. This will be great. I kind of wanted to start out with something a little provocative. And I want to say a surprising. This question for you is a lot of people that have normal blood glucose levels. What I'm quote. Can actually be insulin resistant? Why is that? And what is this state of pre-pri-di-be? Why is it something that is not caught? Yeah. And yet so common. That adds an extra layer of reason to talk about this because it's become the most common problem. People much of modern clinical care has what I call a glucose centric paradigm and it comes to monitoring metabolic health. Or even cardiovascular disease. But the consequence of the glucose centric paradigm. And there's reasons for it. So I don't mean to state this in any kind of incriminating way. They have their own justification for the glucose centric paradigm. But it's increasingly harder to overlook because of what we know with regards to insulin. So insulin resistance is the state where insulin levels are higher. The body is having to use more and more insulin in order to keep glucose in check. But because it is able to keep glucose at that normal range, it flies under the clinical radar. Because of our glucose centric paradigm, the conventional clinician is only measuring glucose every time the patients coming in for an annual visit. With no regard to the patient's insulin levels. If we were able to broaden the paradigm a little bit and include insulin, then all of a sudden we are measuring the earliest signs of insulin resistance. Because it is insulin itself that ought to be measured when we're trying to get that view of the patients. Not only metabolic health, but insulin resistance. So to stay all that in another way, type 2 diabetes is when both insulin is high, but it's starting to really lose the war. And now glucose rises as well. Then the conventionally trained clinician says, the glucose is elevated, so you have diabetes or pre-diabetes. But in its earliest stages, the glucose is still normal, but there's this cold war happening in the body where the insulin levels are still two or three or four times higher than they used to be. It needs to be that high, but it's working well enough to keep the glucose in check. And so the glucose centric paradigm has us miss the earliest metabolic canary in the coal mine, which is insulin. So the sooner our paradigm with modern medicine includes insulin, then the earlier we can detect these metabolic problems and a person who's progressing towards type 2 diabetes. But also it changes the treatment protocol too, because not to go off on a tangent too soon off the very first question here. But if the longer we ignore the insulin, the more the clinician may be tempted to push the insulin up even higher by giving say a type 2 diabetic and insulin therapy. Now they're pushing the insulin from high to superphysiological, all in an effort to control the glucose, little realizing that in the process you are actually killing them faster. Because so much of what kills the type 2 diabetic is not the hyperglycemia. It's the hyperincelinemia and the insulin resistance. But I definitely want to get into that. Well, just sort of as a follow up question. In this world we live in now where the glucose monitors are becoming very popular and many people have them without a prescription. You can get them. Is there any signs or tests using those that people can do to kind of look for this potential problem with having perhaps high insulin? Yeah. Yeah. Right. So to answer the first question very directly, I'm an enormous advocate of CGM use the more we democratize access to CGMs. I think the better we put individuals in a position to be their own coach. You know, they don't need to have someone like me or you berating them and telling them to change their habits and eat a little better. When you see how your body is responding to what you're eating and the CGM enables that you end up making your own lifestyle changes. So with the use of the CGM, fasting glucose isn't going to be the best indicator. It's going to be the dynamic glucose. So if you've eaten a carbohydrate heavy meal or a simple carbohydrate, I shouldn't call it a big meal, but a simple carbohydrate like two pieces of bread. If your glucose levels aren't back down to normal by about two hours, that suggests a problem. So in my mind, the greatest utility of the CGM is to monitor the dynamic changes rather than the static where am I at every morning. That has less value. The dynamic changes are what has value, but beyond the use of the CGM if a person's curious about their insulin resistance. In many instances, you don't even need to get a blood test. The the skin is a window to the metabolic soul where if there are two things you can observe just on your skin. And they're both generally going to be right around the neck. One of them is a condition called acanthosis nigricans, which is when around a little skin fold that most people have around their neck. The skin will get darker pigmented, which can be harder to tell depending on the pigment of the person's skin. But what is obvious regardless of pigment is the kind of crinkled tissue paper texture of the skin. So the skin will be very sort of roughed like crinkled tissue paper. So that's acanthosis nigricans around the neck. And then the other one, people know, is called skin tags. And that is those little, it's not like a rounded little mole, but rather a distinct little kind of mushroom stock column of skin. People probably know what I'm talking about. You can see them around the neck. Sometimes you can see them around the armpits, but again, it's just a teeny little mushroom stock, almost of skin. Skin tags. Both of those are very, very strong evidence of insulin resistance. And the nice thing is, as the insulin sensitivity improves, those problems go away, just like everything else will. So many researchers, including yourself, do view insulin resistance as a sort of root of causing many different types of chronic diseases. And so there's actually majorly diseases, obviously type to diabetes, obesity's in there, cardiovascular disease. Alzheimer's, fatty liver disease, infertility. So, so why, why is that? Yeah. Something that people think is the root cause of somebody chronic diseases. And again, you know, why do you're talking about insulin resistance being common and certainly like this pre-pri-diabetic state being pretty common? What do you think the reason for that is? Yeah. For the question, I unapologetically embrace the view that to some degree, that's italicized wording there, to some degree, insulin resistance is a common root cause for most chronic diseases. So, I'm not claiming that it's the singular cause. For example, the connection between insulin resistance and breast and prostate cancers, the two most common cancers and women and men respectively, I'm not saying insulin resistance is the singular contributor, not at all, but it is absolutely a contributor. With regards to Alzheimer's disease, insulin is not probably the singular contributor, but it is one undeniably. And the same goes for polycystic ovary syndrome, the most common infertility in women or erectile dysfunction in men and fatty liver disease and hypertension. So, when I, in fact, this question is the question I asked myself as an academic in, in, at my university, when I got tenure, I thought, I looked at the rest at my future career and I thought, Do I want my career to be defined by the number of peer-reviewed papers I publish in science journals? And I thought, no, that's not enough, because most people will never read those articles, no one will ever get a direct benefit from them, and I thought, What would be the one message as a biomedical scientist that I would want to convey to people? And it was this one, it was that, to some degree, most of chronic disease can be attributed to one common origin. And so rather than trimming at the branches of this sick tree where we are giving the patient a drug for their Alzheimer's disease, We're giving them a patient for a drug for their hypertension, we're giving them a drug for their infertility. What if all of those were actually just branches coming off of one tree? Let's just cut down the tree. So when we can acknowledge a sort of common soil hypothesis, it starts to simplify the clinical approach. So all of this in my mind is a reflection of just how powerful the hormone insulin is. Most individuals only think about insulin as being a hormone that controls blood sugar, which is fantastically unfair. Insulin is one of the few peptide hormones that will literally affect every single cell of the body from brain cells to bone cells, Long cells to liver cells and every cell in between. There's no exception. Insulin will have an effect at every cell of the body, and the particular pathology within insulin resistance is unique, because you have some cells that aren't responding very well to insulin, like in the case of erectile dysfunction. Insulin is less capable at producing nitric oxide in the endothelium of the blood vessels, so there's less vasodilation, less vasodilation means compromised erectile function. So on one hand, you have some cells that suffer because they're not responding, but on the other hand, you have some cells that are overstimulated, because insulin resistance is insulin not working the same at all cells of the body, and blood insulin levels are higher. So there's too much insulin, some cells are responding too much to that insulin, so with polycystic ovary syndrome, for example, that's not a problem of the insulin signal not working well. The problem of there being too much insulin stimulating the ovary to inhibit the conversion of testosterone into estrogens and thus she manifests with polycystic ovaries. So to some degree, most chronic diseases can be connected back to insulin resistance, and to me that has a tremendous power that's a reason to focus on that disorder. So some researchers think that the high insulin is more of a response to ectopic fat accumulation, obesity, sort of being the underlying cause of the high insulin. So how do you kind of differentiate between this cause and effect what role does ectopic fat accumulation have in insulin resistance, causing high insulin? Yeah, that's a great question. In fact, that's a big question. In I already am too long-winded with my answers, so I'm going to try to be concise here. I look at the origins of insulin resistance as being one of two origins where you have what I call fast insulin resistance and then slow insulin resistance. And what you're touching on is the slow insulin resistance, which I'll come to in just a second, within the fast insulin resistance side, there are three what I call primary stimuli that in humans have been confirmed and in rodents and in isolated cell cultures that can cause insulin resistance quickly, like within hours. But at the same time, if the stimulus is removed, the insulin resistance is resolved in short order. And that is stress. So elevated stress hormones, whether it's cortisol or epinephrine adrenaline, will cause acute insulin resistance in humans. As that stimulus goes away, the problem resolves. Next is inflammation. If you increase the levels of inflammatory cytokines in cells or rodents or humans, they will be insulin resistant very quickly. In fact, people wearing CGMs may notice this that the CGM may reveal that they're starting to get a colder or flu because they noticed that their glucose levels, they're having a much harder time controlling them, even though their habits have been changed. That's often a sign of inflammation. But even with autoimmune diseases where you have people where the autoimmune disease will be in flow, so too will the insulin resistance. It will track very well with the how active the diseases. And then lastly of the primary fast causes of insulin resistance is too much insulin itself. So we know in humans rodents and cells, I've published my own work on this topic that too much insulin will result in a resistance to the stimulus. So too much insulin can cause insulin resistance. Now, none of those touch on what you had mentioned, which is the topic idea. That idea is very important. And there's a lot of nuance to it where we have to define the fat first of all. And by that I mean what of the many of the hundreds of thousands of types of molecules that we call a lipid or a fat within a cell, which are the ones that actually matter to insulin resistance. Some people will think of just triglycerides, which is the main form of storing fat. And yet triglycerides are totally inert metabolically. There was some a case in point Brett Goodpaster in David Kelly 30 years ago described this phenomenon of the the athletes paradox where they noted that in obesity with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. If you pull a muscle biopsy, there's really high levels of fat in the muscle of triglycerides. And they're very insulin resistant. And so some people would say, and did it the time well high muscle triglycerides causes insulin resistance. And yet when they did muscle biopsies from very lean exceptionally insulin sensitive marathon runners. They had just as much fat in their muscle in the form of triglycerides as the obese type 2 diabetes did. And again, they were very insulin sensitive. So it couldn't be the fat that was being stored in the muscle. The same could be said of the liver. If the liver has triglycerides, it's not the triglycerides that are causing insulin resistance. So what is it? If there is any lipid that's to blame, it's going to be a lipid called seromides. And those do not track the same across these say these the lean marathon runner and the obese type 2 diabetic. When you start measuring levels of tissue seromides or it's precursor dihydroceromides, there's still some debate is which is the two matters most. I'm very strongly just saying it's one of them. And so I'll just say seromides as a family. You can in any biological model cause very strong robust insulin resistance just by increasing the seromides because seromides will block the insulin signal. When insulin binds to its receptor, then you have a series of phosphorylation events seromides block that. Very well. It's very well defined pathway. And if you can just do one thing and just resolve the seromides, you correct the insulin signaling. So when it comes to ectopic fat, it's not a matter of how much triglycerides you're storing, but rather what is the entire metabolic milieu to be promoting seromides in various tissues throughout the body. Interestingly, all of those primary stimuli, the quick insulin resistance, all induced seromide biosynthesis in a cruel. But with the slow insulin resistance, I still think it's appropriate to invoke fat, but by that it's the fat tissue. And I don't want to get ahead of us, but my view is that if you look at tissue level insulin resistance is it starting in the muscle or the liver or the fat. I'm very much an advocate of the fat first focus when it comes to insulin resistance from that slow progressive. It settles in over years and it may take weeks to months in order to reverse. Yeah, well, this is, we've got a lot to dive into here. I mean, it's funny. I remember one of my first projects as a budding young scientist was to look at insulin resistance, like free fatty acids and can you make like a little nematode worm insulin resistance. And you know, it, it, it, for my understanding had to do with the adiposite cell and this sort of spill over of seromides that are then attacked and it all had to do with the AKT signaling pathway. Yes, you know, stopping basically the insulin receptor. Yeah, that's exactly. And that's where in, that's where seromides act. Right. We, we mentioned AKT, that's what we would measure in, you must have to. We would measure a particular protein in AKT for, or an amino acid residue for phosphorylation and then look at one other downstream signal. And then we could do some other more complicated metrics, but that was always absolute baseline. In fact, I've run so many Western blots measuring phosphory KT that next time, if I have to have, if I ever have to run another, I'm going to like show the pipette in my eyeball. I'm so tired of it. Well, this is one of those things that you know, when you do experiments, and especially when it's like something, one of your first projects, you kind of remember it. And so, you know, as I became, you're interested in nutrition, you know, later on down the line and it's like, well, it always stuck with me like there's, there's a role in it. Like there's a role for fatty acids in causing insulin resistance. Oh, there it is. So, so that was something that kind of stuck in my head, but, and I think we're going to get, we're going to get into some of the dietary causes in just a minute, but like beyond, you know, we're talking about, you kind of hinted at this earlier insulin has many roles. And oftentimes, the general public thinks about its role in just regulating blood glucose levels, but maybe you could just talk about some of the other roles in insulin plays, for example, in fact, accumulation. Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. In fact, we've already touched on a few, like, for example, who would have imagined that insulin regulates the enzyme that's responsible for the conversion of testosterone to estrogen's for goodness sake. And yet it does. Insulin has a direct inhibitory role on a romantic that enzyme that mediates the conversion and the synthesis of estrogen's and men and women. It also regulates nitric oxide production, regulating dilation of blood vessels, and other hormones throughout the body that affect water retention, salt signaling, neuron conduct of signals, and more. But when the, at the fat cell, insulin probably has its most powerful effect, where you cannot under, now we're touching on a broader topic of why do we get fat here. And I, and I welcome that topic. In fact, of all the human tissue I've studied the most in my lab, it's fat tissue that we've, when we, we started doing fat biopsies in my lab a few years ago, and that's the tissue we study the most. So I'm very comfortable talking about adipost tissue physiology. There is as much as there is the debate in two camps of what makes fat cells grow. It's just purely a matter of thermodynamics or no, it's purely a matter of endocrinology. The truth is, of course, you actually have to have both. You cannot under any circumstance make a fat cell get big unless you have both. Just to make a, put a fine point on that. If you have all the calories in the work, so I grow fat cells in, in petri dishes in my lab right now back at BYU, I got students growing fat cells in the incubator. They are swimming in a culture medium filled with calories. Everything the fat cell needs is all the calories that fat cell could ever want are around it right now. And yet their teeny little cells, they're not getting big at all until we add one thing. And the moment we add insulin into that culture, now the fat cell starts to get big. If we check them six hours later, there's a big lipid droplet. Six hours still later, it's even bigger. So in other words, the fat cell knows what to do with the energy that it has access to. A cell doesn't have any kind of intuitive intellect to think, okay, there's calories here, or more accurately, carbons that I can turn into triglycerides. And I'm going to take them in and store them. But in the context of the body, the fat cell needs to know, am I playing nice with the rest of the body? How stupid would it be if we got up and we go out on a jog outside? Our fat cells are breaking down triglycerides as free fatty acids by activating lipolysis, and yet at the same time they're pulling them right back into store them. That would be stupid. The fat cell wants to cooperate well and be part of the orchestra of the body. And so it will be releasing its fat so that the muscle can take it up. But if insulin were elevated, so insulin acts as the signal basically telling the fat cell when it's time to eat and when it's time to share. So, and then let's, if we flip it, in fact, actually I'll stay there for one more second. We even see this. Someone could say, well, Ben, that's just in fat cells. What about humans? In fact, humans provide the most convincing evidence of all that you cannot get fat unless insulin is elevated because one of the more common eating disorders, and some young people with type 1 diabetes is a condition called Diabolemia, which is this terrible tragic scenario where the person feels such pressure to be lean. And they have learned that that little syringe of insulin is the absolute gatekeeper of the fat cell. So they will deliberately underdose their insulin in order to stay as thin as they want. And as long as they underdose their insulin, and it's not even at zero, they're just doing a deliberately lower dose. They will be as skinny as they want. Now, there's metabolic hell to pay, right? They're hyperglycemic, they're getting into ketoacidosis, so they're dying, but there'll be as thin as they want. So as much as people want to say, no, it's just calories. We have a human case that he that absolutely proves that wrong. That it's not just calories. Now, having said all that, I'm not claiming calories don't matter because on the other hand, if you just have high insulin in the absence of sufficient calories coming in, that's also incompatible with life and the personal die. If you, if you and I were fasting, in fact, Dr. George K. Hill did these studies about 40 years ago, you could never get IRB approval to do it now. He would fast men for days, and then give them an insulin dose and drive their glucose levels down to about 20 milligrams per desoliter, just to see how low could the glucose get in the person maintains consciousness. And they did, but suffice it to say, if you spike insulin, which is telling the body to store energy, but there's not energy coming in, then the total energy available in the blood drops to essentially zero glucose goes down to zero ketones go to zero fatty acids go to zero because you're inhibiting lipolysis, you're inhibiting ketogenesis, you're stimulating glucose uptake. Now, the brain has no energy because it doesn't have a reserve of energy like the liver or the fat cells or the muscle, and so as blood energy goes to essentially zero the brain shuts off. So, coming back to the fat cell, you have to have both. You have to have elevated insulin sufficient to tell the fat cell to store that energy, but then you have to have the energy to store. So, calories matter, but so too does the insulin stimulus, because in the absence of the insulin stimulus, there is no such thing as fat storage, and indeed the body can't stop breaking down the fat. And in fact, that's what ketones are. ketones are nothing more than a sign of the liver burning a lot of fat, where it's burning so much fat. It has such an abundance of acetylchoy that it can't, it can no longer feed the acetylchoy into the citrate cycle because it's too full. It cannot divert it to lipogenesis because insulin is low, so that pathway is inhibited or not activated, and then the only other option of all that acetylchoy is ketogenesis. So, ketones are simply sort of this overflow, this metabolic release valve of fat burning, but they go one step further if you allow me, where how do we then reconcile it? What is it about insulin? Like if I'm not saying calories don't matter, I'm not trying to break the laws of thermodynamics. In fact, my PhD is bio energetics. I have a unique appreciation for energy in organisms, so that those carbons need to be accounted for, but the more insulin is low, you have two adaptations that allow the body to stay lean or to not store that excess as excess that they're eating as fat, which is one of the things that I'm trying to do is to make it more important. The excess that they're eating as fat, which is one of the higher metabolic rate by several hundred calories a day when insulin goes down, so the body is just burning a little hotter, the engine is revving higher, so the overall energy expenditures up again by two to 500 calories a day, and when you're in ketosis, you're eliminating ketones through the breath and the urine. The ketone that a person's breathing out or you're uniting out has a caloric value roughly similar to glucose, so you're just excreting calories from the body. So the net effect of all of that can be up to 800 or so calories a day that the person's just wasting. We're really getting into this underlying cause of what's causing the insulin resistance, what's causing the high insulin as well, and then ultimately obesity is in that mixture as well. And I think refined carbohydrates is something that you've mentioned, and I think a lot of people think that refined carbohydrates definitely play a role in insulin resistance, perhaps the primary role. But aside from the obesity, has been talking about obesity in that slow, forming insulin resistance. What role can we talk a little bit deeper about carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates, saturated fats is also something you touched on the sermide, you know, as well, we know, palmotate kind of plays into that pathway, and so what role do dietary carbs refined versus maybe complex saturated fat, and then is this all in the background of caloric excess or, you know, being in a deficit, being in a deficit, does that matter as well, the mixture of the two sort of like, because there's nuance here. Oh yeah, it has to get into it. In fact, the big, a big nuance is the calories, and this is where I need to be careful because the degree of studies that have looked at these interventions that you're looting to and all touch on more now, in low calorie or hyper calorie, it's not been fully fleshed out. I would think it's safe to say, if there's a caloric deficit, then it becomes less relevant, which of the balance of saturated fats to refined carbs. Now, then someone would say, well, unless just always live in a caloric deficit, yeah, good luck with that. I mean, if it were that easy, then people would just shrug their shoulders and say, okay, I'm just going to be on a low calorie diet for the rest of my life. So, so if you're going to, if you're going to caloric deficit and you're eating, you know, some refined carbs, then it's not you have really big or you have more wiggle room. I think you do. I'm comfortable saying that. And then again, I just have to counter that by saying, that's not really feasible long term, you know, people get hungry. Hunger always wins. Yeah. You got to eat. You got to eat. Yeah, you got to eat. You got to fuel the body. So you can't be in that kind of chronic low calorie state. So my view on saturated fats is one of the more polarizing topics, and I'm very comfortable talking about it because my entire postdoctoral fellowship was looking at I shouldn't say entire. My biggest paper ever published was looking at the degree to which different fatty acids are capable of causing insulin resistance through the conversion into ceramides. And I'm going to upset some people, but in cell cultures, if you treat cells with saturated fat, pulmetate, which is the main saturated fat in the body, you get insulin resistance very quickly. Now, if you block ceramides, you resolve that insulin resistance. If you treat those cells with monolinsaturated fatty acid, no insulin resistance, if you treat those cells with polyinsaturated fatty acid, no insulin resistance. So as much as there is, and I believe it's justified, a very heavy focus on seed oils. I approve of that focus. I think they're pathogenic, but I grimace when people invoke them as a primary cause of insulin resistance because the data do not support it. Again, I think they're very harmful, but not when it comes to insulin resistance because you can, in fact, we would treat cells with pomeotide, cause insulin resistance, co-treat them, co-incubate the cells with either olyc acid or linoleic acid, and we would reverse the insulin resistance. Now, I do not mean to give seed oils a pass. I think they're highly pathogenic, but not within cells. Well, there's other dietary sources of linoleic acid. There are. And you can't even avoid them. Really. Yeah, yeah, and in meat, I mean, literally any animal source of fat. Any animal food has some linoleic acid in it. It's ubiquitous. You would just, you know, want to control it, I guess. So with regards to saturated fat, that my own work, when I published that paper in 2010, maybe, I left that project with this idea that saturated fats are thus a cause of insulin resistance. And I had to challenge my own assumptions when I saw the work of Dr. Jeff Volic, a friend and a legend in the realm of low carbohydrate studies, because he published some incredibly compelling papers. Over a few papers, he found that I had to sort of challenge the model where I thought, all right, I was treating cells with saturated fat. Is that the same as a human eating it? And of course it's not. And now to touch on his work, you can have humans that if the carbohydrate levels are going down, they can eat two or three or four times more saturated fat than a high carb group. And then they're circulating levels of saturated fat. So the saturated fat in some in the plasma is significantly lower. That's because most of the saturated fats that's flowing through our veins is coming from the liver when the liver is told to make fat through denobolipogenesis. The fact that it makes is palmotate. So most of the fat, most of the saturated fat we have flowing through our blood that's going to get to a cell is going to be coming from what the liver's making, not from what we're eating. And he showed this very, very well. But that's only in the background of the low carb. Exactly. Yeah. So in fact, I won't even elaborate more on that. If that points clear. So the lower carbs are getting, the more you can eat saturated fat and appear to have no deficit. I'm very comfortable with that. No deficit in no problem with insulin resistance. Yes. Okay. And indeed, but calories aren't an issue in that in the context. I don't recall whether they had it in a low calorie context or not. I would suspect because insulin is low. Once again, you probably have a little more of that metabolic wiggle room. Okay. With the higher metabolic rate and then the ketone washing. So it starts to get a little cloudy as to the saturated fat scenario is they that there is definitely a pathway to insulin resistance. However, it seems as though if you're more of a ketogenic type of eater low carb, ketogenic type of eater, that pathway doesn't seem to be relevant. I'm very comfortable with that. Yeah. That's a great way of stating it that the lower the carbs are getting the less the dietary saturated fat matters. So in the context of a higher carb diet as much as it pains me to admit because I'm such a defender of saturated fats, there are a couple studies that are very well done. If I recall it was some groups in Europe in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition where they had in the context of a high carb diet and then manipulating the saturation of fats, the high carb and high saturated fat was the worst for insulin resistance and insulin signaling. When it comes to again the background of high carb, then I as much as it pains me to admit because I'm such a defender of of saturated fats from natural sources, I which is where they come from. That begins to be problematic. I think it's problematic and not just you know for for metabolic health, but cardio metabolic health. I mean, that's where you get small density of the particles. Again, it's the combination of the saturated fat and the refined carbohydrates. Now are we talking about when you're having a high saturated fat diet in combination with what you call carbohydrate, high carb? I mean, is this what if you're eating fruits and vegetables and you know, making some oats? Is that the same as eating cookies and rice? Yeah, no, of course the easy answer would be no, but I can't recall the specific the specifics of that study and anytime I can't cite a study, I want to be careful in the answer. But my view would be what is the underlying insulin effect of those carbs? So if these are low glycemic load type carbs where the insulin response is going to be very modest, insulin itself causes insulin resistance. And again, rapidly. And so what I think is if you take the context of an insulin spike with the saturated fat load, that's uniquely harmful with regards to insulin resistance. So back to the idea of what are the carbs. I think if you're talking about the low glycemic load carbs, like cruciferous vegetables and berries and citrus fruits, for example, now there's almost nothing. And then you've chased that down with the tablespoon of coconut oil, the most concentrated form of saturated fat on the planet. I think you're fine. Well, coconut oil is a bit of an outlier because so much of its MCT, which doesn't follow, which is not a substrate for seromides. So it doesn't quite fit. But in that case, no, I think that would be perfectly fine. But you are touching on what is to me the obvious villain, as much as we have increasingly two camps of people saying, no, it's the seed oils. And I'm generally more just because I'm an insulin resistance guy in the notes through fine starches and sugars. The fact is they always come together. And so the more a person has a dietary ideology that's just simply based on the idea of don't get your carbs or don't get your food from bags and boxes with barcodes. You're getting rid of both the refined starches and sugars and the refined oils. Anything else is going to be fine for the average for most people. Right. Less bags and boxes with barcodes, more whole foods you're fine. And but what about like fructose versus glucose, if you're having more fructose and the fruit, is that really causing the same insulin responses of refined oil? No, it's not. No, it absolutely is not. No fructose itself will not elicit an insulin response whatsoever. Now, the body will convert some of that fructose to glucose, which is why the diabetic who's gone hyper glycemic can just drink a cup of orange juice. And within minutes, it'll start to, you know, that's such a concentrated load of fructose that they will see a glycemic excursion. But no fructose isn't the same, but even still, depending on the person, you know, you and I were too lean healthy people, we could get away with it. If I'm talking to an overweight type to diabetic, then I say, all right, well, the most sugary of the fruits just be more careful with like say mango or banana. Then I would say, all right, you may be want to be a little more careful because your disorder is you don't burn glucose. You don't burn sugar very well. And so you just be careful with the most sugary of the fruits, but then everything else enjoy liberally. So with respect to insulin resistance and weight loss and obesity and what's causing like the cause of these things, right? I mean, this is where we get into, there's also this sort of war between saturated fat versus sort of a high carb diet and can you lose weight on one or the other better. And that's where Kevin Hall's study was kind of interesting. I love to get your thoughts because so he's published the study back in 2021 and I aged at a pretty well controlled study. Where people were on a higher carb diet or they were on a ketogenic diet. They were isocallorics of same calories. But if I recall the, No, in fact, they were, they were able, it was at libitum. And then I found they found that the plant-based group just spontaneously ate less. So yeah, so the 2021 study, they, one of the powers of that study and it's not a perfect one, which I can articulate was that they allowed them to just eat freely. So I've got to follow these kind of balance and you follow this pattern, you follow that pattern. And if I recall the plant-based, he, he rejoiced in the fact that it challenged the carbohydrate insulin theory of obesity, which I can articulate in a moment, because they found that the higher carb group spontaneously ate about 700 calories a day less. Is that sound right? I think that's right. So they, they just spontaneously were eating less because they could eat freely. They just ate, and 700 calories a day is a meaningful amount to just spontaneously eat less of. That did challenge the idea because one view, I actually don't like, but did they lose more fat as well. Yeah, they did, they did, yeah, but it was, this is modest. I mean, to, to be fair to the study, they did a good job controlling it, to be a little critical of the study. The findings were exceptionally modest. This is the kind of thing where it was like one pound versus two pounds. And it was two weeks. And it was a very small study. And a lot of what Kevin has done is a lot of these kind of mathematical modeling outcomes where they sort of speculate or extrapolate beyond the data that they get. So they, they found that they spontaneously ate 700 calories a day less. That challenged one of the central ideas of the carbohydrate insulin model, which is, if you spike insulin, you get hungry. And he was saying, well, they ate all these carbs. Mine, you was mostly plant-based. Complex carbs. Exactly. So that's right. And so it's almost, it's a little unfair because that's not how most people are getting their carbs these days. And just to put a fine point on that point, 70% of all calories consumed globally. It's about 60% in the US, our carbohydrates. And they're not coming from leafy greens and berries and citrus fruits. It's coming from bags and boxes with barcoids. But nevertheless, that's an interesting finding. My criticism of that is one, it's an extremely short term study. And there are longer studies that we ought to highlight just to offset this very short study. But at the same time, when you're eating so much fruits and vegetables, you're putting a lot of bulk in your stomach. And it didn't surprise me that these may be people who within just two weeks on this diet were just probably having a lot of bloating and gas from eating a lot of plants. When they probably weren't eating that many plants before they started the diet. So it didn't entirely surprise me that they were spontaneously eating less. I would personally enjoy eating more meat than I would big leafy greens and other fruits and vegetables. So I would probably eat more calories. The fact at the end of the two weeks, in fact what's funny is I looked at the outcome and thought, okay, the low carb group was eating 700 calories more per day. And you're telling me the only gain like one more, they only had one more pound of fat. If anything, you could have looked at all that data and said, wow, there is a metabolic advantage to a low carb diet. In fact, some of the studies, Kevin Hall, of his own work that he's trying to distance himself from, is finding that in a ketogenic state, people have a significantly higher metabolic rate. And so perhaps one outcome of that study is that when a person gets to ketosis, they were able to eat 700 calories more per day and only had one more pound of fat than the other group. Then the other group did that to me is a pretty big win. And that touches on something that's become a theme for my lab where, if you'll allow me very briefly, and we'll try to be brief. I'm not very good at that, but over 100 years ago, two famous legendary scientists, Francis Benedict, who you and I may recall wrote, created what's called the Benedict equation, which is an equation that is still used this day to try to assess metabolic rate based on someone's body. So the Benedict equation is legend of energy expenditure. He collaborated with Elliot P. Josslin, who, the most famous endocrinology clinic in the world, the Josslin diabetes centers named after him. So you had these two legends in their own realm who tried to understand the metabolism of people in what they called severe diabetes, which we would call type 1. They found that their metabolic rate was about 20% too high. And then years later, when insulin began to be a therapy, a group at Minnesota, the first author's narrow, shreener and AIR, they not only confirmed the findings from 60 or 70 years earlier that in type 1 diabetes, the metabolic rate is too high, like something's broken, they're burning too hot. But when you gave them insulin within minutes, the metabolic rate began to slow down. And so all of this back to that study from 2021, the reason I even brought all of this up, is to me, that's further evidence of the lower insulin gets, like with a low carb diet, the more metabolic wiggle room a person has, where energy expenditures up by several hundred calories a day, and we found in human work that part of it is because the fat tissue starts having a much higher metabolic rate. When insulin comes down, there's much more mitochondrial uncopling. So the engine is just revving and revving and burning energy just to create heat. But at the same time, the more you're making ketones, the more you're expelling those ketones and ketones are calories. And so maybe those 700 calories a day that the low carb group was eating in excess, the fact that they only had one other pound of fat, could be that they were just burning the rest off because of these metabolic advantages. Well, speaking of wiggle room, I mean, we're talking about a variety of scenarios here where people can have wiggle room. We talked about being in caloric deficit, you can feel a little more wiggle room, being in a ketogenic or close to a ketogenic state seems to give you more wiggle room. But what about being highly physically active? Absolutely. Yeah, good. I love how you're framing that with this context, these themes of wiggle room. Where do you have a little bit of margin to work with? Yeah, absolutely. Exercise is one of those other outlets, if you will, where if you have energy that you need to account for exercise is going to be a wonderful way to do it. I often don't focus so much on exercise because I don't want to convey to people that it can outdo the diet. There was a paper published in women where they looked at a very structured and intense exercise program. I think it was just a low carb diet and the low carb diet had better metabolic improvements in the strength training did. And so diet is going to generally smart, smartly done diet. So changing nutrition is going to yield better long-term benefits with metabolic health. However, the exercise I'm an enormous advocate of exercise. And to me, you are not going to go, it's one thing to be metabolically healthy and lean, but then it's something else to be lean and sick or weak or frail. And that's where to me, the exercise comes in. So my view is you eat smart to be lean and metabolically sound. You exercise to be strong and capable and metabolically sound. So muscle, of course, is the great glucose consumer. When if someone's wearing their CGM and they see the glucose come up and down, 80% of that coming down is what's going into fuel to muscle. The muscle is just by mass, so big and so hungry that the more muscle you have, the more you're going to have this big buffer or what we're calling wiggle room, where you're going to clear that glucose much much faster. So if you had two people of equal body mass, but one having more fat, one having more muscle, but otherwise the same, and that's a big difference though. I know they eat the same amount of carbs. The guy with more muscle is going to have his glucose curve come up and down and it'll be back down to normal in an hour, maybe 90 minutes. The person who has less muscle, even more fat, so same body mass, it's going to take much, much longer for that glucose to come down and thus take longer for the insulin to come down. Because muscle is the main place where insulin is going to escort the glucose to, and it does so very well. So the more muscle mass the person has, the more sort of metabolic wiggle room they have to clear that glucose, and then the more carbs they can eat, as much as I really point the finger at carbs as a primary problem, the more they can eat. And even to the point where if a person is very active, I knew a guy who was training for a marathon, he would eat over 200 grams of carbs per day and still be in deep ketosis the next morning. You would think well, normally a ketogenic diet is no more than 50 grams, well unless you're just burning that glucose. Right, and also you mentioned this study that was comparing strength training to the, you know, low-guard. Right, well, I think also high-intensity interval training when you're doing, you know, there's a lot of work on, so we're talking about how exercise can improve metabolic health, and I think it is a really important. Let's leave her to pull here because you're, you're activating these glute four transporters, and it does that, like that activation happens through lactate, the generation of lactate, which is happening when you're really pushing yourself hard. Yeah. And so at that point, you know, you're becoming insulin sensitive too, right? You're really kind of changing the scenario in some ways. It doesn't, I don't personally think it should give people the justification to go and eat indulge. And, you know, ice cream and all that stuff, all, you know, cheating once in a while is fine, but like, I think that you can't, you definitely can, you can't, you can't out eat exercise. You know, the words, so you can't out exercise, but you can't out exercise, but you can't out exercise, bad-dad, but I do think exercise is extremely important, especially like there's different types of exercises. That was kind of another question, you know, the strength training versus like really going hard or the long endurance training, right? So high-intensity interval training, you can kind of get away with doing less time, but you're going really hard, right? You're pushing that. And I am unapologetically an advocate of that. As much as people may look at their day and say, I have one hour, I would say everyone, man, woman, old young strength training, strength training. Maybe, if someone, I sometimes question my own motivations, where I just think if I were in a crisis situation, would my ability to run away from the challenge be better than my ability to face the challenge? No, I don't think so, because I'm going to be with my wife and kids, in the fact that I cannot run them isn't going to solve the problem. And so I want to be ready to do something if I need to, but even beyond that silly dramatic scenario, the bigger the muscle, the hungry or the muscle, and given the time constraints that most people have, but even then there are studies to show that minute from minute at that shorter end, if a person spending, I think it was like 30 minutes a day, the strength training group had better improvements in insulin sensitivity than the aerobic training group. So if you have constrained time and let's face it, everybody does default to strength training. Whatever degree of strength training you can get and just to touch on your point about intensity, just try to go to failure. At least at some point during that overall muscle or that movement, it doesn't have to be a high weight low rep, even if you're doing a lower weight higher rep, just get to failure. Fatigue yourself. Fatigue yourself. Yeah. Yeah. And that's where, like, if you're in the context of aerobic training, I think that's also like, there's a spectrum, right? Like, well, well, well, where they do, where they were able to talk, you know, if they're really going hard, it's going or then. Right. You know, it really does make a difference with respect to your, how you're pushing that lever for, for, you know, instance sensitivity and your glute transporters and them sort of translocating up to the muscle and opening the floodgates. And so, yeah, it's nice to know. In other words, there's, there's many roads to roam. And so, I do, I'm just trying to, you know, there's definitely a lot of diet wars out there. And I do think it's important to keep in mind that biology is complicated. There's a lot of things going on here. And yes, having a low carb diet can be very beneficial for insulin sensitivity, for saving off insulin resistance. But there's also people that are not going to eat a low carb diet, and they can still be very metabolically healthy, particularly if they're avoiding refined carbohydrates. They're exercising. They're not overeating. They're not in a caloric surplus. And then there's people that hear saturated fats okay, and they don't quite understand the whole context of it. And they'll eat a lot of carbs with it. And that's the worst case. Yeah, it is. Yeah, well, any, yeah, to me, high fat high carb is the worst combination for every outcome. You'd mention cardiometabolic with regards to adverse changes in liproproteen profile. Absolutely. I agree with that. But high carb and high fat just bringing it back to the fat cell. You are now giving it a stimulus of insulin, which is telling the fat cell to get big. And the fat cell wants to get big most easily just by pulling in fat, which if your eating fat is going to pull in very happily, but it won't, if insulin's low. And so, you know, that's why you can sort of pick which variable you're going to play around with, not that you've asked this, but then if having touched on what causes the growth of the fat, so naturally it begs the question of what shrinks the fat. So, while you look at those two levers, the high insulin and the high calorie, you have to pick one. My only worry is as much as people are so ardently defending the caloric view, which they have for a century now. If you just cut calories without addressing someone's underlying high insulin, you're going to make them hungry very quickly. And that's one of the reasons why I speak to the insulin side as much as I acknowledge the calorie side. I think that is a step to take. It just shouldn't be the first step. What I like to see is the first step is, control your insulin. Okay, how do I do that? Well, reduce your consumption of refined carbs. So, make sure you're getting a lot of good protein and fat. And then fruits and vegetables. That's going to help your insulin come down. Don't worry about your calories yet. We'll get there later. And just by focusing on the lowering insulin aspect, you have the metabolic advantages come into place, which is metabolic. Great goes up. Caloric wasting through ketone excretion goes up. So you're going to start to lose weight. And then, if you get when you get to that next sort of plateau, all right, now we can look at that calorie side. Because with lower insulin, your brain is more accustomed to using ketones now. And you're more accustomed to mobilizing fat. You have more mitochondria because you've been burning more fat with low insulin. Now you can start cutting calories and not have to worry about hunger kicking you out. The most obvious example of the problem with just going after calories without addressing a high insulin would be perhaps like the biggest loser. Where you never see a reunion tour with those poor contestants because they gain everything back. Right. Hunger always wins. It's true. I definitely, we're going to, I want to get more into some of what you touched on, but I kind of want to just complete this, you know, talk about a little bit more about what's the underlying cause of insulin resistance. We've talked about diet composition. That's a big one. What about meal frequency? So how often you're eating, if you're a snacker, if you're when you're eating, if you're late night, or if you're a shift worker. Yeah. How does that play a role? Yeah. Well, we pity the shift workers and bless them for everything they're doing for community, but that's the worst way to do it. So with regards to meal frequency, I think that our device that we've been giving since the 1960s, officially since the late 1970s of high carb diet. And then what transitioned into with the food guy pyramid and then what transitioned into eating multiple small meals per day. I think the proof is in the pudding, which is that's how most people eat. They eat a starchy, sugary, terrible breakfast, then they need a mid-morning snack, then they need a lunch, then they need an afternoon snack, and then dinner, then an evening snack. We can see the consequences, which is insulin resistance and obesity are the most common problems. The obesity is not common in insulin resistance, it's still common, not to go on a tangent too much, but even countries like Japan or Singapore, my second home, one of my kids was born there, I did my fellowship in Singapore. Why would the beautiful little island of Singapore care so much about diabetes when the average Singaporean is incredibly lean? Because their rates of diabetes are higher than ours by a lot. We're not even close to the most diabetic country, and that actually comes back to how we store fat. So with regards to meal frequency and what we eat, I think high carb diet with abundant calories, eating multiple times a day is the worst way to do it. So I would think it'd be better to have fewer meals, two to three meals a day, where you are controlling carbs, so whole fruits and vegetables enjoy them, and then good proteins and fats, enjoy them liberally. But this isn't convenient in social or family situations, but the more you can stack your meals to be earlier in the day, the better. So studies that have looked at humans finding where they do the kind of intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating, of you have one group, eat breakfast and lunch, one group, eat lunch and supper. The lunch and supper group has worse outcomes. Not that they're not better. I mean, any one of those is better than the standard, but when you compare the two, the outcomes are better for the meals being earlier in the day. Now, you and I are parents. How awkward would it be for me to come home and just sit around the dinner table and look at my darling wife and kids eat dinner while I'm not. I'm not going to do that. And so as much as me as a scientist knowing that it would be better for me to have breakfast and lunch and fast through later part of the day, including supper, I'm not going to do that because I care more about being a husband and father than I do about having a six pack or whatever. So I'm going to my only of doing it is, well, maybe I, without, I don't need to explain my own situation, but I think that intermittent, finding one meal of the day or at a minimum just have three meals a day, and try to have about four hours between those meals. And then the most important thing, I would say, and this is where we pity the shift workers and thank them, it would be evening, do not snack in the evening, especially one of the things I think that people don't appreciate is as much as they're monitoring their sleep and they're wondering why they have night after night, terrible sleep habits. The most common cause of insomnia is elevated body temperature, so they're too hot, and one of the most common causes of being too hot is hyperglycemia. Most people don't appreciate that when your blood glucose levels spike, you activate your sympathetic nervous system, and of all the times of the day when your sympathetic nervous system is activated, you don't want it to be turned on when you're trying to go to bed. That's when you want the parasympathetic to dominate, so when someone eats that evening snack of spiking their blood sugar, then they go to bed in a hyperglycemic state, and they're going to have all of the signs and symptoms of anxiety. They're going to be laying their hot, their heart is going to be beating hard and fast, and they're going to feel that pulse pounding and wonder, what am I anxious about? Why can't I just sleep? Well, it's not because you have anxiety, it's because you went to bed hyperglycemic, but unfortunately that is the one time of day where people are at their weakest, and I'm very sympathetic to that, because I feel the same thing. People can walk past, treats, and junk food all day, and deny themselves that, knowing that it's not good for them, but the moment six o'clock comes around, or seven o'clock, then all of a sudden the temptation starts to take on a new form, and they indulge, and that is the worst time. It would be better for them to indulge in that at lunch, for example, than it would be at that point of the day, not only metabolically, and maintaining good insulin sensitivity, but not to mention sleep, and then the compounding consequences of poor sleep just creates this vicious cycle. Yeah, okay, so the meal frequency, it sounds like the more you're each time you're elevating, it's time you're having an insulin response, that insulin is then you're getting into the fat storage. Yeah, and you will get hungry. So as much as we highlighted that 2021 study, what I ought to have done is highlight the work of Dr. David Ludwig, Cara Ebleing, and others, and shy at all, and New England Journal of Medicine in 2012, where there are so many decades worth of evidence showing that as much as we had that one study, suggesting, well, the insulin higher insulin group didn't had less hunger. Yeah, there's a lot of evidence showing the opposite. So you end up creating this roller coaster of glycemia and hunger, where the person eats a starchy sugary breakfast, which lets face it, most breakfasts are these days. They have this big spike, and then when you go high, you inevitably go low, and then when you go low, hunger comes again, even though you may still literally have food in your stomach, and yet your brain is starting to sense, well, I'm hungry, because the overall amount of energy and the blood has gone down, even though there's plenty of stuff still in the stomach, but it stimulates hunger. That's David Ludwig's main contributions. So anyway, it puts the person on this roller coaster of glycemia, and every time it comes down, hunger wants to push it back up again, and so yeah, I cut you off though, but that puts them in a position to eat six or seven times a day, and if they're not eating, they're drinking something sugary, either a soda or sugary fruit juice. Right, and the difference between this sugary type of breakfast you're talking about, and perhaps some of this more complex carbohydrate would be the fiber is slowing that glucose response. Oh sure. And causing some satiety as well, so that would be something that you would contrast. Not to mention even in that study in 2021, they probably were doing more complex carbohydrates and not. They were, yeah, it was plant-based, and that's again another reason why I thought we need to be careful. Not, I don't mean to sound overly critical of the study. I appreciate it, but at the same time, I think we need to elaborate on the limitations, which is most people aren't starting with the breakfast of a big leafy green salad. But there is a group that found that when you have a breakfast and they look to breakfast, and the name of the article was something like, more rapid return of hunger. It was something like return to hunger was in the title. And if the breakfast, I so color it breakfast. So same number of calories, protein was clamped, and it just differed in the ratio of fats to carbs. The high carb group was hungrier, much sooner, and then ate more for their next meal than the low carb group. And so I would say as much as we want to be sort of fair with whole plants, if that breakfast is a mix of whole plants with good proteins and fats, that's going to be a winning combination of satiety. And then have a nice lunch, and in my view, for me personally, I don't eat breakfast as much as I said I wouldn't elaborate on my own approach. I eat a big lunch. That's my main meal of the day, because I want, and then I find if I have a big filling lunch, it's easy for me to taper through dinner, and then easy to not snack in the evening. And much as I know, one of the great ironies of being a metabolic scientist, and yet a fallible human with bad habits sometimes is that evening time is still my weakest time of the day. My kids think that I'm the best dad in the world, and I want them to be healthy, and I don't really bring a lot of cereal into the home. I make breakfast for the kids every morning for the most part, and it's a mix of various meals that I make. And I think, wow, my dad just loves me so much. Yes, I do. I love you all my little darling babies, but I do it because I don't want cereal in the home, because if they're cereal in the home, daddy is a meth addict. I'm going to come to cereal. And if it's there as much as I know, I will go through this, I can almost script it out, where I'll put help get the kids to bed, a clean the house, train things up, and then everything's quiet, and then I think I need six bowls of cereal right now. And so then I will eat myself sick, and like a true addict, I will tell myself, I'll just have one bowl. What's the problem with one bowl? And then yet there's this little shoulder angel telling me, oh, but you know, you're not going to stop at one bowl, but then there's the addiction side of me saying, yeah, I want this. I'm just going to have one bowl. I never. My wife can though, my wife has this uncanny alien like ability to eat something like this, something sweet like an ice cream or cereal, and just have a little bit of it and be done. I can't do that. She is a moderator, and I am an addict when it comes to these kinds of things, which is one of the reasons why I don't love a lot of the modern. The most popular modern mantra when it comes to nutrition is moderation and all things. What if you can't moderate, then it would be better not to even start. Right. I want to talk about, you talked, you sort of alluded to this, and this has to do with the other contributing factors to insulin resistance, and you're talking about this in the context of if you're if you're late night eating, it can disrupt your sleep. And for many reasons, you're also, you talked about some very interesting stuff that I hadn't really thought about before, but also you're digesting, you know, when your your symptoms are all active. It's thermically effective. Yeah, you're hot. Yeah. So it makes, it makes perfect sense. And in fact, I remember a friend of mine, I'm Dr. Sachin Panda. He's done a lot of research on time, I'm sure, did eating, and he's got this app. Mystercoding in clock where people were, you know, uploading pictures of their meals, and it was timestamped, and they're putting comments and like the most one of the most common comments he was getting was disrupting sleep. Eating later was disrupting sleep. And finally it was like, he's like, got it look into this. I mean, there's this. And it does and it's a people talking about this, and it's kind of funny when you kind of get that reverse thing that you're looking at when you're when you get the data, then something else kind of pops. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So eating late at night seems to be disrupting people's sleep, and that's that's a real thing. I'm convinced. I'm convinced that given the natural temptation and inclination people have to indulge before bed, I'm in the sleep epidemic, the poor sleep epidemic. I'm convinced that more of it isn't blue light. It isn't even light exposure, even activities. It's you're going to bed hyperglycemic and it's full and you're full. And so like you said, you're stomach, you're bubbling, you're digesting. When no, you ought to have give yourself at least a few hours before from your last meal. Yep, before you go to bed. Yeah, exactly. I mean, takes like what? Five. How many hours of digestion? That's going on while you're asleep. That's the one thing's sleep. So you're talking about these fast causes of insulin resistance, inflammation, the chronic stress, high cortisol. And then the last insulin insulin. Where does lack of sleep come into that? Because I have seen, I've read studies and we were talking a little bit about this before we, you know, started the podcast and that is First of all, when I became a new parent and my, my sleep was entirely wrecked. I mean, just entirely wrecked. I mean, I age like 10 years. But we're good cause. But we're good cause. I would do it all over again in heartbeat. My post-prandial glucose, which is what I was monitoring at the time with my continuous glucose monitor was, I mean, it was not my normal. I mean, I was pre-diabetic. Yeah. It was unreal. And so I started looking into literature and this was the most surprising thing. When I, when I wanted to wear a CGM, I was more like, How is watermelon going to affect my glucose? And I was more into the fruit and the look, what a great tip. This is insane. And then it was like the disrupted sleep and everything else. Nothing mattered anymore. I was like, this is real. Like this is the real deal here. And I started looking into the literature where sleep, you know, sleep deprivation after one night. Yeah. Like half, you're getting four hours of sleep instead of eight. You can be insulin resistant the next day. And I'm like, what? Oh yeah. So I'd like to hear about that and how that's contributing to this, you know, fast cause of insulin. Yes. Well, everything you just said, I am nodding to because I can relate. When I've worn CGMs, I absolutely see that these single most predictive variable of my glycemia in any given day is how did I sleep? Nothing, and that I've played around with nothing has even come close. So when you get one bad night of sleep, the stress, so it fits under the stress category to put to make it very succinct. So of the three primary causes of quick insulin resistance, it's stress when it comes to sleep deprivation. One bad night of sleep will result in a much higher and disrupted rhythm of cortisol. And, and so cortisol is will cause insulin resistance in every biological model very quickly. So too will epinephrine. And epinephrine is another stress hormone, sort of the faster stress hormone to cortisol being a little more delayed. But both of them are higher with regards to sleep deprivation. And even even epinephrine, even adrenaline can cause insulin resistance in humans. If you do a steady little drip in a human of adrenaline, they're going to be insulin resistant, with demonstrably insulin resistant within just an hour or two to make so that's how sleep deprivation causes insulin resistance. And to make matters even worse, what is the most common intervention to try to offset the negative consequences of sleep deprivation? Well, it's more caffeine. Well, more caffeine is going to increase epinephrine even more epinephrine causes insulin resistance. So even the solution to the sleep deprivation ends up inadvertently compounding the metabolic consequences of the sleep deprivation. Now, let's not to say epinephrine, it's not to say caffeine doesn't have some metabolic benefits. It can when used correctly, like I would say when used in the context of performance. But for someone who's trying to offset the consequences of their sleep deprivation, you may have some increased alertness, yes. But the metabolic consequences of the sleep have now just been added on. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. We cover a lot of detailed evidence-based content here, and I want to make sure that you don't miss any of it. Now, back to the episode. What about, so we're talking about other causes of insulin resistance. You've also kind of looked into some of this other stuff that's very interesting with respect to environmental toxins and how Aureparticulate matter from Aureparticulate matter from Aureparticulate matter perhaps even plastic associated chemicals or microstics. How those can contribute? Is that something that's meaningful? Like, the sleep deprivation, of course, is all sounds pretty meaningful. Are these other talk about it and whether or not they're pretty meaningful in the context? Super, super question and really fair of you to stay to that way because as much as I found that work and still do really, really cool. And we're doing more of it. So to articulate what we've done so far, we've published reports looking at PM 2.5 diesel exhaust particles and we published another report looking at cigarette smoke. With the cigarette smoke particles, that was purely in the context of sermides forced mitochondrial fission and insulin resistance and the cigarette smoke did all of those things. The newer paper that we published about a year to ago was I think the first to find that if you just have increased diesel exhaust particles, even when we calorie clamped these, we pair fed these animals. In the animals that were inhaling more of the diesel particles at physiological levels, at a level that a human could be exposed to, they had much fat or fat cells, so they had much more at a precise hypertrophy, which accounted for a higher body fat mess. Even though they were eating the exact same amount of calories, again, we pair fed them. We only let them eat as much calories as the other group is eating and they still had more fat. So it does suggest that there are non-nutritive stimuli. You'd mention some others. We've not done work on microplastics or the plasticizers, those, like dieethylstylbestrol and BPA, but those also have been shown to promote greater fat expansion in the absence of calorie changes. That's another reason why I think that we don't do ourselves any favors when we only have a calorie-centric view of obesity, because there are more variables that come into play here. Now, to answer that last part of your question, which is to what degree should the average person be worried about that, I pains me to say this, because it's my own work. I think that's a lower tier concern. It's also one that some people may not literally be able to do anything about. Like, if you are simply living in an inner city area and there's just pollution, there's nothing you can really do. Maybe you can replace your in-home air filter more frequently and get one. But those aren't cheap either, so I'm very mindful of the financial constraints of the person who we may be fictionally talking about. I guess others, that would be the only thing you could do. If you could have a better-in-home purifier, great. But for the vast majority of people who couldn't even quantify their pollution exposure, let alone afford an intervention to reduce it, the good news is that's going to have a much lower effect than just changing your nutritional and exercise habits. There are some more affordable temperatures now that do seem to make it dense and reducing particular matter. But it's interesting that this air pollution seems like pretty pervasive. It's not just metabolic health, but it's Alzheimer's disease. It seems like a cardiovascular disease. It's really affecting lungs, of course, in a respiratory health. It's affecting so many different chronic diseases as well. It is important to keep the context in perspective, right? Obviously diet exercise, these things are the most important. It comes to metabolic health, but they do not just form metabolic health for a variety, just our overall health. It's interesting of what it's smoking or vaping. That's the new project that we're starting. We have just preliminary data now. When we look at the super heated particles, which is what you're inhaling, we have been fining. I've even published this yet. This is unpolublished. My master's student is this is her thesis project right now. The data is forthcoming. But the early data suggests that it's actually at a relatively controlled dose matching it for the cigarette smoke dose that we use previously. It's worse. Now I can't speak to the consequences of the tumor agenesis effects. Maybe the person's going to have slightly better outcomes with cancer. We're looking at the outcome we've measured so far is mitochondrial. Outcomes looking at the degree twitch the mitochondria can take in oxygen and convert it to ATP. Rather than the oxygen being converted into super oxide radical, it's worse with the super heated particles from the vaping then from the cigarette smoke. Do you think this is coming down to nicotine or other things in the vaping? I don't know. We have just the whole animal data so far. The next step will be isolating individual particles to try to find out which culprit if one culprit is more to blame with regards to the esig exposure versus the cigarette. Because it is different chemicals. Yeah, right. No, I'd be I'm going to have to let me know. I mean, I will not. Yeah. Before we get into some solutions here, I'd also love to touch on one more thing that you've also looked at with respect to other causes of insulin resistance. And metabolic health and that is commonly prescribed medication. And this is something that I've witnessed firsthand and friends where their metabolic healthy lean and metabolic healthy. They get on an antidepressant example. And all of a sudden gain a bunch of weight. I mean unbelievable on a weight 30 to 40 pounds. And our no longer metabolic healthy. So there's a whole host of commonly prescribed medications out there from lipid lowering medications like statins, you antidepressants and other neuropsychiatrics, you know disorders and medications that help with those disorders. What is that something to be concerned about? Oh, for sure. Yeah, it absolutely is. And I'll just mention one that you just mentioned, which is statins just because of how commonly are. So there's no evidence of statins that I'm aware of. We're going to create weight gain. But there are metabolic consequences to messing with cholesterol. Less people forget cholesterol is a precursor to an essential component of the electron transport system. And so it's no surprise that if people are waging war on cholesterol synthesis, the mitochondria may suffer. And in women, middle aged and older women have a 50% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes when they get on a statin. That's a meaningful increased risk. And it appears to be much more susceptible to the consequences of statins, metabolic consequences of statins. Not to mention the increased risk of Alzheimer's and even certain cancers that come with statins. Now, I'm not intending to sound like I don't think there's ever a place for statins, but I do think they're over prescribed. Now, more heavily metabolic, any steroid that's been prescribed to control inflammation is going to be deeply problematic for waging. So if a person has an autoimmune disease or a chronic inflammatory condition and the clinician has prescribed a corticosteroid, they're going to gain weight very, very quickly. Because that starts to play on that stress pathway where the more cortisol is that pathway is being activated, which is what that's doing. The more you're going to make the body insulin resistant, higher insulin promotes fat gain. And then just for the sake of time, perhaps I just mentioned the atypical anti-cycotics, the any drug that ends with an apene at the end of the day. At the end of it, the suffix being apiany is generally going to promote waging. That's probably through a central insulin resistance of the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus becomes insulin resistant, you have a reduced satiety signal and the person's just going to start eating more. All right. So let's kind of shift gears and talk about some solutions here protocols to maybe enhance and sensitivity. People that are, you know, we talked, we started this conversation talking about people who are a large population of people that are actually pre pre diabetic. They might be, you know, on their way to insulin resistance or already insulin resistant and not even really know it. What, what are some of the best strategies people can do now to really make a difference. And, you know, dietary strategies, you know, stress reduction, physical activity. But, but also how soon can they expect to see changes and what should they look at? Yeah. So see and monitor those changes. Yeah. Well, in fact, I'll, I'll start with that last part of your question, which is how quickly can it turn around. We published a clinical report. So working collaborating with the local clinic in Utah, we took 11 women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. And their A1C was 8.9%. So very much diabetic range. In the physician who's very much on board had given these patients two options. And he said, you can leave the office with a prescription for an anti diabetic drug, like metformin, or you can meet with the nutritionist and go through this lifestyle nutrition counseling. And in just 90 days, their A1C went down, the average A1C, the average was 8.9 and it went to 5.6. So no sign of diabetes whatsoever after just 90 days without a pill popped or a needle injected. So I have often taken that 90 day span as a very reasonable amount of time to reverse insulin resistance. And now depending on the scope of the problem, it may take a little longer to get rid of all of the consequences of the insulin resistance. But I think 90 days is a very reasonable justified timeline. Again, I say justified based on our own evidence. Now, what did we tell them? That could sort of segue into the first part of your question. We gave them, in fact, just three pieces of advice based on the three macronutrients. And I've actually kind of already alluded to this, which the first one is control carbs. And that was simply this admonition to eat whole fruits and vegetables. You don't even need to count it. Just whole fruits and vegetables. But in the case of these type two diabetics, we said try to be mindful of the most sugary fruits and vegetables or the starchy fruits and vegetables. So the tropical fruits we said, please be careful with like bananas, pineapple's mangoes. And then the starchy, if the vegetable grows in the ground, eat less of it relatively. But all other fruits and vegetables, and that's still a lot, enjoy liberally. And then prioritize protein and don't fear the fat that comes with that protein. And that was an important caveat because we didn't want them to be drinking fat, but we wanted them to acknowledge that in nature all protein comes with fat. Don't be afraid of that fat. When humans eat fat with the protein, we digest the protein better and it's more anabolic. There's studies and humans to show that people work out, give them protein. They'll have a certain degree of muscle protein synthesis. If you give them protein and fat, it's even higher than it was with just the protein alone. And that's most people don't appreciate the bile when the gallbladder from the liver releases the bile into the intestines. We always just think of that as being relevant to fat digestion and it's critical for that. But it also enhances proteolytic enzymes. It makes the proteolytic enzymes more active, better. They work better. So we digest the protein better. And that may be the mechanism that explains the enhanced muscle protein synthesis from the combination. So that was the dietary advice we gave them. And I would just say that for people that manage your macros, control carbs, prioritize protein. Don't fear fat. And then when it comes to eating time, I'd mentioned it earlier. The more you can stack your meals earlier in the day or at least the bulk of the calories coming earlier in the day, the better. So that you can taper off through evening and by all means or please don't eat within that three to four hour window before bed as much as you can don't don't eat. And then exercise. And my view on exercise as much as we both are I am an enormous advocate of exercise. I was a personal trainer back in the day during my master's degree and I hated every minute of it. But I did it and I appreciate the role of exercise and I enjoy exercising every day. If people are wondering what's the best exercise? My somewhat pithy answer is the one you'll do. Just do something. If you can do the sort of higher intense strength training that we were talking about, then please do it. But if this is like some 80 year old grandma who just likes walking around with the girlfriends, just walk around with your girlfriends. Keep doing that habit. Whatever exercise you can do and you're going to do, then just do it. But there is something to be said for timing it where perhaps you can do your exercise session. If it is a walk around the block a few times with the gals, do that after your biggest meal. Where if you just do 10 to 15 minutes of physical activity after your biggest glucose spiking meal, you will blunt that glucose excursion by half if not even better. So what would have been a huge, big, long glucose spike in a commensurate insulin dose as well. You're going to cut that down substantially. If you did, if you do time that little bit of physical activity, and maybe that would be one other comment. If that's not your main exercise, then have that kind of exercise snack where you had your big meal, maybe hopefully it was lunch, go on a 10 or 15 minute walk. Even those of us that, you know, I'm a professor at a university, I can eat my lunch and still just go on a little walk around the campus. My building is so big that in bad weather, I can walk around my building, even around the hallways. And so just find a way to get up and do something in little bits, little bits of activity throughout the day, but then still as much as a person can try to have that concentrated time of, all right, I'm working out right now and I'm going to sweat and I'm going to get tired from it. Yeah, I love the exercise next. I like to do body weight squats. That's something that I'll, you know, try to do after a meal, particularly when I'm on vacation and get the gelato that I never ever ever eat in less time in Rome. Yeah, well that's the place to do it. But okay, well that's great. So many people ask about these supplements and you know, are there these supplements that can improve in some sensitivity. So you know, you hear everything from magnesium to apple lipoc acid, a burberine, apple cider vinegar, and if there's any merit to that or taking it before a meal or or is this just like dropping like a drop of water on the pool to like fill the pool. Yeah, when in fact, everyone you just mentioned works frankly, the one I like to talk about the most because the evidence is so compelling and it's so easy to get. So burberine is undoubtedly effective, no doubt it works. Burberine absolutely works. I love apple cider vinegar as a personal favorite. Maybe it's because of my old man palette where I like really tart things the older I'm getting. So I just love the taste when I dilute it in water or sparkling water. But apple cider vinegar, that really that that's the shortest of all short chain fats that acetic acid. And the short chain in the human diet as much as we eat a lot of fat most of it is from seed oils and soybean oil. But we lose out on the full spectrum of fats because we don't really eat a lot of fermented foods anymore. So we don't get the medium chain fats and because we don't eat any much fermentation fermented foods, we don't get any short chain fats for the most part. So short chain fatty acids, which is what apple cider vinegar is, is a really it that's a small normal heal that punches well above it's it's weight. Where the acetic acid will reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis to help control glucose, which is very relevant in a person with diabetes, especially type two. There's so much glucone always in their bloodstream. It's constantly pushing the liver to make more glucose. Apple cider vinegar will inhibit that and so it helps the blood glucose by just having the liver dump less glucose into the blood. But it also stimulates a and p.k. And you'd mention, gluten four at the muscle. The reason exercise is able to open gluten four or translocate it and get the glucose in without insulin is because of a and p.k. So it's that interesting paradox of exercise where insulin comes down and yet glucose is taking in more the muscles taking in more glucose than it ever was. It's because of this kind of back door of the muscle exercising, AMPK gets turned on through a series of events that moves gluten four. Well, apple cider vinegar will do the same thing in the absence of exercise. I'll be at two or more modest degree. So that's a couple mechanisms among others, including mitochondrial biogenesis and a little bit of uncopling. Where apple cider vinegar is one of my favorites where if you take a couple tablespoons before your most starchy meal, you absolutely could compare the glucose curve from one day to the next. And you'll see that it's significantly lower with just that tart little bit of drinking. That's fascinating because when you're talking about the short chain fatty acid, you know, and I'm thinking, you know, acetate. Yeah. So acetate acetate acetate. Yeah. We're going from acid base. I'm thinking of lactate, lactate lactate lactate lactate lactate, and let's have an urgeny rating with exercise and lactate signaling is to AMPK kind of. It's it's very much. Yeah. And then I'm thinking, well, is this like a short chain fatty acid? Sort of like, is there signaling molecules, right? Yeah. And is there something that would be so interesting to look at to see if there's something going on with lactate acetate malate, right? Like that's in like a granny Smith apple or something like a more sour apple, right? Yeah. I mean, all these different short chain fatty acids, well, the short chain fatty acids that you're getting from foods. And then there's another malice also in like blueberries, malice acid, malice acids and then. So, so I just, my, my sort of wheels are turning here when you're mentioning that because it would be so fasting to see if there's. A common mechanism like why is the acetic acid working? We know lactate works too. Yeah. And so I think acetic acid, I know beta hydroxybuterate, one of the, one of the ways that main ketone, not that we've talked about ketones, but some of my work is on ketones. I've been one, I've wondered in the past the ketone is unique because on one hand it's a nutrient. It's a calorie to be burned, but at the other hand, it's a signaling molecule. And it is known to elicit some of its signaling like anti-inflammatory effects and anti-oxidin effects. Part of it is through changes elicited because of a G protein coupled receptor, where it does have a cell surface receptor that it will activate. I don't know the degree to which acetic acid may do the same thing, but with regards to beta hydroxybuterate. Even exogenous ketones, that wasn't when you mentioned, but there are increasingly increasing studies showing that you can have. There was just a study in women with PCOS. The only intervention was to give them exogenous ketones. And every outcome related to metabolic markers and PCOS got better. And the only change was the supplementation with exogenous ketones. I don't know that that was an effect of the bio energetics of the ketone. It was probably more of the signaling effect. And so that would be another thing if a person's becoming increasingly curious about ketones. And that's not without justification. The evidence supporting the value of ketones is growing and growing quickly in it ought to. I have never in the past wanted to be seen as a drum-beating advocate of a ketogenic diet. Simply knowing that that's not everyone's cup of tea. But increasingly, I will vigorously defend ketones as very beneficial, viable signaling molecules in the body. So even when it comes to controlling the metabolic response, you're probably going to eat less because ketones have a very satiating effect. More so than say glucose does. But then they also will impact mitochondrial and coupling and help the body burn through that glucose faster. No, it's interesting. ketones are definitely signaling molecules. And I also think there's a lot of overlap between lactate and beta hydroactics. Yes, you do right as well. They're activating a lot of the same brain-dravener, or trophic factor, one. And I've had Dom, Dagestina, on the podcast twice. We talked a lot about ketogenic diets and Eric, Eric, for it and talked about them as well. I do think they're not easiest diet for people to follow for several reasons, including social too, meaning differently. No, no, they're not. It's restrictive. It's definitely restrictive, but perhaps cycling them. I've been interested in cycling it. I've only done it like a couple of times. For me, it's also very hard to do as well. But I'm interested in the brain benefits of ketones. And this is where exogenous ketones, I think, become so helpful. Where if you have someone who just says, I just don't want to do the ketogenic diet, but I still would like some of the benefits. There are so many good options nowadays that I think it becomes a viable approach for someone to say, I want the ketones, but I don't want ketogenic, so I'm just going to drink them. Do you think the dose matters? Not only in respect to wanting the right dose of ketones to activate these beneficial signaling pathways, but also to make sure that you're not dipping too low. Like your glucose doesn't go too low where you're kind of like what's going on here, a little bit anxious, a little bit. Yeah. Like you can get, you know, when I have an eaten for like many hours, I like forget to eat them so busy. All of a sudden, I'll start to get a little anxious and I'm like, what's going on? Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah. What's interesting actually, even the earlier in our discussion, I mentioned on one of my many tangents, Dr. George K. Hills work. And he was really one of the more famous prominent, what they called at the time starvation scientists. We would call fasting scientists, but that same study I mentioned where he, they, it made you wonder why was it that these patients who got down to 20 milligrams per deciliter of glucose. Many people will say that's lethal, it'll kill you. And yet they not only didn't die, they had no cognitive deficit whatsoever. The speculation, I don't know whether it was him or maybe Richard Veech in a sort of follow-up commentary, a ketone scientist who's also passed away now, where, if the brain has adapted to ketones, it may be more resilient to tolerate a low glucose. But most people, one haven't adapted to ketones and two don't even have any ketones. That's the problem is because the same intervention for the most part that's going to drop the glucose in someone, like someone who eats a really sugary meal or drinks it, their glucose is going to come up. And the higher it goes, usually the lower it's going to go at the end where you have a rebound hypoglycemia. You would say, well, I should be able to weather that drop because I have ketones, no, because the same thing that's helping you reserve reverse your glucose, the high insulin is going to inhibit ketogenesis. And so you've deprived your brain in that acute moment of its primary fuels glucose and ketones, although the brain does use lactate as a fuel as well, albeit to lower levels. And if glucose and ketones have started to go low, that's going to be a panic at the brain because that is its two primary fuels. And as I mentioned earlier, the brain doesn't have a reservoir of stored energy. I'm very, very modest amount, but it's metabolic rate is so high that it needs constant supply. Right. Okay, well, let's talk a little bit more about, you know, fat. And we kind of talked about this a little earlier about, you know, not all fat being equal and a lot of people are thinking about fat is just stored calories, but I mean, there's much more to this picture right. So there's, there's different ways we store fat and there's the subcutaneous way there's visceral fat. These fats are not the same. Yeah. And now when you're talking about liver biopsies, you kept pointing to the abdominal region, and I was pouring a few were talking about you were getting visceral fat biopsies or probably not. But can you talk a little bit about these different types of fat and what determines whether or not you're going to store fat subcutaneously versus visceral, why visceral fat is so dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of that conversation, there's so many topics I could take with this. And perhaps just, perhaps just to try to bring it to one common theme, I would describe the two ways in which a human can gain fat mass. So earlier I'd mentioned, and it's a perfect opportunity to bring in different ethnicities because different ethnicities will store fat differently. And this all is underlying the earlier conversation of the slow insulin resistance where I said it starts in the fat cell and I very much advocate that view. So why is it that Singapore 15 years ago was recruiting young scientists to come to diabetes research? Where you look at the average body weight in Singapore and by American US standards, they're very lean people and that's reflective of all East Asians and in most in many South Asians as well. So India up through Japan and the Korea's. Why is it that these are people with such low body weights? And even low body fat levels and yet their diabetes rates are way higher than we have in the US. And that is the difference in how people store fat. So if a human body is gaining fat mass, it will gain that fat mass through two different mechanisms. It will either be a function of multiplying the fat cells. So the person will have the ability to make new fat cells. That's called hyperplasia. And when the fat is undergoing hyperplasia, the size of the fat cell is staying very modest. So the size of each individual fat cell is smaller, just a lot more of them. On the other hand, you could have someone who's storing more of their fat through hypertrophy. Where the number of fat cells is not changing, but the size is. The hypertrophic fat cell is a very sick fat cell for two reasons. And then I'll explain the ethnic predispositions, predispositions because of it. So firstly, the fat cell gets, the more insulin resistant it becomes to prevent further fat growth. So to say that all another way, a fat cell can undergo more expansion than any other cell in the body that I'm aware of. It can get 20 times bigger than its original volume. And as it starts to reach this point of maximum dimension, it has to start limiting its growth. And so it becomes insulin resistant to stop growing. But at the same time, it starts to become hypoxic. Where the fat cell has become so big that they've pushed each other too far from capillaries. And now it can't get the oxygen from the capillaries. And so it starts releasing a bunch of prone flammatory cytokines because some of them will work like a trail of breadcrumbs, resulting in one capillary having a little budding capillary grow off and follow the cytokines to the hypoxic or suffocating fat cell. So the hypertrophic fat cell becomes insulin resistant to stop growth and it becomes prone flammatory to try to correct blood flow. All of which results in a very insulin resistant on the course to cardiometabolic disease body. Now back to the various ethnicities, some ethnicities like whites and blacks have the ability to make new fat cells. So these are ethnicities that can be a little fatter than other ethnicities and yet have lower levels of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. And that's what we see in the US. High rates of obesity, but relatively modest rates of type 2 diabetes. As much as we think the problem is bad here, I think the US ranks somewhere in the 70s of, if you look at all the countries in the world and how diabetic they are, we're about number 70. Whereas Singapore, for example, in Japan, is not too far back, Singapore is in the number 9. In all the countries of the Middle East are actually numbers 1 through 8 are like Oman, Dubai, Jordan, these countries in the Middle East. And then the other countries sort of round out through Southeast Asia and the Middle East are in the Pacific Islands, the most diabetic places. These ethnicities, especially, so India has among the highest most diabetic countries on the planet, East Asia, Southeast Asia, their fat cells on average are significant. The one paper I'm recalling where it looked at Caucasian men in South Asian men, and did an adipose subcutaneous biopsy. And it found that the average South Asian men had adipose sites that were about 4 times larger volumetrically than the fat cells in the Caucasian. At the same body size, same body fat percent, they just had much bigger fat cells. So to say all this another way, or to start to wrap it all up, what is more problematic about fat storage? It's not the massive fat that matters most, but the size of each fat cell. When it comes to slow insulin resistance and the consequences of too much fat mass. And this explains why, say, an East Asian fellow will just be moderately overweight compared to his obese Caucasian counterpart. And yet he has all of the complications of insulin resistance. And this guy just doesn't look at in his speedo. And as otherwise, fine, metabolically. It's because his fat cells are small because he has so many of them. His fat cells are so few, but they're much larger. And so he has a lower body fat mass, but it's more harmful because his fat cells are bigger. And that is the problem with visceral fat. There's nothing inherently pathogenic about visceral fat. Those fat cells aren't mystically harmful. It's just that visceral cavity is so limited and volume that it only allows fat growth through hypertrophy. Because that is a way to limit the total amount of fat you can grow. If our visceral fat was able to grow through hyperplasia, then it may expand so much that it starts to compress our tissues. It starts to squeeze the liver or squeeze the intestines or squeeze the kidneys. And so by only allowing visceral fat to grow through hypertrophy, you do limit how much it can grow, but it also becomes much more prone flammatory because hypertrophic fat cells release a lot more prone flammatory cytokines than smaller hyperplastic fat cells. So there's very much a genetic ethnic component to this that influences how ethnicities are able to stimulate the growth of new fat cells. And then there is there's absolutely a sex component to it as well, which of course is still genetic, where women because of the effects of estrogens are able to stimulate a higher degree of hyperplasia than her male counterparts are. And so women will have that ability to in this explains why the average woman both has higher fat than her male counterpart and yet is healthier in every single cardiometabolic metric. If it was just a matter of fat mass, then women should be dying more from all these cardiometabolic diseases and yet they're not it's men. Because women will have more fat cells, but smaller because of estrogens men have relatively lower levels of estrogens. So we don't have that hyperplasia as much as the females do. So if we're getting fat, or it's more through hypertrophy relative to the to the ladies. So with respect to these hyperplasia versus like hypertrophy fat cells, and I probably should have mentioned the visceral fat, the fat lining that organs, you mentioned the visceral cavity is this, this fat's usually like the lining the organs and usually find it around the midsection as well. But you mentioned the fact that the the fat in the adipose tissue will become insulin resistant to basically shut down growth as a response like adaptation like okay we got to stop growing. What about spillover of fat like is this feeding into that whole serimide path where that you started to talk about where is visceral fat and is this, you know, this hypertrophy like swollen fat cell. Also causing more serimides to go into your system. Right. I'm so happy you brought that up. I deliberately chose not to because I thought I'm already being too long-winded, but here you are slow pitching the ball to me anyway. So yeah, the problem with that hypertrophic fat cell is that it's becoming insulin is trying to still force feed it to store more fat. And insulin's main mechanism of promoting fat storage is by inhibiting lipoluses. So insulin will promote the growth of the fat cell. It does enable the feeding to some degree, but it's most powerful effect is blocking the breakdown. And so the fat cell is saying insulin, I can't keep, you keep telling me to grow. I can't. If I continue to grow, I mean it literally gets to the point where the membrane can start to fray. It can't hold itself together. It's like a balloon that's being filled too much. And so it becomes insulin resistant, which is manifested as insulin not being able to inhibit lipoluses. Now we have a metabolic milieu that's quite odd where you have high insulin and high free fatty acids. That does not happen unless the fat cells are insulin resistant. So just to make that clear in a fasted state or a low carb state insulin is low. And so you have more lipoluses. So free fatty acids will be higher. That's a, that's a very common feature. This is the fasted state low insulin high free fatty acids. In contrast, the fed state, especially if it has some carbs, now insulin has gone up. It's inhibited lipoluses and so free fatty acids will be down. This is the normal. It's one or the other. And less the fat cells are insulin resistant. Now you have high insulin reflective of insulin resistance, but it can't inhibit lipoluses. Thus we have high free fatty acids. This is a problem back to the, the topic aspect that you've mentioned earlier. We're normally if free fatty acids are high, the muscle will just burn it. I'm the muscle will happily burn free fatty acids. Or any tissue, any cell with the mitochondria would burn it, but if insulin's elevated, you can't burn fat. Then fat burning beta oxidation has been inhibited at virtually every single step with high insulin. So now we are storing more fat as triglycerides, which is the the ectopic fat deposition. So that's where you start to have fatty liver. In fact, the main cause of fatty liver is spillover from fat from fat cells, especially visceral fat. That's the main origin of all that fat, as much as we talk about fructose and other nutritional variables. And those matter, the majority of it is fat that's leaking out from the fat cell. And because insulin's high, it can't burn it. Normally the liver would take those fatty acids and just say, well, I'm going to burn it into ketones. But if insulin's elevated, it can't happen. The liver has to store it. The pancreas starts to store it. But as I mentioned earlier, the triglycerides are not the cause of insulin resistance, but now we have the high insulin, which is an acute cause of insulin resistance, and a lot of free fatty acids. And where some of those are going to be pomemate, because pomemate is some of the stored triglycerides, you have pomemate coming out. That will directly be activating TLR4, the receptor that's going to then drive sermides to be synthesized. So you have a, and not to mention the inflammatory cytokines that are also being released from the hypertrophic fat cell. At the same time, also stimulating sermide accrual. Thus, we end up having the perfect metabolic milieu to promote insulin resistance, and it all started because the fat cells got too big. And not to mention that the cytokines signaling, you're talking about now the chronic inflammation. Yeah. There studies now linking visceral fat to cancer. Yeah. That's right. And so it's the brain, the cancer incidence, it's all... Yeah. Yeah. The protein is a better predictor of heart disease than LDL cholesterol is. And the fat cell is the main source of a protein called Pleasureminegine activator inhibitor 1, PAI 1, whose main job is to erode clots as they form. So why is it that bigger fat cells relate so well with stroke and cardiovascular disease? Because you are producing a protein that's inhibiting the breakdown of clots, making it just more likely that someone's going to have a stroke. So you talked about genetics and someone's sex in terms of like male or female and how that affects whether or not they're going to have this predisposition to forming more fat cells or taking that fat cell and just expanding. Yeah. What other factors play a role? Because I mean, is there a dietary? Is there some other factors that are also contributing to that? Because yeah, I'll just mention one just for the sake of time, which actually is Linnolake acid. So my view on seed oils is that they can contribute to insulin resistance through a secondary route by influencing the dynamics of the fat cell. Specifically, when Linnolake acid is taken into the cell, one of its peroxide metabolites that it can turn into is a molecule called 4HNE. And 4HNE has been shown to inhibit the fat cells potential for hyperplasia thus forcing the fat cell to only go down hypertrophy. So if there is some nutritional link that can drive fat cell storage into one versus the other, Linnolake acid does have that effect. Linnolake acid being converted to 4HNE will inhibit the adapogenic hyperplastic signaling and only enable the hypertrophic signal. Is that dose dependent? Like, are you going to get that if you're eating? I don't want people to be scared to eat like walnuts. Yeah, for sure it would be. I don't know. I can't quantify the dose, but yeah, in general, my view, you and I were chatting earlier. Linnolake acid is ubiquitous in nature. Yeah, you have to have it. So as much as I'm talking about it and invoking it as a problem, I think it's very appropriate for you to say, yeah, but it also, like it's in Mother's milk for goodness sakes. It's in every meat source. And I'm a huge defender of meat. I think meat is very healthy and yet you're going to have Linnolake acid in it. It would maybe counter or not counter by just stating that those also in nature when you have the Omega 6 Linnolake acid, you often also have an Omega 3 that comes with it. That to me is key that if you're can end, often it'll have some degree even miniscule levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E will help that Linnolake acid not go down the pathway of proxidation. It'll help it just go down the pathway of oxidation even. Dr. Stephen Kunein, this incredible man, just a delightful individual, he's done a lot of work documenting the fact that Linnolake acid, when it's allowed to just be burned for fuel, burns so high and so rapid that it It allows the brain to create its own key tons. He has a fascinating area of research on this. So I've always tried to have a little bit of a nuanced view of Linnolake acid in that it's everywhere. But when we get it in nature, it'll come with an Omega 3 and it'll come with some amount of often vitamin E, which will help prevent Linnolake acid from going down the pathway of becoming a villain, which it can. Linnolake acid will undergo peroxidation very readily and become a very harmful series of metabolites that are harmful to cell membranes and mitochondrial membranes. Is that the more, because I've looked a lot at the literature here and I remember I first was submitting a paper and I was going off about how terrible Omega 6 to high Omega 6 and it wasn't necessarily from C-doile, but it was kind of going that way. And a reviewer just got me hard and I started to really have to look at this with a different perspective and get into the literature. I really was shocked by how much of the literature is showing with these Linnolake acid and even switching saturated fat with these polyensaturated fat seed oils, where either neutral or beneficial with the exception of maybe one study, but like the bulk of them were not. Showing that and it wasn't until I started to really dive deep and see like okay, it's like this heated seed oils and when you start to heat them, especially if you're like, he and them very very high temperatures or you're heating them over again. Yeah. Where they're becoming problematic at least with respect to some of the biomarkers that were being looked at like inflammatory biobunters. So I'm wondering, like, is the heating the seed oils, the bigger problem that consuming them in this really concentrated form and heating them and the whole package that they're, you know, the friends that they're they're bringing along right people are consuming these seed oils in process food right they're all in process food. Versus eating some like you said meats, you know, while not I mentioned nuts because they have a higher ratio, but they also you know, have a omega 3 example. So I do think it's a nuanced topic as well. I don't want people to like be so scared of just anything with Linnolake acid right no and I totally agree I would also just say I'm also not the person to tackle the seed oil topic. There would be other people that would be way more articulate on both sides attacking and defending I've only tried to view that I've tried to kind of stain my lane, which is I'm an insulin mitochondria guy and in that that's why I've tried to be a little cautious because as much as people will invoke Linnolake acid for causing all heart disease all fatty liver disease, et cetera. I just sort of say okay great that's not my forte I'm looking at it in the context here of I'm looking at metabolic outcomes so. Having said all that I think what you just said is what I would agree with in that. I think it's appropriate to scrutinize seed oils. Because of how we eat them we eat them from refined seed oil sources Dr. Christopher Ramsden at the NIH number of years ago published a report finding that. Soybinoil has become the number one consumed source of fat calories in the human diet. That's not good. And so I think it's appropriate for us to call them seed oils rather than Linnolake acid coming from all natural animal sourced foods, which I'm always an advocate of dairy has Linnolake acid in it meat has Linnolake acid in it. They all do seeds have Linnolake acid in it, but they also come with other things like the degree of vitamin E and an omega 3 to some degree. And those help to varying degrees reduce the pathogenicity even if the Linnolake acid was had the potential to be harmful, which it does through proxidation more than the other fats do. These other characters that are coming along with it help it behave and act in a way that we want it to act because it is everywhere. It is ubiquitous. And so I think where you and I would agree and maybe others would disagree, I don't have a fear of Linnolake acid per se as an omega 6 in so far is it's going to come in every natural source of fat that I'm eating. But where earlier I had said control carbs, if you're controlling your carbs by and part of me for repeating again not getting your carbs from bags and boxes of the barcodes, you've also eliminated essentially all of those refined seed oils from your diet too. And that's why I also don't like getting cut up in the is it seed oil or carbs, they always these refined carbs, they always come together. And such as I am the guy who's saying well refined starches and sugars are real problem and never someone else would say no it's the seed oils and I'd say you know what. Fine they're coming together anyway because it's it's in that it's you opening up that pack of chips or treats or some they're fine snack that's going to have the first ingredient is going to be a starch. That's it's the potato chip you know as it's been fried but what's it been fried in it's been fried in corn oil or whatever so you not only have a concentrated source of omega 6 but it's undergone this super heating. And now it's absolutely gone through some proxudation so if the person's just eating whole fruits and vegetables and natural sources of fats and proteins you're going to get Linnolake acid and I would say there's no reason to fear it. Yeah, I think also it can be a distraction if you're if you're not focusing on like avoiding avoiding the refined carbohydrates or avoiding the refined sugars making sure you're getting exercise making sure you're not overeating like all those things. And then like I look full disclosure I don't cook with seed oils. Yeah, I don't cook with them. I don't use them. Yeah, but I will say that an unbiased look at the literature. I still think I don't I think cooking them I think eating them I would stay away from that for sure. See but if someone wants to put a little bit of you know. Of this uncooked oil on their salad, do I think it's like the worst thing in the world? I'm not sure that it is. I don't either I know on the current evidence, but you know at the end of the day, I think that that person's probably already doing things right. Yeah. And that's really what matters. Right. Well, you'll get someone else on here who can articulate the seed oil point much more eloquently than I can. Yeah, if there's if there's a researcher doing that, I'll look into that. But kind of going back to this fat cells and shrinking and you were talking about the the adipicites kind of becoming insulin resistance first. Mm-hmm. Insulin resistant first. And and that kind of leads into something that I forgot I wanted to ask you about as we were talking about some of this before. And that is you know insulin resistance doesn't happen at the same time in all tissues. And and so it'd be kind of nice to just talk about that briefly. Yeah. We continue on in terms of like the muscle, the adipos tissue, the liver. Yep. What happens when each of those become insulin resistance, insulin resistant? And you also talked about adipos tissue. Yeah. Maybe first. Yeah. Is that then contributing to the other ones then becoming insulin resistance? Yeah. Absolutely. So there are people who would say, no, the fat is first when it becomes so what what is the first domino if it's a sequence of tissues, which is the first to fall when it comes to here's the person healthy. Here they're progressing through insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes being the most obvious outcome at the end of it. What's the progression? Some would say it's the liver. Some would say it's muscle. Some would say it's fat. It's the fat. Uh, in my view very strongly. It's the fat tissue. Um, so insulin resistance in its early stages is high insulin, but normal glucose. The problem with invoking a fat, a muscle, centric view or a liver centric view, or I need to add one and alpha cell centric view because that's also relevant of the pancreas for a reason I'll touch on in a moment. The moment those become insulin resistant glucose is not going to be controlled anymore. And so then you skip a step because insulin resistance, if you look at the progression of the person towards type 2 diabetes, the insulin has come up first. And then the glucose is normal and the glucose will start to climb and that's when we detect the problem. So my view is the fat cell falls first. It's the first tissue to become insulin resistant as it starts to experience some degree of hypertrophy. That then starts to facilitate the other tissues becoming insulin resistant. And at that point there's no order in my mind. It'd be hard to distinguish if there's another order, but I actually when I teach this very idea to my students, I want to my undergraduate assignments as a classical pathophysiology. And these kids are fortunate enough to learn the true origins of type 2 diabetes from an expert. But I actually show the fat cell first and then the next step, I say, I teach you this concept of, all right, well, what flips the switch from prediabetes insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes? What is it that makes the glucose go up? That is then when the muscle becomes insulin resistant, you have lost access of the main glucose consumer. So you are clearing the glucose out far of the blood far worse, less readily than you were before, resulting in a hyperglycemia. When the liver becomes insulin resistant, insulin can no longer inhibit glycogenolysis. So normally one of the mechanisms whereby the liver works with insulin is by storing glucose as glycogen. Insulin inhibits the breakdown of that glycogen, unless the liver is become insulin resistant. Now the liver is breaking down glycogen and releasing it as glucose even when insulin is attempting to tell it not to. thereby further compounding the hyperglycemia, then the last one is the most overlooked but absolutely relevant, which is the alpha cell. The alpha cell is the Yin to the beta cells Yang, where the beta cell releases insulin. An insulin's most famous job is to lower blood glucose. The alpha cell releases glucogone and its most famous job is to increase blood glucose. Very important for fasting and exercise, the opposite of when insulin would be up basically. But the alpha cell knows when to not release glucogone when the beta cell is releasing a lot of insulin. Because insulin and their next door neighbors within the eyelids of the pancreas, insulin will flood the beta cell with, rather, the beta cell will flood the alpha cell with insulin. An insulin will inhibit the production of glucogone, which is good. Because then that helps insulin overall affect blood glucose to bring it down. But the alpha cell can become insulin resistant. Dr. Roger Unger at UT Southwestern over years published a series of mind-blowingly cool papers finding that in type 1 diabetes, if you just control the glucogone excess, you don't even need to give the patient insulin that you could correct all hyperglycemia by just inhibiting the glucogone. That's just a weird little feature of the fact that when the alpha cell becomes insulin resistant and it does, it starts releasing uncontrolled glucogone, which comes to the liver and once again is telling the liver to make glucose and release it into the bloodstream. So the fat tissue becomes insulin resistant first. That facilitates the insulin resistance of the glucose controlling tissues. Muscle liver in the alpha cells. And when those start to become insulin resistant in any particular order, that's when you start to see the glucose start to climb. But we know decades potentially before the person ever starts to have hyperglycemia, they have hyperincelinemia. That's why I think the fat cell is subtle enough in its metabolic demands that it doesn't really need a lot of glucose. It's metabolic rate is so modest. So it can become insulin resistant without really affecting fasting glucose levels. So the person's fasting glucose levels can stay normal. But once the glucose handling tissues, like the three I've already articulated, become insulin resistant now glucose is uncontrolled. Going back to this fat cell hyperplasia, like a lot of, you know, forming lots of different fat cell loses this, you know, swelling of it, that hypertrophy. If a person loses weight, like let's say they're on a weight loss, you know, doing, you know, doing, predicting their calories, they're doing low carb, they're exercising any of the combination of those. What happens to the fat cells? Do they shrink? They shrink. Do you ever, do they have a diet? They do. Yeah, they do. Yeah, but they shrink. So I actually say, when I talk about this in my class, I say, the patients on a fat cell shrinking journey. How I describe it. Because that is weight loss. All weight loss is shrinking of the fat cells. Now, however, a fat cell has a lifespan of about 10 years. And so depending on the utility of the fat cell, it may not be replaced, or it may be replaced. And so you can over time lose fat cell number. And indeed you do at around 60 years old, 60 to 70 a person, so during infancy, childhood, purity, we're making fat cells. And then for the most part, the number of fat cells we have is set. Now, women have a little buffer, like I said earlier, but even then, you could have a person who gains 100 more pounds or 200 more pounds in adulthood for the average individual. That's hypertrophy, not a result of hyperplasia. But then when we get to older age, then the number of fat cells stop turning over. So as they start dying at their tenure, lifespan, we don't replace them. And so at the end of life, we have a little drop off in the number of fat cells. So no, so weight loss is shrinking the size, not changing the number. And in fact, if you force artificial weight loss by sucking out fat cells, where you are just sucking out the fat cells and reducing fat cell number, then you don't improve any cardiometabolic outcome whatsoever. So there's many studies that show that you can have people lose a significant amount of fat through liposuction and they're not a single outcome has improved. Whereas if that same person had lost that 20 pounds of fat through normal lifestyle interventions, like you'd mentioned, they would have had improvements in every cardiometabolic outcome. But you don't do that with liposuction because you haven't changed the size of the fat cell. The size of your fat cells is the same. You've just sucked out a lot. But the remaining ones are still there. And now, in fact, you've put a greater pressure on them because a person in adult doesn't make new fat cells very readily. So what will happen is the remaining fat cells will be forced to grow through size because they can't share the burden with their other neighbors that you've sucked out already. So when a person starts to regain weight, the cardiometabolic outcomes are amplified. When people do lose weight and they're shrinking their fat cell size, are those fat cells? Like, let's say someone was even insulin resistant. There was problematic fat cell. And a shrink-sensei is the way a shrink-sensei is. I mean, is it still problematic? No, no. In fact, that's why it was the slow insulin resistance, the reversal of that. Like over the 90 days in the type 2 diabetic patients that we had in our published case series, that would have been not that we measured this, but it would have been because of a shrinking of the fat cell. Now, let's say they grow those fat cells again, the same problems will come back. So whatever intervention, one of the problems I have with diet, whatever the intervention is, low carb, or calorie restricted, whatever people will complain and they'll say, well, but it's only short term. Of course, it is. Whatever a person has done to reverse their metabolic problems will only persist, as long as they adhere to those changes. The more they go back to their old habits, the more the same consequences will return, because it was those old habits that caused it. With respect to the visceral fat, and I mean, I particularly visceral fat, since it's the fat that's really got that expansion of the fat cells. It can only go through hypertrophy. Right. Only going through hypertrophy. What sort of targeted diet lifestyle interventions would be suggested, or evidence-based to actually decrease the visceral fat? Yeah, that's a great question. So visceral adiposites are more responsive to the lipolytic signal, the fat breakdown signal of epinephrine. So anything that increases epinephrine will have sort of pound for pound or sight for sight, visceral versus subcutaneous is going to have a better visceral response. So the more the epinephrine is being targeted, so that's going to be things like exercise and like cold therapy. For example, cold immersion, talk about an epinephrine spike. So anytime you're really activating the sympathetic nervous system, you're going to be sort of molecule from molecule cell for cell targeting the visceral more than the subcutaneous. So it is more responsive to that sympathetic tone than subcutaneous fat is. Interesting. So epinephrine high-intensi-enabled trainings, like more intense exercise again back to that, and then yeah, deliberate cold exposure. Yes. And I'm a big advocate of cold immersion. Great. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's interesting. I didn't know about the fact that epinephrine was linked to that as a mechanism. Okay. So a little bit about, we talked a little bit about the muscle mass, and I think just the one thing that was kind of on my mind was that sort of anabolic paradox of insulin. Yeah. And kind of what your thoughts are with respect to, you know, somebody builders are injecting insulin. Yeah. So how, yeah, like let's talk about a little bit like reconciling insulin thrall, hence being this, you know, anabolic versus, you know, storing fat, you know, metabolicly problematic. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to be careful in answering this because I'm an insulin guy, but I'm not a muscle cell guy. But because I'm familiar with insulin, I'm comfortable enough answering this question. So there was a group. I think it was the same guy mentioned earlier, Schrinner and AIR at Minnesota at the time. They published a paper finding that insulin wasn't necessary for muscle protein synthesis. So, so you have the, here we have the muscle, me of the protein formed, giving the bulk of the muscle. There's, you have to look at both the stimulus, building it, and the signals that are breaking it down. They documented that insulin was not necessary for muscle protein synthesis, but it was very helpful for inhibiting the breakdown. So it, they suggested that insulin's main effect of muscle is an anti-proteolitic effect, rather than estimulating effect. So that, my general view is that that's where insulin's going to be favorable, but it also didn't take a lot of insulin to inhibit the proteolysis. I do not think it's at all justified to take insulin as an intervention to try to promote muscle growth. And in fact, just as a very unscientific observer, when I compare the physique of Arnold and Lou from the old 1980s bodybuilders to the modern day bodybuilders, and the almost bizarre phenotype of this bubble belly, you know what I'm talking about? Anyone listening, probably knows what I'm talking about, but I want to be polite, you know these are real guys. But we can all agree that there's an odd physique, you know, whereas Arnold and Lou were extremely tapered, very, very narrow waist, modern bodybuilders, yes they're more jacked, but they're also oddly distended with their abdomen. I can't help but wonder whether insulin has been somehow facilitative to promoting some degree of visceral growth because insulin wants to promote fat growth. It wants to, no matter, it's like a fertilizer for fat cells. And so someone who's wanting to overdose on insulin in an effort to promote muscle when you're just maybe enhancing some proteolytic anti-priolytic effect, I'd say there are better ways to do it, like not that I'm endorsing any intervention like this, but you'd be better off just focusing on growth hormone than you would injecting yourself with insulin. So I'm not a fan. Now, I appreciate some big yoke bodybuilder looking at relatively spelty, small bend-bickman and sing, well, what do you know? Maybe I don't know a lot. No, I think that's a really good, goes a great point that you made for sure, for sure. I think we covered a lot of the muscle effects on insulin and how exercise is so important, growing muscle tissue and exercise is important for allowing the muscle to be that, you know, sight of glucose disposal. But let's kind of then shift gears and talk about this weight loss. And obviously, I think right now, there's a big trend in rapid weight loss and weight loss that's made very easy by taking GLP1 agonist drugs like Ozenbeck and Wigovie. And I'd love to know what your thoughts are on. Maybe first, you can explain just, you know, generally how these GLP1 agonist work and why they're causing weight loss and how they affect metabolic health. But also whether they're addressing the underlying root cause of obesity and, you know, if or if they're sort of shortcutting around that. Right. Well, there's no, no question. It's a bit of a short cut. And I am, I'm worried about the long term effects. So with GLP1, I have had my finger on the pulse of GLP1. Probably since, well, not since its inception, but since the late 90s, early 2000s. My PhD lab was one of the first labs funded in the US looking at the study of Incrotins by a drug company. And so I've, I've long been familiar with GLP1 and the other Incrotins incrotin being a word to describe these gut derived hormones that have metabolic effects. But it's been interesting for me to note the evolution in their use because originally they were only used as anti diabetic drugs. And then the, what was considered kind of an off target effect of controlling satiety is now the mechanism of action at these much higher doses as the dose has been multiplied up to the kind of current, we're govie weight loss dose. So it's really just been an evolution in the dose of this, of semi-glutide for the most part, although there are other glue tides that fit in this as well, but semi-glutides the main one. So at the lower dose originally used these GLP1 activators worked actually by inhibiting glucogon. So back to the alpha cell that I mentioned earlier, it's we come back to them now, where in type 2 diabetes, the insulin resistance of the alpha cell results in a chronic elevation of glucogon chronically then telling the liver to be releasing glucose leading to the hyperglycemia that defines the diabetic state. At this low dose, semi-glutide inhibits the alpha cell, it inhibits glucogon. And by inhibiting glucogon, you're helping correct blood glucose. So it was an effective anti diabetic. Now some people have the very mistaken view that semi-glutide or GLP1 activators also release insulin that is not true. That has been shown to happen in isolated cell cultures, but in humans there's no evidence. And the authority on the subject is a guy named Arnie, ARNE, A-R-N-E, OstraP, A-S-T-R-U-P. ArNE OstraP in Denmark. He's one of the absolute authorities on this topic. He's published multiple papers in humans showing that no amount of GLP1 illicit's in insulin release. So that we need to put that idea to bed. In humans that does not happen, GLP1 does not act as what's called an insulin secretagog or a hormone that adrog that forces the beta cell to make insulin. GLP1 inhibits glucogon, which helps correct blood glucose. Now, as the dose starts to go up higher, just I guess just for the sake of time, I'll mention two effects, which is one in the guts and then one central. Within the intestines, GLP1 will act to delay gastric emptying and slow peristalsis. So that has the effect of a person eating and having that bulk sit in their stomach much longer, which is going to generally discourage them from wanting to eat more. At the same time, it's going to take a lot longer to get through the intestines. Now, that is good for weight loss because it forces them to eat less. A consequence of that is it ranges from the uncomfortable to the problematic. So on the uncomfortable side, the person will have food that's sitting in their stomach for up to 20 hours. And so they will start burping a lot and they will have like people who go through general surgery and have to be put under for general anesthesia. They found that normally you tell the person don't eat for 24 hours and their stomach's empty, so they're not going to vomit food up while they're asleep. But when they found that if people were on these run semi-lutide, the food was still there and they would still have food in their stomach, even though they had meat for 24 hours. So this results in what people colloquially just call ozempic burps where they just have putrid breath and burping and just stomach nausea. But because of the change in gastric emptying, even some medications like birth control medications don't work anymore, for example, because you've so changed how long it takes that drug to get from the stomach into the small intestine where it would have been absorbed. So it starts to change the absorption of certain compounds and drugs, as well as potentially affecting the absorption of nutrients, which may be part of what the person is observing with regards to other changes in say muscle mass. Maybe that's a result of just poor nutrition because even though they're eating, there might not be getting, there might not be digesting and absorbing everything they're eating anymore because of how the rate of the the pair stalsus has changed so much. So anyway, numerous changes of the guts and then there's a central nervous system effect to activate satiety centers. Now the combination of those two is powerful where you have the I'm full signal here and I have a lot of stuff in my stomach here resulting in a person who has a much better control over their appetite, I guess, to say that a polite way or to say that another way they just don't have as much of an interest in eating. So that's the main mechanism of action and and GLP1 is a normal hormone I didn't mention this GLP1 is a naturally produced hormone from the gut. We have it, we know that we can change its levels based on what we eat and that might explain why some people eat more or some people eat less. But still, my concern is that the dose of GLP1 that we're using now has gone, it's just a little too much of a good thing. What is the dose range that you are referring to talking about? Yeah, yeah, so I think that the commonly used doses are going to be in the order of actually in this case it's I know it in milligrams, I think it's about five milligrams or so two and a half plus milligrams and and a once weekly injection. And if people are thinking of that in units, I think that's going to correspond to units of about 25 to 30 units of GLP1. So that to me is too high. And two and a half milligrams being the low dose. That is the yeah that that's the low dose of what is used now. Right. And the underlying the the addressing obviously this was he's were used for like you mentioned this was a, you know, diabetes drug. Right. I mean, this wasn't necessarily meant to treat obesity. Yeah, right. But I guess that it all depends on you know the cause of obesity over eating is partly partly a cause of obesity. So, oh, no, for sure it is. Yeah, in fact, I am as as much as people will hear me describe this and think that I'm being just universally opposed. I actually do think there's a place for these GLP1 drugs. A paper was published in 1996 that looked at the changes in GLP1 in two populations. They took otherwise healthy humans and split them up and they noticed changes in the obese group and the lean group. So when they gave both groups a high fat meal. They looked at the GLP1 response and it was roughly similar in both groups that whether they were obese or lean they ate a high fat meal and GLP1 was the same heavy overlap. Suggesting that the satiety effect of that meal would be roughly equal. Now, I'm speculating a little bit there. I'm adding that last part in. So if you look at the GLP1 response given GLP1's effects on satiety, which is very meaningful, the high fat meal elicited a similar response regardless of bodies fat mess. However, when they gave them a high carb meal, the lean group had a huge increase in GLP1. The obese group had no statistically significant response whatsoever. There was a little noise, but the error bars were big enough that there was no statistical difference. Again, it wiggled around a little bit, but at no point did it reach a significant increase. Suggesting that you may now have two people who sit down to eat a meal. One person eats that carbohydrate heavy meal and they have a big GLP1 response. They pat their tummy and slide the plate away. The other person eats that same amount and asks for a second or even thirds because they aren't getting that GLP1 response. So to me, the best use of these drugs in the context of weight loss isn't for weight loss per se, but it's rather to acknowledge some people aren't going to get that off switch when they eat carbs in particular that apparently people responded the same way to fat. There are differences in how people respond to carbohydrates with GLP1. This study made it very, very clear. It was published in the journal Gut in 1996. To me, that's the best use of the drug to say the physician or the clinician, the expert would be talking with the overweight patient. And they would say, you know what? You need to control carbs. These refined sugars and starches. You got to eat less of them. Then the person says, yeah, but that's the problem. I can't eat less of them. I'm addicted to them. All right, let's use a low dose. And this gets into that range of, you know, five to ten units or a 0.05 to one gram. Millogram, the milligram per week. That is going to be a kind of a micro dose level. To me, that's the best use where the physician, the expert, the clinician is saying, let's just give you a low low dose of this drug. And it's going to, and I want you to think of it as helping you control your cravings. Because what do people crave? People don't crave a plate of bacon and eggs. They don't crave a handful of walnuts. They crave something sweet and gooey or salty and crunchy. And usually it's going to be potato chips crackers, cereal, ice cream. And that's what we want to help them control. So rather than saying, this is a weight loss drug. Let's, what if we change the conversation and said, this is a drug that is designed to help you change your eating habits? While you're on this low dose, we're going to put you on this low dose for three months. And I'm going to see you again in three months. I want you to be thinking about your evening cravings and these, these refined foods that you're always eating. And then you get them back three months later. Ideally, they say, boy, for the first time I can control my cravings and I'm doing better and I'm losing weight. Then I would say, let's see what happens when you cycle them off and say, all right, you've learned how to, what it looks like and what it feels like. The differently let's see whether you need to still be on this micro dose. Maybe they need, maybe they're done. I know people who've done this and they say it changed me and I've, it's been a year and I've not gone back to my old habits. It just helps them rewire their habits. In 90 days is a good length of time to change your habits. So at 90 days, let's do a check-in. How are you doing? It's not really working. All right, well, let's keep going. Maybe we increase it from 0.05 to 1 or something. But basically, my view without having it outlined as a specific protocol would be micro dose and cycling. Let's put you on it with the intention of helping you change your habits. Let's take you off it to see whether the habits of stuck. If they haven't, let's cycle you back on. But always using these very, very low doses, not for weight loss, but for changing habits. That's interesting that in your experience, people can do this micro dose and after about 90 days, they can keep the, the appetite regularly and under control. Because when you look at studies with people using the clinical clinically relevant doses that they're using now of these different deal. And GLP went agonist. A lot of most of the people end up gaining weight back because they go back to their old habits. Yeah, and I think that's because they're not framing, I think a part of it's the narrative or the story, which is let's frame the conversation and the context of helping you change your dietary habits. Rather than this is just a magic bullet and you're going to lose weight. I think in that instance, the person has changed the way they're eating, but maybe they're not, this is, I know kind of getting into this hokey pseudo area of science perhaps, but when the conversation is focused on the habit, I think it helps change habits. Oh, I mean, absolutely, the way you're thinking about something can change the outcome, for sure. I want to kind of go back to something that you mentioned, that was very interesting to me. And it has to do with the way, you know, this food is sitting in your gut and the way digestion's kind of changed. And perhaps, you know, nutrient absorption. I hadn't really thought about it in that way because what I'm sort of alluding to is, you know, the, I guess it's pretty well known now is that when people are rapidly losing weight, whether it's on a GLP one agonist or it's from caloric restriction. They can lose a lot of muscle along with the fat. It's not just all fat. Particularly if people are not getting enough dietary protein, which is a big signal for muscle protein synthesis. And if they're not engaging in resistance training, which is the other very important signal for growing muscle mass. So my question to you was going to be, you know, is there a kind of a way around this muscle loss by increasing dietary protein. Obviously, the resistance training would be key. Perhaps even more key now because, you know, for one, if people aren't eating, I mean, I don't know how many meals a day people are eating probably varies depending on the person and what their side effects and stuff are. But eating the protein and then like are they absorbing all the protein? I don't know if it even looked at that, but that's interesting. Yeah, I haven't seen it either. But it does beg the question, is it is the use of semi, so it's very real. The evidence is very real showing one of the best look papers in the New England Journal of Medicine about two, three years ago. Found that about almost 40% of the weight loss that the person was losing was fat free mass. Now that is itself a big pool, but some of it would be muscle and bone mass. But I have not seen data that has determined whether it is a direct effect of the semi-glutite. In other words, is the drug actually harming muscle and bone, or is it just an artifact of the poor nutrition? It might be a little bit of both, but it also might matter in the dose where I've heard reports. In fact, my lab is doing a muscle cell culture now looking at varying doses of the drug, where it's possible at a lower dose, it's facilitative. And at a higher dose it may be more catabolic when it comes to muscle mass and the dynamics of muscle protein synthesis. But even still, as far as I'm aware, it's unknown, is it a direct effect of the drug, or is it an artifact of just poor nutrition because the person is not eating and what they are eating, they're not absorbing very well. It's certainly not eating enough protein. Yeah. This kind of, there's another interesting point here, and that is like GLP1 receptors. And I mean, they're all over many different organs. The muscle has them and so does bone. Yeah. Yeah. So that is, that is an neuron. Yeah. I mean, and it also starts to touch on the broader use of GLP1 drugs where you and I both know people are using them well beyond, as much as I've been known. The fact that it's now an obesity drug where it was once just a diabetic drug. Now people are saying, well, it's a blood pressure drug. It's an Alzheimer's drug. It's a fertility drug. I just don't know, in fact, as far as I am aware, there's very few studies to touch on that broader on the mechanism. And even all of that could simply be an outcome of improving metabolic health because back to the origins or the beginning of our conversation, because metabolic health is so foundational to chronic disease, all of this could just be a consequence of improving metabolic health. But it still is worth the pursuit of determining, well, maybe it is a direct effect. Maybe there is the direct effect of the drug at the neuron or at the muscle cell, et cetera. As far as I'm aware, that's not been elucidated yet. I get that with my next question for you. I mean, we do have these observational studies that have looked at people on various forms of the GLP1 agonist and a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease. Obviously, type 2 diabetes Alzheimer's disease now. And you have to wonder, like, is this a is there a direct effect of, you know, agonizing these GLP1 receptors on different tissues or is this an indirect effect of weight loss and improve metabolic health. Yeah, yeah, so I don't know, but what I can speak to is our unpublished results right now in muscle cells. We're treating them with varying doses of semi-glutide. At the higher doses, there is metabolism of the muscle and they're far less resilient and far more fragile. So we challenge the muscle with a chemical challenge and they die way more readily. At use, at doses used now at the level, in which you see the dose in the drug in the plasma. So it's a physiological dose. Okay, well, then this gets back to the microdosing and this is kind of, you know, I feel like you're talking, about microdosing GLP1 agonists for a very different reason than I'm going to ask you about now and you're talking about appetite regularly. Yeah, and and that I think that's it's super interesting, particularly for people who don't have real good control of their appetite or perhaps their, I mean, who know their hormones are out of whack, right. There is now this sort of growing budding interest amongst, you know, many people about this potential GLP1 agonist being a longevity drug because of these different, you know, outcome studies that have been observational in nature, right, and looking at correlation here. But the question is, well, like some people are now sort of starting to whisper about, we think we think now maybe these drugs are actually affecting their actually prolonged cavity. And so microdosing, you know, these drugs in the, in the ranges that you've been discussing earlier might be a way of getting the benefits and you're also getting the side effect benefit of appetite regulation. So you're not going to be eating as much as well. Maybe it's just easier to not eat as much. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I appreciate what you framed that, which is you mentioned a word that for basic scientists is a dreaded word correlation. I don't look favorably on correlation because I'm a basic scientist. I want to do one thing and observe a direct effect from that one thing. So one reason I am extremely cautious and even a little shagrin with the entire realm of longevity is that it's, it's not to disparage it necessarily, but it's entirely based on correlation when it comes to humans. And it's not to be speculating and predict and model these sorts of things. I'm not saying there's no utility to that, but I also think it behooves us to be mindful of the limitation that comes with that. So with GLP one, it, in fact, it's worth noting another paper was just published this week finding that the risk of blindness doubles more than doubles and people on high dose GLP ones. A paper was just published. So you look at the degree of blindness that occurs in adults and those using the drug, it was more than twice the risk of developing blindness. Now that's correlational. We don't know what else they may be doing. And so I don't mean to suggest that I truly don't mean to suggest the drug is causing blindness. No more than someone could say the drug is promoting longevity. Although you actually can do a hard outcome with blindness. You can't really do the hard outcome with when does the person die very well. But there's so many variables that get worked in here that I cannot say it's because of the drug. But it is worth another reason to have some caution that what's the point. So maybe we just come back to the dose that maybe that's where we can find a common ground for all the enthusiasts and those who are enthusiastic but also a little skeptical on my end, where I am enthusiastic. But I also just want to bring in a note of caution. Maybe where we do have that common ground is the dose. So with regards to GLP1 at the risk of seeing everything through a singular lens, one of the most common variables that predict longevity. Within families there's one paper that actually mentions the word of a familiar longevity. Like the Amoris study in Sweden or the Honolulu aging study or the Shanghai aging study. Some of the most consistent variables is metabolic health. Optimal glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. In fact, that one study I think it was in the Mediterranean that looked at families where you have a high number of centenarians. They found that the most common theme was that they were all very insolent sensitive. And as much as people have over the years there's been an ideology of villainizing protein as a villain of aging because protein activates Amtor and when Amtor is too activated it promotes aging. I find that view unfortunate because for reasons you and I've mentioned like muscle and bone mass you have to have Amtor turned on. You have to or you can't have any anabolic no retention of lean mass let alone building it. But when you vilify protein because of Amtor you ought to vilify insulin because insulin activates Amtor much higher than even the most anabolic amino acids like loosened does. And it keeps it active. One dose of insulin can activate Amtor for up to 24 hours. Whereas loosened the most anabolic of the amino acids will only activate Amtor for about an hour or two. And so if Amtor matters for longevity and I know I've sort of contorted the whole thing about longevity here. All the more reason to come back to these kind of metabolic first principles. And so looking at insulin sensitivity and glucose control and I would just say the same thing with GLP1. While we may find that GLP1 has a direct effect of say activating autophagy. Maybe it could and that could be a mechanism whereby it promotes longevity. At the same time I don't have to go that far because I could just say does it improve insulin sensitivity? Okay good then it's probably going to correlate and predict and even cause improved longevity because of the evidence we have in that realm. So yeah what you're saying essentially is that the improved metabolic health is probably what's driving the longevity benefits and I would. Yeah I would agree that makes the most sense. Yeah. You know what it is it is important to obviously keep everything in context as well obviously there's people that are obese and metabolic and healthy that have really just change it's changed your lives right. Yeah but the question is. Do they have to keep taking it? Yeah and in fact 70% in the US 70% of Americans get off the drug at two years either because of cost or nausea or whatever 70% stop taking it. Like you said when they stop taking it if habits haven't changed maybe that's an important caveat. They gain it all back. Not to mention those who stay on the drug a paper was published within the past six months. I think it was within the past six months definitely was in the past year. The risk of suicidal behavior doubles and the risk of major depression triples in people who were on the drug for up to two years. On any dose of it or the height on the on the currently used. We go V dose which is the higher dose which is common. So not a micro dose. Right. Yeah. Well my view of this is I don't know the mechanism. I don't know what the central effect is of this drug but as much one way and this is my own kind of philosophical view. We rejoice in the fact that this drug has helped me it's reduced my cravings for junk food. Let's say and we would say that's a wonderful outcome. What if in the midst of reducing the cravings for junk food it reduces their cravings for everything they enjoyed. Were you here? This is anecdotal now. People lose interest in their old habits. A gal, the gal who used to like walking around the block with their girlfriends doesn't really want to go anymore. The guy who used to like getting on and playing video games. He doesn't want to do that anymore. They don't want to a couple. They don't go play pickleball with their friends anymore. Whatever. Maybe what we describe as improved eating control is actually just a reduced joy for life in general. But the regardless of the mechanism or the philosophy behind it. The evidence is extremely clear. The major depression risk people were three times more likely to have clinically diagnosed major depression. Again twice more likely for suicidal behavior. And twice as likely it was like a hundred and six percent increased risk of anxiety. And this is after the weight loss and after being in the drug. Yeah, that's right. It was two years on the drug. So this is part of why I'm cautious where I respect the power of this tool. It is extremely powerful because it's so powerful. I think we should be mindful of going too far with it. Which is why I am such an advocate. If it's going to be used at all, let's use it in a very specific context at a very specific dosing. Regiment with a cycling protocol where we want them to have in their mind. We don't want you on this drug indefinitely. This is not a lifetime solution. It is a crutch until you've learned how to walk on your own if you will and change your habits. That to me is so micro dose cycling with the conversation surrounding eating habits. I think that's a pretty balanced view. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, there's definitely more to discuss here. But we'd have to have another three hour conversation. So I kind of want to just circle back and end on this. You were talking about metabolic health being a predictor of longevity. And there's metabolic health and inflammation in other than that I've seen. Or it predicts which they're linked. They're very much linked. So if metabolic health is so important for longevity and the opposite is true, right? Where you're metabolically unhealthy and that is essentially accelerating aging. You mentioned something that kind of surprised me early on. And that is, you're kind of talking about mechanisms by which insulin is so damaging independent of glucose. And I was sitting here thinking of one of the main reasons why being metabolically unhealthy being insulin resistant. Is so unhealthy is because you're having high levels of glucose, which is glycating everything from your endothelial cells. Lening your blood vessels to your mitochondrial. Your skin. Your skin. Proteins, DNA, lipids, everything's getting stiffer and damage. What are the mechanisms that are involved here with accelerating aging? Just the glucose alone. Yeah. Well, what, yeah in general, is it the glucose alone or what else? Yeah, well, so insulin will promote aging by an persistent chronic emtoreactivation. So in insulin inhibits a topophagee. If a topophagee is a mechanism for aging that we want to leverage, I'm going to wear of any signal that will inhibit a topophagee stronger than insulin will. It abhorres metabolism. It only wants anabolic, which can be favorable when leveraged wisely. But when it comes to aging, if you are inhibiting that catabolic process of a topophagee, that's not going to be facilitative. So I rarely, I have the benefit having sort of staked my claim as insulin matters. I can defend that so well that I don't often need to step out of it. But when I want to, as much as some people will be here, say Ben, it's all seed oils. I'll say, now you got the seed oils covered. I'm going to stay where I'm at because I'm so familiar with this. But glucose is a partner in crime. I just sort of say, it's sort of who would be the partner. So it's sort of joker, the main villain is the insulin. And then the glucose would be like Harley Quinn, sort of joker's right hand gal. In this case, to invoke a comic book reference, which I am delighted to do because of a mispenschildhood. So insulin, I believe, matters most. But glucose on its own is pathogenic. But before I even defend glucose, I just want to say, because so much of modern medicine is obsessed with glucose. At a cost, as I articulated earlier, that obsession not only causes us to miss the metabolic problem as early as we could by focusing on insulin, but it also leads us to unhealthy interventions where you have a hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic type to diabetic. And you're only caring about lowering the glucose. And you do so by pushing the insulin higher. If the glucose were the main pathogenic signal, this should result in improved outcomes. And nothing gets better. When you give a type to diabetic an insulin therapy, they get fatter and sicker and die faster. All while glucose looks good. This is well documented. The risk of dying from heart disease, triples, the risk of getting dying from cancer doubles when you give them insulin. So I did with the type one diabetic. Ah, so that's different. Yeah, because in a type one diabetic, there's no insulin. And so you have to give them insulin therapy just to bring them to normal insulin. In the type two diabetic, they're already super, they're already high in insulin and you're putting even higher. Okay. So that's the difference. It's their diseases of total opposites. The only thing they have in common is that the glucose looks the same in that it goes high. Now, glucose is not benign as much as I have an insulin centric view. Unapologetically, glucose is a problem through multiple mechanisms. You mentioned the glycation. That is a huge one. Not only because of the change in the structure of that protein or that molecule itself, like skin. A lot of, like you can induce premature wrinkling by undergoing, by forcing glycation of the skin. You can result in a compromised glycochalics of the endothelium by all that glucose compromising with glycation. So glycation itself is a way to irreversibly alter a molecule and eliminate its utility in the body. It's utility. Indeed, at the same time, when you form an advanced glycation end product, it becomes substrate for a molecule that can bylagon for rage. The receptor for advanced glycation end product, some in rage gets activated. You have a lot of inflammation. So the glycation goes beyond the altered structure of the molecule itself, leading into some chronic subclinical inflammation. But there's another mechanism too, where when you elevate glucose substantially, you will have cells that are taking in that glucose. But it's overwhelming its ability to undergo glycolysis. And if most cells, if you, you know, there's so much glycolysis happening, it starts to inhibit entry into the glycolytic pathway. Then you divert the glucose into the sorbitol pathway. Now you have glucose turning into sorbitol, which the cell can't do anything with. And so sorbitol begins to accumulate in the cell. And that starts to increase the osmotic gradient into the cell. And now you have basically a water balloon that's getting overfold and you can have overfold and you have this, what's called hydraulic degeneration. Where you basically force water into the cell because of this glucose metabolite and then the cell can burst. And this is a large part of the problem with like macular degeneration and retinopathy's and the nephropathy's of the kidney. The main mechanism whereby the glucose is damaging or one of the main mechanisms is the conversion of the glucose into sorbitol. And when sorbitol accumulates in the cell, it can't go anywhere. And it starts pulling in water and the cell will burst. Wow. I was just starting to think about prunes because prunes are like high in sorbitol. So what's funny though, when I teach this concept to my students, you can tell I'm the monultimate professor here. I teach all these ideas. I actually have my students as a funny little assignment. Look up the customer reviews of sugar-free gummy bears. And it's so funny because these derivatives of glucose like sorbitol or manitol, they can't move across cell membranes. And so wherever they are in the body, they're doomed to stay there, including if it just comes into the intestines. So part of the humor for these 1819 year olds is finding these people giving customer reviews of how the gastrointestinal distress of these sweetened gummy bears that are like sorbitol that all stays in the guts in a pose a lot of water in the guts. Anyway, creating some socially awkward situations for people to put it politely. I also like how you're talking about this insulin centric sort of model of how that's really the most damaging. And it really is. When you think about insulin, you know, shutting down, I mean, I guess I should say that in another way. When you think about like insulin's role in activating AKT, which then is shutting down all the stress response pathways. Everything from a top of G to making stem cells to just just everything. Yes, being shut down by the action of this one hormone. Yeah, humble little peptide. Yeah, I mean, in most people, it's one thing for like a steroid hormone to have a kind of global effect. But peptide hormones don't often do that. You know, glucogone, for example, insulin's opposite. Muscle doesn't have glucogone receptors. Like, it's very much tissue specific, but insulin just operates at a different level. And I'm glad to see that you're maybe always have been, but you're converted. You'll see the value of insulin. I think I told you this on a phone call where again, one of my first, you know, experiments as a young biologist. I was a chemist before it was a biologist. So I had a previous. Yeah, yeah, I was like lots and lots of chemistry and peptide synthesis and stuff. And I was, it's funny as a chemistry major at UCSD. There's only a little bit of biology requirement. So I didn't really have vast experience in biology until I graduated from, you know, UCSD with my degree in chemistry biochemistry. Then decided I was kind of like, I don't know that this is really what I want. And I'm going to like go work for a little bit. And I went to the salt institute in La Jolla and started working in an aging lab. And again, one of my first experiments was what happens, you know, when you, when you shut down the insulin signaling pathway in these little nematode worms that share a lot of homologous genes with humans, including the insulin receptor and IGF1 receptor. And it was so clear to me that when you decrease the insulin signaling in these little worms, they doubled their life. Exactly. Double dip. Just seen days to 30 days boom like that. And they're health span. I mean, you look at these worms and you get to know them after about 15 days. You name them. They're like, hey, yeah, you do, you name them and you see like, you know, as they're reaching after a week, they start to like move slower and then like they're they get old like we do. They get old, they like move less. They like it is very clear. When you shut down insulin signaling, that doesn't happen. They're youthful. They're moving around like they're young worms when they're supposed to be dead already. Yes. And that was like, wow. Wow. You, in fact, I loved that you mentioned this. So you are of most people maybe, but you, I know your family with Cynthia Kenyans work. Yes. Where when I first heard about that kind of pathway, I, it was further justification of this insulin centric view. Now, not to the, expect not to either of us. I am certainly not suggesting there aren't other variables. The more oxidative stress is a variable. Cort stress is a variable, but there's one that I know and the reason I focus on insulin so much is because of these kinds of results, where you can just control one single variable. And a simple one at that because insulin is a single that we can control within 24 hours. Like a person listening to this who's thinking, okay, I have all these signs and symptoms of insulin resistance. What do I do? Control your carbs. That is the main signal. Now, I'm not, again, I don't want to get off topic. I'm not saying don't eat them, but just be smarter about what carbs you are eating and be a little. And then focus on these good sources of protein. In fact, which aren't going to have an insulin spike. That's why these other variables people want to invoke tomato country. I am extremely, family risk mitochondrial bio energetics. And yet why don't I invoke tomato country as a primary source of disease? Because you can't measure it in the average person. Like someone listening could say, well, it's my mitochondria. All right, well, good luck. Getting any marker of your amount of, I could do it in my lab if you're willing to give me a sample of your muscle tissue or something. But it's not a clinically kind of supported focus. So I don't mean to ever suggest other variables don't matter. We know insulin matters. You saw it in the work with the worms and aging. I've seen it in the context of neuron bio energetics and fat cell dynamics. And everything else we've been talking about. And it's just a variable. It's a lever. When you mentioned lever earlier that you can grab and immediately start to turn down. Okay, so let's talk about these key biomarkers for aging. Like from a metabolic perspective. What do you think would be, you know, the most indicative of biological aging and what biomarkers are good to look at? Yeah. Yeah. My first one would be fasting insulin. If I could change health care policy and practice in the United States, my one thing would be to have insulin be a standard measurement on every blood test. As much as the average individual is going to go in and get their annual check up, they're going to get their glucose. They're going to get their A1C. They're going to get all their lipids in youric acid. Those can be great. And there's one, there's some worth revisiting in a moment. But to me, the fact that we don't include insulin on that panel is an absolute travesty. It is in my mind the best overlooked marker. So fasting insulin. If a person can get their fasting insulin measured, do it. If that measurement is six micro units per mill or less, it's a great sign. If it's up to about the mid teens or high teens that's maybe an okay sign because insulin can be dynamic. But then if it's in the high teens to the 20s, it's a problem. That's a warning that you're metabolically off. And then let's come back to some of the common ones. The triglyceride HDL ratio is a great surrogate marker for not only metabolic and insulin resistance, but also cardiometabolic where we focus so much on LDL, for example. But the triglyceride HDL ratio is a way better predictor for cardiovascular risk than LDL is. So triglyceride HDL ratio, if it is, if so you take your triglycerides, which you're always going to get on a blood test and divide it by your HDL cholesterol, which you're always going to get on a blood test. If that number is less than 1.5, that's a great sign that you're doing well metabolically. And then I maybe youric acid is another one. Although I could go on, but I did mention youric acid. It's another one of those that really well done longevity study, the amorous study from Sweden. It found that youric acid was one of the very few predictors that when they looked retrospectively at these people measuring the same markers for decades, their glucose control was a predictive variable and their yuric acid was a predictive variable as to who lived the longest healthiest lives. So lower youric acid is going to be better. And just for a general metabolic health, would you add in some of the HBA1C and maybe APOB? So LDL, you mentioned LDL, I mean, they don't even directly measure LDL. POPOB would be obviously a more direct measure, but then looking also at particle size, which I get. I again think is important. It's the small bed. I do too. Yeah, so LDL, as you mentioned, and I actually described this in my book, why we get sick. I talk about the, like, why is it that we have such conflicting data across LDL? Some study say it predict, some study say it doesn't at all. Maybe it's because we're not accounting for the diameter differences. Even then, most people won't have had their diameter measured. The triglyceride to HDL ratio is an awesome circuit. There's a beautiful figure of a study. I can't remember the citation, but I can recall the figure perfectly. It actually looks at the difference in population of the big LDL, the buoyant, versus the small dense LDL. And wouldn't you know it right around that triglyceride to HDL ratio on the x-axis of 1.5 is that crossover. So as the triglyceride to HDL ratio was higher, it reflected a higher particle B or type pattern B rather LDL. The lower the triglyceride to HDL ratio was the more it reflected a pattern A, the large buoyant, apparently less atherogenic. So once again, we could come back to that pretty reliable circuit. Okay, great. I think if you could leave people with just one practical takeaway about insulin, about their metabolic health, how they can improve their life, their health span, along run, what would it be? Yeah, yeah. So I would say the simplest strategy would just be change breakfast tomorrow. Overnight, fasting is incredibly therapeutic. Insulin will come down during a fasted state, and that sort of re-sensitizes the body to insulin. So in the morning, you've finally been fasting overnight. Insulin has come down. The last thing you want to do is spike your insulin with a starchy sugary breakfast. And of course, tragically breakfast is almost just a dessert nowadays all over the world, where it is just like pure dessert. It's pure sugar and starch. I would say change breakfast tomorrow. Either fast through breakfast. Like a drink, I like to drink a cup of your Bomate. I drink some coffee or tea, and which is not going to break your fasted state. Even if you put a little butter, I don't consider that as breaking a fasted state, because I define fast as the endocrinology, the nutrients, rather than the calories. But that's a topic for another time. But or don't consume anything. But if you do want to eat, then let it be the low glycemic load vegetables and berries. And then more protein and fat. So whatever you can do to keep your insulin in check for as long as possible until, say, lunch. The longer the insulin is low, the more you're improving your insulin sensitivity. And the more you are allowing that metabolic flexibility, where the human hybrid, burning glucose or sugar burning or fat burning, it's insulin that dictates that fuel. And most people are stuck in sugar burning mode, because they never bring their insulin down long enough to shift over to fat burning. So you get to get into this fat burning state, enhancing metabolic flexibility, and your improving your insulin sensitivity. So my one piece of advice, change breakfast and change it tomorrow. So you want to extend that state where you're basically improving insulin sensitivity. Yes, that's right. What if you eat dinner early? Is it as awesome way to do it too? Yeah. Yep, that would be another way to do it. It's just, I don't focus on dinner so much because it's just so complicated. You know, you and I, we have families. And so sometimes, for me, for me personally as a busy dad and husband, even though I am home for breakfast, the fact that I'm not eating breakfast in the midst of the chaos, no, it doesn't disrupt the family dynamic at all. The kids are eating, we're talking, and I'm sipping on my cup of your mamate, while we're helping get lunch ready and everything else. It's not at all disruptive. And then lunch, I'm at work, I have whatever lunch I'm going to have, and that'll be my biggest meal of the day. But as much as I am absolutely a fan of being careful with dinner, because the evidence is so supportive of it, I also recognize that it's the trickiest meal, because of social dynamics, family dynamics. But in so far, as you can eat earlier, then just stop eating. The very best you can do, whether it's drinking some apple cider vinegar, or having something bitter in your mouth to reduce the sweet cravings, because bitter tasteance can reduce sweet cravings. I would say do it. Whatever, whatever leveraging you need in the evening to not crave, or snack on junk, do it. Great, yeah. I mean, I probably should have mentioned this earlier when we were talking about the late late night snacking, but the fact that melatonin shuts down, Yep, insulin production and the pancreatic beta cells is... Yeah, hyperglysemia disrupts melatonin too. So even back to the glucose mechanism, another reason to not go to bed hyperglysemic is it disrupts the melatonin rhythm at the same time. Oh, interesting. So it's like a two-way thing here. It's an ugly little battle. Well, this has been a very enlightening conversation, Ben, thank you so much for coming on this show, and talking to me about all things and getting uncomfortable at times. I really appreciate it. My pleasure. People, so you mentioned your book? Yep, yep, why we get sick. Why we get sick and then a follow-up companion, how not to get sick? That's to be coming soon. No, that's out. Oh, is it out already? Okay, so you're writing a third book. I'm writing a third book. We'll do that next time. And then BenBickman.com is your website where people can find all things you have a YouTube channel. Yeah, yes, so BenBickman.com is kind of my education, and then I also am a partner with insulin IQ. So we provide some coaching at insulin IQ.com and then just straight education at BenBickman.com. And you're on social media too, you're active on social media. Yeah, that's just BenBickman PhD. Yeah, I try to be active on social media, but you know how it is. It's like a black hole. The more I give it, the more it takes and so I tend to have a bit of a light touch. Same, same. Well, thank you so much, pleasure.

Exercise needs to be part of your personal hygiene. It can't be something that you just add on at the end of the day when you're tired and you don't really want to do it. It has to be part of your life like brushing your teeth, taking a shower, changing your underwear, having breakfast. These are things you do to stay healthy and exercise is one of those. So three weeks of bed rest was worse for the bodies of ability to do physical work than 30 years of aging. We found that the heart loses about 1% of its muscle mass a week in bed. I'm sitting here with Dr. Benjamin Levine, who is an exceptionally accomplished sports cardiologist. He is the founder and president of arguably one of the most prestigious institutes for understanding cardiovascular adaptations to intermittent challenges. The institute for exercise and environmental medicine, a UT Southwestern and Texas health Dallas. He is sought after by his expertise or sought after by a major sports leagues, NASA. And really, he's just an expert on understanding the cardiovascular adaptations to a wide variety of challenges whether we're talking about exercise, sports, microgravity, bed rest, and just it goes on and on. So I'm so excited to have you here, Dr. Levine. And there's many, many things that I really can't wait to talk about with you today, but maybe we can start with bed rest and the effects of bed rest on cardiovascular health. So you were part of one of a very, I would say, famous and informative studies, the Dallas bed rest study. Yeah, so actually I was only 10 years old when that study was first done. So my part arrived much later. Thank you for that very generous introduction. The cardiovascular community used to put people to bed after heart attacks or things like that, that was the standard of care. And in the mid 1960s, my mentors and Dallas, Jerry Mitchell, Gunnar Blunquist, and Banks Oldteam, some of the most famous cardiovascular physiologists ever, took five young men and put them to bed for three weeks and then trained them for two months. And frankly, almost everything we've learned about the cardiovascular adaptation to changes in physical activity began with that study, only five guys. And so like I said, I was only 10 years old, so I didn't participate in that study. But 30 years later, we found those same five guys and brought them back to Dallas to study them and to compare the effects of 30 years of aging with what happened to them during bed rest. And quite remarkably, not a single person, not one, was in worse shape after 30 years of aging than they were after three weeks of bed rest when they were in their 20s. So three weeks of bed rest was worse for the bodies of ability to do physical work than 30 years of aging. And that observation really started us on a whole series of studies trying to understand what's the difference between a sedentary behavior or lying in bed or being physically inactive and aging. So when you say that the 30 years of aging was no worse than three weeks of bed rest in terms of, so what sort of physiological parameters you're talking about? I mean, these were the five most studied humans in the history of the world in terms of all the studies that were done to them. But the simplest is the maximal oxygen uptake. That's the maximal amount of oxygen that can be taken in from the environment brought into the body by the lungs transported by the heart to the skeleton muscle and used to do physical work. The exercise physiologists marker of fitness. And so when we hear the term cardio-respiratory fitness, that's what we really mean. And there are ways to estimate it. There are ways to measure it directly. Many of your audience will have seen or even participated. You can't imagine how much of a male piece in their mouth and run on a treadmill until they can't go anymore. And that's how you measure the maximal oxygen uptake. Back in the 1960s, they did a lot of other things. You should see the pictures of these guys. Catheters in the arms, catheters in the bladder, catheters everywhere. They measured heart size. There wasn't echocardiography then. So they measured heart size by x-ray. Now that takes into account both the mass, the muscle mass of the heart and its volume, and the heart just shrunk in bed rest. So the heart shrinks the muscles atrophy. And that's probably the single most important thing that happens, at least, to the heart. The blood vessels adapt to meet the demands that's placed on them. So the blood vessels kind of get a little smaller or also everything kind of contracts. And that's probably if I had to pick one thing that would be the archetype of the bed rest is the shrinking and atrophy of the circulation, including the heart. And you said that they were trained after bed rest. So yes, was this reversible? That's really interesting, right? Because out of those five guys, three of them were just average jose. They weren't athletic. They weren't sick. They were just healthy college students. Two of them were competitive athletes. One was a semi-prohookable player. The other was a distance runner. They all decreased by about the same amount. They lost fitness. But what was really interesting is that the three guys who were relatively unfit quickly returned to baseline and even got fitter than they were before hand. For the fitter people, it took them the full two months to get back and even then they weren't quite back at where they were. So people whose bodies are adapted and trained, they lose the same amount. But it may take them longer to get back. And part of that may have to do with the load that's placed on them. So you have to kind of build back up slowly after you've been in bed for a while. And it just takes people for get how much load they placed on themselves to get them back trained. And you can't just pop into that all of a sudden. You've got to build up slowly when you've been in bed. And we've learned a lot about this in the COVID pandemic, where people went to bed and were placed in quarantine and lost a lot of fitness. I will tell you to me, one of the most compelling observations is well, and sticking with the COVID pandemic for a minute, because really is the same concept. So you've heard about long COVID, for example, in people who have symptoms that last more than three months, 12 weeks after their COVID infection. Well, you know, we were very worried when the COVID pandemic hit about what was going to happen to the athletes, because we were worried that they were going to get infected. We know that COVID could infect the heart. We were worried it was going to cause sudden death. And so we were very intensely monitoring all the collegiate athletes. And out of hundreds, if not thousands of collegiate athletes, who had COVID and went through brief quarantine, how many of you think had symptoms that lasted more than 12 weeks? 1600 in Brad Peddick study. What percentage do you think? Make a guess. 8%. Yeah. 0.06% two people, two out of 1600. Why is that? It's not that athletes are resistant to long COVID. No, it's because as soon as they got over their quarantine period, because they were in a competitive environment, they quickly returned to a trainer, monitored, and implemented returns a play program. So it's really important for almost any condition, as soon as that forces you to bed, that you have to get up and start moving and progress your training to return to a baseline state. And in some cases, you can do even better. So the hypothesis that after being COVID's case, exercise may help protect against having this long COVID-19. Absolutely. Now, let me caveat that by saying, some people have been really sick with COVID. Right. And COVID can affect the heart and the lungs and the mitochondria and the muscles and the brain. There are all sorts of things, legions of things that can be injured by the body with COVID. So we're not talking about those people. Right. Because that's a whole different story. We're talking about people who didn't get that sick and had to be placed in quarantine, which often resulted, if not in Frank Bedrest, that leads dramatic reductions in their physical activity. Well, the other thing that is that there was a lot of public health messages that were urging people not to exercise. I know. I know. Because it was somehow, I don't even know exactly where that was coming from, but it was potentially dangerous. Well, that's what we were worried about with the athletes, right? That because we would check there for the check them for triponin, which is a marker of cardiovascular injury. We do echo cardiograms. We check elector cardiograms. That was called the triad. I was part of the sports cardiology council that laid out those guidelines of the COVID triad testing. What we learned since is that that really wasn't that effective unless the individual of the athletes had cardiopulmonary symptoms. If they had palpitations or exertional shortness of breath or chest pain, those are the people who really needed more intensive evaluation to make sure that their bodies, their hearts and their lungs, I've not been injured by COVID. We then went on to do cardiac MRIs in a lot of people, a lot of athletes who had abnormalities in this triad. If they didn't have cardiopulmonary symptoms, then anything wrong with their heart. We were definitely afraid of this because, for example, in the military, the most common cause of certain cardiac death during basic training is my acorditis. That's an inflammatory infection of the heart muscle by a virus. That remains and persists as a diagnosis as a cause of certain cardiac arrest in young athletes. Once this COVID pandemic started, we realized that it affected the heart. We said, oh my God, the streets and the playing fields are going to be littered with the dead bodies of young athletes. Fortunately, that was not the case. But we were worried about it. And I think it generated tons of publications and guidelines and things like that. And we learned a lot from it. It gets us back to this bed rest model that you had started talking about. In the original Dallas bed rest and training studies, we put people to bed for three weeks. And a lot of our high-resolution physiology experiments have used that kind of two to three week model. Because at least in the early 90s, that was what we were doing in spaceflight. Right, bed rest is a model for spaceflight because you remove the head to foot gravitational gradient. So from head to feet, there is no gravity. So that's very expensive to do work in space. So we use bed rest as that model. But we put people to bed for a longer time than that. We put people to bed for two weeks, six weeks, even 12 weeks. So bed rest. And this is literally bed rest. Like not getting up. You can't even get up to use the toilet. That's where talking strict bed rest. And that takes a little practice for people by the way. So how much of, I mean, is this bed rest a almost accelerated aging model? And how much of cardiac aging, what is cardiac aging? How much is due to being sedentary? So that's a million dollar question, isn't it? We found that the heart loses about 1% of its muscle mass a week in bed. So it just, when we moderate people for 12 weeks, the heart just cuts small and smaller and smaller. Now obviously, it can't get continued atrophy forever. And we've sort of used spinal cord injury as a model for what that plateau is. How low can you go? And it's about 25%. So patients with spinal cord injuries have about a 25% reduction in the mass of the heart. We see the same things in young women with a disease called poth, or the postural or the static tech accordious syndrome. We can talk more about that later if you want. I know that's not your prime focus. If we take people and look either cross-sectionally, if we train them, we can see at least a 15% to 20% increase in the size of the heart and if we look cross-sectionally comparing elite runners to spinal cord injury, it's a 75% change in cardiac muscle mass. Is adaptable plastic responsive to changes in physical activity? So we ask just the question that you asked, Rhonda, how much of what we see with normal healthy aging is due to becoming sedentary. One of the first studies we then did to follow up on the Dallas bed rest in training, follow up study, was we went out and recruited a group of extremely healthy but sedentary older people. It's not so easy to do by the way. These are people who had no chronic medical problems. We're taking no medications except for perhaps cholesterol lowering medication. We had just didn't do any regular physical activity. We compared them to a group of elite masters athletes. These were individuals who trained virtually every day for much of their adult lives. We're competitive at the regional and national level. We used a technique that we developed in my laboratory to estimate and to quantify the flexibility or stretchiness of the heart muscle. The medical term is compliance but it's really how much will the heart stretch? We all think about aging. You think about aging of the skin, for example, that it becomes less stretchy. It's a stiffer. Then else you like to give people a nice brand new rubber band. Take it out of the box. Stretch is great. Get your junk drawer and come back 20 years later and take it out of the drawer and try to stretch it again. It doesn't really stretch. It loses that stretchiness. There are a number of specific biological reasons why that might be. We can talk about that. That becomes a really good marker for the cardiovascular system. The compliance or the ability of the heart to stretch and accommodate blood. Just the heart but the blood vessels also is a marker of the youthful cardiovascular structure. We stick a catheter in the heart. We put it into a vein in the arm. We then unload the heart. We reduce its volume by using a procedure called lower body negative pressure. Basically you put someone in a box sealed at the level of the hips. Hook it up to a vacuum cleaner and suck. We can literally pull all the blood out of the heart. We can make the heart smaller and measure the pressure and its volume using a cool choreography. Then we give them a volume load. We put an IVN and we blast salt water into the heart and we make it bigger as big as we can get it. Then we look at the slope, the stretchiness or the heart. What we found is that when we compared the seniors to the healthy young individuals, we noticed that not only did the heart shrink but it stiffened. Then when we looked at the elite athletes, their hearts were intesting wishable from healthy 30 year olds. A lifetime of endurance training at a level commensurate with the competitive athlete was sufficient to prevent that aspect of cardiovascular aging. That's really interesting from a physiological perspective but it's not a good public health measure. We can't really expect everybody to be a competitive master's athlete. The next question we asked was, okay, where or how much exercise does someone need to do over a lifetime to preserve their youthful cardiovascular structure? We turned to our colleagues at the Cooper Clinic and we partnered with them. Cooper Clinic is a center in Dallas developed by Ken Cooper where they have tracked physical activity and physical fitness for 40 years. Ken was very prescient and starting that database and we've learned a lot from that and looking at people and tracking their fitness and their physical activity over a very long time. We said, okay, we want you to help us find people who over 25 years and multiple visits to the Cooper Clinic have said on their questionnaire, yeah, I do no regular exercise. We call those people a center and we would allow so two less than two days a week of regular physical activity, secondary. Then we took people, okay, who did two to three days a week consistently over their lifetime, we call that casual exercise training. Then we looked at people who did four to five days a week, we call that committed training and then a whole another group of masters athletes who are called competitive training. And when we did the same techniques, we measured their heart compliance and their vascular compliance and low and behold two to three days of exercise over lifetime had no effect at all. It did not protect against that aging effect. Four to five days a week got us most of the way there, closed to the competitive athletes not exactly the same, not all the way there, but pretty close. So that gave us the sense that the optimal dose, if you will, a physical activity is four to five days a week over a lifetime, making it got to be part of your personal hygiene, we can talk about that a little bit later. Because then the next question we had to ask was, all right, we studied our master's athletes and our healthy sedentary people at age 70 and our youthful people were at age 30. So when in the aging process this is begin, right, so we partnered with a Dallas Heart Study, a large community based, very highly intensive epidemiologic study. And we looked at people who were in their 30s and their 40s and their 50s and their 60s and their 70s and we did the same studies on them. And what we found is that the heart starts to shrink in that late middle age period. You know, if you think about aging at so late middle age is kind of that 50 to 65 period early middle age is at 35 to 50 range. So the heart will get a little bit stiffer, but it's in that late middle range that starts to actrhym, you can see the most dramatic effects of aging. So we said, okay, well, it's this all reversible. I was sort of the question you asked me earlier. And so we took our healthy seniors and we trained them for a year. We used the same training program that we used in a group of young people trying to make them endurance athletes. I know you want to chat about that a little bit also, but we put them, we trained them hard and they got fitter for sure, but we didn't change the heart structure at all, not even a little bit. So once you got to be aged 70, it was virtually impossible to change the heart structure. That was very disappointing because we really thought we were going to be able to reverse it. And when we trained our young people, we sort of very marked and very impressive increases cardiac size and compliance and things like that. But we said, okay, what if we made a mistake? What if we started to lead? And what if we didn't train them long enough? And what if we didn't train them hard enough? So we then said, okay, let's take a group of those late middle ages and the sweet spot. Let's train them hard. And then we did them increasingly fit over a year and then sustain that at our perfect dose that four to five days a week. And we'll do that for two years. And low and behold, we were able to reverse the effects of sedentary aging by sustained training at the right dose, at the right time period in the aging process. So that paper, which is published in circulation, got a lot of press. It still is that among the top 10 papers for something called outnetrics, which is the interest within the media and the public and the professional community, the top 10 in the history of circulation, which is American horse association journal. Incredible. How much would you say the heart aging was reversed in these mid-old-central age-fifth year olds? Yeah, in 50 year olds. So the answer to that is from the standpoint of the uphleness, the compliance of the heart, most of it. So we didn't get quite back to being a healthy thirial, but we got pretty close. So there are a lot of other things that happen with aging that are not just related to the sedentary and so the circulation, of course. One of the things that happens is you get accumulation of advanced glycation and products. Those are, those are, yeah, so those are the things that not you run. But other people, stiffen your skin and make close wrinkles. We measure it in diabetics with hemoglobin A1C. It's a natural biologic chemical reaction called the malad reaction. Your audience is probably more familiar with it from basting a turkey. What do you think causes that crinkling and stiffening of a skin when you base a turkey? It's this reaction, this complexing of glucose, sugars with carbohydrate, with collagen. And it happens in the skin, it happens in the blood vessels, it happens in the heart. So we actually gave a drug which doesn't exist anymore. I have the last of it in my laboratory that breaks advanced glycation and products. And we gave it to another group of healthy sedentary seniors. And one group just got the advanced glycation and product inhibitor. One group got a placebo. Another group did a year of training, just training. And another group did the advanced glycation and product and training. So four groups. Just taking the advanced glycation and product inhibitor didn't do anything. It worked in animals. We saw a marked improvement in rats. Nobody really cares that much about that. But because we're not rats, but it didn't help the sedentary humans. And once again, we saw that a year of training didn't do anything. But when we added the training and the advanced glycation and product inhibitor, we had the equivalent of about a 15 year reduction in the apparent vascular age of the circulation. In 70 year olds. In 70 year olds. That's right. So the advanced glycation and products, it's interesting because it's very, as you mentioned, tied to blood glucose regulation. And of course, people with type 2 diabetes are the extreme case where type 1 is well, like they're not able to regulate their blood glucose and have probably the most risk of having higher levels of advanced glycation and products. And you know, vast for the damage. So you mentioned the heart aging and you talked about, but I don't know if you started with what when the start, but the stiffening you said it is stiffening until about middle age. And then it starts to shrink. Is that correct? That's right. So the question is, it's interesting that you were able to reverse this cardiac aging in these, you know, late middle age. Like, you know, so 50 to 65. That's our late middle age. So you're already stiffening the blood vessels at that point. Yeah, you're probably having some stiffening. That's exactly it. It's not fully, in sconst, you know, it's still reversible by then. So okay. So the question is, it'd be interesting to see if there were like a subset of people too that, let's say, had low, very low HP1A1C or something that did respond. You know, it's a good question, Rhonda. And you know, if you think about it, hemoglobin, which is what we're talking about when we measure hemoglobin A1C, that, you know, last for 120 days, right, that doesn't those red cells don't last forever. Right. So so that's why hemoglobin A1C is such a good marker of diabetic control. Um, blood glucose is measuring a glucose instantaneously. hemoglobin A1C is measuring the average over the last few months because that's how long hemoglobin lasts. But collagen lasts forever. So once you've glycated, it's done. And that's why, you know, measuring glycated hemoproducts in the skin or in the basculature is a marker of something over an even longer time scale. You know, we, we hoped to be able to break all those, to be honest with you, I'm not sure that we did. The animal data is very compelling. We did not actually take cardiac biopsies to prove that we had broken the advanced glycation in products, right? We just used the physiological consequence. And so one could argue that we didn't even do what we thought we did. But I think I was impressed enough by the combination of exercise training and breaking the, um, AGEs. I'll use the acronym for simplicity sake. Um, that I do think it plays some role. It's obviously not the entire issue, right? Because just breaking them by themselves didn't do anything. But the combination of the stretching of the blood vessels and the heart during exercise is perhaps enhanced, or was perhaps enhanced by breaking the advanced glycation in products. So what would you say to someone who's in their 70s that's been sedentary and wants to train four to five days a week? And so you're talking about this two-year study. I mean, I've read the methods section two. And it's quite impressive. I mean, this people are, you know, they're doing a lot of physical activity and including vigorous intensity exercise, you know, whether they're doing, you know, very intense exercise at least once, maybe twice a week. So what would you say to someone who's in their 70s? I mean, how can they improve their cardiovascular health? So I'm not saying that we should throw our hands up and saying, oh, it's too late. Because that's clearly not true, right? I will say, if you hope to overcome 70 years of bad behavior of bad diet and sedentaryness and smoking, you can't make that up with a couple years of exercise training when you turn 70. That being said, there are a lot of other benefits that exercise training that are not related to cardiac structure, right? But you improve endothelial function. What I mean by that is that the arteries have a lining inside them that is, it's not like a lead pipe. It's actually alive. It's biological. And it allows for that smooth flow of blood to and then as you need more blood, like during exercise, those blood vessels start to expand. So the endothelial relaxes and opens up the blood vessels and it's damaged the endothelium with cholesterol and hypertension. It's smoking over years that causes atherosclerotic disease. So it's a very important biologic phenomenon that is clearly improved by exercise training at any point in life. So I think that's really helpful. I think we know that exercise training alters the autonomic control of the circulation, the autonomic nervous system is that part of the brain and the nervous system that regulates those things that we don't have to think about. Like you're not sitting there saying, what's my heart rate? Is it 60? How do I make it 62? That just happens in the background, right? And the autonomic nervous system has a break, which is the parasympathetic nervous system. We've heard that term vagal response is an accelerator. That's the sympathetic nervous system. And you're constantly balancing break and accelerator throughout your life. During exercise, you take your foot off the break, you withdraw the vagus nerve, and you increase the sympathetic nerves. That's what speeds the heart rate during exercise, and that comes from signals and skeletal muscle. That's how your brain knows what to do during exercise. So we know that if you, this is going to be a little bit, I'm going to take a step back for one second. We know that if you have an acute heart attack, and if I, in a dog, if I tie off a coronary artery with a little snare, while they're running on the treadmill, some dogs will develop ventricular fibrillation and have a cardiac arrest. And they'll do it every single time. And if we resuscitate them, and then we put them on the treadmill and stimulate the vagus nerve to the heart and tie off the coronary, none of them have ventricular fibrillation. They don't die. And if you train them before you tarve the coronary artery, without even stimulating the vagus nerve, you have the same effect. So the ability to increase in vagus tone or neural activity in that parasympathetic nerve may be very protective against sudden cardiac death. And those things will happen even if you start training in your 70s. So, and lastly, of course, is people get fitter. We know I can make them fitter, right? I told you that. And that's good. That's important because, unfortunately, with aging, you get less fit. Even if you're a master's athlete, you get less fit. I would be a fool if I sat here in front of you and told you that exercise training can completely prevent the aging process. I wish that it could, but it doesn't. But one of the most important things is that it presurs your aerobic power, this V02 Max. And so think about a cliff, right? And your heading towards that cliff with aging. And that cliff is where the maximal effort that you have in your body that you can do is what you need to do activities a daily living. That's in that three to four metabolic equivalence, metas, the amount of oxygen you need to just sit here quietly. Three and a half MLs of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body mass. And once you get to that, you're really kind of in trouble, right? Because then everything you do in life is a maximal effort. Well, if that point is here and your mass is athlete and you're up here when you're young, right? And you train all your life, you stay above that really well. If now you're unfit and you don't exercise your life and you're heading towards that cliff, what you want to do is change that trajectory and either push it up or flatten the curve a bit, so that you prolong that period before you become disabled. And that comes down to both endurance training and strength training because you need both of those to be able to maintain functional capacity. I, this is great. I do want to get in a little bit more into both of those the cardiovascular fitness and what it means for longevity, but just before a couple more questions on your intervention study exercise dose intensity. So what about people that, let's say they're they're exercising, they're doing the committed exercise, they're right they're 45 days a week. But they think well, I don't you know, I'm exercising frequently, I don't need to get my heart rate up to a high intensity, you know, vigorous, 80 85% max heart rate. What what do you think about that is important because in your study, at least in the to your intervention people were definitely doing vigorous intensity exercise and division. So that's I think one of the more challenging questions to sort out right because it if you, I know you were listening carefully you're and reading carefully. I'm very quite impressed by how prepared you been to come to this interview, but we only stratify people by frequency. That's you know, two to three four to five or six to seven. We didn't stratify them based on how many interval sessions they did or how long was their long run. You know, those are factors the the other components of dose of includes not just frequency, but intensity and duration. And you can imagine trying to quantify that over 25 years is kind of tough people can tell you, yeah, I trained two days and Thursday I went out for a walk, you know, I did my my zoomed class, but if you ask them well how hard did you work and what was your heart rate and how that's a little harder to manage. So I I think that they're clearly our advantages to higher intensity exercise. They're also greater risks. So we know that that exercise by itself does potentially increase risk. For anybody at any time and that's greater risk with higher intensity. Now that risk is relatively small. And it depends on how fit you were to begin with. What do I mean by that? Well, you know, the classic scenario is you know, Detroit, Michigan. You know, the storm, you know, the dad goes out. It hasn't done any exercise and needs to shovel the walk and he has this cardiac arrest, Barry Franklin, publish those data many years ago. And what we know from a number of studies is that that risk of exercise is dramatically higher if you're unfit. It may go up a hundredfold about background, a burst of extras if you don't do anything. If you're very fit, it may only go up 10%, or 20% still goes up, but it doesn't go up by that much. So maintaining fitness reduces the consequences of intense activity. But I think that we all have bursts of exercise during our lives, whether that be running up a stairs, trying to catch a buster of a train, you know, running after a kid, whatever. And I think that we also know that high intensity training relatively has relative advantages over lower intensity training for improving maximum of the power. So I'm going to ask me what is high intensity training mean, that's a whole another discussion. And I know you met with my friend Marty Gavala and had a discussion with him many, a few months ago. So when I think about aerobic power, I like to think about young hoffs, 4 by 4, which is the old Norwegian ski team workout. And it's at 95% of max, followed by three minutes of recovery, repeated four times. Even if you don't have a heart rate monitor on, it's basically as hard as you can go for four minutes. And at the end of that four minutes, you need to be ready to stop. And then at the end of the three minutes of recovery, you need to be ready to go again. And that's how you judge that intensity completely independent of heart rate. If I compare a 30 minute moderate intensity session versus a 30 minute 4 by 4, clearly the 4 by 4 will have a greater benefit on improving aerobic power, session per session. That being said, over time, I think there are great benefits to doing more moderate intensity exercise. Also, it's lower risk, it's easier to do. It's emotionally easier for many people. Others love doing short duration burst activity. They say, oh my god, I can get me and I can get the same benefit by only exercising for four minutes, as opposed to 40 minutes, I'll do it. So it's very individual. And at the end of the day, personally when you look at a competitive athlete, no athlete does just one thing. That's why a lot of the studies in this field are a little bit artificial, because as I say, I'm going to do only moderate intensity training. There's a whole new burst of enthusiasm for zone two training. I mean, gosh, I've had about 10 interviews about what is zone two training. For your audience, typically, that means exercising hard enough that you get a little sweat on your brow. You can still talk, but you're a little shorter breath. And I like to tell people you can talk, but you can't sing. That's a good indicator of that higher level of zone two training. So the ideal strategy, then, is to incorporate whole kinds of training. That's what the human body is best at adapting to. It doesn't really adapt very well to doing the same thing over and over and over again. You will not get fitter if you do that. And in fact, in our two-year training study, there's very, if you be low the lines a little bit, we markedly upscale people. These were completely centering. We worked them very hard for a year, including multiple high intensity sessions, prolonged sessions. But then we said, right, I want you to sustain that for years. So we dropped into only one interval session a week and one long session a week. And we didn't increase the dose, right? We didn't increase the frequency or duration or intensity over that last year. And you know what? You didn't get any fitter. And their hearts didn't get any bigger. The only thing that got bigger was the atria. And we can chat about that when we get to talking about toxicity of exercise training. So the human to come back to our point, the human body doesn't adapt very well to doing the same thing over and over again. And so my prescription for life, if you will, is one that mixes things up. So I suggest to people that you spend, do at least one day of a long session that lasts at least an hour. And it should be fun. I don't care what it is. It could be, you know, going square dancing. It could be a long walk with your spouse or a long bike ride. It could be some other class that you take, but it needs to last over an hour and at least to be fun. Second thing you need to do is do one high intensity session a week. I like the 4x4. I think it's very effective. This great data about it from the Norwegians. But I don't care if you did 2x6. Or if you're a Marty Gabbal fan, if you did 30 seconds times 8, it doesn't really matter. Just do one thing at high intensity. And then do two or three sessions of that moderate intensity at least 30 minutes, getting the talk test. And then supplement that with one or two days of strength training. And what I mean by strength training, it doesn't mean you have to go to the gym and pump iron. Could be Pilates. It could be strength yoga. Anything that requires training of strength and skill in a muscle. And if you do that over your whole life, I think that's the best strategy for preserving cardiovascular. Now if you tell me you want to run an iron man, you got to train different than that. Okay? And that's a really important thing for you to understand. Training for health versus training for performance. Right? Every coach knows how to train for performance. And so if that's your objective, if your goal is to have a competitive performance objective, then you have to train differently. If you tell me your goal is I just want to preserve my health and stay fit and have a good life, then you don't need to train 30 hours a week. But if you want to compete in Kona, you need to train 30 hours a week. Or you're not going to be successful. So I think you've got to just clearly identify what your goal of your fitness is, and your goal of your overall health. And that's what will guide your training program over your life. Let me just add one more thing. I can see the questions circling around in your head. I can't remember. I'll pop up. We'll come back to a later. So definitely a lot of questions. And I'm trying to figure out where to go first. So I think the cardiovascular respiratory fitness and the B2 Max and lots of questions with that starting with, you're talking about what your goal is, right? So do you want to be a master's athlete? Do you want to train for health and longevity? I loved the way you explained the cardiovascular fitness and function, how it's keeps going down with age and how you kind of want to stay above this level. And if you start way up here, you know, it's easier to kind of go down. It's going to match that same analogy like contributing to your retirement fund. Dr. Brad shown, we'll talk about this in the podcast with muscle mass. And I just, it applies to so many different areas and I think cardiovascular fitness is another one. Right? If you're starting way up here, then the decrease with age, you know, it's not going to be as big of a deal functionally. So why do you think cardiovascular respiratory fitness does correlate with longevity? So the higher the B2 Max, which is a marker of cardiovascular fitness, the lower the mortality risk. So I'm going to remember your question. I remember what I wanted to say, so let me go back to that. So the one thing I want to say is that exercise needs to be part of your personal hygiene. It can't be something that you just add on at the end of the day when you're tired and you know, you don't really want to do it. It has to be part of your life. Like brushing your teeth, taking a shower, changing your underwear, having breakfast. Breakfast. These are things you do to stay healthy. And exercise is one of those. And the mindset of people who sustain exercise over a lifetime and who are able to do this over and over again and who are able to stay fit and healthy is that it's part of their lives. It's not something they just add on. Right. So you brush your teeth twice a day because you don't want cavities. Well, you exercise because you don't want cardiovascular disease. I mean, there's other reasons you exercise to. I can't say that. But yeah, I love that part of your hygiene where it's not just, oh, it's this thing. I have time for it. I have to go. No, it's not. Right. No, it's it. No, it's you do it. It's like just like your brush your teeth. So the VO2 max and longevity correlation. Why do you think VO2 max correlates with longevity? So, so first of all, I think it's important to realize that that correlation is relatively weak. I mean, obviously, when we're talking about the effect of aerobic power on longevity, there's a number of reasons why I think that relationship exists. First of all, if you're not sick, it's easier to exercise or it's an pleasure of aerobic power. So there is a bias associated with looking at those factors. Regardless of how well you try to control for them statistically, that bias exists. There's nothing you can do about that. It certainly helps to be well enough to continue to train and be fit. So if you get cardiovascular disease or cancer or neurologic disease, it's harder to sustain your fitness. And so just be a little bit careful about that. The O2 max is a function of two things. There's a very famous equation called the thick equation, which relates VO2. That's the volume or the venulatory oxygen uptake. I started this podcast by talking about what that means. But it's a function of two things. The cardiac output, that's how much blood the heart can pump. And the VO2 difference, the arterial, Venus, oxygen difference, which is how much oxygen is extracted in the skeletal muscle. The cardiac output is also a function of two things. Heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume is the amount of blood that the heart can pump a per beat. So the heart relaxes. And when it's done relaxing, that's the end diastolic volume. The time when the heart is completely relaxed, that it's at its biggest. And then it contracts and pushes that blood out. That's the end systolic volume. And the difference between those two is the stroke volume. And so the stroke volume times the heart rate is the cardiac output. Now let's look at an elite athlete versus a centery person. And we laugh at can extract more oxygen than a centery person. But it's not so much more. It's not a lot more than a centery person. And the heart rate, the max heart rate of an elite athlete, if anything, is lower than that of a centery person. So the biggest difference between being centery and have high levels of aerobic power is having a big stroke volume. So having a heart that is nice and stretchable and compliant, that can relax to a large amount that your muscles pump blood back to it and contract strongly and vigorously and pump that blood out into the blood vessels. That is the biggest adaptation that allows you to be an elite athlete. But that goes back to your, your, you know, how exercise improves cardiac structure, and function because the heart's not atrophying and getting bigger. And it's not stiffening. It's more accessible. So exactly. So I think that there are clear advantages into heart structure. Heart structure and vascular function by sending all this blood out and pumping large amounts of blood. The in a healthy vascular system, the aerota and the large blood vessels accommodate that blood. It's called the wind castle effect. It's the blood when the heart pumps blood into the aerota. It expands. That's why it needs to be nice and compliant. And then in between heart beats, it releases that blood into the rest of the circulation. So that sustained dilation is what requires a flexible arterial system, as well as a flexible heart. And the heart and the blood vessels are coupled together very tightly. That's called ventricular arterial coupling in the physiology world. But they need to be coupled. And I think having a nice, regular, flexible aorta becomes really essential. Of course, if you've got aortic diseases, morphance syndrome, for example, genetic diseases at the blood vessels, then exercise can be quite dangerous for some of those people. And then aorta can tear, that's called an aortic dissection. So we know that exercise clearly does drive more blood out into the aorta. So I think that the advantages and the reasons why hyerobic power improves mortality is a preserves vascular structure, improves endothelial function, optimizes autonomic tone, preserves the mitochondrial function. The mitochondria of those little energy producing organelles, subcellular things within your skeletal muscle, within your cardiac muscle, and your brain, which utilize all that oxygen. So it preserves the energy producing architecture of many of your organs. And all those things are advantageous and leading to mortality. Now, or preserving the mortality. Now, you have to ask us of what kills people. Well, one thing that kills people is cardiovascular disease. And again, I wish I could tell you that exercise completely protects you from cardiovascular disease. It does not. Athletes get hypertension, they have high cholesterol. There are genetic effects that influence development of cardiovascular disease. So exercise will not provide immortality, right? But it will help you manage those diseases of human life. There is some evidence that exercise can be protective against certain kinds of cancers. That evidence has been challenged recently, but I do think the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that it reduces the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer. And how it does that, I can't, I'm not 100% sure, but I think increasing blood flow on a regular basis is beneficial. And it, of course, by utilizing energy, it helps to prevent diabetes. And if you have diabetes, it helps to manage diabetes. It increases blood flow to the brain and has some modest effect about preventing dementia. It will not prevent you from getting Alzheimer's disease. If you're genetically inclined, I wish we completely understood why people get it. We don't, but it certainly will reduce that risk. So I think it is a combination of the physiologic adaptations to exercise at every step of that oxygen cascade. The heart muscle, the blood vessels, the mitochondria, the sustained high rates of energy expenditure of multiple organs. That helped to protect and improve mortality with higher levels of fitness. I'm sure seeing this, this drama study in 2018 that was published and looking at cardiovascular briefness and mortality. And the interesting thing to me about that study wasn't so much that, okay, well if you're low cardiovascular fitness, you have a fivefold increase mortality rate over people that are more elite. So they're in the top two point three percent of cardiovascular stiffness. But what was so interesting to me and again, you mentioned reverse causation. So that's obviously people that are more fit are able to exercise more with that in mind. The fact that when all these other diseases or negative habits were looked at, for example, smoking, it was, at least by the data and hazard ratio, it was clearly worse to be in the low fitness groups of the bottom 25 percent of the population that was, you don't look at. It was you they had a higher risk of mortality being in that low fitness group than smoking. So it'd be a little bit careful about that for your audience, what what's been being what often is reported in literature is relative risk. Not absolute risk. So there is a protection of one compared to the other. But for example, if being low fit were to be a low absolute risk, then a little bit of protection doesn't, you know, if let's say you're risk of dying in the next 10 years is 1 percent, okay. And I reduced that risk by 50 percent. 1.5 hazard ratio. I've only reduced your risk by 0.5 percent. So the absolute benefit is relatively small. So you sent me that paper and I, of course, I was aware of it. It's by my good friend, Dermit Thillin, when he was at the Cleveland Clinic and his team there. So I know the data well. We knew about that when we put together the scientific statement for the American Heart Association, suggesting the cardiovascular fitness be included as a vital sign. You know, the same thing as your blood pressure and your body weight when you go to see your doctor, you're supposed to get and have them ask you what's your fitness level. You're supposed to do that within the electronic medical record now. Simple, Liz Joy and Bob Salus when they were both presidents of the American College of Sports Medicine have pushed the exercise vital sign, which is very simple. How many days a week do you exercise enough to get a little bit of sweat on your brow and make it a little shorter breath and how long do you do it. You're supposed to be able to buy it frequency times duration, get your physical activity vital sign. So your doctor should be asking you that or if he isn't, or she isn't, you should tell them. But, so when you come back down to that Cleveland Clinic study, remember there are two things. First of all, these were people who were referred for exercise testing. These were not healthy people. Okay. These are people all who had some complaint. Some of them had valvula disease, some of them had heart disease. None of them were a fitness test on a competitive athlete. And if you look at the elite fitness level, they are nowhere near elite. The peak view to is in the young people was 50 ml per kg per minute. I mean, that's 50% less than a competitive athlete at that level. So calling them elite was a little bit disingenuous in my mind. They were the top percentage of people referred for exercise testing. But there are nowhere near elite. These are not people doing 10, 12, 15 hours of exercise weight. This is 50 ml per minute per kilogram. That's an average fit. You know, good, good fit, but good fit young person. So, you know, by looking at percentages of predicted of healthy people, you can get a little bit of a different perspective. I don't think you should take the message home that, you know, there's no upper limit and you can just keep on training and you'll keep getting better. I do think the message that fitness is as important as other cardiovascular risk factors is critical. And I think that's a very important take home message. I don't put too much stock in comparing relative risk scores. I don't think that's helpful without knowing the absolute risk data. But my friend Steve Blair used to say, I'd rather be fit and fat than lean and sedentary. Yes, so it sounds like the measuring your cardiovascular fitness is at the very least a good biomarker. Absolutely. You know, you're health and, you know, like you said relative risk. Well, so you're talking about a 30 year old. Yeah, their risk of death is quite low, but when you start to get to 70, you got a 75 year old male, their VO2 max, that relative, that absolute risk matters more, right? Because they do have a higher risk of dying from heart and heart problems. What a strange, a major way to disease this is. I'm not going to get rid of that, they're not going to extend the human lifespan forever. But, but you're right, I think that and we made a strong case for that in our scientific statement. I do think that the risk is as important as smoking and as hypertension and they have different treatments, right? So I think the other thing to be careful about is there is some data from the Cooper clinic mostly, but also from others Jonathan Myers at the VA in California. I'll show them that if you measure fitness at one particular point in time, people who gain fitness gain advantage, equivalent to people who have sustained fitness, and people who lose fitness, lose that advantage. There are much fewer studies of changes in fitness over time as they are about a single point measure. So, you have to, the data are not as robust as what happens if you stop smoking or what happens if you treat high blood pressure or what happens if you treat high cholesterol. Those data are hundreds of thousands of people, really high quality clinical trials, treating these diseases. So, we know what the outcome is. I know less about what happens if I take a 50-year-old and I train them and I increase their view to max by 10 or 20%. What does that do to their subsequent mortality? I don't know that as well. There are data there, I think they're encouraging, but they're not as certain, for example. So I know for sure that I need to lower your blood pressure if it's too high. And I think our targets are getting progressively lower. Same thing with cholesterol. I know for sure that treating it will lower your risk of having a heart attack, for example, or having cardiovascular outcomes. So, I do think that measuring your fitness gives you a leverage to say, okay, let's improve that fitness. And there are many reasons to do it beyond mortality. I view life span as only one objective of healthcare. Health span is at least if not more important. Certainly, that's true for me. I also think that you mentioned the changes in B02 max. If you're not improving at a certain point, you mentioned earlier about people that are doing the same thing. For example, they're not really improving their cardiovascular fitness. I'm wondering if that also goes back to this non-response. What is this non-response where people will meet the requirements for physical activity guidelines are doing 2.5 hours of exercise a week. And yet they can't improve their cardiovascular fitness. So I think there are a couple of things to think about there. Number one is if those people were doing nothing, they would be a lot less fit. Okay, that's for sure. And I can make almost anybody fitter. And there's a little bit of disingenuousness about the non-responders also. It's non-responders to the dose that they've been given. The same thing like saying, you tell me, look, when I take one Tylenol, it doesn't get rid of my headache. But if I take two, it gets rid of my headache. My husband, he does fine with just one Tylenol. Right, so I think there is a dose response of exercise, just like the race for any other medication. That's one of the rationales behind Bob Salus's exercise is medicine. And so Carson Mundi and his group in Copenhagen has shown very clearly that if you take someone who's a non-responder, non-responder, and quotes, and increase their training dose, they all improve. So I don't think I'm sure there must be some people who are non-responsive. But in our study, in Aaron Hauden's study, Aaron Now is a player and a court of ask that are expert at the Baker Heart Institute in Melbourne, Australia. And her study about the two year training in the 50 year olds, we had zero non-responders, zero. But you were also adding in, I think, some of those non-responses, like you said, the dose changes or the intensity of the attack and some high intensity, all of a sudden that responding. Again, going back to your point where you know, mixing it up and you know, you do want to continue to challenge yourself, right? I mean, you don't want to just do the same thing every single day. Right, and I think that there's a number of benefits that we're talking now as a, you know, how do you adjust your high gene, right? I'm not necessarily saying that you want to do things to steadily improve your fitness progressively over a lifetime. I think that's almost impossible to do. You want to achieve a level of fitness and sustain that over life. That's a difference. And we coming back then to the performance versus the health benefits of exercise. So I think doing the same thing over and over again is for some people they love it. They find that very satisfying and doing that and preserving their fitness. I think is important. For some people, it gets boring and they want to mix it up. You know, and they want to change what they're doing and that gives them more joy. And it also helps them stay compliant with this activity over a lifespan. So I think, though, and my own bias is that the different kinds of exercise have different roles in improving and preserving fitness over a lifetime. I mean, if you want to run your 5K faster, you got a train harder, you know what I mean? But if you go this look, I'm happy with my, you know, 3 minute 5K and I don't care about running that faster. I just want to stay well. Then then increasing the dose has less benefit for you. So you're mentioning this stroke, following being really important for cardiovascular fitness. I mean, is that the limiting factor? Like, is that how what is the limiting factor for improving your BOT marks? So I think that for a lead competitive athlete, the stroke volume and the cardiac output or the limiting factor. And I know this because, I mean, if I blooddope them and I give them more blood, their muscles can accept that just fine and they get faster. Right? So it's just the ability to get that blood to the muscle that's important. The muscle has a lot of reserve. And, you know, obviously there comes a point where you can't make the heart any bigger. But I do think that that is the primary difference between the elite of the elite and the sub-elead. Now that's different. If you told me I've got a 50-year-old guy who wants to start training. Oh, our patient, you know, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic disease of the heart muscle, James McNamara, at our institution, has been studying how you make those people fit or they've been told their whole lives don't train. They were because, you know, earlier data suggested that patients with that kind of genetic disease were at risk for dying during exercise. Turns out that now the evidence in the last couple years has become much more obvious that you can those types of individuals can safely train. And in fact, regular physical activity and fitness is critical to their survival. So, animal data suggesting that if they train when they're young, it may even prevent the full expression of the disease, where working on that right now. But those kind of individuals, particularly some who may be limited by cardiac limitations, will improve their ability of the muscle to extract oxygen. And I think when you get to the elite level, everything ends up being optimized. Maximum lung function, maximum cardiac function, maximum muscle function, and they are all linked together, you know, in the entire oxygen cascade. For people who are sub-aliet, who have not raised each particular part of that physiological process to their limits, can improve your two max by increasing oxygen extraction. They can increase the enzymes producing oxygen in their muscle. They can increase the number and size of mitochondria. They will increase their AVO2 difference. They can't increase it forever. And so you increase that. And particularly if you've got a cardiac limitation, if you're sedentary and don't have one, you may increase both in parallel. But it's the cardiac limitation that gets differentiates the highest levels of aerobic power fitness from the less lower. And let me give you an example, you know, we tried. We took a group of young people because I wondered how much of this extraordinary aerobic power is genetic and how much is, you know, trainable. So we took a group of sedentary young people in their 30s. And I train them to be marathon runners. I train them to be successfully complete either a marathon or a hundred mile bike ride. And we made them a lot thinner. Some of the largest gains in heart size and fitness than anyone's ever seen. Including long duration, two hour up to two hour runs on on the weekend, multiple workouts, high intensity sessions over the week. I threw everything I could have them. And frankly, I couldn't make their hearts as big as our competitive athletes. You know, I just couldn't get the life long competitive athletes like this. No, no, these are young people. These are 30. So, well, life long up until then, right? So high level competitive athletes. I just couldn't get the heart size the same. They got a lot bigger, but not the same. I wondered why that is. One thing to remember is that the heart is constrained by a stiff, fibrous sack called the pericardium. And the pericardium is really important. It allows the right and the left ventricles to function together. Remember the right ventricle pumps, blood to the lungs, the left ventricle pumps to the body. And they work in concert. So, the pericardium preserves that ventricular interaction in a positive way. And it may be that training for one year or maybe even two years isn't enough to stretch that pericardium. The myocardium, the skeletal muscle is very adaptive. The pericardium less so. It's also possible that you have to train when you're growing to get the biggest bang for your buck. That, you know, obviously the pericardium constrains the heart of a baby, as much as it does, the heart of a elite athlete. And as the heart grows and adds myoc fibers, the muscle fibers within the heart, the pericardium adapts and remodels to accommodate that. It may be that those things have to rise together in order to get the truly biggest hearts of the most elite athletes. I don't know that there are some studies on going, you know, in Europe and in the US to try to address that. You know, class in and under legaries have the pro at heart study that are looking at young athletes. I don't know that anyone's looking at kids that are starting when they're 12 though. I'd just in Lali and Innsbruck is trying to do that. A group in Norway is trying to do that. So I think that we are as a community trying to get that it's hard to study kids, you know. But but I guess I suspect that you've got to train when you're growing to get the max of all ability. You know, in Antonio Policia from the Tian Olympic Committee, really, the one could argue the father of the whole concept, the sports cardiology. In the world, has studied athletes who have participated in multiple Olympics up to four even five Olympics. That's a lot of Olympics, you know. What he says shows is that if he looks at their heart size over 12 or 16 years of sustained high intensity Olympic competition, it doesn't get a lot bigger. You know, and so these are people who have acquired that fitness to get to the Olympic level. And then to sustain that over time, it's not that they're progressively getting bigger. They're sustaining and preserving their fitness and their heart size. There may well be a limit to what that how big that can be. Of course, I mean, you're limited by the size of your body, right. Heart can't just go up continue to get big forever. So obviously there's an upper limit to that at some point. Can you sort of differentiate between, so I've heard you talk about, I mean, this is at it. You're talking about the adaptations to endurance. Yes, I have a aerobic exercise. I mean, Olympic athletes that are more strength training, right? So in terms of this adaptation of the heart getting bigger. What adaptation, how are the adaptations different? Well, so I'm going to give you the traditional thought. And then I'm going to tell you that that's not probably 100% right. So the traditional thought, what has been called the Morgan Roth hypothesis, is that strength training, which does not increase Venus return. That is, the blood returning to the heart. It doesn't increase stroke volume very much because it imparts a huge after load, a rise in pressure during a static strength contraction. Any idea how much the blood pressure goes up during exercise? Do you know this? Which kind of exercise strength exercise? If I, if I were to have you, if you have hypertension, I mean 180 or so. If you're going to do, if I take a competitive athlete and I do a 90% one repetition max, squad or what do you think the system blood pressure gets to. A score like a multi joint squat like 200. Higher. Keep going. 250. Keep going. 400. 400 millimeters, mercury. John Sutton in his colleagues put arterial lines and showed that many years ago. So you generate that kind of pressure by intense muscle contraction, which contracts the blood vessels. So now you're driving stroke volume into a very small, much smaller space than you did before. There's massive sympathetic activation from something called the exercise presser reflex, which is a, a function of both the relative intensity and the effect. Is a function of both the relative intensity and the total maximum muscle contraction. And, and so that raises arterial pressure very high during the contraction, right? And so to adapt to that in order to reduce the load on the heart, the heart has to thicken because the wall stress, the stress on the heart muscle, is increased by the bigger the heart is, but is decreased the thicker the heart is. So traditionally purely strength trained athletes tend to have thicker hearts. And what we call concentric hypertrophy. As opposed to dilated hearts, which we call eccentric hypertrophy. And athletes do almost exclusively endurance training runners, swimmers, cross country skiers in the days before skating technique. And they have massive increases in blood flow. So the adaptation of the heart is to get bigger to accommodate and then sustain those big stroke volumes. So that's the sort of traditional view. The endurance athlete has a bigger heart, which is eccentricly remodeled. I mean, if I just stretched it without making the heart thicker, the walls would get smaller. That's not what happens, right? The gaps get bigger and more muscular, but the walls don't get thicker. A strength trained athlete, the heart doesn't dilate the walls just get bigger. And it's the eccentric hypertrophy that's important for stroke volume and thus cardiovascular fitness. Exactly, that's correct. Now it turns out that it's not probably not so simple. And it's not so simple for a number of reasons, because even during dynamic exercise, when you contract your muscles and run, you're actually a cooling blood flow during those two. And many sports like rowing, for example, are an intense combination of both static and dynamic or a strength and endurance type activity. So rowers are we talking they pull on the ors that use a massive amount of skeletal muscle that's contracting. But they're also doing that in a rhythmic basis like a runner or a swimmer. So they're doing both strength and endurance, and they have the biggest hearts of any athletes. The biggest hearts that you ever see are in the rowers. Now in some skiers, so you know, be skating technique in skiing is a huge strength as well as endurance component. You know, and in the four, I guess gosh, in 1984, for a 40 years, we've been classifying sports into their static versus dynamic exercise. And we created a little matrix, you know, low medium and high endurance, low medium and high static. So a nine box factor. And in the Bethesda guidelines from energy and athletes with heart disease, we put sports in these different bins. We're revising those guidelines right, those scientific statements right now. And we're going to change how we display that. We're eliminated the individual boxes. And we say there are increasing amounts of endurance requirements in the sport and increasing amount of strength requirements in the sport. But it's not so simple. I can't just put them into little bins because I mean even golf or a strength train, right. And even some strength train athletes will do aerobic exercise. So, you know, most football American football players don't do anything more than 10 seconds. Never. You know, I tend to recommend to the trainers that even the strength train those athletes will be better off if we incorporate some higher intensity. They're the perfect people to do not just the 10 second effort, which is all they ever do, but do a one minute or a two minute. I mean, how long do multiple play series take last in a football game, for example, American football game? Now, I think they need to do four by four, or two by two is, and that's what's going to allow them to sustain their fitness and not get tired when, you know, they're playing fast on the sport. So, I think we realize that sport is not so simple. I mean, even within a sport, you know, the goalies are different than the full backs. You know, in American football, the defensive backs are different than alignment. You know, it's just really different. So, we can't just just bin sports and all the sport people will train with strength and even runners are training with weight training and doing strength training. Even runners are doing strength training these days. You know, to not try not to bin them, but I'm going to bin them. So let's say purely strength trainers. There is there does seem to be an argument then that they should definitely incorporate some endurance training, if not for the stroke volume increase and eccentric hypertrophy and the effects on cardiovascular risk. So, I think that for I think from strength trained athletes, it's a mistake not to do any endurance. We can argue about what endurance means, whether that two minutes or four minutes or 40 minutes is endurance. And I think that there are different ways to skin the cat, so to speak. Certainly for a long-term health that becomes critically important and Jonathan Kim and Atlantis work very closely with the National Football League to help retired NFL players. You know, figure out how to change their training and their eating and their habits to preserve their health over their lifetimes, sort of football career is just aren't that long. I think you're right that for performance may be not for Olympic weight lifting, you know, but for other strength sports. I think there's no question that endurance is important. And for sports that require repetitive bursts of strength activities, I think some type of endurance training of some degree, whether that be high intensity, or four by four is something is critical for performance and well-in-hand performance. When we talk about cardiovascular health, that's a little bit of a different story and I think that it is important for overall cardiovascular health. In fact, essential to include that over time. And again, I'll come back to the point that no good athlete does just one thing. I think that's where our studies kind of are a little bit too isolated because in order to do the research, you've got to focus on an asked one simple question, but training is not that simple in real life. Right. There are people that are much more focused on resistance training and strength training that are not athletes, they're just, you know, interested in health. And, you know, some people wonder, well, I'm getting my heart rate up, you know, to some almost maximal heart rate when I'm doing my compound lifts. My deadlifts or my squads and, you know, how much of that counts towards, you know, am I getting this, you know, improvement in this eccentric hypertrophy and stroke volume or, you know, do I need to then, you know, incorporate some other types of training as well, right. So I think you're articulating the CrossFit concept basically, right. And so I think that I'll, I'll tell you that it kind of depends. So I think that if you ask what happens to the heart rate and cardiac output during a purely strength activity. There are things that drive the heart rate that are controlled differently in a strength activity and an endurance activity. Let me, let me dig into that if that's okay. This is a little bit of science. Please do. All right. So let's first talk about something called the exercise presser reflex. So simply, it's easiest to study by doing just a hand grip exercise. Okay, but it would be true for any if I squeeze my hand. Okay, that's the same as, you know, doing a short static exercise doing hand grip. And I do it at, let's say, 30% of a maximal contraction and I hold it. Okay. Heart rate will steadily rise blood pressure will steadily rise if I put a little needle in an eference sympathetic nerve as it passes by the figure. I had that's called my chronography. I can actually record signals from the brain to the blood vessels, which cause vasoconstriction throughout the body. Okay, it's a brain driven process, which comes from feedback from skeletal muscle. How do I know that? Let's say I do that and until I can't do it anymore, I take a blood pressure cuff and I blow it up on the arm. And I trap all the muscle, all the metabolites, you know, the things that are happening in the muscle that are causing fatigue that are utilizing that energy. And I trap them there and then I stop exercise. I let go. Heart rate comes all the way back to baseline immediately. But blood pressure stays up and the sympathetic nerve system stays up. And that is the essence of the exercise pressur reflex. The heart rate is now. You can ask me, is the heart rate controlled by the brain then? Because I've stopped exercising. So the brain's no longer trying to make something happen. That's called central command. Or is it happening because the muscle tension, nothing to do with metabolites? Because I stopped exercising. Well, to address that, my one of my mentors, Jerry Mitchell went to Copenhagen and put some Neil Secker and checked with some curary into the nerves, which paralyzes them. And they had them look at a screen. And they said, I want you to try to squeeze as hard as you did before. But because the hand was paralyzed, they couldn't contract the muscle. But they could try really hard and heart rate wouldn't have been higher. Even though the muscle was not contracting. So we know that this vagal withdrawal and sympathetic activation comes to a heart rate in particular. It comes from the central command. The sympathetic activity also is stimulated by what's called group three and group four. Large and smaller, unmilinated fibers. Fibres that are not insulated. That carries signals from the muscle to the brain and say, but something's wrong. Let's get that blood pressure up. Increased nerve activity, constricting the blood vessels. So that's called the exercise press reflex. The harder you squeeze, the longer you do it for. Okay. And the more amount of muscle mass, the bigger the blood pressure response. So that's one component. Okay. How is the heart rate regulated during dynamic exercise during running, for example? Well, it turns out that it is almost certainly coming from an energetic signal in your skeletal muscle. How do I know that? Well, some patients have diseases in the mitochondria. They're called metabolic or mitochondrial myopathys. And one of my colleagues at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Ron Haller, studied the he was neurologist that studied those patients. He's since retired. He's not dead, just retired. And what he found is when those patients started to exercise, their cardiac output went through the roof. Their Venus blood looked red because they couldn't extract the oxygen. They had a problem in the muscle. But they would, you and I might increase the cardiac output by about five liters for every leader of oxygen. I'll take these people were increasing up by 10 or 20 liters. So even just walking down the hall is maximal exercise to them. And what that tells us, it is a signal that we need energy. We need oxygen delivered and fuel that drives the heart rate response and the cardiac out response during endurance exercise. So those are two fundamentally different things. One increases the heart rate during a muscle contraction from central command. The other drives muscle cardiac output to match Venus return. The more the compliant, the heart, the more blood could come back, the more it could pump out. Those two things are happening to a greater or lesser degree with any combination of movements. That's why I mean it's no longer so simple to talk about just strength or just endurance. And then that gets me back to the question we started with, why are you training? What's the purpose? Some people tell me they want to look good. They want their muscles to be big. They want to have relatively little muscle fat. They want to be strong. I say, well, and you kind of do a lot of strength exercise. You know, if what you want is to perform during a crossfit competition, you kind of do crossfit work. I think crossfit is very interesting to me because it's a combination of repetitive strength type maneuvers. But they also include repetitive muscle contraction. So I think that kind of exercise does have both an endurance and a strength component. Mike Emory from Cleveland Clinic now is a huge fan of the Crossfit type training. And believes that it will get you a combination of eccentric and constant trick type hypertrophy. And again, it's where, you know, this Morgan Roth hypothesis kind of falls apart because it's not one thing or the other. It's kind of a combination of both. I don't think you can lift free weights and expect, you know, that, yeah, slam down the weights on the floor, walk around in between my sets that you're going to get an endurance type trained heart. That requires a more sustained repetitive contraction and more dynamic type exercise to engage. I know that was a little complicated. No, it's not helpful. Wonderful. I mean, I also love that you, you did bring up the Crossfit, you know, that that they I've been doing Crossfit for the last few months. And and also there is a corp in incorporation of a lot of high intensity. There's rowing. There's jumping rope. There's getting on the bike. So it is, you know, like you said, it's not, you know, you can't just put strength training and resistance training and one band and endurance and another, particularly with a lot of these programs now that are available like Crossfit or each day, or each day, reason, another one they do, you know, they have something very similar. But you're right, just like if you're just raising the dumbbells and doing, you know, you know, there, there's not as much of the endurance kind of training there. So it's, it's good to talk about the science there on that. I kind of want to go back to the, the blood pressure thing as well because there was an interesting study that was recently published that made a lot of headlines on these isometric types of exercises. Right, the static hold and being better at improving blood pressure. What, what is the best exercise to improve blood pressure, right? I mean, that's so, so, you know, when we take care of patients with hypertension, the first thing, the, the community tells us to do is lifestyle modification, reduce and take of salt, reduce and take of alcohol, make sure you're getting plenty sleep and increase exercise. And, and I will say that traditionally my approach has been that dynamic exercise is best because that causes relaxation of blood vessels. That's how you get the blood to the exercising muscle and what will do one more little science thing, okay? Because the body has both a general alerting response as a function of the exercise presser reflex and a local response. So when I'm exercising hard, the muscles that are contracting are relaxed. Blood vessels everywhere else are contracted. It's really interesting. So if I'm running, the blood vessels in my arms are contracting as they are in my kidney and my gut. That's why you sometimes will get catastrophic gut ischemia during extraordinary endurance exercise. Because you just don't have enough blood in your circulation to maintain your blood pressure. If you've got a lot of skeletal muscle that's requiring blood. The thing that the local is called the saltine hypothesis about the cardiovascular limitation to exercise. Because if you add arm exercise, why you're doing intense lex exercise, you start to constrict the blood vessels even in the legs. Because you simply cannot sustain your blood pressure with all the blood vessels relaxed, even with a maximal cardiac output. So the blood vessels have to constrict, but they constrict from this general alerting increase sympathetic activity. But in the muscles, you get something called functional, sympatheticlysis. What that means is the muscles are releasing metabolites as not just from the muscle, but from the blood vessels and from the red blood cells themselves. ATP and ADP are dramatically poond. They so dilators. So you get constriction in one place and dilation in another place. And it is the regular contraction that needs to release of those metabolites, the driving of the cardiac output response. That causes relaxation of the blood vessels. And that's what I want in hypertension. I want the blood vessels to be relaxed. Remember, we started this by saying blood pressure. I didn't, maybe I didn't. We talked about the thick equation. Blood pressure is also a function of two things. Two things only. Cardic output and the muscular resistance. We talked that cardiac output is heart rate and stroke flying. So blood pressure is the triple product of heart rate stroke flying and the muscular resistance. We probably resistance being a may of very major component. So what I typically think is that people need to do sustained in during the blood vessels. So we need to do a certain direction during the activity to dilate those blood vessels. Cause that relaxation and let those blood vessels start to relax as a the best way to reduce blood pressure. I don't know what to make about the static training study. It's just one study. It's really contradicts a lot of other data in the literature. I don't think that people say, oh, let me quickly switch to doing Planks and legsets against the wall just because this one study showed a low blood pressure. For the most part, unfortunately, if you have hypertension and have already done your lifestyle modification, you're probably going to need medication to drop your blood pressure. Hyper-tension is a cardiovascular disorder. And we've learned that a lot of people are going to develop it. And so I think the lifestyle stuff is the foundation. I don't think it's going to make a huge difference whether you do, whether it changes my prescription for life, that remains the same. And I think having a strong component of endurance exercise, but incorporating strength because that's important for life and function as you get older. I think all of that is really important and it's not going to change my prescription. You know, I do have specific approaches to hypertension and physically active people. But I will remind your audience that many people are salt sensitive and reducing salt intake and the diet is important if you have hypertension and maintaining a high potassium intake is also important. And then watch your alcohol. Because I think sometimes doctors don't tell you that, but that too much alcohol intake is a very strong contributor to hypertension. And making sure you've got good sleep and don't have sleep apnea. So sleep apnea is another thing. If you're spouse or a partner's snores, that may be one and as hypertension, talk to a sleep doctor that may be something that's a little easier to manage. And we'll concoast dramatic reduction in blood pressure. So along with those, you think it's possible to, with lifestyle intervention, reverse hypertension. I think in some cases, in mild hypertension, I think that that's true. If you've got hypertension in a young person under the age of 40, I think you need to look for other causes. I don't think we look hard enough often enough. Probably the single most important is to measure a reenan and an aldosterone. To look for hyperal gastronism, production of one of the hormones that raises the blood pressure by the adrenal gland and the kidneys. That ends up being really easier and more directed to treat. And it's grossly under diagnosed in our country. So you should have a reenan and an aldosterone level measured. There are other rare causes of hypertension severe hypertension in young people. Should get a plasma metanephrins to look for unusual tumors of the adrenal gland. But I think that garden variety, essential hypertension, at least at its earlier stages, can well be modified by behavioral modification that we've been. Great, including someone who may be in their late 60s, if they perhaps do the training, the sleep, looking at the sleep, the alcohol, all in tape, all the things. That can have a huge effect. What about, I've heard you talk about recovery and recovery days being as important as how much load you're putting on your heart and so how much training. Right. I'm curious what you mean by that. Right. So recovery is a essential part of training. And I think most athletes in coaches understand that, but but it's a way that many athletes get into trouble because if they're not. Performing as well as I want, they think, oh, I just need to train harder. And that ends up just getting them into a vicious cycle of increasing over training. You know, that athletic community has thought a lot about this over training syndrome for years as a guy from the Netherlands in. Armed chiepers who did a really interesting study with horses. You know, horses are some of the great endurance athletes of our time of our world, right, biologic world. And he tried to overtrain them. And first thing he did was he increased their base training load and they all got faster. And then he said, okay, well let me increase the intensity of their training and they all got fast. And they all got faster. And they said, let me increase the number of intensity training sessions. And they all got faster. And finally said, well, I don't know what else to do. Maybe I'll just change their recovery. And what I mean by recovery is, you know, they do a high intensity session in the morning. And then the next session after a high intensity session is something easy. So it's simply a simple canter just a walk around to get the blood moving. And as soon as that within the week of increasing the intensity of the recovery sessions, they were all overtrained. With marked reduction of performance, increasing resting heart rate fatigue, you know, every sign of overtraining. So in order to reap the benefits of a training stimulus, the body has to do something, right? The muscles have to produce protein. The blood vessels. There's a release of a variety of downstream metabolites from the oxygen sensing cascade from a poxyinducidible factor through a wedge-f the vascular and a fealial growth factor. The thing that makes the blood vessels that improve the lining, the endothelium that add muscle fibers that make them bigger, all these things have to happen. That's what beneath, you know, the skin, those are the things that are happening after you do a training stimulus, right? And if you don't allow those their full expression, then you won't get the benefit of the workout that you do. And so most good coaches and trainers will always incorporate an easy session after a high intensity session. And always, I think, should always have a day off. Whether that day off is some, you know, strength training or technical training or things like that, that's okay by me watching film doing some basic technical things, shooting free throws if you're a basketball player, whatever, but it has to be something easy that's unstressed. And that's what allows you to get the most benefit. And I think that people who are not coached, you know, or who have a coach that's perhaps a bit more inexperienced, they get driven to do more and more and more and they find that they're not getting better. And that's probably because they're not having adequate recovery. And one of the things we did in all our altitude training studies, we spent more than a decade studying the best way to do altitude training for a USA track and field in the US Olympic Committee, is to monitor early morning heart rate. That was our best indicator. So we'd have the athletes put their heart rate monitor on, you know, setting a alarm, put their heart rate monitor on, if you've got a watch at rest that's pretty accurate. During exercise, the watches that just use the PPG, the Pothisma Gram are not accurate. That's a whole nother discussion that we should talk about, but put it on at rest and track it for, even go back to sleep and see what it was for those five minutes before you woke up again. And as you start to get over train, that resting heart rate starts to climb. And that's a signal that, okay, I need to reduce the frequency of my intensity sessions. I need to make them a little shorter or I need to make sure that I'm adding adequate recovery and take a day off. An adequate recovery, if I'm just, I want to make sure I understand this. It includes on a day you're training doing something a little more light. Exhains up a rubber band. It might if you're used to doing stuff in zone three and zone four or zone five, you might do in a zone one. Okay, so did you know what I mean by those five zones? I go ahead and I would be great because it seems like definitions vary depending on what journal you're reading. And I think that that's true and there are different coaches who use different zones for us. You know, and I learned, you know, my basic practical exercise science from Jim Straygunderson, my partner and carver. Oh, that's a good one. I'm going to go with it. It will a little less. Yes, sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So from Jim Straygunderson who passed last year, my good friend and partner. I'll get there. Just give me a second. Okay. So I learned most of my exercise science from my good friend and partner Jim Straygunderson who unfortunately passed from Peggrata cancer last year. And we, in all our studies, we used a five training zone model. And typically what that means is we would pick the generally the second ventilatory threshold where ventilation starts to really increase at a proportion to oxygen uptake where VEVCO2 has gone down to its nadir where lactate is between that two to four millimolar range. They all reflect what we call the maximal steady state. That's the highest level that you can sustain for a prolonged period of time. Most good marathon runners are running at the maximal steady state. And let's just say for argument sake that was at a heart rate of 155. Because there's no magic to heart rate and it changes on a day to day basis where not machines. We would bracket that and call let's say the maximal steady state or threshold or zone three training would be 150 to 160. Okay, then zone two training is about 20 beats below that. So 130 to 150. Okay, and then zone one or recovery is less than 130. So a recovery effort would be below the lower limits of zone two. Now zone four is probably the, am I still pressing this too hard? Okay, so zone four is probably the hardest to quantify because in the physiology world you need to bring people back and do multiple repeat testing to do that. Zone four is what we call critical power. That's the highest intensity you can sustain without failure without a drift towards VEVCO2 max. So when Kipchogie was trying to run the under two minute to our marathon, when Kipchogie was trying to run the under two hour marathon, he worked with Andy Jones and my joiner and trying to say what exactly is my critical power. And it's amazing if you look at Andy Jones from the UK's work. I mean, he does exercise in an MR magnet and looks at truly, you know, phosphochree in ratios in hydrogen ions. One or two what differences is a difference between sustainability and failure. It's extraordinary and it's delicate and it's hard to pick and it's my belief. I think Andy's also is that the reason that some of these great runners from East Africa or some of the great swimmers spend so much time doing what they're doing is they want to feel what they've got to figure out what the pay for is. They have to know what that is. And it's hard to prove that in a lab, everybody, the good athletes know that when can you push that pace and when do you have to back off. And so we know zone five because we're measuring maximum heart rate and in the model that I gave you, let's say the max heart rate was 180. Okay, so the top of the zone three was 160. So I often what I typically will do in the lab is I'll split the difference. We'll call zone four 160 to 170 and zone five 170 to 180. And so that gives you a nice broad heart rate five zone which reflects different kinds of events. So zone three typically is a marathon and I'll calculate running economy. And so I know the speed at any given oxygen uptake for a runner for example. And also if I take zone three heart rate and running economy, I can tell you what your marathon time is going to be. And if I figure out what zone four is that's about a 10 k pace or so. So you can't run that pace at an entire marathon, right? But you can run it for you know 45 minutes or an hour, right? And then five k and shorter, five k is run at the O2 max. So five k is run at zone five and anything shorter than that, right? We know for sure that you can't run 10 meters a second for a marathon. You can't even run it for 5,000 meters, right? But that's still going to be zone five, right? So anything that's, you know, pretty much, you know, a five k and shorter will be run at those higher heart rates on those higher training zones for endurance activity. So you mentioned the importance of looking at your resting heart rate early morning, four recovery. Yes, sort of a good as a guy. Right. What about you hear a lot about heart rate variability? Yeah. So you know, we spend decades and I publish probably a hundred papers about cardiovascular variability. So first let's ask what is heart rate variability? So heart rate variability looks at the change in heart rate over time. And there are two, this is grossly simplifying it, but there are two main stimuli to heart rate variability. Number one is respiration and breathing. When you breathe, there are two things that happen. Your brain is sending signals to your diaphragm to breathe. The nerve that carries those signals also goes to the heart. The biggest nerve. There are also changes in blood pressure and stroke volume that occur as you breathe. Because when you breathe in, you're decreasing in the thoracic pressure blood flows into the heart. When you breathe out, the blood comes out of the heart. So you're changing stroke volume, you're stimulating the arterial bariseptors, which are in the carotid arteries. And in the archivier aorta. So there are a number of things that happen when you breathe that move blood in and out of the heart and also send neural activity from the brain to the pacemaker of the heart. That's the respiratory variability. That happens at the respiratory rate. Then there are other intrinsic rhythms within the circulation. They happen a little bit slower. If you think in terms of cycles per second or hurts, you know, point one hurts or ten cycles a second is the low frequency, myor wave frequency. And if I measure sympathetic nerves, the myor frequency is mostly sympatheticly driven. Not entirely. It's sympathetic and vaguely driven. So the problem is is that all measures of heart rate variability when you use a heart rate monitor do not take those into account. So if I told you to breathe at six breaths a minute, I would slam the high frequency on top of the low frequency rhythm and I would markedly increase your heart rate variability. If I had you breathe a little bit faster, I would separate those out. And most of the heart rate variability that's being measured by your heart rate devices. Most of the heart rate variability that's being measured by your heart rate devices is mostly looking at the high frequency variability. But that is absolutely dependent on respiratory rate. And nobody controls that, right? You're not given a tone that tells you you breathe at this frequency and will measure your heart rate variability. No, it's not doing that. And then I'm going to add one more that as you move around, very low frequency rhythms will alter heart rate. So when you stand up heart rate goes up when you lie down heart rate goes down. When you pee, you have with vagal withdrawal, so you only wait a pee. So your heart rate goes up when you pee. And when you talk to somebody, your heart rate goes up. These are uncontrolled factors. In my laboratory, if I control every single factor, so same time of day, same food in the body, same, I control how deep and how fast you breathe, I can't get better than a plus or minus 25% day to day variability. So I'm just telling you that even under the best of circumstances, these measurements are very technique dependent and very different. And very, very bold. So I don't think people should use them as an indicator of anything because I think it's too. The science is not there. You can read lots of articles about heart rate variability. I was like the thesis advisor and a pun in for one of my good friend, Hikki Rusko from Finland, from a vascular students who tried a lot to look at heart rate variability. I've read very ability as an indicator of training and overtraining. And it's just too hard to standardize and get right. So I think if you tried to use that, except under extraordinarily controlled conditions, I think you'd find, yeah, I think that you'll find you'll make more mistakes than benefit. Well, that goes with what my gut was telling me because I can, with my training, I can see improvements in resting heart rate, I can see it in my heart rate, my maximum heart rate going even low. Like getting lower, but my heart rate variability according to my Apple Watch, nothing. So we, you talked a little bit about, you know, this, the performance, cardiovascular performance and limitations and, and that got me to thinking of, you know, men versus women and these sex differences. And what, so my husband and I go for a run together and he smokes me every time. Like he's faster. Yeah. And, you know, now we're not doing a six hour run, maybe that would change, maybe I would outperform him who knows, but I'm curious, like, what are the cardiovascular performance differences between men and women? So you're asking a really interesting question and there are some fundamental differences between men and women, particularly, you know, younger men and women, which is virtually all due to the anthropogenic effects of testosterone. testosterone builds muscle reduces fat builds blood volume, makes the heart bigger, makes the body bigger, changes the power outputs of skeletal muscle. So, so that's why we have women's sports, right, is because men and women, given equivalent access to training and coaching, men are still faster. And if you're interested in reading more about this, we just published a definitive scientific statement about the biologic differences of sex from the Marin College of Sports Medicine, Sandra Hunter from our cat is the first author on it. It's been published, it's in the public domain, it just came out a number of months ago. So that, that has a lot of information about this. You know, if you looked at, I'm not sure I'm going to get the exact numbers correct, but if you looked at in the, some of the great, this middle distance runner is female middle distance runner is house in Felix, Sandra Richards Ross, you know, those are the great names that we hear about and know about in women's women's middle distance sports. And if you looked at their world records that they set during the peak of their career, at the same time, 20,000 or 10,000 boys ran faster. Boys, not these are high school kids. If they had to compete against the boys, we would not know their names. This is not, this is not benign. And you know, if our society wants and views having women's sports and women to be able to be successful, which I think is a tremendously important goal. It's important that women compete against women and men compete against men. And let me say that differently. It's important that males compete against males and females compete against males. Because as a difference in sex and gender, I don't want to get into that. I don't think that's what we're here for. But biological sex makes a difference, particularly the sex that you are, your biological sex as you go through puberty. That's where the differences between boys and girls start to become most dramatic. Before puberty, there's not much of a difference. But as a puberty, when the massive increases in testosterone come about and you know, you're not just going to be true. Now, I wouldn't beat you, because I'm an older man and I'm not probably not as fit as you. So it's not that every man is going to beat every woman. That's moronic, right? But given the same training and the same level, the males are going to run faster. Yeah, the same age. What about this? There was this study this year that was published in the Journal of American College of Cardiology, claiming that women can reap the benefits of aerobic exercise with doing less exercise as men. So it was twice as less exercise and they had the same cardiovascular. So I'm underwhelmed. I think that there's not a huge amount of benefit. The bottom line is that premenopausal women that they just don't have a lot of cardiovascular disease. There's extraordinary protection against cardiovascular disease by estrogen and progesterone. And what I tell many of my patients is, is one thing that will turn a woman into a man and that's cigarettes smoking. So cigarettes smoking abolishes most of that difference. And we see that clinically all the time. But I think that women should not necessarily consider that their dose response relationship to exercise is fundamentally different. That's why after menopause, those differences basically change. And so what happens is you simply shift now once you've got a woman who's well past menopause now from an endocrine logic perspective. She's much more similar to a man. And now the risks start to accelerate at the same level, at the same rate that just pushed off by a decade. What if she undergoes hormone replacement therapy? Yeah, you know, that's an interesting question. And there are risks and benefits of that, right? I think that there are clearly benefits, cardiovascular benefits, particularly if the hormone placement therapy is started early in the menopause transition. When it starts later, you lose the protective effect and you increase the risk of breast cancer and other bad things that counteract the male female mortality difference. So the timing of of a timing, I think, is, you know, this obviously been studied by, you know, dozens of people and hundreds of thousands of women. So that's a whole none of the complex task. But I think the simple answer is I wouldn't count on it. I would say that the dose response relationships are the same. And we've seen that we have always tried to incorporate women in our studies. We have the only studies that included women in all our altitude training studies. Because women are competitive athletes and we need to know how they respond to altitude. We did the same thing in our year-long training program. So to our community, everybody knows this, but we have to include women in all our studies it is essential. But I don't think women should think they are special in terms of their adaptation to exercise. And we're mostly found in the same exact, except that in our year-long training study, women increase the size of their heart in the first three months, similar to men. And then they stop, they play a toad and then continue to increase. And I think that's a testosterone phenomenon. It's another example of why testosterone enhances the building of cardiac as well as skeletal muscle. So that's one of the fundamental differences. And I want to get into some of these risks with now comes with extreme exercise. He's really also an expert in that area. And there's been a lot of interest and worry in extreme exercise. Like I guess we should define what that is, but in some instances, you can find studies saying seven and a half hours of exercise a week. And in some cases what they call double the risk of cardiovascular disease. And I think you'll clarify me with the depends on they're actually looking at other biomarkers not necessarily someone dying of cardiovascular disease. But what is extreme exercise? How does it affect coronary plaque calcium? What is coronary plaque calcium? Why is that significant? Okay. All right. So first, I think extraordinary exercise in, in, can be defined by multiple different things from a epidemiological cardiovascular health perspective. I think what we're talking about people who do more than three to ten thousand met minutes a week. And I'll tell you why I chose that. In our studies in the Cooper clinic, we used more than 3,000 met minutes a week, which is about eight hours. And on about six hours, but on average, our high volume exercises did about eight hours a week. So the nay deer where you reach the maximal cardiovascular benefit is about five hours a week, five, maybe up to ten hours a week for heart failure outcomes. Once you get more than about ten hours a week, you're starting to get to, well, I think most would agree on extreme exercise. The coronary calcium story is interesting, right? The original concern about coronary cancer came from the German study by Mollon Camp, where they looked at a group of runners who had done lots of lot of marathoners. And found that they had more initially when they compared them to a population-based study, the Heinz and X-Store Freakwell study. They didn't have more coronary calcium. But the authors of that study kind of said, well, that it's not fitting our hypothesis. Part of it is the athletes had better risk factors than the controls. So they said, let's only select athletes who had the same risk factors as the controls. And then the athletes had a little bit higher coronary calcium and a little more non-zero calcium. But 50% of those runners were smokers, and they all started training later in life. That's a consistent theme in much of this world. A lot of the masters athletes tend to start later in life. They're not the young elite Olympic athletes. And many of them are doing it to try to combat bad behavior when they were younger. So just keep that in mind. When we look at, then the next big study was the one out of the UK, which did CT and geography, which looked at more than just coronary calcium. And now is a good point to step into that, right? Calcium is the footprint of atherosclerosis. So as the atherosclerosis, the heartening of the arteries that we think about is cholesterol mediated. Because that progresses from accumulation of cholesterol there, important into macrophages, the cells that suck up the cholesterol into the lining of the blood vessels, and injured and start to accumulate and obstruct the blood vessels. As that heals or progresses, there's always a little bit of this plaque, a little plaque, rupture, a little bit of injury here, and the blood vessel counts flies. It's not the calcified blood vessel that I worry about. It's the company it keeps. Because calcified blood vessels don't crack, don't rupture and don't cause heart attacks. It's the non-calcified, what's what I've been called soft. It's not really soft. It's just non-calcified plaque. That ruptures in causes are heart attack, occludes the blood vessel. That's what heart attack is. So the more calcified plaque calcified plaque. That makes sense. The atherosclerotic burden is higher. What the British study showed was that first of all, their female participants had almost no cardiovascular sclerosis. Let's talk about the women for a moment. The males, the higher intensity, more volume athletes, had more plaques and more calcified calcim. What was interesting though, is all the plaques were almost all calcified. And in the non-afflates, it was a mix of calcified and non-calcified plaque. They're the ones who first raised this issue. It may be exercising, stabilizes plaque and makes it more calcified. And that's why it's the athletes tend to have a lower mortality and a lower risk of a heart attack. But none of those studies looked at events. They just looked at the anatomy of the arteries. So that's where our Cooper Clinic study came in. Laura DeFenis, paper, and Jamma from 2019. We looked at 25,000 people, with multiple different ranges of physical activity. From the middle group, which is sort of that guideline directed three to five hours a week, a low group who did less than three hours a week, and then a high volume exercise. It did about eight hours a week. Okay? And it turned out that about 75% of both groups, all three groups, about 75% of them, had relatively little coronary calcium. And the number we worry about is score of a hundred, because that's where the higher the calcium level above a hundred, the greater the risk. So that's sort of our clinical cut point where it becomes really clinically meaningful. And among those individuals who have the majority, so 75% of our group had coronary calcium scores less than a hundred, there was no difference in coronary calcium among the three different activity groups. And a 50% reduction in events. Quite dramatic. Now there was a small, about 11% increase in the risk of having a calcium score over a hundred. I'm parsing my words carefully. There was a little bit of a greater risk of having a higher score. But if I look in all the individuals who had scores over a hundred, there was no difference in the absolute score between those who did no activity, and those who did eight hours a week. And there was a 25% reduction in events. Didn't quite reach statistical significance, but it wasn't a greater increase for sure, no greater increase. It was a lower end. And the bottom line, if you look at now absolute versus relative risk, which we're coming back to, we talked about at the beginning, you're better off having no calcium than having a lot of calcium. Absolutely, right? Because calcium is a sign of Atharosclerosis. If you've got calcium, you're better off being fit than unfit. Okay? And in a natarad for his paper, also from the Kubo Clinic, we showed that there's an interaction between calcium and fitness. So the higher your fitness, the closer the high calcium group comes to those with no calcium. So if you're unfit with a high calcium score, that's a disaster. If you're very fit with a high calcium score, you're worse than if you had no calcium. But not that much worse, because the fitness ends up being protective. What causes a calcification in Atharosclerosis? I mean, if I knew that, I'd have the Nobel Prize, right? We have lots, I mean, billions of studies about the nature of Atharosclerosis and what causes it, but it's due to many of the risk factors we know. High cholesterol, how that cholesterol interacts with the vascular, a wall hypertension, smoking diabetes, and your parents. Genetics. If you're measuring, let's say, by CTNG, you're looking at the quote-unquote soft plaque, which isn't so soft, but it's not calcium. Not a cast-five plaque. Then it does physical activity reduce black information. So the, I have to say that just a few months ago, or last year, the pro at heart study that I mentioned before, kind of threw a big wrench into this, because they looked at a lead, low, young, and older athletes, and they did show more plaque related to high intensity and their insectivity. I don't know exactly what that's going to mean. I don't think that exercise removes plaque. I don't think you can count on that. It may, it certainly provides protection, and it may, against cardiovascular bad outcomes. And it may cause the non-couse-five plaque to be more classified, and more rupture resistant. But I don't think it makes it go away. There are idiocincratic studies looking at this training and this reduction, but there's also idiocincratic studies showing, and bag of showed and run across the America, that when they did that, they had an increase in plaque. I will tell you, because I just got a notification yesterday that we have a new paper from the Kubrick Clinic, showing that if you look at try to parse out the exercise dose into intensity, resist duration, as you increase the intensity, calcium goes less, and as you increase duration, calcium goes up. So I think the higher intensity efforts are probably more protective, and the very longer duration that ones are probably more calcium-inducing. Why that is? I don't know. You can look at some of Wendy Quartz data from Colorado. She's the one who's shown that when you start to exercise calcium and the blood goes down, that causes an increase in parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone causes a leaching of calcium out of the bones. And where that calcium is going when it goes out of the bloodstream, I don't know. Maybe some of it gets deposited in the blood vessels. We don't know exactly what the path of that calcium is. I think this is an area of active investigation. But it's one of the reasons why endurance athletes always thought, this is going to protect my bones, but it doesn't. It doesn't protect your bones. It actually may worsen it. Some of that is nutritional, but also it's because of sustained increases in parathyroid hormone. And sustained leaching of calcium from the bones to preserve blood calcium levels, which are essential to everything that is necessary for life. The other, I would say, the other outcome, well not necessarily outcome, but risk factor for a negative outcome that people are worried about with extreme, particularly extreme endurance activity is atrial fibrillation. So what's interesting though is that you look at numerous studies, there's a decreased risk and a fit with increasing physical activity. But it seems as though there might be a certain point when that changes. It's absolutely true. And so one thing I tell all my masters athletes, this is one of the consequences of the duration and the intensity of activity that you do is you'll increase your risk of achrial fibrillation. We know why. It's a very elegant study by again, Gito class in an Andre Lugherge, which talks about the damning effect of the valves. Remember that the heart has upper chambers called the atria that collect the blood and pumping chambers called the ventricles, which eject the blood out of the heart. In between the marvals, A, V, H, of in trickicular valves. On the left side, it's the mitral valve. Let's talk about that one for a moment, because most of the atrial fibrillation is probably generated within the left atrium. So when the heart contracts that mitral valve snaps closed, and the blood gets ejected out, but the blood continues to flow into the atrium, because the cardiac output is increased, right? So it's got to keep flowing in. The blood doesn't just stop. It accumulates in the atrium. That's called the reservoir effect of the atria. Then when that valve opens, the pressure that has built up in the atria drives the blood into the ventricles to help fill it. And then so there's blood to pump in during the next cardiac cycle. Does that make sense? Okay. So now let's take exercise, which increases the cardiac output. So increases the speed and volume of blood that's being pumped. And now the other thing it does is increases the heart rate. And when you increase the heart rate, now you have more cystallies. So instead of having the valve open, now it's... And you spend more time with those valves closed. And so it creates a dam in between the atria and the ventricles, and the atria just dilate. And as you dilate the atria, you increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. And what point is there like a amount of exercise? Yeah, so that's a good question because the tromso heart studies, probably the one, also from Norway, which shows the point that you made, and we all know, that being unfit is also a risk for atrial fibrillation. And probably that targeted middle dose, if you will, three to five hours, moderate intensity, physical activity gets you to the nadear. And that population-based study, as you got past that, you started to increase the risk. There was a lot of noise around the point estimate. And nowhere near, that, you know, increase it by, I can't remember exactly by one and a half time, something like that. nowhere near the five fold increase that you see in the competitive athletes. So, so I don't think anyone who is doing recreational or even occupational exercise needs to worry about a fib. I think, you know, particularly as we've talked about the optimal dose for health and joy and wellness, you know, is up three hours is what's recommended up to five, three to five hours probably gets you most of the bank for your buck. And as you start to get beyond that for performance, then you accept the risk of atrial fibrillation. Now, the risk of AFAB, the reason people worry about it is increases stroke. Do athletes have an increased risk of stroke? Athletes in general don't have an increased risk of stroke anybody with atrial fibrillation has an increased risk of stroke. Do athletes have less of an increased risk maybe, but we don't really know that for sure. So, so I think that, you know, it's easy to protect yourself from stroke by taking an accumulation. There, of course, we base that there's obviously risk to taking bloodthin or is because, you know, you may bleed. And for some athletes like cyclists who get into crashes, that's a bad thing, right? So, depending on the nature of the athletic event, someone who's a runner or a swimmer, I don't think you have to worry about it, right? But cyclists, when you are risk for a crash or, you know, other kind of athletic events that involve collision, then that becomes an increased risk if you're on a blood thinner. So, we don't know the best way to manage that. Some of it depends on how often you're in AFAB. This can be paradoxesimal, meaning it only occurs intermittently, where it can be persistent or permanent. It ends up being persistent or frequent, then ablation is a way to go, just keep it from happening. There's a new study out called React. It's actually recruiting right now, and we're asking the question, if someone develops AFAB, can I just, take in a coagulation for a couple of weeks right then, and then take a medicine to get rid of it, and then when I'm back in science, we're them stopped taking the medication. So, only take it when you're in AFAB, that requires you to be able to detect it either symptomatically or with your watch. And we just don't know, most right now are saying, you know, if you have other risk factors, older age, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, other heart diseases, that increase your risk of a stroke, it's probably better off taking the anticoagulation, depending on what your risk of bleeding is, and that depends on your sport. And do most endurance athletes have lower risk factors, probably, I mean, generally speaking. Most of them do, you know, and if we, there's a scoring system that we use called Chads Vask, don't worry about the details of that, that help you define that risk. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of elite athletes in that's the populations that develop that scoring system. So, I don't know how perfect it is for a competitive athlete, but for a middle aged athlete under the age of 65 with no other risk factors, no hypertension, no diabetes, no other heart diseases. The risk of anticoagulation is probably greater than the risk of stroke. You know, you have to say, well, you know, look, I rather take anticoagulation than have a stroke, you know, I'm willing to accept a little bit of a risk. That's a discussion to have with your doctor. Right. I want to be mindful of your time. I know you have to leave. One quick question, life expectancy of what we would call this extreme type of endurance training. Yeah. What data is there to support or. Yeah. You know, I think that as you get out to the extremes of age, most things start to fall apart. You know, so I think that what enables somebody to sustain extraordinary exercise at the edges of lifespan. So, after let's say 85, for example, the extreme old is really joints and muscles. It's nothing to do with the cardiovascular system. So, you need to be able to run, you know, that those durations or without injury require some unique genetic predisposition. So, I don't think that anyone should be an extreme athlete because they hope that it will make them live longer. I think that would be presumptuous. Regardless of whether there's, you know, a small study here or a small study there, I don't think it increases the risk. You know, there was this, the Danish Copenhagen Heart Study, which frankly should never have been published as ridiculous, which looked at runners who did a lot of running. This one that generated a lot of press, but people who did a lot of running had an increased risk of death. How do they know that? They were two deaths. What did they die of? I have no idea. Maybe they could hit by a car while they were running. You know, and the confidence limits on that point estimate were so big as to be useless. I think that was a terrible study. And in fact, we have, we presented it at the American Heart Association a few years ago. We looked at the, again, the Cooper Clinic database. We looked at more than 10,000 metmen at so a week. This was stimulated by anti-burphate, by the way, who asked us this question. What about, you know, you say only eight hours a week. That's nothing for many of my runners. All right, so okay, these are our guys average 30 hours a week. And there was no increase in mortality, there was no increase in events. The number of cars, it wasn't a lot of people. Twice the number in the Copenhagen Heart Study, by the way. You know, I'm any cardiovascular deaths, zero. So, so I, I, I, I would not, I would not say I'm worried that my extreme athletes are going to take my life. I don't think that there's the evidence is strong in that regard. I don't think there's evidence that it will prolong your life. And you have to, as you start to get to hold your an older, you really, it's health span, not life span that matters the most. Thank you so much, Dr. Levine. I mean, this has been incredibly informative. I have so many more questions that I would like to ask you, maybe we can do it around two sometime. And thank you again for all your research, all your contributions. I mean, just moving the field forward, not understanding of how physical activity affects, you know, cardiovascular adaptations and how that does improve our health span and to some degree our life span. So, what's asking my pleasure, thank you, Ronda, for your, wonderful, your homework that you do prior to these interviews. It's really quite impressive. And, you know, your podcast is high quality and reaches a lot of people. So, thank you for inviting me. Thank you. Thank you.

Hi, everyone. I'm sitting here with Dr. Bill Harris, who is a professor at the Sanford School of Medicine at the University of South Dakota. He is the founder of Omega Quant, a company we will discuss in detail in a little bit, and he's also recently started the fatty acid research Institute, which aims to understand the health effects of various fatty acids, including the Omega-3 fatty acids, which is why I'm pretty excited to be sitting here with Dr. Harris. He has spent the last 40 years researching fatty acids and in particular Omega-3, he has over 300 publications on fatty fatty acids, and many of them, including Omega-3 fatty acids, most of them. Today, we're going to talk about a lot about Omega-3, and most people that have listened to the podcast or watch the podcast know that I'm a bit of a Omega-3 enthusiast, so you can imagine I'm very excited to have this conversation today. We're going to talk about generalized Omega-3s, what they are, the effects on cardiovascular health, and all cause mortality, perhaps on the brain as well. Lots of stuff to look forward to here, but I kind of want to just start with an opening question about, you know, you started studying Omega-3 fatty acids four decades ago, and here you are today, still doing it, but what sparked your interest 40 years ago? I mean today Omega-3 is like one of the top five research, you know, nutritional suitable, I guess, you wouldn't call it back. But 40 years ago? What was it going on? Yeah! I was told to do it. I started at, I got my PhD in nutrition in 78 University of Minnesota, and then I started a postdoc in Portland, Oregon, with Dr. Bill Conner, and Bill was really interested, very much interested in how dietary fat affects cholesterol. That in the late 70s, that was a big deal. And we all knew that vegetable oils, lowered cholesterol levels, and animal fat, saturated fats raised cholesterol. But we really didn't know why, and we didn't know if it was the animal versus the plant, origin of the oil, or was it the chemical makeup of the oil, the liquid-room temperature, solid-room temperature? What's the? So, Bill had this bright idea. We knew nothing about Dr. Diaburgin bang and Eskimo was at this point. I mean, just hadn't shown up on our radar. They had published their stuff. I just didn't know about it. So, Bill was this interest from a cholesterol point of view. Well, here's fish oil, it's from an animal, but it's liquid. So, it's got this kind of cuts across. And so, we'll see what high-fifthesial diet does to cholesterol levels. So, he assigned me to design a metabolic-word feeding study where we had three groups, you know, saturated fat, control polyunsaturated fat, and fish oil. And that's when we were doing our very high dose, you know, drink a half a cup of salmon oil every day for volunteers. So, that was the idea. He said, he wanted to know if it how it affected cholesterol, LDL cholesterol. And that's when we discovered that a lower triglycerides. Because we weren't looking for that. We were looking for cholesterol in the facts. That's why he gets started. So, the finding, so you were, so this half a cup of day, this of salmon oil. I mean, that was like 25 grams or... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was saying about 20 percent of my three. So, it's fairly low, as fish oils go, it's a fairly low omega 3 o'clock. But, you know, so we had to build this one, give it all the calories, all the fat in their diet was from salmon oil. Either three salmon stakes a day plus drink the oil, no other fat in the diet. He, I mean, he went way beyond any escamol intake of omega 3. How long was this one month? One month. So, they're reading three salmon stakes plus the... Was drinking salmon oil. Salmon oil, which is, you know, 25 or so grams and omega 4. All together, well, we've put with the steak, yeah, yeah, yeah, 25 grams. And they were doing this for a month. And no other fat sources. Just... And they were, yeah, they were, they came to the metabolic board and we're saying that. And this wasn't a, there was no dose. First one, there was like just one, one dose. And that was, that was it. We backed off a bit since then. You found it lower triglyst, was it like a robust lowering of triglyst? Well, there's... I mean, these were normal healthy volunteers, so they were average triglyst, right? Low was 100. And went all the way down to 75. But it was statistically, I mean, it's 25% reduction. But it's a clinically meaningless reduction in triglyst, right? But we just weren't expecting a lowering of triglyst, right? And then we, then we recruited hyperlipidemic people and did another study. And then we actually picked people with both, we called type 2B, which is a Fredericson type, you know, a high triglyst rise high LDL. And a group of people that had type 1, or excuse me, type 5, high hyperlipidemic, which is a very high triglyst rise. And we treated them and that's where we got, you, you know, a percent drops in triglyst rise. When the triglyst are very high, you get a big drop. Wow. And it was at the same sort of protocol where they were getting the same protocol, same thing. Right, the same same deal. And that's the paper that got in the New England Journal. So in a fateful day, May 9, 1985, three papers, back to back, New England Journal, and one of Omega 3. And that really put Omega 3 on the map. And what did you, what were your thoughts like, what were you thinking, that's a huge discovery, and this stuff is great for lowering triglyst, right, it takes a huge dose to do it. But people were very excited. And by that time, this was, again, by the mid-80s, now, and the work of the Danish investigators, Diaburring Bang, and Green and Eskimo, it was linking Omega 3 with reduced after the process. That was becoming well known then. And so we were all kind of getting on this Omega 3 bandwagon. And then the, you know, I've got a slide of a roller coaster of Omega 3 popularity over the last 40 years. And it does a lot of this, you know, everybody's excited. Things look great. Then you do five trials and none of them work and you go down. And then somebody does a new trial like reduce it and it comes back up again. So those were in the, fun beginning days when Omega 3 was very popular. And supplement manufacturers were starting to make Omega 3 and make claims that they lowered cholesterol out, because we did see a lowering cholesterol in the both vegetable oil group and the salmon oil group. And so we thought it lowered cholesterol. But actually, the trouble was it was in comparison to the saturated fat group. Or was it also that they were not eating saturated fat because you've had them on the strict diet and so taking out the saturated fat from the normal diet. Exactly. In hindsight, that's what happened. We could have fed them cardboard and given, taking the saturated fat out in the cholesterol would have gone down. So there was no active cholesterol lowering from the Omega 3s. It was just the absence of the saturated fat. I do want to talk about all the, the trial design and the, like you were saying, you know, people getting excited when we have a positive result and then in this. Before we get to all that, um, that's how it started. Just a couple more questions on this. It's just so robust. This type of, you know, design that you guys, the experimental design, like such a, it's kind of what I've always wanted to see, super high dose, you know, take away all the other stuff and just see what do these like Omega 3s do when you give them just in immense therapeutic dose. Um, did you guys look at any other like inflammatory biomarkers or any other? No, inflammation was not a topic in those days. Um, we looked platelets. Platelet aggregation was a big topic because that's what Diaburg proposed, the mechanism of cardiovascular protection was in the eskimos. They had published in 78, a paper saying EPA is what's causing the platelets to be not so sticky in the eskimos and that's why they don't have, because in those days, it was after a thrombosis was the cause. The thrombotic events were causing the heartdax. That's what it was thought and it's still true. Um, so we studied platelets. We got a hematologist on board, Scott Goodnight, and we did all kinds of platelet studies and platelet aggregation was reduced by the Omega 3. Leading time was reduced. They weren't outrageously reduced. I mean, it wasn't like dangerous, but it was like, affect them bleeding time was sort of like taking an aspirin. But it's still an, you know, it's kind of unexpected that an oil would do this. And we did have, we had one patient, one normal guy who had a very big drop and platelet count and we had to stop him from, we don't know why. And it's platelet count, not platelet aggregation. It's a different question. Um, and again, we're deflecified, you said, we're feeding 20 to 25 grams of Omega 3, which is just out of control high. There's no way you do that today. There's no need to do that today. Um, but that's where we started. I guess you. But even at that high of a dose, most people, it was, it was, it was pretty, pretty safe for the monk. Oh, yeah, for most people except for that one. Oh, yeah, they were, nobody had any problems tolerating it. Um, GI. Now is this where the origin, I mean, because you hear, for the most part, when you think about safety of Omega 3, it seems like, you know, is there an upper, tolerable intake level? I mean, people are more concerned, most concerned about the potential, um, you know, as they like to call it, quote unquote, quote blood thinning effect. And I don't know if that's accurate, but um, it's a reasonable concern. Certainly, if more it came from, I've been the history of back to the Eskimos who did have long bleeding times. And there were anecdotal stories of Eskimos, you know, bleeding to death from a nose bleed. Kind of thing. Now, is that the Omega 3s, who knows what else? I mean, it's a very different environment. Um, and we did see again, a reduction in play of that irrigation and extended bleeding time. But again, like aspirin, like nobody's that scared of aspirin to a point, ulcers, no, that's a problem. Um, but yeah, the classic belief is that there's some concern about Omega 3 and bleeding. And we've tried to rebut that many times, and I probably strived for studies looking at either past literature on this question, or we did one big study where we were doing open heart surgery on people trying to preload them with Omega 3 before open heart surgery. This was a Dr. Moza Farian's study opera opera study. And we're trying to prevent post-op A-Fib by giving them a big load of Omega 3 ahead of time. Because that was the theory at that time that we could prevent aphrofib relation in people by giving them Omega 3 before surgery. And well, they didn't work. They didn't make any difference. But we found that even if you give people for like three or four days, 10 grams of Omega 3 a day, but for certain before surgery, they actually, and when they checked how much bleeding came on with the surgery, how much post-op bleeding was there, it was actually less post-op bleeding with the people they got the Omega 3 than the placebo. Less need for transfusion, which was kind of cool. I mean, that that is not that we would advocate for reducing risk for bleeding, but it's not increasing risk for bleeding. Interesting. Any speculation why you think that was? I mean, we always kind of back up into this nowadays anti-inflammatory effect and how that would sort of black box because how that relates to risk for bleeding is not all clear why they would even be related. But so we don't really know why, but we do know that there's the concern about bleeding, even if you're taking blood thinners. There's no, even the FDA in their package insert for Lovesa and all the Omega 3s for Vassipa. There's like, there's not caused clinically significant bleeding. So the Lovesa and the Vassipa for people that aren't aware of these are prescription available types of Omega 3. There are still little differences between the two correct. Lovesa is the EPA plus the HAA F-alester Vassipa is an EPA-only F-alester. Do you know the ratio of EPA or DHA and Lovesa? It's about two parts EPA to one part DHA, roughly. Or three to two? So that's interesting to know that the FDA doesn't says that it doesn't increase the bleeding risk because I know of several physicians and I think it's pretty standard. Practice now that when they prescribe a patient and anti-quag, something that's going to be a blood thinner as they call it, they say not to take yeah and the FDA says if you're on blood thinners, you should be monitored. Well, you monitor them anyway. And you're going to take Omega 3 and you should be monitored. Well, okay, there are already being monitored. So there's no, there really isn't any serious significant increased risk as they say, clinically significant bleeding. You might cut yourself shaving and bleed longer than you used to, but is that are you now becoming normal? And you were abnormally, I mean, it's it's it's interesting. I just a little anecdote Mike, my son was is a doctor. He was stationed in an Air Force Base in Japan and and a one of the soul to one of the airmen on the base had a traffic accident, bad one, and they had to transport the kid to a Japanese hospital for orthopedic surgery. And after the surgery he threw a blood clot to his lung. And so gotten the gave said that they was the unheppocrine. I mean, normally we put him on heparin if you're going to do major surgery to prevent blood clots and we never put people on heparin. Japanese don't. Because maybe they're already anti-quagulated enough with the Omega 3, they don't need to do this. So it was a surprise. It makes me think that when we say you're prolonging the bleeding time, maybe you're moving it toward normal or optimal and what's normal in America, it's like a normal cholesterol. You know what he wants to have a normal cholesterol. Maybe you don't want to have a normal bleeding time either. Very good. I agree. I think very interesting point and I'm sure you're aware of this, but there have been some studies on Omega 3 playing a preventative role in pulmonary embolisms. So actually, so that would play that role to suggest that they're beneficial in that regard. Yeah. So maybe we could take just a step back for a moment and because Omega 3 fatty acids is three of them and most the time I'm focused when I think about my enthusiasm for Omega 3, I think about the marine sources of EPA and DHA, but there's another source, I all like. Do you mind just spending just a brief moment kind of? Sure. Yeah. So we generally put them in two camps. There's the plant based Omega 3's and then the fish, seafood based Omega 3, and alpha-little-enic acid, ALA, the 18 carbon Omega 3, 18 carbon's long, Omega 3, compared to the 20 or 22 carbon-blong, marino Omega 3, ZPA and DHA. And they are all in the same chemical family, as you say. The classified as Omega 3 is because they have a certain chemical structure, but they are not, it's like, you know, 34th cousins that they're in my view, that ALA has not got the cardiovascular protective benefits of EPA and DHA. I mean, there's some studies that have shown some benefit and it's good. I'm all for it, but people very often confuse those two sources. They think, the list good sources of Omega 3, they'll say salmon and sardines, and they'll say chia seeds and black walnuts and just throw it all in the together in this very misleading, because the plant based Omega 3's are not nearly as potent as the marino Omega 3's. So the plant Omega 3's ALA get, ALA gets converted into EPA in the body, correct? Can be yes. It can be. And this is one reason why I as since when you look at the essential fatty acids, you see ALA on there and not EPA and DHA, correct? Correct. Which irritates me, but you're alone. And so, you know, is there any, we can talk about also like the conversion of ALA into EPA and DHA's, there's huge inter-individual variation in terms of like how well people can be. How well people can be. Huge might be a strong word for it. There is certainly inter-individual, but there's not like some people convert one to one and other people are, you know, one tenth of a percent. It's not that. I think it's, you know, in the neighborhood, it's neighborhood two, three, four, five percent, you know, of ALA going to EPA. ALA going to DHA is less, I mean, for the EPA that's produced doesn't go on DHA. So, it's not a good source of DHA for sure. Do you think there's, does the literature suggest there's any benefit of ALA that can be separated from its, you know, ability to be converted into DHA? It could be. And there's, there's some studies that could be interpreted that way. And there's certainly our, I mean ALA can be converted by, we'll talk about later into a variety of what they call oxylippons. These are oxygenated fatty acids, prostate glands of the most common ones you think of. Those are 20 carbon fatty acids, but there are metabolites of ALA that are made via these enzymes that we don't know what they do, but they're there, they're made for a purpose. So, there may be benefits that come from them as well, independent of a conversion. So, that's, I think, future research to figure that out. What do you think the best source of the omega 3s would be for someone who is a vegetarian or a vegan? Vegetarian or vegan would be an algeo oil. So, the original, the original source of EPA and DHA in a fish is not that they make omega 3, they don't really make omega 3 any better than we do or make EPA and DHA. They eat preformed EPA and DHA. And it comes from their food sources, in which at the bottom of the food chain is these micro single-celled micro algae. And then, I'm not talking about seaweed, these little organisms that convert sunlight into fatty acids, some of which are omega 3. And so, different companies have identified which strains specific strains of algae, micro algae will make DHA or EPA or both. And they've commercialized or industrialized it and they harvest you. Well, it's an expensive process at this point. I think the more, what's exciting is that there's, I mean, if we can get over the GMO issue, there's a whole other question, but there are two or three groups that have found ways to put genes into plant or land plant and plants. That can be grown, you know, as long as you've got ground, you can grow them. Camelina is one, even soybean oil, which starts with ALI. You can get up to a fair amount of DHA EPA and DHA with genetic engineering of these plants. So, someday, we could be at the point if we will accept the GMO produced omega 3 and not be worried about it. It sounds more sustainable. It totally sustainable. You don't have to kill any fish to get omega 3s out. And that's, I think, in the future. We're doing it now with the micro algae, but that takes huge huge vats and lots of processing after the algae are grown. But if we could do it with something on scale, soy bean oil, God knows. That's very exciting because it's an important question that many people are asking, you know, the taking of the fish oil and get to, you know, supplementing with the fish oil, but how it's, you know, it's not sustainable and, you know, people are concerned. And I think, rightly so. Right, Lisa. I mean, sure. If you really, if we really attended to the recommendations that everybody gets, say, 500 milligrams a day, there's not enough fish in the ocean to do it. And the agriculture is not going to do it. So there has to be a new source of it. And there will be demand will drive it. And hopefully, we'll, again, you know, where they can turn about it being a GMO product. Right. I mean, I'm certainly not concerned about it. Give me both. What is to this? I want to discuss a seminal paper. What I think is a seminal paper of yours that you published back in 2004. You co-published with Dr. Von Shackie about the Omega-3 index and the Omega-3 index being an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Right. Can you explain to people what the Omega-3 index is and let's get into why you thought and think it's a risk factor for cardiovascular disease? Yeah, it's great. Just a little background on how Dr. Von Shackie and I came up with this idea is we were together in 2002 at in Chicago in American Heart Association meeting. And Dr. Christine Albert from Harvard had just presented her study where she'd looked at blood Omega-3 levels in the physician's health study. And they had stored blood from when they recruited the men into this physician's health study. It was an observational study and they had frozen blood samples. And they, after 17 years, they looked back and saw that they had a certain number of sudden cardiac death events in the physician's health study. And so the theory had already been out there from 10 years earlier that a high Omega-3 would protect against sudden cardiac arrests. This from animal studies and some human stuff. So physicians' health studies said, well, let's go look at the blood that's in the freezer of these guys who died of sudden cardiac arrest and compare to some controls who didn't die, just case control study. And they analyzed the blood and they found that those men who had the highest Omega-3 levels at baseline when they started were like 90% less likely to be a case experienced sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. So Clemens and I were sitting after this talk have an beer talking about it. And we said, look, this is, you know, Omega-3 level in the blood means something. I mean, it really does predict, I mean, this is second study that's shown it. But this is the first one that had been prospecting. It really is just like a risk factor, like cholesterol. And except this is one that you could modify, easily, and without taking drugs, without going on extreme diets, without having to change your lifestyle completely. You can just eat more fish or take supplements and you can raise your Omega-3 levels and reduce risk. So he said, we said, there ought to be a doctor's ought to be able to know their patients Omega-3 level. So they can do something about it. If you don't measure, you can't control it, right? Managing. So we kind of said, well, we ought to make up a task. We had both, we both had laboratories, so we could say, well, we can do this. So ultimately, we over the next two years wrote this paper, brought the evidence together and explained why we think, and what we thought a target Omega-3 level ought to be. And we called it the Omega-3 index. We didn't really know what to call it. We didn't want to call it red blood cell on EPA plus the HHS too much. And we picked red blood cells because that had been used in past studies. And it makes sense because it's a long-term marker of Omega-3 status. Because the Omega-3s are in the membrane of the red cell and in most other tissues and the by all other tissues. So it was a good reflection of other tissues. And so we again wrote this paper published it in Provene, Medicine in 2004 and said, here's the Omega-3 index. There ought to be people want to start looking at this like a risk factor. And that's kind of what's happened. It's slowly. I mean, this is now what? 17 years later, it's not, it's certainly recognized by the American Heart Association or the NIH or anybody as a official risk factor. But I hopefully someday it will be. And the same sense that CRP took a long time to be kind of considered a risk factor. Omega-3, I think, definitely deserves a full variety of not just heart disease for variety of reasons. But that was the genesis of it. He started a laboratory in Munich called Omega Metrics. It's still going, and we started a laboratory in the US called Omega Quant. We use identical methods. So this is a big problem with the diagnostic field. What's the method you're using? Because you get a different answer for different methods. So that's a problem. Standardizing it's a problem. But he and I both started doing studies independently of each other exploring the Omega-3 index as a risk factor. And I think the evidence is growing quite well. What's the biggest difference between measuring EPA and DHA in red blood cells? The Omega-3 index versus, you mentioned there, you know, there are the membranes of the salal, which is indicative of many things. And it's also a long term. But most of the time, if people are going to go get Omega-3, most people don't ever get term. Omega-3 is very rare. But if they do, they often get plasma. Omega-3, your phospholipid. Omega-3. What are your thoughts on the differences there? There are differences. First of all, in plasma, of course, there are lipoproteins. All the lipids in plasma are in lipoproteins. And lipoproteins have a membrane. And that membrane has got fatty acids in it. Lipoproteins also contain triglycerides and cholesterol esters, which also have fatty acids. That's different patterns of fatty acids. So the plasma has a omega-3, and you can express the plasma omega-3 content as a percent of total plasma fatty acids. It's just that the number you get, like a normal might be 2% for plasma EPA-DHA, whereas for red blood cell EPA-DHA, which is just the red cell membrane, it might be 5 or 6%. It would be normal. So numerically, the values are different. They correlate pretty well. So if you just, if you put a monon x, y, graph, the plasma level and the red cell level, you get a pretty good correlation. But what's confusing about is the numbers different. It's like saying you're, if you don't have the same units, you don't have the same, you don't really know how to set a target. If people are talking about different numbers, in different lipoproteins. One problem that I have with the plasma is it's more noisy. They today, it varies, because especially if you're in a non-fasting state, if you just eat, you've got now triglycerides with fatty acids coming into the blood, changing the denominator, because it's a percent of total fatty acid. And if you're just had a big meal, that's going to change your plasma percent EPA, where I want to affect your red blood cell. So red blood cell is very much like the hemoglobin A1C relative to a plasma glucose. It's the same concept. It's a more stable long-term marker. It's not affected by daily fluctuations, whereas plasma levels are. So that's one thing I don't like about plasma. Plus, very few studies have really used plasma. It's hard to know what target will make a three-level would be in plasma. Do you think the omega-3 index is indicative of EPA and DHA levels in every different organ, including the brain, or is there some? Well, you hit it. Almost every organ, probably but the brain. The brain is, there's this blood brain barrier, of course, which is very careful to take in what it wants. Brain is got a huge amount of DHA. Almost no EPA. In brain tissue, I mean, obviously, in the blood flowing through the brain, it's there, but yeah, the correlation between the red blood cell and brain tissue is not nearly as good in brain as it is in heart-liver muscle. Every other internal organ where the red cell does reflect much better. New merically, maybe a different value for red cell versus liver, but the correlation would be very good. Higher the omega-3 in the blood cell, the higher the level of the liver. But it may not be the same number, the same percent. Do you think the red blood cell omega-3, the omega-3 index is better? Indicator of brain than plasma? I think I- Well, probably, yeah, probably better than plasma. But, and I think you just have to part of the brain just turns over so slow. Red cell's turned over in 120 days. Brains, I don't know if I've got my head, how fast brain cells turn over and are recent the size. But I suspect it's quite a bit longer. Turn over times, one longer. So you've measured omega-3 in many, many people through publications and omega-quant, which people can then go and get through omega-2 index. Quantified, do you see, are there like huge variations in people that are given or have the relative average amount of dietary and take of omega-3 similar? Do you see that there are still variations in the omega-3 index? Yeah, and this is something we don't understand yet. There is quite a bit of background variability and I always say genetic, you know, what else are you going to say? Even though we know that there's, we have not discovered, we scientific group have not discovered any genes that really controlled EPA-DHA levels. Well, the standard fatty acid desaturates, the fads gene, and very little effect. Mutations in that gene have very little effect on omega-2. They affect omega-6, or a rackadonic acid levels, pretty substantially. Those mutations in fatty acid desaturates. But they don't affect omega-3's very much at all. Two or three percent variability explained. Like that. So we don't know what it is. It probably an even bigger variability is the variability in response to taking omega-3. So we look at the delta, the change in omega-3 index, at different, different dosage groups, and they can be, you know, on average is a very nice to hire the dose to hire the omega-3 index. But if you look at the individual, display across those increments. Some people on the set, on of 1800 milligrams of EPA-DHA, they'll make three and next to four to 4.3. Others might go up from 4 to 8. It's huge, variability. And we don't think it's compliance all the time. I think there's some actual, there's a lot of, a lot of land to cover between your mouth and your blood. Yes. So there is, and I'm going to look this up after this conversation because I don't remember the gene. But there has been one identified where there are SNPs in that gene, and it does play a role in the response to supplementation of omega-3. And it's, it's, it's a, you know, it's a little familiar. But anyway, I will, and I will, yeah, I'll get back to you. What in the show notes? But I will text it to you too, because, yeah, some people, and I gosh, I wish I had looked this up before for the conversation. But yes, the, some people actually may require a much larger dose of omega-3. And it's really interesting because it comes back to that. And I, and I did want to, you know, talk about this. I don't want to go off in this tangent right now. But the trial design, and, you know, when you're doing clinical studies in nutrition, as you know, more than anyone, it's very complicated. It's not like a pharmaceutical, you know, the gold standard being a randomized controlled trial, which is great for pharmaceuticals, because nobody has that, at any level of the pharmaceutical and their bloodstream before they start the trial. Right. Everyone has the same baseline. And for the most part, I mean, there are some SNPs in some of the, you know, zinobiotic metabolism, you know, genes, liver, and things like that. But, but you don't have as, you know, wide variation, like you do with nutrition, where, you know, thought is that people have sort of, you know, depending on where they come from, their ancestors, you know, they make all sorts of all sorts of, you know, adapt to that region. But anyways, you know, so in an ideal world for every randomized controlled trial you do, you obviously need to measure something like the omega-3 index at baseline and, you know, after treatment and throughout perhaps, but also measuring the SNPs and looking at that, and including that, that would be something. That would be great. And I thought you were going to say, you know, measure omega-3 before baseline, and you have to meet B below a certain level to get into the trial. Well, that would be another thing is also just, you know, analyzing the data for all that, like, you know, people that are low, you're probably going to, like you mentioned with the hyperlipidemia effects much more robust when they had hyperlipidemia versus someone that was like the normal. Right. Right. And we're seeing more studies now where they, they are do a randomized trial with omega-3, and they at the end of the day, you do what you normally do, you compare the effects seen in the placebo group on whatever endpoint, death, Alzheimer's, whatever disease. And you make a free group, you pair. And you get a P die. And sometimes you don't get a very strong effect. And until you look at the achieved omega-3 index and say, okay, those people that achieved and this omega-3 index are one group, how do they respond? These people, mostly in the placebo group, but not always, never got that high. What was their response? So in other words, your outcome is based not on your assignment of groups, but on to, you'll make a free level achieved. And then you can really see much more clearly. Oh, the people they got a high level, they did much better. And mostly it's people who are in the supplementary group, of course. But there are some people in the supplementary group who don't get a change at all. And they're, by that analysis, they're in this control group because they didn't change. And they're outcome didn't change. And that's the best way to look at those kind of trials. And that would be the easiest, actually. When you even have to look at this nips because you have this quantifier of omega-3 level. And obviously, for whatever reason, for people not responding, there's non-responders. Whatever it is. You know, for whatever reason. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it's important to type-trade the omega-3. Any given patient, just don't ask him how much fish they can call it good. I know we're going on a tangent here, but is there, have you, is there a way you can sort of talk to these deleted researchers that are running these huge clinical trials? We'll talk about the vital, the reduced it's drink. And say, like, set up some kind of way for them to use omega-1 and measure the omega-3 index because this sounds like to me, you know, there's such heterogeneity in the research. And your thoughts, why do you think there's such heterogeneity? Well, I mean, if we're talking about cardiovascular randomized trials with omega-3, that's where the heterogeneity is you're talking about. Yeah, there's a lot of reasons why maybe over the last 10 years studies have not shown them. Some studies are not shown. In fact, partly it's low dose, partly it's background of omega-3 levels or higher in the population and they haven't been told for that. Partly it's short-term treatment. To me, it's silly to think you can take somebody who's 65 years old and has had a crappy diet or whole life and put them in a omega-3 trial. Given 840 milligrams of omega-3, like one capsule of Lovesa and expect in three years to see a difference in cardiovascular response. I mean, it's just ridiculous. So that's probably why the dose studies will talk about high dose has been effective because you can at least hit them with a bigger hammer. But a lot of these studies, plus the other thing that's happened is a background risk for heart disease is going down and it's just continuing to drop. We're way below what 1950s heart disease race. Now we're like a third of people die of heart disease now instead of half. And so the incidence of heart disease is down. We're at we have much more powerful medications that are widely used and some of these most of these trials had those background medication. So a lot of reasons why these early studies in the 90s, early 2000s may have worked and they're not working now when the same dose is used. So that is a problem. But I think if we would, and to your point about measuring omega-3 in the trial, both strength and reduces dead. We did the denhouses for strength. It'll make a quant. Another lab did it in reducing. And I don't know if you want me to do it too far to reduce it. But the most successful omega-3 trial in years was reduced at the four grams of EPA. And they reported that the most striking, the only risk factor they could measure or thing in the blood that they measured that would predict outcomes. It was better than cholesterol, better than triglystriides was the omega-3 level. It was the omega-3 level achieved that was the strongest predictor of benefit in the reduced trial, which makes perfect sense. So they're starting to move that way. So the reduced at trial, yeah, we can talk in a little bit, let's get into the cardiovascular and... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, the reduced at trial you said it was four grams of EPA, so they were using the Zepa, the Zepa, the Zepa, and is this, is it the trial where there was like a 25% reduction in mortality, cardiovascular related mortality. Cardiovascular events were counted, right? And was that correlated with the actual omega-3 index, was that just the... What's correlated? That was the standard approach. We'll see both versus active. Okay. They saw that difference. Did they do any sub-analysis with the omega-3 index? Well, with omega-3 levels, yeah, they measured omega-3 concentrations in the blood, not percent count, but micrograms per mill. There's another confusion here. Well, okay, your EPA is 10 micrograms per mill. Well, how is that to play related omega-3 in you? We know how it relates, but it's confusing for the medical world when you've got multiple metrics for omega-3 that have different units that being the case in, in reduce it when they did look at their plasma EPA concentrations at the end of the study. People that had the highest, the biggest change in EPA levels in the blood had the greatest benefits compared to those had minimal change. And to your point about how trial design, you want to go there again, difference from drugs, not only do you not, when you do a drug trial, you don't have the drug in the blood in the control group. And if it's experimental drugs, they can't even go to the drug store and get it cheat. But with omega-3, if you're assigned to placebo, all you got to do is bite into one pill, and you know you're on the placebo. I mean, you have to five-year trial, right? It's going to be very clear that this is not official. And if you already believe that official oil is good, and you've seen that now you're going to be five years on an placebo in this trial, you might want to go down to your local drug store and pick out a bottle of fish oil and just take it and don't tell anybody. Or what the very least, you could be efficient take or start your eating more fish, right? Exactly. But if you measure blood levels, you'll find that person. They're now in the treated group. You know, you don't measure blood levels, you have no idea. Exactly. So, anyway, nutrition research is tough. But omega-3 is probably the easiest, one of the easiest nutrients to study like a drug of all the nutrients, because our background intake is so little. And there's so little metabolism in vivo, metabolism of omega-3. It's not controlled like calcium levels are controlled. And so tightly, magnesium levels in the blood are controlled tightly. Lucosis is pretty tightly controlled. I mean, but omega-3 is not very tightly controlled, driven by diet. How much do you eat? So, it's the reason that omega-3 has been probably like the fifth most studied molecule in medicine is because it's been easy to study in the drug model. Right. Plus it works. So, you said something that kind of peaked my interest about it, not being tightly regulated it because it's controlled by your diet. Is there like an upper level to the omega-3? And next, can you saturate that? Like if you think so? Nothing but fish. Yeah, well, 25 grams a day. Which way? In that study, we don't know what the red cell was. We did measure them. He just did plasma. But yeah, in our experience, it'll make it quiet. And we're looking at thousands of dried blood spot tests for omega-3. Getting up above more than 15-16%. So, context, right. average-Americans are roughly 5% omega-3 index, which is EPA and DHA in red cells as a percent of the total fatty acids in the red cells. So, 5% of the fatty acids in the red cell membrane EPA and DHA. Japan is on average 9% 8.9% percent. Say, eat so much more omega-3 than we do. Vegans are down around 3.5%. As our US military personnel, I'm sorry to say, when we studied the soldiers, that's about the same as a vegan. And you know they're not vegans. So, they're not getting enough omega-3. So, 4% we like to say, be over 8% that's the goal. That's been our target. So, you can get up to about 15 or 16%. We have seen two or three people out of hundreds of thousands that are over 20%. Wow, which is weird. But that's, I mean, a dolphin here at SeaWorld, which we studied. And that's all they eat is fish. And they're way about 200 kilograms. I mean, they're big mammals like us. And they're all they eat is fish. And they're omega-3 indexes around 18 or 19%. So, that's, I think that's a bad as all that you can get into a cell membrane. It's only so much- the body will only let you put so much, because when grids cells are made, they're made to be able to perform a function. And the fluidity, the membrane is very important. And I'm somehow or another, bone marrow knows how much polyensaturated fact can go into that membrane. And it's enough. And is there a difference between the amount of DHA versus EPA? I've always thought of, you know, DHA playing a more prominent role in membrane fluidity, you know, the, it's certainly, they're in a higher amount. DHA is always there in like four times the amount of EPA. I mean, unless you're just taking to EPA, then no one to one roughly. But in normal, the normal situation, there's a lot more DHA than EPA. It was just, I mean, one is more important than the other. It's just what it is. And the, when you take fish or all supplements, both EPA and DHA will go up. We need fish, both of them will go up. But typically, in, in red cells, and I don't think, I think, almost every other cell. I can't think of another cell type that's where EPA predominates over DHA. But still that doesn't say anything about the importance of them in biology. Right. Just what's in membrane. So you mentioned that target omega-3 index being around 8%. And let's talk about why that is. So I've, I had my omega-3 index measured. I was telling you earlier. It was 11.7. And it said, I did it through wellness effects. And, and they, it says RBC, omega-3 index, I can't get it that. So I'm assuming it, it may have been, may have been, may have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. May have been. This was, I literally, like, a week before everything shut down. Because in pandemic and 2020 I had done this huge performance tests. Right all these things measured and I get the megfiendics of one of them. So, sorry, I'm up there with Japanese. Oh, my, how much omega-3 do we? Well, I eat salmon. I would say at least you know, two to three three times a week. I also eat sardines. So it's like an oven. That's a big one. Yes. And then I take a lot of fish oil. I take about two grams of EPA in the morning and two grams of DHA in the evening for a total of four grams. Separately. I take them separately. Yeah. You know, I... And where do you get pure EPA? A friend of mine. He is in Norway and he makes... Okay. It's pretty... Okay. It's not getting a subscription for VICEY, but... No. No. Although I'm interested in doing that for my mother. Because I've been giving her a mine. And I'd like to keep mine in. Get your hearts out of this. But anyways. Anyway. The Omega-3 Index. Yeah. And the 8%. So you very recently published a study that correlated the Omega-3 Index to all cause mortality. And it's able to even predict mortality. Very interesting study. I shared it on social media, but I would love to talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. That was a... It's going to be probably one of my capstone studies, I think. In hindsight, we was a collaboration among 17 different cohorts. Like the Framingham Studies of Cohort. Women's health initiatives. They're all... And from all around the world, these are groups that have been recruited at one point in time. Blood temples taken. Fadi-assid levels measured in that blood. And then the investigators just follow this group of people over time. See what happens. What kind of diseases they get. Who dies? Who doesn't? And so we had 17 of those pool together. And around 40, 45,000 people all together. Where we had omega-3 levels at the beginning. And then roughly the total follow-up time when you're... When you're looking at risk for death, all cause mortality. You obviously look in a given window of time. If you wait long enough, it's 100%. Everybody dies. So you can't wait forever. You got to wait. So we looked... Basically between age 65 and 75. Who died in that window of time. And we found that the people there, the highest omega-3 levels, compared to the lowest were 15%. Or so less likely to die over that time. And it was a very... When you look at quintiles of omega-3, it was very... Dost-dependent. The higher the omega-3, the lower the risk. And that was for total mortality. We then looked at cardiovascular mortality. Cancer mortality. And then everything else. Kitch and sink. If it's not cancer, not cardiovascular, it's group 3. And we saw the same thing in all... It wasn't a strong and cancer. It wasn't as stair-steppy. Like it wasn't cardiovascular. But the highest group in omega-3s did have a significantly lower risk of death in cancer. But interesting to me is the non-cardiovascular, non-cancer, all these other causes of death from electrocution to suicide, to car accidents to kidney failure, you know, everything people die of. The higher the omega-3, just like cardiovascular, low risk. So there's something very systemic, very protective across many... Health systems in the body. Many diseases I think are just held somewhat in check by having a higher omega-3. It's not just heart disease. I think that's the message to get out. It's not just heart disease. Right. And this... 15% decrease in all cause mortality. Was that about a five year? Was it translated to about... We didn't. In that study, we didn't try to get out that. Because the... Well, basically, that meant in that window of time, you were 15% less likely to die. Okay. How long you actually lived? We didn't follow people till they died. It's all the time. But in another study we published from Framingham, just one cohort. We did see that there's roughly a five year difference. If you're at the very lowest omega-3 versus the highest, your odds of dying are about five years early. You say again, so the omega-3 index for the lowest... Well, that's probably under four percent. And this is for the upper level roughly seven percent. And this is... Again, this is observational in Framingham. Nobody's supplementing. So we haven't got people. Many people over eight percent. And these are people living in Boston. And so they don't have high omega-3 levels. But the highest quartile, quintile, was about over seven... Over seven percent. You said the average in the United States was about five. Five is. So five ish. And what's the average intake of fish in the United States? Fish. Well, what is the 13 pounds per person per year? And that's all fish. And it did write. So that includes, you know, shrimp, which has zero omega-3. And white fish, polyq, which is the fried fish that people get in McDonald's. Sam and itself, which is one of the highest omega-3 fish. Sort of the most... One of the highest that people actually eat. You know, that provides about one and a half grams per serving of omega-3. The average intake of what EPA and DHA in America is something in 100 to 150 milligrams a day. The median intake is zero. The average, because some people eat a lot and a whole lot of people eat none. Wow. So the median is zero, at least the two decimal places. But the average intake is 120 milligrams a day. Japan is roughly 900 milligrams a day. 900 milligrams. And for life, for minus nine months. Wow. There are... I mean, because moms do it too. And they, if I remember correctly, their average lifespan is about five years longer than the United States average. Right. Despite the fact they smoke more, despite the fact they have more hypertension. Despite the fact they have higher stress life, they still live four or five years longer. Is omega-3, is it known that if it has any effect on smoking, in terms of like negating something negative? Well, in our most recent paper in framing him, we asked the question, in general, we're trying to understand how much of a risk factor is omega-3 compared to things you already know for doubt. But so we know cholesterol is a risk factor. We know blood pressure is a risk factor. We know diabetes is having diabetes. We know being a smoker is a risk factor for bad outcomes. How does omega-3 compare that? And we found that in the study we did in framing him, looking at all cause more talented. That if you're a smoker and you have a low omega-3, you're 15 years of studying your 50-50 chance of living. You're going to die of 50 percent chance of dying. If you have a low omega-3 and your non-smoker, it's not so bad. Your risk of death may be 30 percent over day. If you're a smoker and you have a high omega-3, let's see other flips, I bet you're a smoker, your risk is kind of like having a low omega-3 being a non-smoker. And then if you're best case, you don't smoke and you have a high omega-3, your odds are dying or like 10 percent. So in a way having a low omega-3 is like being a smoker from a pretty mountain. But I don't mean to say that taking omega-3 or races your risk of being a smoker. Don't want people to think you can do that. Oh, keep smoking, I just take some fish or all this. I'm good. That's not the deal. We do notice that smoking actually lowers your omega-3 index. Smokers have lower omega-3 index than non-smokers from other studies. And it could be because of the hyperoxidative state of a smoker blood that could actually destroy omega-3's. Or they just don't eat fish or they only fish. It's the other explanation. So the general tack are both of our study in nature communications on total mortality with our 17th of works. And this latest one in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, in premium. Point to having a high omega-3 level is protective in the same sense that having a low cholesterol is protective. It's about the same productivity value. And that's about 8% of omega-3 index. Again, if it's over seven in framing him. But in the pool analysis of those 17 cohorts, it was roughly about 7.8% of the highest quintile was about roughly about the 8% target. But that our original 2004 idea that 8% would be the target, which was based on much less data. Back then, it has been vindicated. It continues to be vindicated. It's been seen that that 8%. It's not perfect. In Japan, you might actually get additional reduction in risk at 10% versus 10% percent. Okay, that's good. But we're now going from this much risk to this much risk. Yeah. Well, that was going to be my question too. What if we get up into a 10 to 12 to 13% omega index? Is that even clear? Yeah. It could be. We at omega-1, we kind of say our target level is 8 to 12. And it's not because above 12 is bad. It's because we just have so little data to know just to say that if you get to 14, you're better than you're at 12. Or even to say that you're 12, you're better than 10. You don't really know that. It's just a reasonable target level. It's safe. I'm not concerned about that. And it's tough enough for people to get up to 8. Never mind, get up to 12. And so we're not trying to say anything above 8. As far as you can go to the higher or the better, I don't know. I can't say that. I mean, there may be adverse effects that pop up somewhere out there. You would think in theory, there could be. We just haven't seen them, but that doesn't mean they're not there. So, be conservative and just. Have you looked at the correlation of the migrainex with inflammatory biomarkers? Yeah. And as you expect, again, we did this in Framingham. We looked at 10 different very different inflammatory biomarkers that in the plasma. You know, patients in Framingham and correlated it with the Omega-3 index. And all 10 of them, the higher the Omega-3, lower the market. So it's just across the board. It isn't just CRP. There's also some. Fushal IPC2. PPL, I do this one. Which is kind of inflammatory markers. We'll very different. It's a very different chemical than CRP. Some bone related inflammatory markers were reduced in association with Omega-3. So it's there. And giving Omega-3 does lower inflammatory levels. Right. So it kind of stands like people like there's the. The mechanism by which these inflammatory markers lower. I'm sorry, which Omega-3's lower the inflammatory markers. And there's a wide variety of them. So you have. You know, I for a long time, I always thought of EPA being the, you know, anti-inflammatory Omega-3, Yeah. Which isn't entirely accurate because all these metabolites of DHA and EPA are. Or anti-inflammatory. Yeah. And not just anti-inflammatory. They are pro resolving of inflammation. There we go. Yeah. Which is the flip side of, you know, you can, you can either prevent an inflammation from starting, which may not be good because inflammation at one level is important. But if you don't have the Omega-3's on board, the active process of shutting down the inflammation once it starts, that shut down is inhibited. So the inflammation stays long. So the Charles Sirhan is the guy who's discovered all of these. What he calls some specialized pro resolving mediators, which with all due respect to Charlie, I think it's a silly name. I mean, there's no molecule on the body that doesn't specialize to come on. Water specialized. So they're pro resolving mediators. They're molecules made from EPA and DHA. That. And some that are made from a rackidonic that are also. Suppressive. Blackpox and A is one from a rackidonic. So that whole field of, it isn't just that they're anti-inflammatory. They're pro suppression, pro suppressing of the inflammation. It's just the important. Right. Because as you mentioned, you're talking about you want to be able to activate your immune system when there's a pathogen, you know, that's there. But you don't want it to remain active and inspire a lot of control. But in the context of just let's say, not a pathogen. Let's talk about this low level of just chronic, you know, immune activation in this chronic, you know, inflammation. Yeah. That can be caused from a variety of lifestyle factors. Sure. It's still obesity. Exactly. Obesity. What role do these specialized pro resolving mediators, the SPMs, is they're called, and Resolvins and Protecting. It's also a race in the race in the proclacities and poxy trocons and poxy trins. There's a bunch of them now. It's actually a bewildering array of molecules that have been discovered, made from EPA and DHA, that operate on different cell types and different receptors through different mechanisms. But at the end of the day, they suppress an inflammatory response that's keeping getting out of control. So, I don't know really the answer how the presence of those resolving mediators plays into the chronic inflammation of someone who's just got a lot of adipostition. I assume it will just keep a damper on it, keep it down. Again, what we saw in Framingham was all these mediators are inversely related to Omega-3 level. And these people aren't chronicling and flamed. They're framing him, people in their 60s, so maybe they are like typical Americans. So, there's a ton of research to be, and the drug companies are very interested in taking some of these molecules that are made from Omega-3 and making them drugs. They can be used. Okay, fine. One of the reasons I'm asking is because this chronic inflammation is that the root of many different diseases, cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer. A lot of the diseases that you're measuring in the Framingham study, and also in your large 17th study cohort. And so, you know, the question is, is that, so let's talk about the cardiovascular health, for example. You know, you mentioned the reduced to trial with the high EPA, there was a dramatic lowering of triglycerides. No. No, that wasn't the reduced to trial. Didn't lower triglycerides. I mean, it was 15%. 15%. Okay, I guess that's not dramatic. But that's what a lot of people talk about when they think about cardiovascular health and Omega-3. And think about triglyceride lowering. That's the indication that the FDA gave these drugs because the only way to get these nutrients turned into drugs. And approved by the FDA as a drug is it's got to affect some risk factor that the FDA believes in. And that when it all began with low vaso they said you lower, oh, look, we can lower triglycerides by 20%. And that was enough to get them to indication for people with triglycerides over 500. That's the limitation. Only that's steep is indicated for reducing risk for cardiovascular events. It's the only one that's been shown to do that. Lovazes never been tested for lowering cardiovascular events. It's EPA plus DHA. But it's approved for triglyceride lowering. Because that's what we saw back 40 years ago. It does that, but I don't think that's the mechanism by which Omega-3 is a part of it. What do you think the mechanism? I think it much more likely to be an anti-inflammatory mechanism and anti-platelet. So thinner blood less likely to plot. We've been fascinated recently to look at what's called the RDW, the red cell distribution with. And we're just preparing a paper on this now. The red cell distribution with is just a metric that comes out whenever you do a complete blood count, a CBC on a patient. They get their hemoglobin, their hermaticrit, the mean cell volume, the red cells, and they get this thing called RDW, red cell distribution with, which is really just how varied are the red cell sizes in your blood. Ideally, red blood cell sizes should be all the same size. So the coal-fishing to variation would be very thin, very narrow. So if you divide the standard deviation by the mean, you get a coal-fishing to variation. And that's the red cell distribution with. So it's expressed as a percent. If you have a high percent distribution, you've got... It's a remarkable predictor of all kinds of adverse outcomes independent of everything else. I mean, this is last ten years. This has been discovered there. For some reason, this is how your red blood cells, the variation size your red cells is a big predictor of outcomes. Bad outcomes. If you have a lot of little cells and a lot of big cells and a wide bell curve of red cells, that is bad. You want to have a very steep, sharp distribution of red cells. And the omega... So we're interested in... Since we measured the omega 3 in red cells, you know. Maybe instead of just being a passive vehicle that's carrying omega 3s around the blood, allowing me to measure omega 3 status, maybe they're actually affecting red cell biology. Maybe they're really changing the way red cells carry oxygen. Pick up CO2, squeeze through capillars. Just, you know, red cells got a squeeze through half its diameter as it goes through a capillary. So it's got to be very flexible. And omega 3s will help make that membrane more flexible. So it could be that we're actually delivering more oxygen to tissues when you have a high omega 3. Haven't tested this this is all. I mean, I'd love to test this. So it is really very cool that... Again, we've seen that we've got a data set, 40,000 people. We've seen a very strong correlation between high omega 3 and lower healthier RDW. We're getting ready to submit that now. But the ways that omega 3s may be protective, we may have never thought of yet. Still, which makes it hard to explain to people how they work. Absolutely. It's easy to say if they lower triglycerides. It is. I get that. It is. It's so what? So many mechanisms are doing so many things. Yeah. That membrane fluidity with the red blood cell membranes itself. That's super interesting. Another thing, I'm sure you're from my with Dr. Ronald Kraus's work on small dense LDL. Particles and how those are anthropogenic. Yeah. You know, the larger a buoyant LDL seems to be more cardiovascular because it is transporting, you know, fatty acids and cholesterol. Things to solve and I miss the small dense ones that really can get stuck in arteries and start this inflammatory cascade. Well, he's also shown him in collaborator, his collaborators and colleagues that, you know, inflammation can, you know, can basically, you know, cause a larger buoyant LDL to form a small dense LDL. It's not really. The inflammation plays a role in that process. And so. Interesting. And I would love to see our guest this answers my question. You haven't looked at this yet, but the omega 3 index and small dense LDL particle. Um, we shouldn't look at that. Yeah, because. It's a bad feeling. Yeah. Awesome. I think that would be, you know, because right now, people go when they go and get their cholesterol measured. It's usually just totally LDL. Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's some good LDL. They're like, you don't want it. What is it? Good LDL or is it's not as bad LDL? The way the reason I say good is because you, you know, like when you have a damage cell, you want to repair that damage and your LDL is going to bring triglycerides in cholesterol and, you know, a flat arases and everything that cell that builds another membrane, which I mean, make a new cell. I mean, like, so it's serving a function, right? And so I guess I don't know if good is the right word to describe it, but yeah, I mean, it's got a function. Yeah. It's important for normal health. For normal health. So, so that would be very interesting to see that if there's a correlation between a migraine necks and small nonslbial, I would imagine you're going to see an inverse correlation. I think so. That's too, but obviously. And it would be great to have that sort of panel in the positions, you know, tool box, right? Really? Really? Measure the omega 3 and x. They're measuring the out of this moment so the out. You know, it's like, oh, you're a migraine necks is 3%. Well, you've got to take some fish well or. Right. And raising your omega 3 index is going to have implications all over the body. That may not be even measurable in a blood test. That are good. Good things. Right. Like this red cell biology. It behaves better. It's a more efficient mover of gases, something like that. So you also had a recent study kind of going back to the the the resolving of the inflammation. Aspect. What I think is very relevant in, you know, are are 2021 world that we live in. Forward world. Yes, the COVID world. Where we have a pathogen that is in some people causing a very bad cascade of inflammation. Right. And we published a study looking at the omega 3 index and COVID-19 associated mortality. Right. Right. We did that with colleagues here in LA. I don't know which way I'm pointing. I probably should have said pilot preprint hasn't actually the been peer review. It's not been peer review or. Oh, no, it's worth it. Helmet. Helmet. In January. It's published in January. Yeah. And it was a pilot study because we only had access to data from the 100 people. Which was too bad, but we did have omega 3 index levels and 100 people that have been admitted to see your sign. And I and I with COVID. And so we asked the question, well, you know, is there any relationship between how they did. They live or die. And they're omega 3 level. And it turned out if we look and again, the distribution of omega 3 levels was very narrow. You know, like I think I probably went from. Uh, low 3 to a high of 5. Something like that. You know, but the distribution was was narrow. So we didn't be weren't able to see, you know, all the people that had an 8% didn't really. Nobody there in the study had any percentage. So we we looked at the people who had the highest quartile of omega 3 levels. The 25% highest compared to everybody else who was lower. And those people were really half as likely you're died as people who had. But and it was 0.07 p value. So it was statistically significant by standard metrics. But in the race to understand what we can do about COVID will put up with a slightly non-significant. Strong trend in the right direction with good biology behind it to explain it. Another papers come out from children's just confirming the same thing. They saw the same thing. Okay. What about um, Japan? Do you know what they're because they're because they're omega 3 and X is higher. Yeah, I know. Do you know they're amicalli? I know a group has looked at this world wide. And they looked at. Uh, WHO data on COVID death. And they looked at reported fish intake on the countries. And they did it by six different regions around the world. And what they showed, you know, the higher the average fish intake for lower the risk of death and COVID. Okay. It's hard to. I know. So many variables. Right. Of course. But just it's it's things the right song. What that paper that specific paper was most. Most interesting to me about was not this worldwide population thing, which was just their introduction. They were doing in silico experiments. Looking at the spike protein on COVID. And they found that there's two confirmations. There's an open and closed confirmation. And if it's open, then it can interact with the receptor. Yeah. It's closed. It can't. Right. If you got hot, they found that DHA, again, in silico experiments. If it's present, we'll hold that thing in the closed position. You're kidding. No. So it will not interact with the receptor and not be taken in. I'm that's the theory. So that's a huge deal. I mean, you know the vaccines, at least the mRNA of vaccines, the Johnson and Johnson keep it in the closed transformation spike protein. They inserted a two-proning amino acids to keep it in the closed. Oh, the dye didn't know that. Yeah. So it's a it can't interact with the ACE2 receptor. Interesting. Very interesting. It's a different spike. It very important because the whole, I don't know, I'm not going to go off in this tangent, but like a lot of the, you know, terrible effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection go through ACE receptor. And because the downregulation of that receptor occurs when the spike protein binds to it, it's through and I say to it, and there's I toast this pulls it into the cell and causes downregulation, which disrupts the whole reeninantute hunts and system and lung injury. That's a mess. I mean, heart injury exactly. That's big mess. Yeah. So anyway, this is, you know, take this with the grain of salt, but because it was in in silico experiment because it also showed that. Little later, okay. That's the same thing. Oh. That's what that's what prompted them to look at DHA. Somebody also published little lake acid had the same kind of effect. Yeah, potentially, in effect. And so they look at DHA. And that's an omega 6 fatty acid for people that are not aware. It's a, this is a classical omega 6, right? So not all omega 6 are bad. Okay. Well, that is a very, I'll send you that very much. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, the fact that both DHA and Lennowag acid keep the spike protein. Yeah. So I mean, again, a completely different mechanism than presuppressing information. This would actually suppress infection. And well, not, it would also suppress, you know, negative outcomes. Yeah. It's a real outcome for the reenan and due tensed system. Like that whole thing not happening. Yeah. The bad stuff. Yeah. So very cool. Since you mentioned Lennowag acid and I kind of know, there's so many people out there. And that talk about the omega 3 to omega 6 ratio. And how I, I'll never forget, I was submitting a paper for a review on omega 3s. And I mentioned the omega 3 to omega 6 index ratio. And, you know, how it could be negative. And this was, you know, years ago. And a reviewer just ripped me to shreds. I mean, totally came down with all this evidence. Not true. Of course, you know, it blew my mind and I was like, wow, this is, seems to be, It's all out of the sphere. Yeah. But I wonder if I reviewed that thing. I don't know too many people are more. I think I do know who they're reviewer of us, but anyways, I can tell you off camera. Okay. But change my mind, basically. So, you know, the whole thought that the omega 3 to the omega 6 ratio is so important. Everyone's so concerned about eating too much omega 6, which, you know, the dietary sources, the major nit dietary sources these days are vegetable oils, refined oils, but, you know, getting them through. And then people have become scared about getting them through whole foods, like eating nuts. And you get a lot of food. It's crazy. Healthy food. Yeah. So, what do you think? What are your thoughts on this thing? Well, I agree. I mean, the ratio, I mean, the concept, well, we haven't got that much time. It makes some sense. It's just, it's very non-percise. Because when you say omega 3, you don't know what you're talking about ALA, EPA, or DHA. It could be an AM, and when you say omega 6, you don't really know where there's seven, and omega 6 fatty acids in the blood, which ones you're talking about. And so, you don't know what this ratio, it's not, you can't act upon it. Because you don't know what you're acting upon. The problem is you can have a high omega 3 intake, an a high omega 6 intake, or low omega 6, and a low omega 3, and have the same ratio. So, that doesn't help. Because the problem is that you can fix a bad ratio by taking more omega 3. And that's the right way to do it. But you cannot fix it and improve your health by leaving your omega 3 intake alone, and just lowering your omega 6. Which, that ratio tends for people tend to do that. They think, well, that's, I got a fix it. Well, the way to fix it, there's only one way to fix it. It's a good way to fix it. It's eat more EPA, DHA. That's fine. If you want to play that ratio game and fix it, that way, okay. But don't take it any further than that. 100% agree with you, that's my, my thoughts is that really, it's, it's, it's the low omega 3 intake. That's proper. That's right. And that's pretty much what the reviewer was arguing for with a little bit of, well, you know, omega 6 is good. It's part of the cell membrane. Well, you need to know like, I don't know. So, some of that. But we've published two papers with this consortium of the 17 or 20 cohorts. We've had several other papers. All looking at fatty acids in some outcome. And one of them looked at little lake acid levels in the blood. And cardiovascular outcomes. And found that the higher the little lake acid, the lower the risk for cardiovascular conditions. And another paper looked at little lake acid levels and risk for developing diabetes. Higher omega 3, excuse me, higher omega 6, little lake, lower risk for developing diabetes. So, when you, when you look at that kind of data, when you're talking about a biomarker, it's not a dietary intake questionnaire thing. That everybody questions. We're going to do a biomarker of omega 6 intake, little lake acid. You can't make it. And higher levels are associated with lower cardiovascular and diabetic risk. It's hard to say they're bad. Right. You could turn that around and say lowering your levels a little lake is going to increase your risk for after all, scrosis and. I think those, these were a couple of the studies that the reviewer used as an argument against, you know, like they're not. Yeah. So, people love black hats and white hats though. Right. And it just feels good to have a, I hate this when I love this one. You can't love both of them somehow or another. It's somehow, I like omega 6 and omega 3. And that's pure. We can't do that. You got to hate one of them. Right. I don't. So, we do have a little bit more time. So, there's a few more things that I would, I would kind of love to get your thoughts on. Sure. One is a question. A lot of people will ask me or email me about. And it is about this 2013 paper that was published by. Yeah. Brad's Gate. Yeah. Brad's Gate. Yes. And he looked at blood omega 3 levels. I don't know if it was platinum. Plasma was full of it. Yeah. Omega 3 and the incidence of prostate cancer in a trial of people. It was called the select trial where people were given. High dose, off of the cough or all, and go to the lanyone. Millennium. Right. And he founded a correlation between the plasma phospholipid omega 3 and prostate cancer. And it was statistically significant. Yes. It was the range of high to low omega 3 was like this. Like 4.6 percent versus 4.2 percent. Something like that. It's very, very, very narrow. Very small, which makes it go well. That doesn't make any sense. Plus, I mean, my biggest, I don't criticize the results so much as the discussion in that paper. Because they said, therefore, air go, taking fish oil or eating high omega 3 fish is going to cause prostate cancer. They turned to an association into a cause infect. And that study, you weren't allowed to be on an omega 3 supplement. Nobody in that study was on an omega 3. Since so they, these guys already had a bent that they didn't, they wanted to show something bad about it. Supplements in general. Omega 3 happened to be supplemented to your work. And so they're discussion and what they said on TV and what they said on other interviews was what went way beyond the data. The data itself have not been confirmed. They've been refuted by other studies. Those studies don't get any press, of course. And you're left with this weird thing hanging out from now eight years ago. That still pops up that hopefully this podcast will not cause somebody to go look at. Because if you do look at it, realize that the levels of omega 3 are very tiny. Plus, I mean, we, we submitted a letter to the editor about that. Me and Michael Davidson. And one of the things we pointed out was there's evidence that in, in, some cancer cells, they can actually upregulate fads, activity. And you might actually be making some more omega 3 because you got cancer. If, I mean, that again, it's a very tiny difference in levels between those who didn't get cancer. But there are other mechanisms one, if it was even true, then that you can explain it by. And, and when you have expected it to be repeated with yet there were other studies that you mentioned that refuted that weren't. That show that actually omega 3 is more protected. A, even prostate cancer. But I don't know if you, you want to know my thoughts too on this with the fact that you're not sure. My allowed to ask her. I mean, so I, you know, the fact the trial design, the fact that these men were actually, they were given, like, it was a 400 I used of alpha to cough or all or selenium. Sure. I mean, the, the 400 I used of alpha to cough or all, my mentor Bruce Aims and his, one of his postdocs had shown that when you give, like, a high dose of alpha to cough or much, like, the RDA of it is like 25. It's 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. Something like that. Yeah. That you basically deplete another, to cough or all, gamma to cough or all, which is anti-inflammatory. And so there's this, you know, it's, it's actually not good to take meggadosis of the, the alpha to cough or all, the alpha to cough or all, homo, vitamin E. And so it's, you're looking at blood samples from a very confounded, you know, cohort. Yeah, you're assuming the sling of an alpha to cough or head and all the fact on the fake. Right. And we have no idea what could have happened, right? So I know that. That's interesting. Yeah. And then plus the, the, the lack of confirmation of that study, it's just, I kind of want to, like, you know, get this out there. I mean, this, the study, it was not believe this, so not let me know. It's, it was a sensational headline as anything that is thought to be good for you, but then is not good for you and not only not could, could be bad for you. Totally, they love you. You know, yeah, it makes, it makes the headlines. So, let, we got that tangerine. Me too. So what is your personal Omega 3 intake look like? Um, two to three grams a day from supplements. Um, and don't really have a favorite supplement. I kind of, you know, like your friend Norway. I have, people send me supplements. Oh, yeah. Try this. Um, and then salmon, I probably want to wait for sure. Try to do more, but at least once a week. Uh, so my index is around 10. Mine is, the, you know, a lab, we have high controls and low controls for our assays and so. They're always getting my blood for the high control. Um, so they want to have a 10% they want to have a 3% when we do our assays at a may quant. And so it's, it's got to, because of that, I have to keep it up. Right. So I'm pretty diligent taking my Omega 3s. Um, what are your, so we, we, we talked a lot about cardiovascular disease and some all cosmetic. Howlady, we didn't talk about all the studies. I mean, there was the, there was, there was too many, there's too many. The, the vital study. Well, I do want to get your thoughts on, you know, the, the, the strength study and, and why this was the, with the use Lavasa, what, what are the things that you just think called epinova? Epinova. And which is a, epa plus dHA same ratio is in Lavasa except they're free fatty acids, not ethylastras. So they're unistarified. Um, epa and dHA, which, which, which they had previously shown are more readily absorbed. You don't have to hydrolyce them. They're already free fatty acids. But the trouble with those is they're also pretty in, um, irritants. They're, their, GI irritants free fatty acids are. They're going to do encaps, they had to, um, interact with coat the pills. Um, so at the end, so that's fine. Um, why did strength, which was a bigger study than reduce it, but inversely the same kind of patient. High cardiovascular risk, high triglycerides, on statins. That's, everybody had to be in their 13,000 people worldwide. And, um, placebo was corn or was olive oil and strip olive oil. Um, they found no effect at all. Um, and stopped study early. It was a matter of fact, um, for futility. And it was the biggest shock to everybody in the omega-3 world that it didn't work. And nobody really has a good understanding of why. And, you know, people come up with ideas, you know, like they were healthier. Well, I mean, it was done like two years after reducing the food done. I mean, and probably recruiting out of the exact same sites as well around the world. The multiple countries are involved. Um, I don't think that makes any sense. To me, if I had to guess that there may be some chronic, I mean, your GI track is not designed to be taking in four grams of free fatty acids every day. It's just not designed for that. And there may be some that may induce some kind of chronic inflammatory response. It's going on systemically from taking these detergents. Right. Um, certainly if they don't, um, and they want to be studied like for 12 weeks and other studies. And they show they're nice absorption, lower triglycerides. They do very well. And they've had, but for four or five years of taking this every day, I bet there was some chronic. And it's like chronic inflammatory thing going on that erased any omega-3 benefit. And they didn't measure any infection. I mean, CRP even they didn't see any difference. Yeah, it's not very sensitive. Yeah, I mean, that's all they measured. So that's the only metric they have. So nobody knows. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. But that way. So they cut the officer, the study. So early, and you said they were, you know, the participants were of the same sort of health status of the doctor. But if you look at the adverse or the fatalities, there were much fewer. Is that because you stopped it early or is that why? I mean, no, no, I mean, yeah, I've got an interesting slide showing the event rate in Reduce it in the placebo group, which is like this. And the event rate in the treated group, which is lower 25% lower. And then you look at the event rate in strength. And both placebo and active were even lower than the event rates in the treated group and reduce it. So there's something, there were fewer events, a lot fewer events. And maybe nobody knows how to explain that either. And you really, theoretically, can't put these curves on the same graph. It's not the same study. But it was very close to the same study in my view. Well, the other thing is that the EPA versus the one that had EPA and DHA. And what are your thoughts? Like, you know, I hear people, I mean, you see headlines that say, oh, DHA can negate some of the positive effects of EPA in the hospital. I don't believe that. I mean, I think there's an effort by those who want to promote the EPA only product to identify DHA in any way they can, which I don't think is appropriate. And I don't think we have the evidence for it. Just because this study didn't work, doesn't mean DHA counteractivity effect of EPA. Can't draw it. You need to do a study with the AHA. That's what needs to be done. A pure DHA versus pure EPA versus maybe a combination would be optimal versus placebo. So a forearm group like vital, you know, vital it to 25,000 people. Four arms, the environment D. I love to see a vital with four arms of EPA alone, DHA alone, the combination and placebo. And see what would have. And measuring the omega 3 index. Totally. Yeah. I mean, that sounds like a trial. I think with the vital study, you know, it made headlines because the, well, it didn't work. Well, the primary outcome didn't work. The primary outcome didn't work. Did it not work in your opinion? No, it did work in my opinion. The primary outcome was with a composite of multiple different kinds of outcomes. And if you look at the individual elements, there was benefit. There was reduced to major reduction in risk of heart attack. And even in people who didn't who ate little fish or half the lower half of the fish intake, they got a significant reduction in the primary endpoint. Right. So there was, there was good outcomes in that study from taking 840 milligrams. So it's a one capsule of little days in. And that's not much. It's not much. So I think it was a positive study. Yeah. And that study itself kind of proves because it, because it was LeBase, I, which is the EPAHA combo that DHA campy negating. Because. I suppose the other side can say well, it's, yeah, it would have been much better for a system. Right. It's the four grams of what was important with reducing four grams of days, which is five times higher than anybody's ever used before. And that, that showed benefit. And I think everybody said, oh, okay, that makes sense. You know, we got a high dose finding. Now we see some serious benefits of omega-3. I just wish that strength had turned out with same dose for grams of the EPA-plus DHA. I wish to turn out, but it didn't. So you know, you take a big risk in these trials. Right. And you kind of just mentioned what your ideal trial would be with the DHA, the combination of the combination of the. I'd love to. And who's going to fund that? I don't know. Well, any other, any other clinical trial designs that if people are listening, scientists or. Well, I mean, the, the, the, the, the fundamental thing to do is something you mentioned earlier is to, is to measure omega-3 levels. At, at BASELINE are normally allow people in who've got a below normal. And if you're going to have a high dose of omega-3, then you're going to have a high dose of omega-3. And it's not going to potentially not going to help. It's like recruiting people who are statin trial when their cholesterol's, you know, 100. It's silly. There's nowhere to go. So I think that would be, that's one of the main things to do. And then of course to follow it up with an analysis based on blood levels of chief, instead of just by. Rupert sign. Yeah. Are there any other areas of omega-3 research like maybe sports medicine, joint health, the brain, that? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We still have a little bit of time. We do. We do. Well, brain, we're, we're working on a, on a paper right now again from one of our cohorts. Looking at, you know, omega-3 index predicting risk for Alzheimer's. And dementia. And it does. It's just nice. But it's, that's kind of what's you'd expect. We're looking for an interaction with apo-ege for genotype and not quite there. I think probably sample size is not, but it didn't. Generally, I mean, if we control for apo-e levels, we find a still have a significant benefit of higher omega-3. We control for it. But if we stratify by apo-e-4, non- apo-e-4. It looks like the benefit is little better. The curve is steeper. The relationship is stronger in those that are at the higher risk. I, you have the e-4. Then those have low risk. But I think because our sample size is too small at this point, you can't get a official interaction. I mean, value. So, so that it's actually, the preventative power is better in people who are sicker. And who are higher risk? Right, higher risk. Which is kind of what you feel. And this is a great work because a lot of the omega-3 brain or dementia are also which is these research has always been fixing someone already. Has it trying to improve memory? Very hard to do. Very hard to do. Very hard to do. Yeah, I mean. Which is out of the bar. It is. So, if people that do have a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, if they know that they can increase their omega-3 index by supplementing with omega-3, and or increasing their fatty fish, like salmon or sardines that have high omega-3 in it, to prevent and stay off dementia. I mean, that would be, it's very important. And it's like low hanging fruits. It's a very safe way to help reduce risk. Put it off for X years. I don't know how many years you may be putting off dementia. We'd like to try and figure that out. Since we're talking about the brain, I mean, another area that I am very interested in, much like your daughter who is also a PhD, which is also a registered dietitian as well. I'm just going to introduce Dr. Christine Jackson. Is the role of omega-3 in development. And, you know, you guys that omega-1 are doing some really interesting, getting gathering some interesting data because you are looking at, and maybe you can talk about this, how you're looking at the omega-3 index in pregnant women, and lactating women. Yeah. Right. I think one of the, one of the high points in omega-3 research has been a, a cognitive report from a couple years ago, reporting that looking at 70 trials in pregnant women, given omega-3, that the giving omega-3 reduces risk for premature birth, especially early premature birth before 34 weeks. premature birth, garden varieties before 37. But the effect on reducing risk for early premature, which is the most challenging one for the baby and the mother and the NICU and the entire financial system. Reducing risk for that. In fact, in this meta analysis, Middleton was the first author on this meta analysis. They said, at this point, no more research should be done on this, the question is settled. And then, two months later, the biggest study done in the field came out negative. So, what do you, which is the orp trial from Australia. But in that trial, unfortunately, there was apparently compliance with DHA supplementation, which was not very good. So, the change in omega-3 index was not much in that big trial. So, they didn't see a benefit, it could be because women weren't taking it. That's a problem. But we do have a test we developed in a marriage one called the, RBC, mothers DHA test, RBC DHA test, I don't remember any of them. Let me get in trouble. But anyway, it's a test for pregnant women to measure their red cell DHA levels. And we think being over 5% is where you want to be. I mean, there's no guarantees you're going to prevent preterm birth. There's so many factors that go into a woman delivered, certainly. But from the risk factors we can control, if you're down at 3%, that's the high risk group for preterm birth, over 5%. It's not a problem. So, there's something an obstetrician could easily measure, dried blood spot test, could measure that, and counsel a pregnant woman, you're too low, take more, you know, you're already supposed to take DHA. People know it, but if you have a blood test that says you're low, you might actually do it. Right. It's the compliance issue, I think. So, that's an important area of research now to try to figure out how to operationalize that, get that in the clinic, get the use of an omega-3 test in pregnancy in the clinic. This 5% omega-3 index, you're talking about in the context of potentially helping prevent premature birth. What about development? Pre-indevelopment. Pre-indevelopment. Yeah, I mean, that's the other side of it. We're looking at mom and the delivery issue with premature birth. But, yeah, there's plenty of evidence that having a higher omega-3 level in mom, I mean, it's mixed evidence as is everything. If you look several years down the road, kids do are doing better in some studies. Yeah. And I'm doing worse than ever doing worse. They're doing no different or better. Right. And so, there's a long-term benefit, probably, to the kid for having higher omega-3 in utero. I think there was a recent study that was published where it was randomized trial. When women were given like 200 milligrams of DHA or a thousand milligrams. Right. It's a study from, no, a door. There's a name of Kansas University, Susan Carlson. They published it and they found a benefit in pre-term birth. But they also found benefits and other adverse outcomes, reduced risk for adverse outcomes in the delivery. They are, at this point, they haven't looked at mental outcomes in the baby. This is all about first. Okay. So, I'm thinking of other studies. But, yes. So, I'm very important, I think. Yeah. I'm making it for you, it's just important across the entire life span. It lifespan. Exactly. You're talking about development to the way you age. And in a way, I mean, we're talking about sustainability. That isn't issue, but it is a low-hanging fruit to some degree for people that are willing to. Yeah. Right. Make that much of that. So, all these problems are once. Right. And so, I know from my mother, who was, you know, she's mostly sedentary and she kind of tries to eat. She must eat what she wants. She tries to follow my advice to some degree. But the one thing that is like consistent about her is she gets her supplements like every day. And that includes two grams of EPA. And, you know, vitamin D. But, you know, that's good. The low-hanging fruit. That's a way. Because it's easier to take those pills than to change your diet. And, you know, much as we in nutrition would love to say, get it from food, we're real. You've got to be realistic. Some people are not going to do it. And so, you don't withhold plan B, which is, take your from supplements. Do you think there is, so you mentioned just this, you know, one thing about the dose is that I've been wanting to ask you about, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the the Vlas, La Vaza and the, um, epinome. Vesepa. Vesepa. Um, they're sort of like capped out a foreground. Right. That's what originally when the folks are black sauce, myth flying, took low, phaser. You just need to be called Omicore. Took low phaser to the FDA to get it approved. Um, their studies. They did dose response studies. And they got on triglyceride reduction. And they got good enough at four capsules a day of triglyceride reduction. So they said, let's use that. But they got better at eight grams. Better triglyceride reduction. But who's going to take eight grams a day, who's going to afford it? Who's going to act, there's a practical wall. You kind of run into so four grams was nothing magic. It's just what the data that was brought to the FDA to get approval for La Vaza. So now everybody's kind of capped it for ramps. Not because higher wouldn't more better. That's what I want to ask you. Yeah, we'd just like to see that. I mean, if higher would work better, shouldn't we know that? I mean, it would be nice to know that. And then you do have the obstacle. What are you going to do it? And then you have your genetic engineering come in and figure out how to make it more doable to get eight grams. Oh, yeah. Right. I mean, because we will solve these problems eventually. We will. So we need to know that if the data's there, we should do it. And we'd but without having the data, we won't know. And so. So you're point very well taken. Yeah, it should be looked out. I used to see that. One last question about safety. And this was something that was found as a guest you call an adverse side effect in the clinical trials. I believe it was both in the reduced it in strength. Right. Where there was a small. But I think. It was a significant increase in. A trial. Fib relation. Right. A Fib. And this was in people that already had preexisting heart condition. Right. Right. And. Yeah. And then they looked in vital and there was there was a slight increase. But not statistically significant. Okay. And that was a lower dose was 800 milligrams instead of 4000 milligrams. Yeah. So yeah. And this is not been settled. What's causing this. And I haven't got any magic answer either. Talk to cardiologists about it and they go. I don't know. It hasn't. It wasn't seen for 20 years. 25 years of randomized trials. Nobody saw it. So why in these studies two of them. Forgram dos. So that. And that could be. It could be that. You could give or maybe give a negative cooking, maybe. And for at least this could be. That's why I didn'tache three forgiven giving that high a dose to be. You might want to be a little more tentive day to be there. But there is no increase was oui vaist was back we're Detroit, going back at Kheار [...] Yeah. And we're trying to make it, you know, tend to get a figure out. We're in our coalition of studies or 1720 cohorts. We're looking at the question of incident, AFIM. It's a function of baseline omega-3 levels. Did people have the highest omega-3 been followed out over years? Are they more likely to develop AFIM or not? So we don't know yet. We're looking at that. And how common is this? In Japan, you know? I know. I don't know. I know. Two studies have been published already looking at that question. We're looking at two individual cohorts that followed people out and said higher omega-3 at baseline lower risk rate. So. So, yeah. It's not four grams a day. So maybe that's it. We'll see. Well, I wish we could keep talking more because there are so many more things that I would love to talk to you about. But I just want to thank you so much for your contributions, the field and the person. It's been fun. Coming out and having this conversation with me and people people that do want to continue and looking into your research, they can find out more about you like the best place. Well, I go to go into either omegaquant.com. So I'm linked to my biography. My bibliography is there. Or at our fatty acid research institute. You just look for the fatty acid research institute to find it. It's the websites kind of weird to say. But it's those two places will believe outline who I am, what I do, what have done. Encourage people to get omega-3 testing. So they can know how to manage their own health. Your omega-3, quant also you have a social media, Twitter, Twitter handle for the omega-3, quant. A mega one. Sorry. Omega-1. And you also have a podcast. We have a podcast that we're doing for omega-1, called omega matters. So once a month, we try to get together with omega-3 expert, not me. And I interviewed them last time we did Dr. Yoran Dyerberg, the real founder of the omega-3 story. So it was sweet to talk to him. But like that. So that omega matters isn't fun, little podcast. Okay. And everyone can find that on the omega-quant.com website. Or writer YouTube. All right, folks. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's great time.

It is, in my humble opinion, fundamental to combine resistance training at the very least with an energy deficit through nutritional restriction to promote weight loss. And here's why, if you do not lift weights, even if you just do cardio, you will lose muscle as you're losing body fat. Evidence shows 25% to 30% of the weight loss will come from muscles. If you don't do resistance training, my views of certain respects on 180 and nothing can be characterized more so than loading. So I always thought that if you're doing anything over 12 to 15 repetitions is basically glorified cardio and that, you know, it's just muscle endurance. You're not going to gain muscle. The literature is now compellingly shown. I just, there's so much literature on the topic. I will have this done quite a bit of research as well as many others. And it shows that you can gain muscle, similar amounts of muscle, regardless of the loading, across a wide range of loading spectrums up to 30 to even 40 repetitions, which is along, as a long set. Hi, everyone. I'm sitting here with Dr. Brad shownfeld, who was a professor at Lamin College in the Bronx in New York City. His research primarily focuses on muscle adaptations to strength training, muscle hypertrophy. He is published over 300 studies in the field of exercise, sports nutrition. I am super excited to talk about so many things related to why we should care about resistance training, about the mechanics, training load, training intensity, reps, how many to do sets, whether we should rest or stretch or everything related to resistance training and muscle adaptations to resistance training. This is going to be a great podcast. So, Brad, thank you so much for coming out. Really excited to learn everything that we're going to talk about today related to muscle, hypertrophy and muscle adaptations. I'm a response to resistance training, but maybe we can just start with resistance training. I mean, why should people care about resistance training? So, in my humble opinion, certainly there are every form of exercise or most forms of exercise are very beneficial. Doing something is always better than doing nothing for your health. But if I were to say, if I were to pick one activity that is indispensable, it would be resistant to resistance training. And there's a couple of reasons. So, certainly cardiovascular exercise, it's been much more well researched over the years. And, indisputably, it has great effects on your health and wellness. But resistance training has many of the same benefits as cardiovascular exercise, but it goes well beyond what you can get through a rubber training. And particularly, dealing with muscle strength, obviously, and a bone density. Other things like posture. So, aerobic exercise itself has very minimal effects on your strength levels, muscle development, muscle hypertrophy. Even on bone development, so certainly running has certain benefits to bone. But nothing in the way that resistance training does. And again, things like your posture, people don't even consider doing, if you are sedentary and not doing anything. Over time, you're going to lose muscle, your posture is going to go. And you could do all the aerobic training you want. It's really not going to have these benefits. So, that you just mentioned two things that I was unaware of in the bone density in the posture. So, can you talk a little bit more about that? Resisting training, effecting bone density? Because that seems very relevant for particularly post-but pentopausal women. It is. So, osteoporosis, which is basically porous bones. It's when over time, at the aging process, your bones, if you are sedentary in particular, will start to degrade. And the 80% of osteoporosis people with osteoporosis are women. Because women generally no more one start out with less bone mass. There's also effects of, as you mentioned, estrogen is osteoporative. So, women undergo menopause. Postmenopausally, they're going to have increased bone resorption, which is going to increase their chances of getting osteoporosis. And resist is trading by pulling on the bones of muscle pulling on the bone. So, there's an interaction. You must feel a skeletal system is the muscle that allows when you have movement. It's the muscle pulling on the bones to move. And strength training really is the primary way to strengthen the bones. So, while you're strengthening the muscles, necessarily the bones become strength in this well. And there's certain ways that are going to be more appropriate than others to maximize that process. But, really no matter what type of resistance training you do, whether it's light well as heavy lows, etc., you're going to be strengthening bones. Whereas, and it's always, by the way, specific to the joint that you're working. Weight bearing exercise in particular is what strength and bones. If you're doing cycling or even the elliptical machine, it's really not weight bearing enough to have substantial effects on bone development and swimming another endeavor. Whereas, running to some extent there is ground reaction forces, but it's mostly specific to the femur to your lower body muscle, which is the spine. And the wrist is going to be a major area for osteoporosis, particularly women. Anyway, long story short is that resistance training when done regularly and consistently over time has profound effects on staving off the touch of frosty process and even building bones, particularly when you're younger. Is there, are there, you said there are certain types of exercises that may be better or is there any types of exercises that you can talk about? I mean, yeah, so it seems so most of the research has been using somewhat heavy moderate to heavier loading. I'm not convinced though. It's, I think it's a fact, it's an effect that we just don't have research. That's really looked at doing lighter load training with bone density. And I would surmise if you were training with a good deal of effort. I love those intensity of effort that you would achieve similar effects. But it also does seem that doing more multi joint movements, so multi joint meaning squats, movements that are utilizing more than one joint, multi joint is more than one joint. So rather than a curl, you can get better effects overall on bone because of the loading that is imposed. So again, not really great evidence. This is more speculative based upon the literature I've seen. So again, I'm a fan of any type of resistance training over not, but if you're looking to maximize bone development, I would certainly say you want to include some multi joint movements. I think just in general, those other reasons why you'd want to as well. Besides the squats, what are some other like? Rhoans presses, I mean pushups. Any type of movement where you're involving more than one joint. For someone that doesn't, like someone that's working with a dumbbells, for example, who's not going to go use a machine, can you do multi joint with a dumbbell? We should shoulder press. So that's a nice press. You get dumbbells of great. Should hold the press. Just press. You can do squats. You can do a goblet squat. We hold the dumbbell here and do a squat. So yeah. Well, that was very, I didn't realize. I mean, I had a question there about bone density, but I didn't realize that it really does play a significant role in the bone density. And it's really good to know about that. Muscle mass in general, aging. I mean, what about someone who hasn't, let's say, you know, they're more of an endurance athlete, like throughout most of their, you know, young adulthood. And they're getting into even just maybe perhaps older age. Is it ever too late to start resistance training to help, you know, build muscle mass, to help prevent the activity that's happening? It's going to happen. Absolutely not. So I, in my previous life, I was a personal trainer. Before becoming an educator researcher. And I mean, literally I was involved in the training thousands of individuals. And I had clients at the time that were 60, 70s and 80s never lifted away and so a huge benefits in relatively short periods of time. We carried out a meter analysis on the oldest of all, which was 70 in above, well, the 70s actually, not that it's the new 50, 70. But 70 plus years old, and up to octogenarians, the nonogenarians, profound improvements in muscle strength, muscle hypertrophy within 12 week, 8 to 12 week training programs, never, these are novice trainees who've never done anything before. Now, I will say this with the caveat, it's always better to start when you're, the earlier you start the better, because once you start losing to get it back as hard. So you can always improve upon where you're at at a given point in time. But trying to get back to where you were when you're in your 20s is going to be almost impossible if you're not starting through your 70. However, if you start when you're in your 20s, you can maintain a majority of your muscle mass. And certainly, I would say this. Someone who is not doing anything in their 20s, I've had clients in their 70s who were stronger and more fit than people in their 20s who were serious lifters. So, yeah, it's always best to start when you're younger. And I will say this too, for women in particular, in particularly in reference to bone density, it is very important to start early. Again, it's never too late because you can get some... How early? How early? I mean, it's early as you can, but certainly like in your teens and 20s. Because you do build up a bone bank. I mean, the analogy I like to use is having a retirement account. If you... Yeah, it's never too late to start technically. But if you start when you're 50s, your retirement is not going to be what it is if you start in your 20s. And there is this concept of a bone bank where if you start when you're young and particularly again for women who have the biggest issue with osteoporosis, you end up saving off the possibility of having osteoporosis. If you start when you're already low-sponed density, it's very difficult to get back. You can stay low if you can certainly prevent the progression of osteoporosis. But getting back your bone density becomes much more difficult. So, it's very similar to this concept of building up a muscle reserve, right? Where because that's also right when you... Correct. I don't know. They're easy, maybe. I used to lose the muscle mass. And so, yeah, if you... Like you said, having a starting with that bigger reserve is always better because things are going to be taking away from it so you want to have like a bigger starting point. So, that's really great to know because, you know, in particular for women, I think, you know, and at least for myself in particular, and I know like many of my friends and growing up even throughout high school, and we were always endurance. We were endurance athletes. You walk into the gym and there were most of the guys in there lifting weights, you know, the wrestlers, the, you know, and so I don't know that this may be changing now where women are trying to understand the importance of resistance training and building up muscle mass and bone mass through resistance training. But, you know, for me, it was always endurance. If I'm doing my endurance, then I'm checking the box. I'm getting that exercise. I'm going to be healthier because of it. So, this is all... It's really so important, I think, for young women too to really... It's easier to convince young men who, like, want to get the muscle. I mean, for them, they've got other goals as well in mind. But, I think there's now a growing interest in bone mass and bone density and preventing osteoporosis as well. So, that's really great to know. What about starting, like, so starting young, like, you know, can you start, like in childhood? Absolutely. So, there's compelling research now that children, it kind of is never too young to start provided the child's maturity is such that they're able to to lift. I will say that always it should be done, especially early on, if you're dealing with children, six, seven, eight years old, you want to have a fully supervised environment, even beyond that until they are, you know, when you're teens, even. But, yeah, there's really compelling research. Now that resistance training in youth not only is not detrimental, so I mean, it does not. I want to dispel them now that it's stunts growth. I mean, there's been this myth around forever that, you know, that training, if you do resistance training early on, it will stunts your growth. Zero evidence. How would you think the opposite because growth hormone increases with resistance training? Yeah, growth hormone really does not have the effects on interest, even though the name is growth hormone. That's, it's really not the driving force of development. Well, it is on height. Yeah. But, that's what I mean. Growth hormone is pulsatile and the effects on growth hormone for it's never been satisfactory interest and it's never been studied, but it's pulsatile and the effects on growth hormone with resistance training are very specific to the one hour or so after the work out. But, it was thought that you would injure the epithetial plates in the bone that would, you know, somehow start to grow. Anyway, zero evidence to that. The issues can be that if someone is not, I want to emphasize that for child, there's not a motionary mentally ready for that. Yeah, they get injured, but I'll say this. It's kind of, to me, it's always this weird thought process that parents often have no issues with letting their children play football and basketball, the possibility of getting injured and potentially breaking bones in sports and these, you know, major sports are much much our resistance training is one of the safest things you can do in a supervised environment. So, see, yeah, with children, again, very young, as young as six, seven, eight years old, there's been good compelling research on this that they can do it. I generally say you want to start off with lighter loads with them and again, it's getting them into the feel for doing it and look, when you're dealing with children, the most important thing is making it fun. So, if something is not fun, you're forcing them to do it. It's not only is it not going to work and you're going to have a rebellion against it, but it can also later on in life get them to a point where they're kind of adverse to doing that. So, again, I think what's really important is to make it enjoyable for them and it improves self esteem, obviously it improves so, you know, bullying and children. These are all things that can help to stay awful out of the issues that children can have and make some better athletes. So, for my parents standpoint, you can get scholarships to make them, if that's the avenue they want to pursue, it can make them better in their sports and lead to just a host of positive improvements. With respect to body composition, so, you know, we're talking about the benefits of resistance training on bone density, obviously muscle mass and people are now thinking about those things, but you know, back in the day, you know, body composition and it still is important as well, but that was kind of one of the major things people would think about, like, why they should do resistance training. Can you talk, like a little bit about body, like how does resistance training, you know, a fact body recomposition, can you gain muscle without gaining fat mass? Sort of sort of things like that. I know a great question. So, well, let's start from the basics that resistance training can improve, certainly it improves lean mass, which is largely muscle mass. When I do think it's important to understand, like, certain measures under water weighing, like a lot of the measures that you see dexa under water weighing, BIA, biological computers and analysis, they are looking at not necessarily muscle mass, whether there are ways to try to derive that, but when you when they talk about fat free mass and lean mass, generally depending on the measure, their combinations of in the very least muscle and water. So, it's not necessarily just if you're gaining water that'll show up as fat free mass, that's not anything outside of fat mass would be fat free mass. And that I think is somewhat important to understand there, but with that said, resistance training certainly can impact fat free mass aspect. And it can help with fat mass. Now, I want to say in general, in this goes for cardiovascular stress too, exercise is not the best way to lose body fat. It can, it's certainly I think a good ad jump to a fat loss program, which I'll get to in a second, but you have to do a lot of exercise to meaningfully lose fat. Whereas, it's just much easier to do it through reducing the calories in nutrition, the energy intake. So, for instance, if you do an hour of cardiovascular exercise and hard, you know, where you're running for the most part, I mean you can burn five, six hundred calories in that hour. You know, that's, you have a bag of potato chips that get pretty much offset everything you've done. Whereas, if you focus on reducing the energy intake through your food and using exercises and adjunct, it can certainly help with the weight loss, not only in terms of increasing energy expenditure to some extent, because by the way, doing an hour of exercise every day, for most people, it's just not a, it becomes very little boreous. And that's just cardio. Like I said, you want to do resistance training as well. And resistance training, cardio actually is somewhat more effective just purely from creating more energy expenditure than resistance training is, but here's the the catch. It is, in my humble opinion, fundamental to combine resistance training at the very least, with an energy deficit through nutritional restriction to promote weight loss. And here's why, if you do not lift weights, even if you just do cardio, you will lose muscle as you're losing body fat. And there are, depending upon how you're going about it, evident shows 25% to 30% of the weight loss will come from muscle. So, you might lose 70% fat, and it can even be more if you're a somewhat leaner. And 30% coming from lean mass. If you don't do resistance training, now you talked about Reacomp. Resistance training, not only will stay off the loss of fat free mass often, but you can actually Reacomp. Reacomp means you can gain muscle while losing fat. There are two primary factors, and I'll leave that so this three, the elephant in the room is anabolic steroid use, so if you're doing anabolic taking anabolic steroid, yeah, you can have serious Reacomp. But putting that aside, that's probably not your audience or most of the people listening here. The two primary factors are, number one, how much weight do you have to lose? So, when you obese, the more weight you have to lose, the easier it is to Reacomp. Also, how long have you been training? So, someone who has a lot of years of experience of training that's higher to their closer to their genetic ceiling? We'll have a more difficult time Reacomp. Now, I will so, by the way, so if you have a lot of body fat to lose, and you're just starting out, you can do serious Reacomp. I see this all the time, not only anecdotally, have I seen this in clients, but we have controlled experiments run through our lab where I see this all the time in individual subjects that we have. You cannot, however, maximize muscle mass while you are losing fat. So, this is important. If your goal is to go into, let's say, a mass gaining cycle where you want to, let's say, bodybuilders do this or a strength athletes, and your goal is to maximize muscle development. You're at the very minimum going to need to be at maintenance in general, you're going to need to be in a small surplus, where you're going to gain a little bit at least some amount of fat. Okay. Boy, this was a fantastic information. I'm just it's sinking all in. So, can, if you are in a caloric deficit, and this kind of brings us into the protein dietary requirements world a little bit. If you are in a caloric deficit, and but you are, and we should probably talk about what the protein requirements are, but let's say you are getting sufficient protein intake, daily protein intake to counter, to prevent your, your body from pulling protein out of your muscle, basically. Can you not lose the lean mass or muscle mass? Let's say you're not resistant training, but you are just getting the protein in, say, say you're doing a rubic, but you're still in the caloric deficit, deficit, but you're getting the protein. And not lifting weights. You're not lifting weights. So, the answer is it will help to preserve some lean mass, but you're still no matter what, if you are not lifting weights, I mean, this has been shown again over and over in research. You will lose, well, I want to at least always hate to talk in absolute, because if you're a very obese, we just have a, let's say you're a hundred pounds overweight. You can lose fat without losing muscle much more in red, because you just have so much fat to lose that the body is going to pull from the fat source. But I'm talking when you're starting to get down into, people who just quote our quote unquote overweight, you're going to lose muscle. If you do not resistance training now, even if I want to point out, even if you're lifting weights, if you are getting insufficient protein, it's going to, you're going to reach some muscle. So, you need to still take in sufficient protein. There's actually evidence that you need more protein than what has been shown for people that maintenance or above to maintain muscle or even the gain, it's slightly when you're in a caloric deficit. So, that actually increases protein needs to some extent. Can you talk about what those are? Sure. So, this, we start to get into generalizations. So, the general literature show somewhere around 1.6 to 1.8 grams per kilogram per day of protein is required for resistance training people, which is about double the RDA. It's where RDA for centering individuals is around 0.8 grams per kilogram per day, per kilogram per day. You need roughly double that to maintain or to promote anabolism while you're resistance training. In the upper confidence interval is about 2.2 grams per kilogram. So, meaning that to really be on the safe side, if you're for the vast majority of people, if you're in the gen pop, probably not going but if you're a bodybuilder when I'm coaching bodybuilders and consulting with them, it really does not hurt to take in more protein. I mean there's a lot of myths about kidney damage and healthy individuals, no good evidence that there's a negative effects on renal function. Certainly a bone density. These were all unsupported from my reading in the literature. So, there's not necessarily a downside to it. You have to look at cost benefit. Everything is cost benefit. For bodybuilders, I would say go up to 2 grams per kilogram per day, which roughly around for those of us in the states, it's about a gram per pound. It's not going to hurt. But I would say that becomes even more important to stay in that upper realm. So, if you're like 1.6, if you're especially in a surplus, you generally need the needs for protein are going to be encompassed because the body isn't going to reach protein needs. When you start getting into a deficit, that's where I think it becomes even more important to be at that upper realm that 2.0, 2.2 grams per kilogram. So, people that are, let's say people that are obese, and I always say obese or overweight and maybe it's important to distinguish these two, based on what you just said. But if they are obese and or overweight and they're wanting to lose that mass, should they be calculating their protein intake based on their targeted weight? Or because if they're like 300 pounds, for example, or that's a lot of protein. It's a great question in the answer. No. So, the protein needs have been based on men and women who are relatively lean. They want to say relatively for the best majority of the population that we consider. So, for guys somewhere like in the 12th to 15% body fat range for women around 20% body fat. So, if you are 300 pounds and you should be 200 pounds, you would want to say you would calculate it at your weight that you would be where you would be at your lean weight. For a guy 12th to 15% body fat. So, we can then regress to saying, based on lean mass, but most people weren't getting decks with skins to determine their lean mass. Or even, okay, they're not going out and getting body fat caliper measurements. Just not in the realm of what most people are going to do. When you can make a general estimate, these are not precise measurements. It's not like, you know, people think that we're doing these experiments and they're really nail it down into these precise areas. They're generalized recommendations based upon what we know and there's going to be variations around the mean. You're always going to have people that are, when we do research, we report the means is you will know, which are the averages, but people aren't an average. You get some people that are up here, some people here and they average out the year. So, yeah, so if you're overweight obese, you want to figure your protein needs at what you would be at a relatively lean weight. You know, once again, for a guy, 10, 12, 15% body fat, I will say this. It doesn't hurt to take in, like I said, a little extra protein. On the good side, protein is very difficult to store as body fat, much more difficult than carbohydrates and fat. So, it's, um, if you're going to earn the side of caution, that's where you want to earn the side of, you know, taking it a little more protein at the expense, if you're going to weight loss at the expense of carbs and fat. All right. Um, now we had Stuart Phillips on the podcast, a colleague of yours, and um, he was talking about with the, with the protein requirements, like the buy-in being more like, you know, just to get, like, at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And for me, I was like, okay, because that, that's what I'm going to try to aim for. But then, as I started to become more, um, do more resistance training, I realized I was meeting the buy-in, but I wasn't meeting the 1.6. And so I have to now increase, like, a can of certains will get me there. Like, I need about 16 to 20 more grams a day. So, you know, for people, like, like, my dad, for example, he's in his 70s and, um, like, getting good luck getting him a 1.6. Like, I'm trying to get him to 1.2, right? I'm trying to, like, prevent him from, like, just, you know, completely depleting his, you know, his, I mean, he'll ask this from his, from his muscle every day, which he's kind of doing. So he has to supplement and do the protein, protein shakes and stuff like that. And I'm happy at least to get him there. Um, next step would be then 1.6, you know, and, of course, adding the resistance training, which should be essential, but I haven't been able to get to that point yet. Um, so I wanted to mention that with the protein requirements, because, you know, there was, like, I know, the RDA is so low 0.8. And Stuart talked a little bit about, like, some of the flaws in the early studies that were done to calculate that. And I'm just, like, wondering, when is it time to reassess this, you know, and, and change it, because a lot of people think they're, they're getting enough protein. And, um, many people don't even get the RDA. So to address that, uh, two things, I think that are important. So 1.2 is better than 0.8, certainly. But I mean, there's good literature showing we've done work on this, that if you want to maximize anabolism, so again, it doesn't mean that you're not going to gain any muscle if you're taking a 1.2, but it will impair the gains that you're going to get. And especially when you're talking about older individuals, where that they're anabolically resistant. So it becomes even more important. And I think this is another important thing, you're dealing with older individuals, there's resistance, not only anabolically resistance to resistance training, but also to protein, where the per dose aspects need to be higher to some extent to get what's called elucine, which is one of the essential amino acids. And there's, I don't know, how deep you want to get here. But there's elucine, elucine, the amino acid that seems to kickstart the muscle growth process. And if it seems to be somewhat higher, at least some literature does show that an older individual is getting more elucine is important to kickstart that process. As you point out, though, and fairly for older individuals, it becomes increasingly difficult to get protein in. And I'm a big fan of whole foods. Like supplementation is something that you do when you cannot get whole foods in. But as you get older, taste buds start to dissipate your food does not have good taste. So older individuals have difficulty chewing sometimes too. And that is where supplementation can come in. It's much easier to drink a way protein or a casin or egg protein shake and get that protein through supplemental means if you're not meeting your daily requirement. So I think that's where, and for anyone, I mean women, it seems that women often also are not programmed to take protein as much. And yeah, it's just very easy to do through protein shakes if you're not going to be able to do it through all foods. What's the elucine threat? Like, can you, like, in terms of protein, like, obviously we'll get, we can get into the vegan vegetarian because it's a whole other thing. But like, if you're eating meat, chicken, poultry, fish, you know, if you're getting the essential amino acids, like, what gram dose per meal, would you say would be important for that crossing that elucine threshold and what age? Yeah, so these are, and again, hard cuddles, and either of those, I've seen three grams where it starts to increase for two to three grams of elucine as you get all the where is that cutoff from being a quarter-quarter older? There isn't one. And if you don't necessarily, I certainly don't think you need to take elucine as a supplement if you're taking in a high quality protein source, you know, if you're eating meat-based proteins, which, by the way, aren't just meat, they're also milk and eggs, et cetera. So proteins from animal, I should say animal-based sources. You're going to be getting quality proteins that are rich in elucine. And again, it's just getting the proper dosages in, which might be, it's been shown there as a graded, as a recent study out of Luke Finn, so I have a terrific researcher, protein researcher, in the Netherlands. And they looked at, again, my memory now, it's been a loss inside of the study, but it was zero, 15 grams of protein, I believe they was way a 30 and 45, I think it was. But anyway, it showed a dose response relationship for muscle protein synthesis, where they kept getting a graded response. Now, it did seem to somewhat, the curve wasn't a linear relationship so there was, you know, more parabolic, where it started to trail off after 30 grams, but it did continue on above the 30 grams. So it just shows that in older individuals that it's needed to take more per dose protein to hit that loose enthresial, particularly in the time after resistance training. I mean, yeah, that's talking about a dose that you're, you're going to have in your animal products, but then you're also probably going to have a protein shake with it because it's quite, I mean, I guess unless you can eat large, large, large stakes and stuff, but for me, I know, as a female too. I'm all thinking about. This is a chicken, is 30 grams of protein, is that so sweet? I mean, it's four, you know, if you get... I eat four ounces of chicken. Yeah, so it's pretty good. With respect to what we were talking about with the being in a calorie deficit and gaining muscle mass and how it's, you know, you have to do the resistance training and get the protein, but it seems as though gaining isn't... you're not going to be really gaining if you're in that calorie deficit. If you're the person that is actively doing calorie restriction for recomb, like, you know, I guess, aspects. But what about, you know, so like, something I practice is time restricted eating, where I like to eat all my food within a 10-hour window, you know, I don't go too crazy, but, you know, like, I like to have a resting period and, you know, when you're not digesting and all that you are in a repair process, right? You're in repair mode. The problem that a lot of people make with time restricted eating is they go, oh, in order to eat within this 10-hour window, I have to skip breakfast, right? So they skip meals, which ends up being caloric restriction in, you know, combined with the time restricted eating. And so what I do is not skip meals, I do not skip breakfast, I do not skip meals. Unless, you know, there's some circumstantial thing that happens where I have to get somewhere, whatever, right? But if I'm getting all of my protein within that 10-hour window, so it's more of a, it's an intermittent fasting, but not being in a caloric deficit. So getting the same calories that I would get if I was eating my food throughout the day. And then adding in resistance training, making sure I'm eating the protein, is that going to be conducive with gaining muscle mass? Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, we actually started to get some good research on this topic. Now, time restricted eating is interesting. You bring that up. I have a paper currently in review or review paper. Review paper currently in review with my colleague, Alan Ergonne, who's a big nutritional expert. And it's just we cover this exact topic. The interesting thing with time restricted feeding number one is various iterations of it. So there's 420. So we have 4 hours eating and then 20 hours about this. 6, 18, is 8, 16. So there's all variations. Then there's also the two five concept where you fast for two days and then eat up five days or so a lot of that will depend upon the specific type of time restricted feeding. What you're talking about, a 10 hour window, is much more friendly towards an ablism. But most of it's interesting because conceivably spacing out your protein would logically have benefits. And there's been some research even longitudinal research that backs this up that you get better utilization of protein. If it's spread out, let's say at least over three meals relatively spaced like breakfast lunch and dinner and perhaps even four. But now again, here so this is where the nuance is coming. If you're a bodybuilder, I would recommend trying to take in protein across the day as much as possible because when you're not eating, you're catabolic. Eating is anabolic. So when not eating is catabolic. But for these studies on time restricted feeding really don't show much difference. Now, our measures that we have occur at measures of looking at, I've purchased fear, even MRI, which is the gold standard. It still has a margin of error. It's not like we're doing, you're looking at a cadaver and you're actually, you know, measure or you're doing like rodent research, we actually can weigh the muscle, et cetera. So our measures might not be sensitive enough to detect subtle differences, but for the vast majority of people, you're not looking to bodybuild. It's just not going to be much of a difference. If you're going to do a 420, I would say you're then going to be in a lot more. And there's been research as one study certainly showed diminished anabolic, diminished muscle hypertrophy with a 420 versus a traditional eating pattern. I could see where a 2, 5 might be have issues. So again, I would say if you're going to, whatever you do, try to structure your training within that eating window that you have. Because, and there's actually been quite a lot of research on this that the body is highly anabolic for at least 24 hours, if not more after a workout. But when you start getting outside of, you know, 6-8 hours or so, it's probably going to trail up where you might not harvest some of the gains, depending upon what you're looking for. You know, especially if your goals are more optimized and muscle mass, so I would say it's beneficial to try to get the feeding in within that window. Whatever it is, if you're going to be, let's say in a 10 hour window, try to train within the earlier part of that eating so that you're going to be able to eat after your workout and not go. Let's say not do it right after your final meal and then be catabolic for 14 hours. Okay, so is there some with the anabolic window? Is there some, it's really a bond door? Yeah, we've done a total research on this. So certainly, there is somewhat of a window. And even in the paper, we publish, which people take this no anabolic one, that's not what a research show, but it showed that it's really minor. The much more important thing is getting your total daily protein and taking, and that's what we're kind of to your point. If you're hitting your daily protein requirements, whatever your window is, if you're doing, let's say it's certainly 10 hours, but even like a 816, which is the most common, time-restricted feeding strategy, if you're getting 1.6 grams per kilogram, you're pretty good. You're going to get the majority of your gains regardless. Then it starts to come down. You kind of mention this with the Stufel of similar veins. That's kind of like the, now you're starting to get more like the cherry on the Sunday here, if you want to eat out the maximum amount of gains. And really it's like I said more of a barn door. It's not this narrow window. And the, I think what we've debunked is that after 45 minutes, you, oh my god, I got to swim my shake immediately after training or I go catabolic. And even if you're an advanced bodybuilder, I don't think there's utility, the utility, and that is virtually no. But I do say, when I'm coaching bodybuilders, you get your protein in as quickly as you can after a workout. You don't have to stress and slam your shake the minute you finish your last set. But because small, this is where even small amounts of gains can be the difference between winning and losing a competition. So again, it's highly context specific. We try to make these general guidelines and apply it to the population. But everyone has their own, you know, goals or lifestyle that they have to deal with and other factors and that needs to be taken into account. If you are working out at home, let's say, and you can go and you're not a professional bodybuilder, recreational, you know, I guess I wouldn't call it a gym go or if you're doing it at home, but you're a recreational at home gym go or and you can go and take your shake right after your workout because you're a home when it's not stressful and you don't have to think about packing it and all this. I mean, with that, not going to hurt and it could have, like even if it helps a tiny bit. Yeah, I would say it's that is the cost benefit where there is really no cost and a potential there is small benefit. Now, again, if you start going longer and longer, if you're taking five, six, seven, eight hours and again, if you're doing it, you'll say 10, 14 and you train right after your last meal and then go 14 hours, then you can start compromising some gains. So, there's no hard rule to this. It's on a spectrum, but I would say the quicker you can get it in, conceive of way the better. It's just no downside to it. With your, you mentioned the aging study where the, the fellow from the Netherlands was looking at, I guess, on a per meal effect with respect to protein intake and muscle protein synthesis, is it like, you're, you're not going to have three, like, most people aren't going to do three meals with 40 or 50 grams of protein without supplementing on top of that. It may be, you know, maybe there's, you know, some people that will do it, but not like all the women, and not all the older folks, you know, for the, for the majority, I think of those types of people, they might not be taking in that much protein per meal. Should they try to at least get 40 grams and in, in at least one meal? Yeah, I'm worth, is 30 enough? I mean, so it's 40 better than 30 for these older people, is it something they should even think about or is it like, just the, the cherry on top, but you don't stress yourself kind of things. Yeah, it's a great question. And one of the things I think that needs to be understood is that the studies are sterile. So what I mean by that is that they're taking people, they're going to look at kind of proof of principles, so they take them fasted, they're having nothing in their body, and they're giving them a, wait, let's say, a way, protein shit. Way is a very fast-acting protein that gets into your body very quickly, into your circulatory system, the body gets to use the amino acids quickly. When you're eating a whole meal, the amino acids are released in a much more time-released fashion, because the body has to digest the food break, it down, there's fats that are going to delay absorption, so again, you're eating, let's say, chicken with, you know, broccoli and rice, etc, you're eating a whole meal. There's time-delayed release of nutrients into your body, so you know, that's why I said the most important thing, 90% is targeting your, I hate to give exact percentage, because I'm just pointing that out of the air, but I just want to emphasize the vast majority, is getting your total daily, worrying about getting your total daily protein intake, stressing over this, you know, minutia of how much is in the meal. If you're getting, if an older individual is taking in 1.6 grams, they're going to be doing fine. They're not going to be meaningfully compromising their gains and Western looking to bodybuild, doing masters, level of bodybuilding, you should. Okay, well that's good to know. I mean for the people like us, shifting a little bit into mechanics and like the training load, I mean that's a big one. I mean for the longest time, you know, I remember you'd hear lift heavy or lift bigger, go home, or something like that. I mean you're like, you know, go have your home. Yeah, that's it. Like what does this science say about that? Like you're, this is, you know, you've really contributed to this this area about, do you need to train heavy to get your gains? So this is an area that I've done pretty much a one, so I've changed my opinion on it, so many things that that I learned is an up-and-coming sports scientist and that were treated as dogma, you know, in textbooks that my views of certain respects on 180 and nothing can be characterized more so than loading. So I had always thought that if you're doing anything over 12 to 15 repetitions is basically glorified cardio and that, you know, it's just muscle endurance, you're not going to gain muscle. The literature is now compelling, we show and I just, there's so much literature on the topic. I will have is done quite a bit of research as well as many others and it shows that you can gain muscle, similar amounts of muscle regardless of the loading across a wide range of loading spectrums up to 30 to even 40 repetitions, which is a long, as a long set. And that's at the home muscle level. Now there may be, I want to really emphasize this is not, this is still a quibical, there may be some muscle type muscle fiber type specific benefits to doing light loads for type one fibers and type two fibers for heavy loads. I, if you're asking my confidence in that literature, it's, you know, modest at best, but I can't rule out that that would be the case. But when you're looking, let's say an MRI data or ultrasound, which we've used extensively, really shows no difference and I tell you what I think is a quite funny story looking back. But Stu Phillips had published a study circa 2012 and he went on social media with Facebook at the time and it was on untrained subjects doing light extensions and they showed that there was no difference in home muscle hypertrophy between 30% on RM, which is like 30 reps versus 80% on RM, which was like 8 reps. And I remember it was Chris Dasex still come on. This is untrained subjects doing light extensions that's they could jack from doing spin cycle. That was I think my exact quote. And I said I'm going to do this study and trained individuals you're going to see, it was going to be no, no question the older individuals are going to need the heavier loads to get those highest threshold mode units, the type two fibers into play. And um, homehold, I carried out that study in no difference. I was really a crow and since then there's just been so much evidence not only in just across the spectrum of populations untrained, trained, older, younger, men, women, really any and every population has been extensively studied. And it really is a beautiful thing because it provides so much flexibility and options to carry out resistance training and it's particularly, I think, beneficial for issues like training through injuries. So your training through injuries, you have you loading can be contraindicated and also particularly for the older individuals because joint related issues as you know, people get older and they get asked you arthritis, some other joint related issues, where heavy loading can be very uncomfortable for them and perhaps debilitated as it's kind of contraindicated. And they can use lighter loads. Now the caveat to this is is that the lighter loads have to be taken with a high degree of effort. So they have to really, if you do not extensively challenge your muscles, meaning that the last few reps are difficult to complete, you're not going to achieve gain. So when I talk about light loads, it's not this taking pink thumb bells and just doing something like, okay, I stop. You must challenge the muscles. So heavier, when you lift heavier, just innately you're going to challenge the muscles regardless because the weight is already heavy. With lighter loads, the first number of repetitions are very easy to complete. And if it's easy to complete, you're really not doing much for challenging. And this goes back to a survival mechanism. So the reason that the body, I think this is important because the reason that the body adapts to strength training is survival. The reason that the body adapts to anything is through a survival mechanism. And if you are not challenging it in a way it is not accustomed to being challenged, it has no impetus to adapt. So the reason that you will get these adaptations and strength and power and hypertrophy, muscle endurance, bone density, etc, is because the muscles and bones, etc, tendons, legaments are being challenged beyond their present capacity. And so as you get stronger, then you have to push past that and challenge them more. So the big take-home for lifting lighter, which is what I tend to do, is to get fatigued, right, when you're doing it, it's often means more reps, which I enjoy doing. I've done both and I do find for me, I like doing the lighter lifting and more reps versus doing heavier and fewer reps. And I also notice I'm less likely to endure my rest. Now maybe that wouldn't, if I was doing things like proper form and all that maybe wouldn't be such a issue. But you mentioned the muscle type 1 and type 2 fibers and maybe there's some evidence that lifting a little heavier might help shift a little bit more type 2. Can you talk just for a moment? What are the roles of those types of fibers and do you should people aim to kind of gain both of those or are there distinct differences, you know, in terms of with aging, their roles in aging? Yeah, so great questions. So I'll talk with the second question first. Yes, aging is mostly spacits of aging. What's called sarcopenia, which is the aedrolated loss of muscle, is most specific to the type 2 fibers, which are you're strength-related fibers. So just to kind of even circle back for those that don't know, type 1 fibers are enduring sorenyented fibers. They do not produce force as well as type 2 fibers. But they're indifateeable. They can go on for longer periods of time. They're hard to fatigue. Whereas your type 2 fibers fatigue relatively easily, but they have the capacity to produce greater force. As you age, the type 1 fibers are more well preserved where the type 2 fibers, there's even what's called apoptosis, which has been shown as a loss of fibers. But certainly there's a diminishment where the fibers get smaller. It's more specific. This are acupenic effect is more specific to the type 2 fibers, which is obviously problematic because the ability to produce force is where your functional capacity, or primary functional capacity, at least from being able to open cans and jargile jars, avoiding falls, etc. Circling back, so then the training effect, I want to emphasize. You're going to train, if you are training hard, regardless of heavy light, you're going to be targeting both one and two fibers. So we're talking now new ones. So if you're about, I think this is where this kind of gets lost in context, that where I think this would have the greatest, if it is, in fact, true, greatest relevance would be to let's say bodybuilders. You want to maximize their muscle development. It probably has been official to utilize some heavier training and some lighter training so that you at least make sure you're kind of hedging your bets and make sure that you're maximizing development of all fibers. For the average individual, if you were training hard, regardless of lighter heavy, you're going to be getting the type 1 and type 2 fiber development. And it's been world documented that light load training does target the type 2 fibers, which had been, that was one of the myths that used to be taught when I was an up-and-coming sports scientist that if you just used light loads, you would not activate the highest threshold modion, it's which are associated with these type 2 fibers. And thus you would not optimize your strength and power in hypertrophy. So we were talking about the resistance training, we've mentioned strength training and then there's power training and I think this probably has a little bit to do with what you just mentioned with the problem with aging, right? And so can you just briefly talk about differences and then maybe where like just one shine more than the other with respect to like what older individuals should be doing or focusing on or is it like you know women versus men or any differences there as well? So the definitions do somewhat vary depending upon who you give you a mind. So resistance training is kind of a catch-all for any type of exercise that moves against resistance. This would be body weight exercise pushups, pullups, body weight squats, would be resistance exercise, free weights, machines, cables. Any of these would be considered resistance exercise. Strength training often is used synonymously with resistance training, but also it can be thought of specific to let's say power lifting where you're moving very heavy loads and necessarily when you're lifting heavy loads you're doing, you're moving them very slowly. If I give you a very heavy load to lift you can't move that fast or you'd be able to do more than than whatever you're doing. You'd be able to do more repetitions than what you're doing. Whereas power is the ability to produce force over time some more quickly. The more rapidly you can produce force, the more power you generate. Power is developed on a foundation of strength but it also involves this time component and there is evidence that at least it is some training needs to be done quote unquote explosively. So moving weights quickly, or when I say weights doing resistance quickly, to generate maximal power and our group was involved recently in a made analysis on older individuals that showed functional improvements were optimized when they did training that involved moving the concentric action quickly and then doing a controlled eccentric. So I do think it's important for older individuals to incorporate some power training in their programs. Doesn't mean that every set needs to be done in this respect but at least having some of the training that will be devoted towards power training and I think it's really exemplified by the fact that hip fracture. So when older individuals fall and it's a frequent thing now, particularly in those who were sedentary, they are not able to quickly reverse their fall and avoid the resultant effect of hip fracture and study show that individuals older individuals when they get a hip fracture. It's been a loss since I've looked at the literature. I think it was 50% never recoverful function and die with it. I think two years, half of them going to convolescence, they have to be under constant care. They're not able to be functionally independent. So I mean this is a big thing, it was a younger individuals, they can get their cast side by their friends or whatever and it's not a big deal but older individuals, these are really important issues that you want to stay of off and I would say that having some power training and then again other types of training, it's not, this is another thing I think is really important. We often think in binary terms, train this way, not that way or there's programs that are devoted. This is how you should train. We should be thinking of training as combining different concepts to a given goal because often doing some light and go training with some heavy or low training, if possible, sometimes that's not possible but sometimes it is. Doing, like I said, some power training with heavy or training or light or low matter or training, these are things that ultimately can optimize the effects for a given goal. Thinking about the power training for me, I would think, well, sounds like it would be easier if I had lighter weights. Can you do, I mean is that still considered power training if there, or does it have to be like a fast movement with a heavier? No, no, no, you, so again you're not going to be able to move heavy, heavy and lighter relative terms. So if you're using the very head, let's see you're doing what's called a 3RM, the maximum amount of weight you can lift three times. Let's have doing a bench press with a 3RM. Even on my first rep, if I tried to move it fast, I'm not going to be able to, because if I could, I'd be able to do more than three reps with that. So you're going to have to choose a weight that is relatively light. Let's say you're able to do a minimum of 10 repetitions, right? 8, 10 repetitions. So again, light exists on a spectrum. 8 is lighter than 3. 3RM is heavier than 8 reps. 8 reps would be heavier than 15 reps, 15 reps. So at what point is that, you know, that optimal effect, there's no research that indicates that at this point, where you're, but you're not going to be able to use heavier. It'll be above, let's say, 8. I'd say you'd have to go a minimum as light as minimum of 8 repetitions, 8RM. If you could do more, if you could do a heavier load, you're not going to be able to move it quickly enough to get that benefit. By the way, there's other things you could do. You can do pieometric training now for some older people that can be somewhat dangerous. But I mean, you can throw a medicine ball. That's a way of power training. So take a medicine ball. I mean, older people can easily do that. We're for the upper body. These are going to upper body movements. That would be, I think, very user friendly for people that are older can be fun, which again, it's kind of, we do see kind of this trajectory from youth to getting into our adulthood and then aging. We're making it fun again. A lot of times is important for older people. What about? So you mentioned with the lifting lighter and the important thing of basically fatiguing yourself, right? You can't just do a couple and compare that to lifting heavier and doing a couple, right? This whole idea of training to failure and what does that mean? Do we need to train to failure? That's important. Yeah, so failure, if an operational definition would be the inability to perform another repetition with proper form. And we carried out a major analysis recently. On this topic, and the bottom one is that, and that's kind of the go harder go home philosophy. That's the bodybuilding, went out of go harder go, every set needs to be taken to failure. The evidence is not an decay, that's the case. So certainly you need to train with a high amount of effort. But to take all certainly to take every set to failure is not, not only does it not, doesn't show any benefit for high-purchase, but it actually showed a small detriment for strength. So with strength, stopping a couple of reps short of failure seemed to have better effects on maximizing strength than training the failure. Again, there's some limitations to that research. How much of that does that mean that if you train to failure, you won't maximize your strength a lot? That's necessarily a more with that, but that is what our result showed. I also would not dismiss the fact that for very high level, let's say you're very close to genetic ceiling, that it might make the need to go to failure, at least on some of the sets, more relevant beneficial. We don't have good it. This is purely speculative of my end, but I can see, at least the logical rationale where it makes your challenge, it's a way to challenge the body in a way that it is not used to. I will tell you that in when I coach bodybuilders, I generally incorporate some failure training, but another area where my view is shifted, maybe not 180, but probably 90 degrees, where I used to be the go hard, go home, do to every set, need to be taken to failure. Now, most sets within two to three reps of failure, so there's a concept called the repetitions in reserve. And zero, the RIR scale, repetitions in reserve. And RIR of zero means your failure. You cannot have done another rep, there's zero reps left before you got to failure. And RIR of one would mean that you have, you could have done one more rep and at that rep, you would be a failure. From the literature, although we don't have a definitive way of making estimates on this, but my own interpretation of the literature somewhere between probably one to three RIR reps from failure would be needed to promote optimal adaptations. You can still see adaptations, particularly when you're more in the newbie stage and the early stages, below that. But one to three, I think is a good general recommendation to, that's necessary to see adaptations. Again, then you start giving into the weeds, getting into the nuances for the gen pop. I'd probably would say that's always going to be effective, and you'd probably never have to go to failure for the goals of most gen pops. For bodybuilders, high level athletes, perhaps some failure training, the less set to failure on some of your exercises at least. And again, you want to get into the weeds, probably using your single joint and machine-based exercises would be more appropriate for failure, let's say, than squats. Well, by-seps curl, lateral reeds, a leg extension, they're going to be, first of all, there's less issue of injury. Because when you go into failure, let's say in a squat, if you've ever squat at a death, and you're in the hole and you're trying to push out, there's a greater potential for injury. You get certainly going to need a spotter in that regard. Well, you can be stuck and you can have problems with a bench press where you're trying to do that rep if you don't have a spotter, you're that bar is stuck to your chest. Whereas if you're doing, let's say dumbbell curls or lateral raises, the very least you're not going to be really torched after your sets. You're going to be able to come back strong. So these are just general speculative of my part, but I think there's good logical rationale behind these things. And I do want to say that an evidence-based approach, so I do want to promote one of the things I look like biggest hobby horse in life is to promote the importance of evidence-based practice. It is not simply deferring to research. Research is never going to tell you what to do or virtually never. It's going to provide general guidelines, particularly in the applied sciences like exercise and nutrition. It will get you into the ballpark, or you know, give you general strategies to use. You then need to take this to the individual. What are their genetics? What are their lifestyle? There's stress level, they're sleeping, nutritional status, all of these things together. And then of course goals are going to enter into it. So developing a program from the research means to understand the research and then to use your own expertise in combination with the goals and abilities of the individual. With the designing the training programs, sort of, I expect what kind of, I mean, sort of talking about this. The training til failure sounds like that's pretty clear for me. Maybe the bodybuilders is a little bit more important, but for most people getting within one to three reps until failure answers the will you get a lot of questions about how many reps do I need to do? How many reps do I need to do? It sounds like it depends on the person. When you start to feel that fatigue when you're getting close, you know, right? So that's kind of what I'm thinking from myself, resting between those reps or between the sets, or which ways it, the resting intervals between the sets. It's between the sets. So basically when you're getting ready to do another set, like how many sets do you need to do or how long do you have to rest between them? Is that important? Yeah, so again, it's on a spectrum and it depends on, so I talked to my students, tell asked me questions and I say, you know, pretty much any applied question you're going to ask me, I will answer with an it depends, because within broad spectrums you can get, if you're doing a very minimalist routine, you can make it. So if you're saying is it important, it starts to become more and more important, the more important it is to you to maximize your results. If your goal is just to build some muscle, gain some strength, a very minimal routine. I mean training an hour a week, let's say two days, two half hour sessions a week can give you very nice, most people, very nice results provided your training hard. Is that going, if you're looking to be a bodybuilder, is that going to, you're going to step on stage? No, I would say with 100% confidence, that is not going to be sufficient to optimize your gain. So volume has been shown to be a driver of my part, so you're going to be done. Original research on this, we've done made a nap and made a little work. And there is a dose response relationship up to a certain point. It is individual specific as well, so some people respond better to respond well to lower volumes. Some people need more volume to maximize their results. Hard to study individual responses, but these are kind of general insights that we glean from the literature. But I would say as a general guideline to optimize high-purchasing, if you want to be somewhere between 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week. Now that's not going to be able to be done doing two half hour sessions per week. But we recently published a review paper called No Time No Eft, it's open access. You can maybe post on this podcast, the link to that or show the image of the study. But we basically kind of looked at what is your minimal effective dose. And it was roughly around four sets per week per muscle per week, which again can be done to maximum three half hour sessions, two to three half hour sessions per week. You can get very nice results. And I think it probably, for most people, the majority of gains in that period of time. And then if you want more, you're going to have to devote more time. Are there certain strategies that can be, so we were talking about power lifting, are there certain things that can be done to be able to not have as much time as well? I mean, it's very inclusive after size. Yeah, so a couple of things. Number one or several. First of all, training with lighter loads, well again, it's a very viable option. It does extend the time of the workouts. With your training let's say with 30 reps, the set's going to take triple the amount of time if you're training with 10 reps. So that if you're very time-press can be a consideration. Now how much that depending upon how many sets you're doing, if you're doing minimal, minimalistic training, it's probably not adding that much time on. If you're doing a lot of volume, it can be more extensive. But using multi-joint exercises, so again, multi-joint is more than one joint presses, rows, squats, deadlifts, push-up, chin-ups. These were exercises that involve multiple muscle groups. A lot of stabilizer muscles. They're much more time-efficient than doing, let's say, a bicep curl. So when you don't let's say a lat pull that or chin up, you're working your biceps very effectively. You're performing elbow flexion and addition to working your lats. The sternal portion of your pacts even are working in many of the stabilizer muscle groups. Squats involve many muscle groups, really, the total lower body, and even stabilizers in your torso. So I would say focus more on your multi-joint exercise. And then you can use various time-efficient strategies. So kind of these advanced training methods such as a superset, which is doing two different exercises. And there's different ways to structure these, the something called a pear set, pear set. Well, you do agonist antagonist movements, such as so the biceps and triceps are agonist antagonist muscles, meaning that one one is contracting, one is shortening the others, I don't know if you do a biceps curl, you can immediately do a triceps press down after that and really you're working the muscles in different fashion. You don't have to rest between the sets. You could do a leg exercise followed by an up, so lower body followed by an upper body exercise. Again, you're working different muscle groups so you get it's more time-efficient. You don't have to take the rest. If you're going to do what's a set of chest press, so let's say I do the typical traditional way of doing sets is you do a set, then you rest, then you do another set for the same muscle group you rest. That's going to take more time because you're going to have to rest between those sets. There is something called drop sets where you can do a set to failure, so it's not my close to failure, then you drop the weight. I don't really drop it away, but you reduce the amount of load. So let's say for instance, let's say you're using you have a rack of dumbbells and you use 20 pound dumbbells for curls. You can then when you finish you're getting really difficult on those last reps, you then go to the 15 pound dumbbells and you do more reps because you're writing the loader able to do more weights. You can do triple drops so you go from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 even. And just do them without any rest and then not do any more sets rather than doing multiple sets. You just do this one drop set, one drop set. Now is that as effective as doing multiple sets of the same muscle? We don't have enough evidence to show, but I do think we have enough where I would confidently say for the gen pop, it will be just close to as effective. I don't think for the majority of the populations it will make much difference. Again for the high level athlete, bodybuilder, it might. And that's where again context is important. Where this idea of resting on this is great information that says, I'm typically the way I work out, which is far from bodybuilder. Well, a fall. I don't rest in between sets, but I'm also immediately switched to the next thing. And then I'll eventually go back to that first muscle group I was working. So I'll have like three different muscle groups and I'll and I'm doing the lighter and faster. And then so if you are doing a set, like why is it important to rest in between this set? Is it like something to do with like muscle protein synthesis or what? Well, I mean if you're going to let's say you won't you're going to do four sets of chest presses. You have to rest because if you're training really hard at that last step, you pick up the weight, let's say in two seconds, you're not going to be able to do it by default if you're training very hard, you're not going to be able to do any more reps, or else than your weight failure. So you have to have some degree of rest. Now if you're resting very short periods, let's say you're resting 30 seconds. You're the amount of load that you're going to be able to do will be much less or the amount of reps at the same load. And this is actually interesting. So it had always been promoted as another area where I've shifting my thought processes. But it had been promoted that resting shorter was better from muscle height purge of visor. It had been taught that I was an up and coming strength and conditioning professional that if you want strength, you take long rest like three minutes in between your sets and for hypertrophy it's like 30 seconds to a minute because that will maximize the hormonal response. So in between sets or depending on the type of training that you are doing, shorter rest intervals will promote interset rest intervals will promote greater growth hormone testosterone and IGF one responses after the workout is over. The literature and that used to be thought to be a main driver of hypertrophy, the compelling body of literature now shows that it probably doesn't have, if it does happen effect, it would be very modest and it might not even have any effect at all. So certainly it would not be something that I consider would be important to take into account. And the issue is is that volume will load the amount of total amount of weight that you lift in a given session which is the amount of work that you're doing does seem to be a factor. So let's say I'm doing a set of squats with 200 pounds for 10 reps and then I rest 30 seconds between trying to do another one after 30 seconds. Let's say I tried to use that same 200 pounds. I'm not getting anyone near 10 reps and based on the literature that we have, I'm probably only getting 5 reps. Whereas if I would rest 2 minutes, I'd be able to get much closer to that 10 reps and if I rest 3 even more. And that's why it's actually been shown that resting short having short rest periods between sets. If you're doing a certain number of sets and you're resting short, taking short rest, it actually compromises hypertrophy. So it actually has a negative effect giving greater credence to the fact that at the very least the volume load is more important than any hormonal effects that are given. Which makes sense. I mean, but what you know and we talked about this a little bit with with Stewart is that as you mentioned the hormonal effects, at least you know endogenous and hormonal effects you're getting from resistance trading not taking exogenous hormones. Don't have, don't seem to have much of an effect on muscle protein synthesis, but and Steve was mentioning this with growth hormone, you know, affecting collagen synthesis. And so then a question I've of course had was, well what if that's doing something for preventing injury because you're getting more collagen synthesis and tendons? I mean, I don't know that anyone's looking at that, but we don't know, but I would say again growth hormones are very interesting hormone because it's pulsed so it's secreted at night is when you're getting your greatest growth hormone release. Your guess is as good as mine because like you said, it's purely speculative. I would be skeptical that that brief spike in growth hormone post exercise would meaningfully alter tendons synthesis, let's say to where it would be reducing your injury potential, but without knowing it could. Yeah, but dismiss it we would need research on this. With respect and I think you kind of already answered this, but I just want to make sure with designing this program, differences between men and women should women then really be focusing more on the multi-joint exercises, specifically also because of the effects on bone mineral density and is that or I should all of us be and it should be focusing more on that. Yeah, women really do should not train much through all different from men. The one area that there seems to be some evidence is that women are able to recover a little more quickly, both intersects so they can actually rest somewhat shorter and gain back most of the volume load, like I said, it's not clear whether this has something to do with dodgy and so internally or whether it's the fact they're just in general using lighter loads than men, so it's easier to come back if you're using 200 pounds versus 100. We don't know and even the recovery between sessions may be a little better, the ability to recover, there's some evidence of that, but as far as the overall program, I don't program women much for all different way to men. For recovery, you hear a lot about the importance of recovery, the importance. What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh, it means that you need to take sufficient time so that you're able to come back strong for your, I mean, it means a lot of different texts, different depending on the context, but I think in the context of our talk that you're able to come back with sufficient energy and joy-related reserves where you're able to train effectively in your next session that your training is not compromised in the next time you're going to live. To some extent, it also has to do with the muscle protein synthetic response, which is roughly the time course, it's about 48 hours, can be truncated a little as you get actually more advanced. You seem to get a higher spike, so it happens quicker and actually trails off a little more quickly in some of the research, which is I think getting a little too much into the weeds, but theoretically you probably wouldn't need to train a muscle or it would be beneficial to give it 48 hours rest so that you can maximize that and work on other things or even just recover. It wouldn't be, certainly, it doesn't seem to be beneficial to train it on a daily basis, the same muscle and that having that recovery allows you to do other things that would potentially develop your body or and know your health to a greater extent. Does it blind? I personally could be training the same muscle. So there's actually some interesting, it's kind of a quivicle. We actually care, could tell I've done a lot of work and all of these vary well. So we carried out a study where you had these were young men. We don't have any evidence in older people and I can make a case where it might because recovery seems to be blunt and all the blood I'll get to that in a minute. But in young men, we had them doing either the same exact routine done over three days with more, so when they did it over three days, they performed more sets per session. So it was like twice, each session was twice as long or else doing short sessions spread out over six days to same exact routine. And no difference for most of the muscles, but we looked at the biceps and the biceps growth was much greater in the group that did three days versus six days. Is that an anomaly? Again, we don't know. You'd need to replicate the study. Now, as I just mentioned, older individuals recovery does start to become a factor. And this is just looking, aging. You can't, certainly you can stay off aging, but you can't prevent it in the consequences of it. So to a large extent, we can live extremely healthy and vibrant into our older years, provided we take care of our bodies and do things. But, Father time, Mother time, we'll catch up to some extent. And we do have to take this in our account with programming. So like I said, no differences between men and women per se, but there are differences between younger and older individuals. And one of them, when I have consulted with older individuals, is to factor in not have as much volume, so that the ability to tolerate volume seems to go down to some extent. And by the way, interestingly, it seems their maintenance needs to be somewhat higher for volume, so they can't use as high-bimes, but also they need to have a kind of a higher minimum volume to maintain their mass. This limited evidence of that, but there was one study in particular that seemed to indicate that. And also having more cognizants of inter-session recovery and sometimes having fewer sessions per week. How much recovery would be older people? So again, this really depends on the individual, because there's older individuals, like I mentioned, that I can wipe the floor with 30 year olds. And there's other ones. So these are things that it really will depend upon, so it depends. How long have you been training? There you would just knew when you were 60 years old to training or have you been doing it since you were 20. You know, what do you have joint related issues? What's your nutritional status? What's your sleep and stress status? Are there any other medical issues? So a lot to unpack and on a general level, I think most kind of three days a week as of default, that would be a good. I mentioned that two days a week, people can still make robust gains, but I think three days a week would get you a little better gains and if possible, even on a minimalist basis, if you can do three, half hour sessions per week. I think that's a good kind of minimalist guideline for everyone, including all the people and then, you know, some individuals can do a, what's called a split body routine where they could do, let's say Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and upper lower upper lower type routine and recover well. Whereas others need that three day, you shouldn't do more than three days a week. Is there anything that can speed up recovery, silver cover being, it's passive recovery, active recovery, like things that can help speed it up, nutrition wise or other things as well? Yeah, first of all, being recreational, active, so blood flow does help with recovery. One of the worst things you could do is just be a couch potato. So what's a do-or-resistant work at me, rest of the week you're just sitting on the couch, you know, want you to go bomb bonds and watching your favorite TV shows. That's the circulation itself is going to optimize the delivery of nutrients and expedite delivery and recovery in that respect. Other things have somewhat less evidence behind them. So massage has been shown to potentially help recovery. What's a problem with that was hard to sham massage, so when your massage feels really good, hey, I feel better. I'm going to, it was that because of the massage because of the psychological effect that you, yeah, feel better now, I feel better. We're foam rolling, you know, these are all things that we it's hard to sham them properly and get a sense, was it really the treatment or was it the placebo effect? Because you always want to placebo if you don't, if your comparing it is nothing, then hey, it felt good, so I feel I have better recovery. You know, taking in proper protein itself, that to me is in a recovery strategy that just should be part of your lifestyle if you want to, if you want to maximize your results, but if you're not taking in enough protein, protein of the building blocks of your muscle and of any tissues, so you're not going to get proper, proper recovery if you're not optimizing your protein nutritional intake. And there's other, I mean, a central fat fatty ass particular in threes, your omega 3 fatty ass, it's seem to have certain beneficial effects on muscle development. Particularly it seems for the older people, but we don't have great evidence, longitudinal, we have some good, good acute studies that seem to show that. Anyway, so these are all, I think strategies, again, cross-benefit, well massage, if you're paying for it, that's a cost to that, but if you have, that's a significant other, that can massage, you can make good ad-help foam rolling, you know, really not a cost to that. There is some evidence that cold water immersion, we can kind of get into this, might expedite cold recovery so that you're not going to be a sore. So if the recovery has to do with getting back to trainability levels so that you're reducing soreness and heat, by the way, is another thing, which generally does not seem to have negative effects so again, those are potential strategies. Now, if you want to get into, it's kind of interesting with cold water immersion, okay, there would be particularly it's been shown with the cold water immersion. There is emerging evidence that it actually has negative effects, particularly when I preach people on strength measures as well. Some what-glimited evidence, but it's been showed, there's triangulation of evidence, meaning that we have acute data that shows up once in tricelular and a bioxignaling that it blends muscle protein synthesis, satellite cell. So when you talk about anabolic signaling, the problem inflammatory response, on what end is why corn incoded helps with recovery, but the acute problem inflammatory response actually has been shown to have a positive effect on muscle development. So chronic inflammation bad, acute inflammation good, at least that's the extent of what we see from the literature. And there's been longitudinal evidence showing that at once I preach the overall longer term studies. Now, that is when these studies have done, and done doing this every day or very frequently post-training, I would say that if you're only going to do it one time, let's say you're feeling really sore, nothing wrong with getting at a cold top. It's not, doesn't mean all your gains are going to go. If you occasionally do a cold water immersion, but I do think that using it frequently, probably if your goal is optimized, muscle growth, not a good thing, timing might be a concern. So if you want to do that, probably spacing it out at long periods after, but then you might not get the benefit you want. Like if you're sore, you're going to want to be doing it when you're sore. So if you're sore the following day, yeah, I think that might be beneficial and where you've kind of gotten out of your window or we've gotten the majority of your protein synthetic responses in. But again, the primary reasons that cold water immersion seems to have negative effects in number one, but the protein of the promotivator response in number two, but the circulatory response that cold water restricts the circulation and thus you're not getting nutrient delivery to the muscles speculative, but that's the working theory. Right, so that would make sense to not do cold water immersion right after your strength. Like if it's like your day, I like to do cold water immersion for brain benefits like in feeling you get neuro-benefinally, isn't it, it affects my anxiety and my mood and focus and attention, but I don't ever do it after strength training. So it's usually on a day that I'm not strength training. So the other thing would be you mentioned soreness and people using it for soreness, but what should you be sore? Like should you train to be sore? Does that play a role in hypertrophy and then, you know, like, is that something to get more sore with age as well? Or is what's that indicative of? I mean, yeah, so another interesting question is soreness. To some extent, does genetically influence an interestingly, it seems women seem not to have as much soreness as men? There's been some speculation it might have to do hormonally with estrogen. It could be other effects as well. But so it's an interesting question. Soreness generally is due to a novel response or novel stimuli. And usually that's, it's primarily due to the eccentric component of exercise and that by the way, can also be done through, well, let's say down to a running would be an eccentric form of aerobic training. But let's just focus on the resistance training aspect where the lowering, so eccentric is a lowering basically, lengthening muscles are lengthening under tension. And even concentric exercise cancores soreness and those muscle damage that occurs. But it seems to be also more specific to muscle damage and even damage within the epomysium or extracellular matrix. Again, these aren't necessarily clear, so it's connected tissue might be even more relevant, it's speculative that might have greater relevance to soreness with no receptors that are exposed to free nerve endings and this interaction with free radicals. It's a whole theory behind this. Do you need to be sorted to make gains? No, well, I think that's pretty clear, but could being sore potentially be indicative that there may be some additional positive gains? It's not clear, but a novel response, again, why does the body adapt? It adapts because it is being challenged beyond this present state. A novel response would generally indicate as being taxed beyond its present state and thus having some degree of soreness might indicate that you are challenging it beyond this present state. But again, some people is genetically influenced, so some people just don't get sore and some people get a very responsive to soreness regardless. There does seem to be a repeated bout effect, whereas you keep doing the same thing over and over again, the body adapts and gets less and less sore over time, but some people keep doing the same thing and they keep getting somewhat sore. Where soreness is an issue, so if you are mildly sore, I think it's probably not only okay, maybe it's positive, it shouldn't be negative. If you're not sore, I don't think you should worry about that per se. But on the opposite, if you are very sore, that is a negative because that's going to impair your ability to training at heart and that would be an issue. Other things people can do to help with this with the soreness that aren't going to blunt their hypertrophy or maybe be bad for them otherwise, so that you know about any evidence-based things that people can do to improve their soreness. Improve their response to soreness? Yeah, so that's not maybe that sore as long or well, could you? Yeah, you can not focus on the eccentric component, which probably is not a great thing because eccentric, not only is the eccentric component as important, there seems to be a synergism between eccentric and eccentric exercise where the intracellular signaling cascade for eccentric exercise is somewhat different than that of concentric and that would imply synergism in terms of the hypertrophic response. There was also evidence that muscles develop regionally, so it's interesting research that like certain parts of muscles will develop more than others. And eccentric exercise seems to work more in the distal portion of the muscle, whereas concentric seems to work more in the mid portion of the muscle and thus combining them again would be beneficial. So it doesn't seem to be, although yes, you can reduce the soreness that's developed by not doing, you know, focusing on your concentric. When suggests that, by the way, there was I don't know if they're still around, but there was a gym chain called curves, I don't know if you heard of them, but they had these machines that just did the concentric exercise because the whole thing was, they didn't want their focus on older women and they thought that this would be a negative, the soreness would just scare them away and they just had these machines that focused on the concentric portion. But again, if you go with to optimize games, that's not a great strategy. So look, you can do warm water baths, seem to again help to leave the edsourna stewing active recovery, just walking around, you know, for a property doing certain motions that would rub a kick and pump your arms, you could do the elliptical that has the arm crank just to get blood flow to the area would help to leave the edsourna. And the other thing I would say, if that's the goal, stick to the same exercises over and over. Now again, one of the benefits exercise selection is another potentially important thing if you want to optimize games, and that's again promoting a novel response, factoring in different movements can be beneficial to optimizing results and that would again have to do with the novelty of the movement, but that will come with the caveat that there'll be some sort of this. So two things that come to one is a roboge exercise you're talking about blood flow and that's another area that I was wanting to talk to you about was the combination of a roboge exercise and strength training and the effects on muscle hypertrophy. Combining them may be even just either with like days. So you do strength training one day and then a roboge exercise the other day so that's kind of a little bit it seems like what you're talking about having the blood flow to help even with recovery or soreness. But also what if you do it within the same on the same day, in the same session even? Yeah, so there's been a lot of talk about concurrent training being detrimental to those something called the chronic interference hypothesis which basically was actually shown in animal models and rodent models where the signaling interested with the signaling for cardiovascular upregulated your catabolic pathways, your MPK pathway. Again, I don't want to get too technical here but the MPK is a catabolic pathway which actually blunts the M2R pathway which is an outabolic pathway and your alternatively or resistant your anaerobic exercise was your anaerobic pathway and that does if you did aerobic training it would blunt the adaptations for resistance training and that actually has been shown to be at least at the very least at a way over simplification. Now at some point there will seem to be some interference. But it does seem that it's a lot that point is a lot further along than what we originally had thought. Yeah and I think that more has to do with the overtraining effects than probably the intracellular signaling effect. But it's not clear but we have some pretty good made animalitic data now showing that within decent volumes of training there does not seem to be a bunting of the antibiotic effect and that's even when it's performed in the same day. There was some evidence that perhaps even at somewhat higher levels that maybe there was a negative effect on fiber type specific, particularly in the type one fibers. Again I think it's a little premature to draw strong influences on that. But what I would say is I think the general recommendations that I would make from the literature that we have like you said if possible space it out so that if you're doing resistant training Monday, Wednesday Friday you want to do six days of week training. Do you aerobic training in your alternative days? Do you think there's this Saturday? If not possibly do a morning afternoon type thing or evening we do it's a resistance training the morning cardio in your evening and at worst if you have to do them in the same session do you resist always do the resistance training first because if nothing else the aerobic training can compromise your energy levels to do the string string it can compromise the performance. So that and itself would have a negative effect if you're going to compromise performance on your results. I do also want to point out that this is again a very nuanced topic so how much resistance training you're doing, how much aerobic training. So it's particularly with the aerobic training, are you doing long slow distance or you're doing six days a week of marathon running training? Yeah that's going to certainly start to have negative effects on your muscle development. If you're walking 10,000 steps a day 12,000 steps a day very unlikely that's going to have any negative effect. If you're doing three high intensity interval training sessions per week very unlikely that's going to have a negative effect. So there's a spectrum on these things. It's not these are not yes window questions that I can give a cookie cutter response but on a general basis you need to think at the very least being tuned with your body and that's to me one of the most important things I can communicate to the audience is to really start to be in tune with your body if you feel you need extra time off you're probably overdoing it and I think a lot of times people are just oblivious again to a routine and it's just a half to do this, half to do this and try to be intuitive. Use your intuition and if you think you need a day off take a day off take a day off the cany tune is off. D-load periods when done properly can be beneficial where you're having periods of reduced training frequency particularly if you're training very hard. If you're doing the typical type of work out that most gen pops through you probably don't need a deal out because you're not training hard enough to warrant that but certainly if if you're a very serious exercise or bodybuilders particular and high level athletes into spurcing regimented periods of reduced training frequency volume intensity I think are very important. How do people that are endurance athletes like that are training for race or whatever do that? I mean like can they still incorporate their resistance training in their obviously very extensive endurance training program without overtraining is it even? Yeah so one thing I would say for endurance so endurance training athletes are somewhat of a fairly compass of fairly wide spectrum but let's take your typical runner. So when we're talking endurance cross country you know doing marathon type running or long distance cross country weight is an issue so you want to train in a way in a more minimal as fashion because higher volume programs will tend to put on muscle mass you want to try as an endurance based athlete to reduce muscle mass development and maximize strength development and that would be using heavier load so that's where you don't want to do your light load training with higher volumes. You'd want to focus more on your let's say three to five rep training for a few sets so that is not going to the volume will be insufficient to substantially increase muscle mass. So volume is a driver of hypertrophy and if you're doing low volume training with heavy loads then generally speaking you're not going to gain much weight in terms of muscle mass but you will be able to get the benefits that will help you optimize your endurance capacity. That makes sense. What about stretching? That's something you know I see people stretching in the gym and they were stretching before I said they're stretching in between sets after working out is it what role the stretching clay in I mean muscle proteins in the scissors or muscle hypertrophy or injury or anything flexibility anything. Yeah so different approach from different levels but on a basic level most people take a stretch in from a flexibility standpoint. To people need to stretch if you need more flexibility then it would be beneficial to stretch. Stretching for the sake or getting what I should say is gaining flexibility for the sake of gaining flexibility is misguided because increased flexibility reduces the stability of the joint so if you can do what you need to do from an activities of daily living standpoint from a mobility flexibility step with no reason to gain more flexibility. If you are a let's say a punter in football you're going to need to be able to get your leg very high or rock-headed in the radio city musical they would you know necessarily want to do if they're not able to do it or even to continue doing it to do some type of flexibility training. But for the majority of people that's not an issue so they'd have to everyone has to assess their own flexibility in these. With that said resistance training itself is a active form of flexibility training and there's been studies that show that compared to static stretching you get similar benefits doing resistance training protocols provided that you're training through a full range emotion. So if you are lifting weights total body through a full range emotion you get similar benefits to static stretching. Combining them is even better if you want to add on your flexibility so if you don't think you've gotten enough flexibility from your resistance training and you need more from an ADL activities. Do you have any other standpoint then go for it? Now I have a approach this also from a muscle protein synthesis this is actually quite interesting. I'm collaborating with the group from Germany and they actually have other research that's recently come out showing that long-term if you stretch now this is a lot of stretching but they did an hour a day using the stretching boot. They got marked hypertrophy like 15% growth in the calf muscles. And the muscle thickness really interesting. Now I don't know who wants to use a stretching boot for an hour a day but it just shows that stretching I mean there is tension during the stretch and that tension muscle tension is a mechanism of hypertrophy. So doing long-duration stretch and these were intense stretches that were like an eight out of ten on the discomfort skill. So not a fun thing so it's not like I'm stretching you know and then we're fairly intense stretch. So it does show that stretching itself can have an out of bulk effect. We recently published a study and there were some papers before this also showing this that what's called intersat stretch loaded stretch. Promoted somewhat greater gains we used it in a calf exercise. So basically subjects did calf raises. What's called plantar flexion for their gastric knee missosolis which of the two or calf muscles. And this was actually within subject design were one leg. They just rested for two minutes between the sets. They did their calf raise and then they rested to it. The other group of the other leg they would do their set and then immediately after the session the set they would descend into a stretch and with the weights they wanted. So they were basically a loaded stretch and it was intense. I mean it was you know they were kind of hurting at that last through what they could to endure towards the end of the stretch and they did it for 20 seconds and then they rested for the rest of the rest interval. And that we found somewhat greater growth in the soviet muscle and really no difference, no substantial difference in the gastric knee missos. Now interestingly the soviet is a type one dominant fiber muscle. It's about 80% soil twitch type one fibers. So what kind of raises the possibility is the stretching at least the loaded stretching that we're doing more specific to type one fibers than type two. Not sure. All this talk makes me think about yoga and I mean yoga I mean it's stretching but it's also like pretty intense. I mean you're holding the pose and your muscles first hurt like what are what are your thoughts on yoga because it somehow do you think it could you could extrapolate a little bit. Yeah so um no again they're different I'm not a yoga specialist but I have I do know something about it and there's different forms of yoga that have some of more clinical strength related focuses within them. You certainly can gain muscle from yoga but is it going to optimize muscle? No because again you're not really as a general real least from what I know through most of the forms of yoga you're really not challenging over time maybe at the beginning when you're a newbie you can that's where you're going to see your gains but over time you don't challenge the muscle sufficiently to need to adapt so you will plateau rather quickly and you'll maintain so you can get some gains at the beginning can there be ways that you might adapt your or third the yoga principles to doing that I would guess but I'm not familiar enough with the strategy to you know decide. Some maybe yoga wouldn't shouldn't be used in instead of a course in training but in addition to. If you want to optimize again I resist as training is paramount regardless all of these other things are potentially beneficial and again if you have well the time in the world don't fall to the extent I should say it would as long as you're not over training to the extent that you don't over train within your body's capabilities but I think if you can only do one my objective somewhat biased of you is that resistance training is irreplaceable. Yeah there were some people that were kind of mostly women wondering oh can you other be considered resistance training and I think you might like oh no that's a good question because you know I could in my head come up with the way where yes it would be so that is good to know one thing I want to talk to you about we're going to and we're getting close to the end and this is something that I know you've talked about before and I've heard people talk about in fact I think Joe Rogan was the first guy to tell me about this and I was like you might just see my face on camera I'm like what this blood flow restriction what is it you know are there benefits drawbacks to it what yeah so again another topic that carried out quite a few studies on so we talked about light load training blood flow restriction training uses a cuff and it's used approximately in the muscle I mean the upper portion of the muscle that you're looking to train the caveat is number one you could only use it on your arms and legs you can't train really your chest your back for your shoulders because you're only can do it proximal but let's take your biceps for instance you would cuff up by the delta I the delta I'd muscle as you're shoulder muscle and you put a place of cuff here and then you do let's say biceps curls and you could try to suppress downs you same thing would be the cuff in the same place with the legs you would cuff at the grind area you know the upper thought very upper region of the fine do let's say leg extensions of squats and you do generally you do this with very light notes they've tried it with heavier loads but doesn't seem to work as well that it's even very light loads 20 to 30 percent one rm but when you're using these very light loads you fatigue much more quickly than if you just did the light load without the cuff so let's say if you're using 30 percent one rm your first set you might get 25 reps and your second set you down at 20 and then 15 and usually the rest intervals are rather short between them good evidence that it promotes similar muscle development to doing traditional resistance training or rather so the rep range strength is similar to light load training without but for restriction your strength is not going to be it's as good for hyperature but strength is somewhat compromised which is always going to heavier loads are going to be better for strength it's just the way it is but you still won't get you doesn't mean this again has been taken it's not binary it's not strength most strength you just don't get quite as much strength but you can substantially improve your strength as well even in well trained subjects now the thing is is it better than light load training well you can light load training I should have mentioned this it is and you've done it you say it's not fun for a lot of people because you just get metabolic acid doses you can you have to train hard you get this burn and when you're doing it over 30 repetitions let's say and you're it's a three second rep that's a 92nd set it's you know 80 and 78 and 90 seconds there's a long period of time we're experiencing that burn quote unquote where's if you're doing a leg let's say a leg extension or by sub scroll with blood for restriction you're cutting the time you're still using the lighter loads meaning that you're not putting as much joint joints stress on but you're cutting the time with that set and thus so somewhat reducing the discomfort is it necessarily better from a results standpoint than light load training there's been no evidence that we've had and so we've had a scene on that but there is some hypotheticals I can I can make cases for certain like the hypothesis epoxy inducible factor is a substance that is thought to increase the hyper trophic response if you say hyper trophic response so there are some logical rationale but we don't have any longitudinal evidence showing it's better and like I said the limitation to it is the inability to do it it's only specific to the extremities there are some potential um I want to at least bring up the fact in general it's shown to be safe but in blood for people that have blood pressure issues I'm not completely convinced there might not be potential issues and the other thing that I want to point out too is that the research we have is in very controlled environments with researchers that know what they're doing you get people they just like put a cuff on their farm starts turning purple where you can really do some damage if you're not doing this properly so you have to be cognizant of how to go about doing it if you're going to apply BFR that was I was going to ask you about that like what kind of cuff are we talking about here like you like I always think of a turnicate with blood pressure and what it's like well so the in research settings there were actually blood pressure type cuffs that are used that we can monitor the pressure that's going on people just use like bandana ties that and they use a rating scale like a discomfort scale of one to ten and saying you should be at a six or a seven but a lot of times people don't gauge their one to ten well and they can be they're saying they're a seven and their arms turning purple so you got to be careful yeah well this has been a really enlightening podcast for me really really really appreciate I'd love to ask you before we before we go on sure about your your personal routine I mean you're a busy busy guy you're your professor you're publishing a lot of scientific papers you're an educator and you're also like very spoken on social media talk about like what how do you find time and what is your routine kind of generally speaking look like sure so for me exercises like brushing a teeth you have to do it that's not really fun for me anymore because I train hard when I do train and that's uh used resistance trading was um but I my routine is much more streamlined from what it used to be and number one just time factors I'm not looking to I was a former bodybuilder and if I was bodybuilding I'd be doing something much different than I'm doing now and as I've got an older the recovery issues start to come in so I'm on a four day week of resistance training routine I do basically a two on one off two once a two on and then I take a rest and I train two additional days and take another couple days off I do an upper lower split my workouts last 45 minutes to an hour so I'm training like three and a four hours a week um I train quite hard when I do train you know all sets are within that I want to two reps of failure and sometimes I do do a set to all that failure I do again lower one day upper the other and I do look every day to get substantial steps I focus on a step count so I target it 12 12000 steps a day roguer when I say a robot titrating just the general step count which is for a real health and again my focus at this point is making sure that I'm maintaining my health that's the most paramount to me and you know still looking good buzz is an issue but I'm not looking to step on stage at this point and thus again it's goal specific and lifestyle specific so I'm so busy as you point it out with not training with research and teaching and also travel that getting the workouts and when I travel by the way it's even now coming out to you at San Diego it's going to be tough to maybe I'll get one day where I usually would get two with a workout but it comes more difficult one of them away and those are kind of structured deloads for me. What about your protein intake to you is that like one point six yeah maybe even a little more I just make sure I don't my cramadage it but I make sure that I'm getting I know just in general what I need to eat and I say a little more is not good hurt me so I'm probably getting a little more than that. Is it hard when you're traveling too? No I mean I was a breakfast this morning I had my omelet and cheese and yeah I'll make sure I get that. Awesome well so Brad you're all of our social media you've got two books can you mention the books and then maybe so you're on Twitter you're very active on Twitter and you tweet very interesting studies and I follow you on Twitter you're also on Instagram you're very active there and you again you're you're breakdown of the studies are great so definitely want to make sure people follow you on on your social media channels. Thank you yeah somewhere too books I have a textbook which is much more technical for those who want to get into like the weeds of science it's called the science and development of muscle hypertrophy published by human kinetics and and that's a hardcover that's a series textbook we use a graduate level for exercise science students but I mean if you have a background something like yourself certainly would understand it but I also have a consumer friendly textbook on optimizing muscle mass quad the the max muscle plan and that's also human kinetics both of them can be found on Amazon and yeah you could follow me just go go meet and you will find it. So you're at Brad show and felt on Twitter and at Brad show and felt PhD on Instagram. Brad pleasure thank you so much for all the great information. Thank you for having

But I think where ketone shine is using exogenous ketones as a means to preserve performance, resilience in extreme environments. There are so many different factors that need to come into play when you're choosing to do a ketone diet, including monitoring. People really need to track nutrients, track calories, some people put, you know, they eat a ketone joint diet, but they put the same amount of food on the plate and the caloric density of the ketone diet is like 50% higher. So you can't eat. So typically, you know, we have autofeedback mechanisms that will tell us when we're associated with full, but for some people they don't work well. So they do need to count calories and macrony trance and track, at least initially so they have some idea of how many calories are you going to eat it. Hey everyone, I'm sitting here with Dr. Dom Dagestino, who is an associate professor at the University of South Florida. He's also a research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Coognition. His research lab focuses on metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, ketone supplements, among others. I'm super excited to have you back on the podcast, Dom. It's been six and a half years or so. It's been quite some time since we had a conversation. And since then, ketone, or as it's called for sure in the popular world, has really, it's exploded in popularity. And I feel like with that explosion and popularity, it's, it's lost a little bit of, it's become a little bit more of a brand and in the popular mind and less of a distinct metabolic state. And so I'm excited to have you here to talk about the science, to give us a refresher about the science of ketogenicis, ketosis, ketogenic diets, ketone supplements and all those things. And as someone that has been researching it over the years, who's been practicing ketogenic diets personally for also many years. Maybe we can kind of just start with a refresher. What ketogenicis is? Yeah, I think that gets lost in, you know, all the noise because it has been commoditized, it's sort of speak and commercialized in ways that are not always very good. So a ketogenic diet is unique from a dietary therapy point of view, and that it's the only diet that we know of that is defined by an objective biomarker. So that's ketones. And you measure that in your blood and your urine and also in your breath, right? So there's different ways to do that. If you are not in a state of hyper ketoneemia elevated ketones, you're technically not on a ketogenic diet. And what most people don't really appreciate is that to really get higher levels of ketones that are therapeutically linked to what it's used to treat, which is like neurological disorder, seizures, and things like that, you really have to increase the fat, drop the carbohydrates especially, but moderate the protein, and really consume a really high fat diet. And that's not always sort of appreciated in the mainstream. And a clinical diet is probably not the best choice for a lot of people, a clinical ketogenic diet. But there are variations of the diet from a four to one, which is a classical ketogenic diet, which is 90% fat, and one part protein and carbohydrates. And then all the way on the other end of the spectrum, there's the modified ketogenic diet or modified atkins, or low glycemic index therapy, or LGIT. And that's more of a one to one ketogenic diet is personally kind of what I follow. And I think you can construct a diet in a way that produces a mild state of ketosis. I think that could be a good lifestyle diet. But it's far different than the classical ketogenic diet, which was used for pediatric epilepsy. But they both have therapeutic effects that we can delve into. Can you give us an example of that type of diet and also what is defined as being in either mild ketosis to actually, you know, basically identify you as being in a state of ketosis from a ketogenic diet, or even from other, we can talk for other ways obviously. We've had a lot of people in the podcast talking about fasting. Yeah. So a ketogenic diet produces ketosis by suppressing insulin, right? And I think of it as like almost like insulin suppression therapy. So when you fast, you suppress the hormone insulin, you deplete liver glycogen, and then that accelerates beta oxidation fatty acids. And it's the oxidation fatty acids in the liver or the over oxidation fatty acids that accelerates production of citochore. And then that condenses to acetylacidate and beta hydroxypurate. So that's accelerated at a maximal state with fasting. And you can mimic that state of fasting with a classical ketogenic diet, which is like 90 to 80 percent fat. With a level of carbohydrate that almost has no effect on insulin really. So you maintain, so in many ways it mimics fasting and that you have a low insulin, low IGF1, a little bit suppression of the M2R because protein is moderated to. And then that diet is used classically for epilepsy. And then there's that's the four to one ketogenic diet. And extreme cases they use a five to one ketogenic diet. But and then if you move down the spectrum, it's three to one, two to one, and then modified acens, which is like a 1.5 to one ketogenic diet. To a low glycemic index diet. So what that would mean is far as to give an example for me. So yesterday I counted my macros and I had 200 grams of protein, 150 grams of fat, and 50 grams of carbohydrates. So 200 grams of protein compared to a combination of 150 grams of fat and 50 grams, or 150 grams of protein, sorry, and 50 grams of carbohydrates. So that would be a 1 to 1. So I have 200 grams of fat, 150 grams of protein and 50 grams of carbs. Right? So it's 200 grams and 200 grams. So that's how, you know, that's how it's constructed in the world of epilepsy or dietary therapies by grams, not percentages. So that's a one to one ketogenic diet. And that sounds extremely high in fat, right? 200 grams of fat and 150 grams of protein. But that's actually the very liberal, more loose version of the ketogenic diet that produces a very mild state of elevated ketones. Whereas a four to one ketogenic diet would be like 400 grams of fat to like, you know, 90 grams of protein and 10 grams of carbohydrates, right? So that would be very high in fat. So they both interestingly, the researcher of the years have shown that they both have anti-seizure effects, and we're getting a better appreciation for a more liberal version of the ketogenic diet that is not so protein restricted and not so extremely carbohydrate restricted. Then something like a low glycemic index diet, which can produce little or no ketones, it can still have an anti-seizure effect and still have benefits, even independent of high ketones. So that's kind of interesting to me because it was always thought of that you needed to get really high ketones to achieve a therapeutic effect. But it looks like you could probably get many benefits from low ketones, but you're also suppressing insulin and, suppressing a lot of other pathways that are, you know, therapeutic. And so they're altering, I should say, different pathways. What? I don't know if I answer your question, but yeah, I'm just trying to, there's very many terms of the ketogenic diet. And I think that over the last 10 years, I guess it's longer than that. I think in 2008, Dr. Eric Kossoff from Johns Hopkins, he worked with Dr. John Freeman, the late John Freeman, and developed a modified acenst diet or modified ketogenic diet for adult epilepsy. And it was published that the diet can work for adults too, back in 2007 or 8, think around that time. So we have many variations of the ketogenic diet even used clinically. And then when people talk about the ketogenic diet in the mainstream, that could be anything. Typically, it means carbohydrate, you know, restriction, and it could be the carnivore diet. It could be, and we can talk about that. And there are many different variations, but clinically what you have is a five to one, which is very extreme high fat, four to one, three to one, two to one. And then a modified ketogenic diet or low glycemic index diet. And all of them are therapeutic in one way or another, and they're used for a variety of different neurological disorders, seizure disorders, metabolic disorders. But some are more efficacious for others. It depends on the individual. It depends on compliance, on the family. There's a lot to be considered when it comes to implement these approaches. For a person who is not done a ketogenic diet before, what would be a good starting point? Like, you know, would you want to start with something that's one of the more like four or five to one, you know, because from my own personal experience, and I'm going to be doing another ketogenic diet very soon. I just haven't gotten my backmarker's mentioned, but it was very challenging for me, even someone that does a lot of intermittent fasting, to really, to get into ketosis and to really stay. And also what levels, like if someone's measuring, and we can talk about biomarkers and measuring things, but like, you know, what would be considered a mild state of ketosis, if you're wanting to go by ketone levels. Yeah. So, very good question. It's very context-dependent. So, if you are using the ketogenic diet to manage a metabolic or a metabolic, linked disorder or a brain disorder like epilepsy, right? You probably want to start with a clinical ketogenic diet and be under the supervision of a registered dietitian and a neurological team. So, this is what they use in epilepsy. And there used to be an induction phase where they would fast you, and that actually helps facilitate metabolic switching, which is the transition into ketosis from being primarily a glucose oxidizer to a fat and ketone utilization. So, you can speed that with fasting. But then you have most people are doing it, you know, for as a lifestyle approach. So, in our clinical trial that we're doing using in non-diabetic people, they tend to be a little bit on the heavier side, maybe, but they don't have type 2 diabetes, they're using it to optimize their metabolic parameters and in glycemic variability. We transition them into a ketogenic diet over four to six weeks. So, we titrate the carbohydrates down. And what we have found in my colleague has found Dr. Allison Hall, who's working, she's at the Florida Medical Clinic and has a wellness program that compliance and adherence to the diet and ultimately the results are better. If you take someone who's eating two, three hundred grams of carbohydrates a day, that's standard, you know, American diet, and you drop them down to, you know, a hundred and then the 75 and then 50 at about the four to six week point. And you get a very nice improvement in many different subjective and objective, you know, biomarkers. They feel better signs of mood are increased anxiety using the grad 7 tests, the PHQ9, SSQ sleep actually improves. If you were to abruptly start the ketogenic diet, you're more likely to get side effects and you're more likely to get things like sleep destruction, lipid abnormalities, elevated triglycerides, you get a quick spike in LDL. This can occur if you rapidly start the ketogenic diet, especially in the context of not calorie restricting. When you calorie restricting ketogenic diet, it sort of mitigates some of the many of the things that are negatively associated with high fat diets, you know, so the transitions a lot easier if you calorie restricting with the ketogenic diet. So that needs to be appreciated. But if for lifestyle, I would recommend if you're not used to, if you're not on a carbohydrate restricted diet, to ease into it and titrate it in over time, if you're not in a rush, right? So for me personally, I follow what would be considered a very modified supplemented ketogenic diet that would be more along the lines of a low glycemic index diet. So I have about, you know, 10 to some days, 20% of my diet is actually carbohydrates, but in the form of fiber-svetrable. So non, essentially non-lycemic carbohydrates. So a lot of leafy greens, a lot of, the carbohydrates that make up my ketogenic diet are on the, like, typically have about one-third to almost half of it is fiber. And has very little impact or actually can improve glycemic variability or reduce it. And it moderates the digestion of protein and helps delay gastric absorption. So the nutrients and things that I'm eating actually get into circulation in a protracted way. So the fiber helps to slow digestion. And so fat and fiber together are really important for the ketogenic diet. And that's not something classically that's accepted or considered. But as we learn more about ketogenic diets, we have an appreciation for the types of fats that are in the diet and actually incorporating fiber, not only to improve digestion and protein assimilation, but to enhance and preserve the gut microbiome, which is to be appreciated. There was a lack of that understanding 20 or 30 years ago, and it came into the conversation about 10 years ago. And now it's actually become a major focus of a lot of these dietary interventions, low-carving ketogenic diets. We need to appreciate fiber as part of improving the diversity and maintaining the gut microbiome. You've just answered one of the main questions I had about being on a ketogenic diet and somehow intelligently designing a diet that had include more fiber and your thoughts on how fiber would be important. It's really interesting to hear you say that because the other thing is that fiber you are making butary in the gut when you're bacteria is making it microbiome inside your gut. And that is feeling the colonic diets, giving energy. Is it, for me, when I was doing the ketogenic diet, I did find that I ended up just naturally fasting more because it's so difficult things I could eat. It was like, well, I can't snack on some macadamias and a person in the point. It was like, well, this is too much the brachios of protein. I'd have to not eat. I found that I was basically this dietary, doing a lot of dietary restriction alongside the ketogenic diet. But I also found that when I would add like dark leafy green greens, the portions really made a difference for me. Like, for example, cooked spinach, like you don't think about it, but like because you're cooking it, it's like a lot more spinach than you would think it is. And so like a little serving of it looks small, but it's actually quite a bit. And so I noticed that cooked, if I had like a portion of cooked spinach, you know, I wouldn't totally take me out of ketosis, but it wasn't getting me into that higher level. So, you know, I would go from like 3 mm or down to, you know, 1. So, um, so you were cooking your spinach. Yeah, if you take raw leafy greens, so the cell walls intact, but when you cook vegetables, green vegetables, they heat, ruptures of cell walls. So you make the carbohydrates a little more accessible, even if it's green, leafy vegetables. So that's going to impact, believe it or not, you know, within the context of a ketogenic diet. It makes a difference. If you have greens that are raw, the glycemic impact is essentially nothing, but if you cook your greens and, you know, it does make it proportionally much smaller. So you're more likely to eat more, but it also makes the carbohydrates accessible because the heat is rupturing the cell wall. So, you're similar to like juicing or a smoothie or something like that, right? So, although with the smoothie, that's the fiber and so, in with it too. So that's a big consideration that people need to consider. Yeah, so yeah, but volume. But with a salad, like salad that would, an example of a salad on a modified ketogenic diet, or modified that can style it would be, you know, fatty fish, like salmon, leafy greens, like arugula, maybe some spinach and and romaine lettuce and stuff and extra virgin olive oil, lots of that, and I tend to mix it with MCT oil. So a combination of extra virgin MCT, MCT, we can get into that as a ketogenic fat and some, like nuts are great, but I don't go too crazy with nuts, but a little bit of walnuts. So you have fatty fish, a little bit of leafy greens and a very fatty ketogenic dressing that's made, you know, with MCT and olive oil and herbs and things like that, with fit in well with a ketogenic diet. So you get mono-insaturated fats, right, and you're getting polyensaturated fats and MCTs, which are saturated, but go to a different, they do not disrupt the gut microbiome in ways that other types of fatty acids do. And that's the kind of nutrition that would be no effect on a continuous glucose monitor, and it would so your glycemic response would be like nothing, and your ketones would likely go up because of the macronutrient ratio, but also because of the MCTs that are better in it too. So that's a very normal kind of typical diet that I eat. So most of your greens are most of your carbohydrates are raw. If I do like, we do broccoli a lot in a sparragus, so I lightly steam it or cook it, but I don't make it to the point where it's like mushy. So I lightly steam vegetables, like cauliflower, broccoli, sparragus, and I always have a salad with my meal. And with the ketogenic diet, when you wear a continuous glucose monitor, you can observe that the order in which you eat your food will impact the glycemic response. And if you're attenuating the glycemic response by eating foods in a certain order, certain combination, it's also reducing the insulin. So you need to continually have a suppression of insulin insulin signaling to maintain a state of ketosis. So if you're in a state of fasting ketosis or on a ketogenic diet and you inject a little bit of insulin, you'll see your ketones go down. There'll be a delayed response. That's because that reduction in insulin plays a big role. When you increase insulin, it dramatically increases glycolysis, you know, translocation of the glut transporters to the membrane and things like that. So you could do that. Exogers ketones can actually increase insulin if it's too much. And we can talk about the different variations of that and why that could be problematic in some conditions. But you know, taking a big hit of protein, like drinking way protein, will kick you out of ketosis because you're going to get the insulin response from the central amino acids and branched amino acids too can increase that. So you could, so it's really important to incorporate fat and fiber within the oil, especially up front. Yeah, to attenuate any kind of insulin. And you learn these things as you go when there's a learning curve to the ketogenic diet and I found I went right into the classical ketogenic diet. I bought the book, you know, the ketogenic diet for pediatric epilepsy and now it's the ketogenic diet for epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Same author, Dr. Eric Hassoff, Dr. Mackenzie, Servenca from Johns Hopkins and the team there. And they advocate for a variety of different types of ketogenic diets and then adjusting it to the patient and there are circumstances to it's going to be important in the world of epilepsy. So we're talking. So it remains the only widely accepted application of the ketogenic diet. At this time is really epilepsy and metabolic disorders like glucose transporter type one deficiency syndrome, pdh deficiency and things like that. Interestingly, they're inborn and arisen metabolism that are contraindicated with a ketogenic diet. Like, you know, carnitine transferase activity, cpt1, you know, whether it be primary or secondary to. So it could be deadly. A ketogenic diet could potentially kill you if you have carnitine, you know, transferase deficiency. So that's a whole other topic we could. You bring up an interesting point with the contraindications because I'm interested in a few of those aspects. So for one, perhaps other genetic variants that maybe aren't as rare. So for example, you know, apoe for allele, which, you know, the core of the population has one of those alleles. Like how is it known how people with that. Polymorphism, respond, ketogenic diets and also you you mentioned, you know, briefly about people that sort of race into the ketogenic diet without any sort of carbohydrate, slowly carbohydrate restriction and how it can elevate some biomarkers like triglycerides. For example, I'd love to talk about like, what biomarkers do you think are good to monitor and to see if someone is favorably or unfavorably responding to a ketogenic diet. And at what point would you, like how many times did you, would you do it before you sort of give up and sort of modify the diet or change that maybe types of fat. You mentioned the types of fat or, you know, yeah, yeah. It's like that. Yeah, I think it's important. A lot of people jump into the ketogenic diet and, you know, just from a standard diet, it's important to test the water. If you're not using it for epilepsy or another disorder, you want to titrate the carbohydrates down and track and monitor along the way. Maybe do like cut your carbs in half or by two thirds or whatever. And then at the four or six week mark get blood work again and look at your glucose response check for hypoglycemia things like that. So, so apoe 4, you know, that's about one quarter, right, of the population. I get this question a lot and I don't think it's ideal, even the books on ketogenic diet say that it's an unnatural diet and it's not healthy and it's not sustainable. So, these are from the people who research the ketogenic diet who publish the most on the ketogenic diet, who are in the trenches, using this diet as a medical therapy for like known conditions that are responsive to the ketogenic diet. So, with that said, you know, dietary teams that manage patients for up to 10 years, 20 and even I had some correspondence with the team that are measuring people and cardiovascular parameters too, they're heart health for 30 years. So, in patients, for example, with important areas of metabolism, that need to be on a like a classical type ketogenic diet for like three decades. And they're still doing all their blood work looks great. So, I think that's a good example that the diet's not going to kill you. It would have done that a long time ago in these patients that are on like a 4-1 or 3-1 ketogenic diet. But I think it's important to when in the context of apoe 4, the high fat, extremely high fat is probably not ideal. And so, you want to take probably a more moderate approach and just restrict carbohydrates. I think it's really important to get lots of fiber, lots of fighter nutrients. We know the data on fiber is just really, really good. So, there's just no argument. People argue against fiber, but I think the data for fiber is really good for not just for the microbiome, for fighter nutrients. The micro nutrients, as you know, there's been a lack of appreciation for micro nutrients and ketogenic diets. And that has caused problems like salinium deficiency, which led to cardiovascular myopathy. And there's case reports where people have literally, I think one or two, or people have literally died from cardiovascular myopathy because of salinium deficiency associated with the ketogenic diet. So, you want to make sure you supplement appropriately. But you don't have to supplement if you formulate the ketogenic diet appropriately with the right type of foods, but it's not always possible. But for apoe and getting back to your apoe. So, a diet that's moderate and fat, moderate and protein and, and I think of carbohydrates is fiber. So, plant-based fiber, moderate protein, and then fats. The types of fats are important. So, mono-insaturated fatty acids, as opposed to long-chain, like saturated fats, medium-chain triglycerides are probably helpful. There is a study that was done using a product that is Coprylic triglyceride, which is MCT, at the time it was called AC-1202. By X-ARA, it was a product that was designed for Alzheimer's disease as an alternative energy substrate that would be given. And the results of the study showed that improvements in mild cognitive impairment were associated with ketones. So, there was a correlation with that, but they did not see the correlation people with apoe 4, which is kind of interesting. Although, I think a larger study probably would have shown a difference, but I think the take-home message is that a diet that's very, like super restrictive and high-end fats, probably not ideal for apoe 4 patients. And adding ketones in the form of exogenous ketones could probably be ideal. There was a case report by on a patient that I am familiar with, that familiar with with the wife of the patient that had passed away, but he was maintained on a ketogenic diet, and then later on ketone esters and exogenous ketones. And was did quite well in the diet for a long time, and it wasn't restrictive ketogenic diet, but he did much better with ketone supplementation, as it means to improve his cognition and different behavioral parameters too. So, I think that would probably be the better way to go. I'm very cautious and speculating and giving medical advice. I'm not a medical doctor. I am a professor and I'm professing that I think that a more moderate-style Mediterranean, like low-carb slash ketogenic diet with supplementation, the form of things like omega-3 fatty acids, MCT oils. The fatty acids comprising the diet should be more along the lines of monolinsaturated fats, and not so much heavy saturated fats, which in the context of apoe 4 is probably not a good thing to chronically maintain a state of ketosis with super high saturated fat. So, maybe more apocados, more of the nuts, and olive oil salmon, which is a good type of polyunsaturated fatty acid. I mean, that's the kind of diet that I was doing and we'll try again. We'll talk a little bit more about why I'm so interested in ketogenic diets. I don't have epilepsy and I'm certainly not someone that eats a standard American diet either, but there are so many interesting effects that being in a state of ketosis. And now having the ketone bodies elevated to me are very interesting and I think possibly beneficial for health span, for cognition and so. But with the supplemented ketones that you keep mentioning, like with respect to having a diet, you follow, which is more of the low glycemic index, one to one ratio with supplemented ketones. It's another really big area that's exploded over the past few years, and can you talk a little bit about for people that aren't familiar, like supplemental ketones, there's different types of supplemented ketones you mentioned. Yeah, ketone esters, salts, and then even MCT, oils or powders. So maybe we can kind of jump into that a little bit. Yeah, I think the question is, like, why would you even want to short-circuit the state, you know, why would you want to circumvent the dietary intervention that produces ketosis? I eat the ketogenic diet. Why would you want to circumvent that? I mean, the reasons are kind of obvious and and just throw ketones into the mix, like what's going to happen physiologically? I mean, there's a, there are people who are unwilling or unable to do the ketogenic diet, so that was the motivation behind developing and testing and ultimately publishing a number of, you know, articles and studies on exogenous ketones. And there are different formulations and not all types of the ketones or formulations of combinations are applicable to different disorders, right? I think some, some more, some conditions are more responsive to ketone esters, whereas some are more responsive to ketone salts or formulations of MCT ketones salts, right? So, in, when I first got into this research in 2008 or nine, I believe I contacted a number of people who remain to be icons in this field. So, Dr. Richard Veech, I like to always, you know, acknowledge him as being a pioneer in developing the rationale and developing ketone esters, you know, and the rationale for using them and writing a number of reviews that actually motivated me to pursue this path. Dr. Henri Brinninggrabber, George K. Hill, Dr. Theodore Van Italy, I mean, they're all sort of friends and collaborators and they published on this. So, I was really focused on the ketogenic diet, but when you're writing a grant, a federal grant, and you're trying to sell this approach as a means to, you know, reduce seizures or enhance more workfighter performance resilience and things like that, the high-fat diet is still look upon as something that is very negative. So, the question was, can you develop a ketogenic diet in a pill? And, essentially, that was sort of the path we took with ketone esters. And, so the ketogenic diet, it was my understanding that the body at the time, that you need to have adaptations over time, that would change your physiology, that would change your brain neuroformacology, that would then have it, you know, an anti-seizeur effect. And that happens. There are physiological, by changing your system, your system's physiology, your changing your brain neuroformacology, and your brain metabolism. So, your brain is switching from using glucose in pretty much only glucose to using glucose and ketones. It never switches completely off of glucose and ketone. So, the homiocytic mechanisms that maintain your blood glucose are very powerful, so your glucose pretty much stays normal, but insulin goes down, so that's the thing that we see. But, the ketogenic diet, the effects of the ketogenic diet are, and sorry, it's a long-winded version, but I want to kind of provide a framework. So, it was, you know, I was educated on the role of ketones as a metabolite, and also later as a signaling molecule, as a drug-like mediator of the ketogenic diet. So, we produce these endogenous metabolites, and they not only serve as alternative energy for the brain and the heart and other tissues, but then they have signaling effects that mediate many of the beneficial effects associated with being anestate at therapeutic ketosis. So, that's things like elevating a denson, activating various ketone receptors, GPR, 109A receptor, for example, anti-inflammatory pathways. I was really interested in the oxidative stress associated with high pressure oxygen, so we measured like superoxide anion production using a Thidium molecule, like the fluorescence, and showed that mitochondrial Ross production goes down with a beta hydroxybuterate and ketone molecules. So, there was all these things that were happening as a consequence of the hyper ketoneemia. So, undoubtedly there's things that happen with the ketogenic diet that are therapeutic and very beneficial that don't happen with exogenous ketones, but there's a lot of overlap. And then later, as we develop ketone esters and ketone salts and use MCTs, we saw that if we administered these things to animals that are not on a ketogenic diet, we saw remarkable anti-seasier effects, anti-cancer effects, we saw changing the brain neuropharmacology, meaning that the GABAurgic tone went up. So, GABA is made from glutamate via an enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase. So, we have glutamate is the most ubiquitous neurotransmitter in the system. And our body and we make, and that's an excitatory neurotransmitter that activates the amper receptors and NMD receptors, and an glutamate via the conversion to GABA through glutamic acid decarboxylase is a brain stabilizing calming neurotransmitter. And I've even measured my own neurotransmitters and showed that GABA is twice as higher than what would be expected. My GABA deglutamate ratio. Right, and animal models we see this too, we did an animal model of angel min syndrome, which is responsive to, we knew from case reports that the seizures could be silenced with the ketogenic diet. And we had an animal model of angel min syndrome, and we had ministered ketone ester with a standard diet and saw an increase in GABA and 65 and 67. And essentially an increase in GABA. And then that resulted in what we saw increase in learning memory, we saw, you know, anti-anxiety effects, and the increasing GABAurgic tone likely contributes to the anti-seasier effect of that. And many anti-seasier drugs like bi-gavitrin and other drugs work through GABA. So the ketogenic diet works through many different mechanisms in synergy and one of them is GABA. So we're sort of interested in it from that perspective. So you can replicate and mimic many of the effects that I'm interested in from a neurological perspective, never protective, with simply administering exogenous ketones to animals at least on a standard diet. And this has actually spawned many the preclinical animal model data was so compelling that it has inspired not from our lab from other investigators, you know, looking at this too. And it doesn't have clinical trials that are ongoing right now. If you just go to clinical trials.gov and Google and just type in ketone supplement, I think you get like 30 or 40 clinical trials that are looking at ketone supplements and just a few years ago there was none, right? So there's a lot of other people instead of us. Looking at this idea of, I guess you're going to call it a ketogenic diet in a drug, but I think of the exogenous ketones are calorie containing molecules that are essentially in some ways founded nature, some of them are some of them aren't. They do elevate a bio-identical ketone bodies in the blood and tissues. So in many ways they're not so much like a drug, but they are, it's like creatinine monohydrate, right? So you can take creatinous found in meat and found in other things and we can create, we can take exogenous creatinine has not only effect on skeletal muscle but on the brain. And I think we're getting an appreciation for creatinous, like a nitropic even. So I think I look at ketones as being kind of the next creatinine, but it's going to take a while for the research. I think there's like 700 or more trials or studies on creatinine showing the efficacy and the positive fact, whereas maybe there's maybe like 50 to 100 with ketones, but it's expanding very rapidly. So it's very nascent literature, but the nascent literature has spawned many other labs outside of our lab and labs that were doing it well before our lab. But I became so interested in this idea that I just changed my whole research direction away from drugs to look at diet and supplements. Sorry, that was long-winded. No, it's fantastic, so much information. You mentioned that in different contexts these different types of ketones supplements can have varying effects or be used for different things. If you're just looking at ketone, beta hydroxybutorate levels as a endpoint, what would be the difference in taking a ketone ester versus a ketone salt? How long would you see an increase in the beta hydroxybutorate levels? How transient? Is it side effects wise with these different, and the formulation as well? There's all kinds of formulation. Yeah. So you can get an elevation of ketones for one hour or six to eight hours, depending on the formulation and depending upon if you took the ketone supplement with an epistemic or taken it with food, or combined for example, a ketone ester with a ketone electrolyte salt. If you take ketone salts and you combine it with medium-chain triglycerides, the fat, delays, gastric absorption, and pushes the pharmacokinetic curve if you will to the right. This is important. You get a slower, a little bit slower elevation of blood ketones, and then you have a significant sustainment of hyper ketoneemia over time. The decrease in the spike, so a very rapid spike in ketones contributes to a release and insulin. So if you consume a ketone ester at a large dose on an epistemic, you have a very large increase in beta hydroxybutorate and a pseudo-astate to depending on the formulation. And it's that rate of change, the relative rate of change of metabolites, similar to like, if you have a very rapid relative spike in elucine, it's going to kick on skeletal muscle proteins synthesis. But if it's a gradual spike, maybe it won't kick on the metabolic machinery associated with skeletal muscle proteins. The rapid elevation of ketones can produce a counterregulatory effect, which is a release and insulin, and then that can shut down your own natural ketone production. So the way to go about doing it is to formulate something that causes a predictable, but gradual rise in ketones and sustains that for a period of time, and has a predictable decrease over time. So the way to do that simply is to take the way that I do it on a daily basis is beta hydroxybutorate. That's bound to electrolyte sodium that has sodium potassium, calcium magnesium in that formulation. So balance electrolytes more or less like the electrolyte supplements that are on the market. So element is one, I think maybe liquid IV or data reader, even these things. But the higher sodium, but you want to match it with some potassium, calcium magnesium. And then the electrolytes in of themselves will actually delay gastric absorption a little bit. So salt does that, and if you combine that with MCT too, that could delay it. But ketone salts, the salts can actually delay gastric absorption, so it's not so much of a rapid rise. If you take a beta hydroxybutorate ester, you have one, three-butane dial, typically is bound to beta hydroxybutorate when you consume that. The beta hydroxybutorate is quickly liberated, so it spikes your glucose, or your ketones up very high, but in regards to glucose, actually that comes down pretty low. So it gives me that question, why does glucose drop, so down into hypoglycemic ranges, with a single large dose, like 30 to 50 milliliters of like a pure ketone ester, so I don't like that, right? Yeah, so in the beginning, I thought it was insulin, and it is insulin, so the threshold for me at least, and I measure insulin quite often in response to this. And I find, if you take a ketone supplement and it boosts you 1 to 2 millimolar, like a delta, a change, and increase, then the elevation of insulin is almost imperceptible, according to like the assays that we're using. But if you were to consume a ketone ester and get up into the 3, 4, and 5 range, then that produces an elevation of insulin equivalent to eating, you know, drinking like two to 4 ounces of OJ, or like 10 grapes, or like a small orange, right? So for me, it goes from like 3 to 6 or 8 or 10, right, or insulin, my blood insulin levels. And it's equivalent to maybe eating about 30 or 40 grams of protein, so you would get that amount. Whereas if you consume, you know, keto start or another exogenous ketone supplement, and you consume it like 10 grams of BHB, pure BHB, and you get that elevation of about 1.5 millimolar. Is that a full packet of ketone start? Keto starts about, it's kind of like double, like almost like double dose in a way, so I usually do half a packet, and then just not drinking right now, right? Yeah, yep. So consuming a full packet, typically I get about 1.5 millimolar, so I feel the effect, but I've actually consumed two packets, and I start to get a bump in insulin, but one packet, no. And the bump in insulin is relatively small, probably because the mineral load is delaying, you know, the absorption into the system a little bit. So I think that's really important because we know like insulin suppression is also important for the anti seizure effect, so we think that a reduction in glycolysis is their part of the scenario of the anti seizure effect of the ketone diet because 2Doxyglupos has a pretty strong anti seizure effect, and that is being advocated and used clinically in some studies as the ketogenic diet and a drug. So a glycolytic inhibitor, 2Doxyglupos, so you consume this drug, and it's like 25 milligrams per kilogram, and if you go higher than that, then it becomes cardio toxic. So it's not an ideal approach, but it inhibits the glycolytic pathway in a way that sort of mimics effects of the ketogenic diet. And so when we increase insulin, insulin stimulates glycolysis, and I think that that could be a negative thing, and the context of maybe cancer, seizures, or other things were interested in therapeutically managing. So I view the ketogenic diet and exogenous ketones, and they're not mutually exclusive, but I actually think they're synergistically when they're, you know, when they're combined together. So if you follow a more liberal version of the ketogenic diet like a modified acinst diet or modified ketogenic diet or low glycine again next therapy, which is like a one to one ketogenic diet, and then supplement ketones on top of that, then I think what you have in my opinion is an optimized. ketogenic diet for lifestyle, but also, and it's needs to be, this needs to be studied and validated in clinical trials, but I think it would also be optimal for epilepsy for cancer, for managing type U diabetes, and also for weight loss. So the ketones have a satiating effect on the brain. So the ketones are alternative energy substrate, and when your brain is metabolizing ketones, and it actually experiences low glucose, it doesn't go into an energetic crisis. So it's not signaling that you need to eat, and I think that's really interesting. There have been cases where you could produce a hypoglycemic shock that would be fatal, otherwise fatal, but if your ketones are elevated, you're asymptomatic for hypoglycemia. So that's a remarkable example of the effects of ketones on preserving, maintaining, brain energy metabolism, and that has real world effects in the context of everyday living. And if you go on a diet, you inadvertently need to go into a calorie deficit. So calories do matter. For one thing, and you have to achieve and maintain a protracted calorie deficit to lose weight, and to some extent sustain that weight for a period of time, then you can go back to a more eucalyptic ketogenic diet. But that's, it will necessitate like low glucose low insulin, and you're going to get hungry. But if your ketones are elevated, that's where a ketone shine. They really shine in the context of calorie restriction, or an energy deficit, because you have a better fuel flow to the brain in that context. So if you're on a low calorie diet that's producing a state of hypoglycemia, but your ketones are not elevated, that's going to be a painful diet to adhere to and sustain. Right. What's the, not fun? No. It's funny. Like, I absolutely noticed that when I was doing my ketogenic diet, I was like I said I was doing a lot more intermittent fasting, and it was a lot easier to do. I'm going to do feel safe, I feel safe, but, and this kind of gets into another topic, and I did want to kind of ask you about the difference between, you mentioned the diester for ketoneesters, but there's also monoester, right? Is there a difference in terms of efficacy? If you're just looking, I mean if you're just kind of wanting to elevate your ketone levels, and again, it seems as though I prefer, like, I've done, I've tried all these different types of ketones supplements, and I personally am not a huge fan of the really quick spike, and then like, like to me it's kind of crashing because my glucose levels get so low, and then when the ketones were off, it's like where's my energy? So you have, yeah, hypoglycemia and hypoketoneemia, and you might also be kicking yourself out of ketosis. So it could be a dose thing, the one-three-butane diol beta hydroxybuterate monoester, that was developed by, in part, by Dr. Richard Veech, and that was one of the first ketoneesters that we actually, you know, I became interested in, and it did not have anti-seger effects. So I kind of, I didn't lose enthusiasm because I knew there was so many other molecules that could be developed. So what we worked on a couple of different molecules, and the next one was the diester, actually, first we had the monoester, one-three-butane diol, a cedulacitate monoester, had very strong anti-seger effects. And we could do more of a trans-estrification reaction, it's just more or less a stoichiometric reaction, where you just add more ketones, in this case, the cedulacitate, two-one-three-butane diol. So it's one-three-butane diol, which gets metabolized in the liver, completely, pretty much the beta hydroxybuterate. That molecule with a reaction we can add to a cedulacitate molecules, and both of these things, the monoester and the datate-snasty, they taste like gas. But they have very distinctly different effects, at least in the context of the anti-seger effects. So when we developed the ketone diester, and we used that in our animal model of tonic-lonic seizures, which was, in this case, a high pressure oxygen, but we then tested it in various other seizure models too. It had a very strong anti-seger-neurprotective effect. And then if we use one-three-butane diol or any other ketone, it didn't really have that profound anti-seger effect. So, what is there a chain difference in the GABA? That's an interesting theory, but one of the things that kind of stood out was the elevating acetylacitate seemed to be really important. And some of the animal model work, it was brought to my attention by people who had been studying this for longer than me. One of them was Dr. John Roe. He was looking at beta hydroxybutarate, and acetylacitate, and saying, you know, there's really good literature with acetylacitate and acetone too, having an anti-seger effect. So, the one-three-butane diol acetylacitate diester elevates beta hydroxybutarate, and acetylacitate more or less than a one-to-one ratio. So, we did blood work, and we, you know, we took, we measured blood, and we sent it out to mass spec, and there's, like, kind of like a nice, there's a quick spike up in acetylacitate, and beta hydroxybutarate from the one-three-butane diol, and that's happens over hours. And, and we had a 600% increase in the latency to seizure, which means that animals could go 600% longer, and we published that. And then later, we actually combined the ketone ester with MCT, and saw a little bit of a boost, you know, the MCT seemed to further elevate ketones, and extend the sustainment of ketosis. So, that has been the ester that we've focused mostly on, in our studies, but, at least initially, but then we started tinkering with the ketone salts, and putting ketone salts, and mixing that with MCT. So, ketone salts, alone, or mixed with MCT, seemed to have a lot of favorable effects on glycemic regulation, anti-inside effects. You know, they also have an anti-seager effect, maybe not as strong as the ketone esters, which are just more powerful on a program basis. But, but I personally would not, I have access to these things, and I would not want even if ketone esters tasted great, I would not be consuming them day in and day out. I don't, just for the same reasons, I don't think it's good to spike glucose throughout the day. I don't think it's really favorable to throw a lot of energy in the system in a way, especially if ketones get high, you do get a metabolic gastrodosis, that you can, we see pH drop in our animals, so we measure like, you know, our pH levels, and blood gases, and things like that, and we see that the pH level will drop typically when the ketones get above about 3 millimolar. So that's probably not a good thing. So I'm of the opinion personally and experimentally by, you know, in the idea of keeping exogenous ketones within like, an elevation of 1 to 3 millimolar, I think it's pretty optimal, unless you're managing like a very serious form of epilepsy, or you have glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome or some other important error metabolism, where having higher ketones can be favorable because you have a decrease in other metabolic pathways or transporters, like in the case of glucose transporters, the deficiency. It sounds like though, you know, so for my own personal anecdote, when I was trying the ketone esters, you know, at first it was like, oh, maybe more is better. I think it, you know, at least above 3 millimolar, and I was, you know, I got like 3.5 with consuming about 30 mills of, I believe, the 1, 3, but that monosterone. Yeah, that formulation. And, and it's like, like I said, you know, 30 mills, that's a lot. So, you know, there's people that might be doing that, like, every couple of hours even, it sounds like that could potentially be a dangerous thing to do, especially if they're getting in that range where there could be a pH change, and if they're not measuring it, you know, no one's going to know. So, yeah, it's something, I don't think we know, and I think it's like, if you have like type 2 diabetes, if you have Alzheimer's disease, you know, cancer, I think it's better to spread out the dose too. So, I think, from my perspective, I'd rather take something that's also delivering electrolytes that my body can use, and also that tastes good, and the 1, 3, butane dial is also a consideration, right, because the liver has to work harder. So, it uses the alcohol, the hydrogenase pathway, and I noticed, you know, playing around with these things over time, just 1, 3, butane dial, which is the ketone disorders. By consume that at a certain dose for two weeks, and then get blood work, my liver enzymes are elevated. They're still within normal range, but they creep up into that upper range of normal, consuming, for example, like 1 gram per kilogram per day. But that's the amount that's needed to sustain hyper ketoneemia equivalent to a ketone diet. You know, so I noticed, I feel intuitively that it's probably better to take a more natural form of ketones, where it's just ionically bound to a monovalent or divalent canine, like electrolytes, which are body tend to deplete anyway, when you're on a state of ketosis. So, I use the product element elementy, but once we got the ketone formulation, kind of figured out, you can deliver the same electrolytes that are bound to ketones. So, I think it's a good adjuvant or good supplement to add to a low carb diet, do you keep doing that? How often do you, is this a daily electrolyte sort of supplemental thing that's? When I just use maybe like a small dose in the morning, and I can line it with like creatinine, acetylalcarnatine, and a couple other like toreine. There's some supplements that I think are really beneficial with the ketone diet. They can help boost ketosis, and then when you're on a ketone diet, or oxidizing so much fat, you tend to be deficient in carnitine. And we see this like in kids that are on. So, I think carnitines like really important. The selenium, some studies may show up that that's really important, but I think that's more of the type of foods that you're consuming. I mean, a standard multivitamin too, also would be. Yeah, multivitamin. But I think you can get a lot of nutrition from, you know, I tend to get a lot of eggs and sardines and fish and oysters and things like that, that are very rich. And some things that may be depleted in other people, at least clinically. So, I take a little bit of ketone salts in the morning, and then later in the day like midday, as it picked me up, like I'll do the other two thirds of a packet, you know, and I feel it. Any other supplements that you take or that you know, I think are? Yeah, well, I take, you know, from listening to you a lot, the Omega 3's DHA EPA carnitine because that's really important kind of aspect. If I, if I wasn't taking ketone salts, I would be taking more electrolytes, but I take magnesium. I'm a 3 and 8, and also biooptimizers makes a magnesium breakthrough product, which is like magnesium in like five different forms or six different forms. So, I've measured my blood levels of magnesium and it goes up pretty high. And I take a vitamin D, which was actually low, even though I get tons of sun, and I was supplementing 4 to 8,000 I use a day, and I got blood test done, and I was on the lower end of normal, which was really confusing. So I got another blood test that also that confirmed the other blood test that I was on the lower end of normal. So I got prescription vitamin D, which is vitamin D 2. But then I ran out of that, and I was using another vitamin D supplement from another maker. I think it was mind-body green. I was supplementing with that, and then got another vitamin D test after, and I stayed elevated in the upper range of normal. So maybe I was using a well known vitamin D formulation, that was like from Walgreens or CBS, and it was taking an 8,000 I use a day, and I was still in a low end of normal, even though I'm getting a lot of sun exposure. So this was really probably one of the most weirdest things. Could have been a polymorphism or... Thinking about it. Because there are polymorphisms that some people require, in some cases, 2 to 3 times normal dose to actually just bring you up to like a normal level, like 30 to 48 nanograms per mill. But the other would be that there's been a variety of studies now over the year showing. If you just randomly take different vitamin D supplements off the shelves, like Walgreens, you know, grocery stores. The actual concentration of vitamin D 3 in each supplement varies so widely that you'll often get a supplement that says it's, you know, 4,000 IU, but it's more like 400. I am. And it's really a big problem, honestly. So it is good to find some go-to-reliable brands. Maybe third party sites have tested the concentration of the vitamin D 3. I know Labdore does one and then consumer lab, they actually go around and test the actual concentration of whatever active ingredient in this case vitamin D 3 in a variety of pretty, you know, readily available supplements. So that could be that could have been in as well. Yeah. It really shocked me because I mean, I am out, we're in Florida, I'm outside, you know, working on the farm, shirt off a lot. And I double dose on I'm pushing like the upper limit, I thought vitamin D supplements. And you're getting, you have enough magnesium obviously because these are important. Get a ton. Now have you done a genetic test? Yeah, I did 23 in me, like back in 2010. So I have all the raw data and I haven't put it into it. Right, right, right. Because we do a lot of the vitamin D 3 SNPs, there's a lot of why it a few. And you know, there's several that affect your ability to convert. So there's several steps in vitamin D 3 metabolism. But to convert vitamin D 3, it was vitamin D 3. Yeah, vitamin D 3 can be converted into 25 hydroxy vitamin D, which is what is the major circulating form, which is what you're getting measured, you're getting a blood test, there's SNPs that affect that. So and I've had several friends and I've seen, you know, looked at the data, but I've had several friends that have had to take, like, 30,000 and it's a dead because they have a SNP. And well, D 2 and explain to me why prescription is D 2. I don't know where it is and to be honest. I have my daughter, Terriblely. I'm not terribly thrilled, maybe it's a cost thing because they're getting it from like, like, like, mushrooms or something. Yeah, yeah. But I know there's been a couple of studies over the years and it's really, I don't quite understand, like, the mechanism and I don't know if it's known or how much has been studied. But there was some preliminary data and having checked back, I don't know how much of this has been confirmed. But we're vitamin D 2. Supplementsation with vitamin D 2 seem to inhibit some of the effects of vitamin D, vitamin D in muscle. You know, so I was kind of like, oh, that's kind of concerning. And I know a lot of vegetarians like to take vitamin D 2 because they want something that's plant based, but you can actually get vitamin D 3 from like in the, oh, really. Yeah, they produce vitamin D 3. Yeah, like stuff that grows on dry skin. You can eat it, you can eat it, you can eat it, you can eat it, you can eat it, you can eat it. So, so there are, there are companies that like, kind of thorn makes one, a vitamin D 3 for, for vegetarians and stuff from, like, and so, but in skin wise, though, if you have more olive skin or, so I form keeloy, it's like this was a big, if I get a cut, I form keeloy, it's like African-Americans do with dark skin. So, I was thinking that there's something, you know, biochemically in my skin, although I don't have, like, an overproduction of melanin, but I have aspects of that of having darker skin, especially like informing keeloy. So, I'm thinking there's something my skin and not synthesizing it. That's interesting. I mean, I tan it if I'm outside, I mean, it's winter now, but usually, yeah, usually, pretty dark off. But, yeah, to have, like, to supplement and double the amount of dose that's recommended, and to be outside all the time and to have low levels, like, I got the call and said, yeah, we need to get you in a vitamin D supplement. I was like, no, it's not right, we're going to another, and I got it, and it was, like, low it, like, super, like, right at the cut off. But I did take 50,000 I use of vitamin D 2, is a prescription, and three or four weeks of that. You just take one per week, I was on the upper range of noinel slightly above. Then I stopped and it went back down the normal, but I was supplementing, I changed to a different brand. And yeah, and you've been able to maintain levels. Yeah. What does you take? I think it's like, back to 5,000, yeah, 5,000 I used, yeah. Maybe it was, maybe it was the, yeah, look at, look at your SNAPS, that would be, like, my, my first SNAPS. But then, it, I absolutely could be the, the actual supplement brand. And is there anything acutely or chronically that you could have that would use, would deplete vitamin D? So that was another thing, I, I researched it, but it really couldn't find to my figure you would know. I mean, there's, there's some evidence that, like, you know, being in a state of, like, inflammation and, you know, like illness, like, what you're not. I H O C R P is, like, usually non-detectable, or is your point one, and everything else, you know, that micro nutrient status is really good. Yeah, it's, it's, I think it's mostly comes down to the metabolism of it, like, forming vitamin, but the 25th hydroxy vitamin D3, and then also the brand of supplement. And then there's another thing about doing, like, a weekly dose versus daily. Again, if you are getting, if you're doing a weekly dose, that's really, really high. So, you're doing, like, 20,000, 50,000 IU a week. You're much less likely to have that huge variation in the concentration of the vitamin D supplement, like, a heart or something. And it seems to be absorbed a little bit better, too. So, but I don't know how much, you know, how negligible that is in terms of what you're experiencing. I would say the SNPs is probably, yeah, the big elephant in the room. So, super interesting, but I'm going to get back to, so, so, we're talking about, we're talking about the C to acetate, and beta hydroxybuterate. I was interested in, you kind of already sort of answered some of that question. If there's varying effects of these two, I'm calling them ketones. I think, it's to acetate's a ketone technically. And beta hydroxybuterate's ketone body, and like, it has much, but, um, anti-seizure. So, that's one. You see, to acetate seems to be really, really, really important for that. Are there any other known differences? Different things, defects. Yeah, they're, yeah. Yeah. There are. Yeah. Well, we know, like, beta hydroxybuterate has epigenetic effects, as far as activating, you know, histone deacetylase inhibition, and also there's something called beta hydroxybuterolation, somewhat, to lack. So, beta hydroxybuterate can directly interact with the histone to cause epigenetic modifications, and it has become the theme of my PhD students dissertation to look at Kabuki syndrome, which is a rare genetic disease, where the ketogenic diet, in the lab of ponds, Bajorancin, Johns Hopkins, demonstrated that the ketogenic diet silenced these, uh, neurological abnormalities associated with this Kabuki syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder in cause of seizures too. So, we want to see if we can recapitulate this with ketone therapy, using ketones as, in, uh, in metabolite to alter epigenetic effects. And so, we have those studies going on right now. So, there's ketone induced epigenetic effects specific to beta hydroxybuterate, maybe a cilacitate, but we don't know. A cilacitate, on the other hand, has effects, at least, in muscular dystrophy, it, in regards to increasing, skeletal muscle regeneration. And it does it through an ERC, MEC, cycling D, I think, mechanism. So, it's a very unique mechanism that was kind of new to me, but a pretty good publication came out using, uh, showing that cilacitate stimulates, so beta hydroxybuterate, I was going to go down the path, and the cilacitate too, maybe have the anti-catabolic effects. Talk about that. Yeah. So, uh, the, the research that we've done uses an ester that elevates both of them, and shown that it works in a model of kkexion. And we know that cilacitate has an enhancement, as I said, proliferation or muscle regeneration, and beta hydroxybuterate as a fuel, undoubtedly, has anti-catabolic effects. And we know that when we administer, even in human studies, if we IV administer, beta hydroxybuterate, there's a decrease, a sharp decrease in alinean, and also a preservation of branch gene in the last, it's like losing, is elevated, and it prevents a drop. So, alinean's, like, your main gluconeogenic, uh, amino acid that is liberated under conditions of stress, uh, high cortisol, high gluconeogenesis, gluconeogenesis, gluconeogenesis, like that. We are going to liberate alinean as a gluconeogenic amino acid, it goes to the liver, we make glucose, and elevating ketone seems to reduce that. And that could be, that could play into the anti-catabolic effects. What are your thoughts on, I'm interested in your thoughts on the anti-catabolic effects of ketones in a various context? I mean, I guess in human development, or even, you know, with respect to humans, I have different lifestyle, so for example, people that are physically active, more young, athletic, um, versus people that are older and are battling starcopenia, you know, versus people that are just sedentary. I mean, everyone has, they have different protein requirements, you know, between these groups, but, um, you know, how, how can ketogenic diets, or perhaps supplementing with ketone, supplements, sort of, can they have an effect on muscle mass, in some way? I think so, and I think skeletal muscle mass, and maybe a little bit biased, because there've always been super-instined strength training and weightlifting and things like that. But muscle mass is probably the most important factor for healthy aging, and focusing on building as much muscle as possible. I think it's super important and preserving that muscle at the time. So ketogenic diets are probably not optimal for adding as much size and strength as possible, right? But I do think they are important for preserving muscle while improving metabolic parameters, like lysine, hyper-insoline, and everything like that. So I do think they're the ideal strategy in the context of a calorie deficit to preserve muscle under that sort of condition, right? So, um, and it does it by a number of different pathways. So I think the elevation of ketones, one of the functions, to prevent muscle loss during periods of fasting, right? So with limited glucose availability, or limited food availability, we start liberating fatty acids for fuel, and then the body makes ketones, and then the ketones provide energy flow to the brain, which has very high demands for glucose. So if we didn't produce ketones, we would liberate a lot of alony in another gluconeogenic amino acids from skeletal muscle, and we would quickly waste away and die. The fact that we're able to make ketones from fatty acids as a water soluble fat molecule that could cross the blood, brain barrier, that actually becomes our safeguard to catabolic processes that would allow us to cause us to waste away, right? So in the context of, and we are sort of wasting away in the context of a weight loss diet, or in the context of intermittent fasting. So then the ketones come into play when we're in a calorie deficit, like I said, but also when we're doing a time-restricted feeding, I think the ketones provide an anti-counterball effect. But from our perspective, we're super-insteading ketones, preventing age-related sarcopenia, skeletal muscle wasting associated with cancer cacaxia. I think that's important. And they're doing it, I think, not only providing in the context of a disease phenotype, or a chronic aging phenotype, the alternative energy function is there, but the anti-inflammatory effects, I think. So with cacaxia, for example, you have high elevation of like IL and beta, TNF alpha, which used to be called cacaxia and I think, as inflammatory media. So the ketones then work through anti-inflammatory pathways that can mitigate the inflammation-induced muscle wasting. So we did study with Leipopolis Acreite, LPS. So LPS causes massive muscle wasting and sarcopenia, root time, and in that model too, the ketones are protected in some ways, by inhibiting some of the anti-inflammatory, inhibiting the inflammatory effects of LPS. Do you think that people that aren't, for example, in a constant state of ketosis, because they're on a ketogenic diet, but perhaps they would like to take a supplement, ketones salt. You think that's something that, like, is it like the chronic elevation or the constant constituent elevation of these ketones that's important, or, you know, are little bumps throughout the day? Yeah, it's a good question. So I get that a lot, and I think chronic ketosis is probably not natural or not ideal for most people, unless you're managing a chronic disorder that's responsive to chronic ketosis, like epilepsy and other metabolic disorders. But I'm a big believer in relative changes, so even with intermittent fasting, like, I think I'm fasting today, maybe I just had some ketones supplements, but like yesterday I did. So I only do intermittent fasting probably two, maybe three times a week at the most, because if I did it every day, I feel that I lose some of the benefits of it, also lose too much weight, like I can't get enough calories and end up eating too many calories at the end of the day. So the body works good, you know, relative changes are really good to the body, so you get a lot more benefit, I personally get a lot more benefits doing intermittent fasting if I use it more intermittently, you know, right, I feel the benefits a little bit more. So I think the same is true with ketosis, and I think Dr. Valtre Longo has a great idea this idea that I actually gave it a lot of thought, so it was good to see that he came out, you know, with this idea of the fasting mimicking diet being implemented for just a one week or five day period, right, per month. And that can have long lasting metabolic benefits, even throughout, you know, weeks, even a month or more after you do that, as far as resetting insulin sensitivity and improving different metabolic biomarkers. So I think chronic ketosis is probably not ideal for most situations unless you're doing, you're trying to get your insulin manage, trying to lose weight and maintain that weight loss over time, and you've had difficulty doing it with other types of diets. But I think there's so many different factors that need to come into play when you're choosing to do it, see the journey diet, including monitoring. People really need to track nutrients, track calories, some people put, you know, they eat a ketogenic diet, but they put the same amount of food on the plate, and the color density of the ketogenic diet is like 50% higher, so you can't eat. So typically, you know, we have auto feedback mechanisms that will tell us when we're associated with full, but for some people they don't work well. So they do need to count calories and macaroni trance and track, at least initially so they have some idea of how many calories we're eating. I know until I started tracking calories, I had no idea how many calories I was eating. So I thought it was eating more like 3,000, but more like 4,000, 4,200, or 300, or 300 days. I want to talk about the cyclical ketogenic diets, but before I go there, since we're talking about muscle and the anticholic metabolic effects of ketones on muscle, I'm also interested in exercise performance as well. Anorobic exercise versus aerobic exercise, if you are either on a ketogenic diet or doing some sort of modified or cyclical form a bit, whatever it is versus supplementation as well, you know, how being in ketosis affects aerobic versus anaerobic exercise. So I'm going to get asked that question more than any other question I think. So in animal models when you put them on a ketogenic diet, and I think one of the first studies we did published at the Alzheimer's Institute at USF, the Bird Alzheimer's. We didn't see a big robust effect on amalgamatea in town, but we started the intervention after the pathology kicks in in these mouse models, double and triple knockouts. So I think Dr. Veech and Dr. Matson, Mark Matson, maybe they did a ketone ester or started earlier in the ketogenic intervention. So in our study, we didn't see any major changes in town or amalgamatea, but the mice ran faster. They ran like 30% longer and faster on the treadmill, and it was remarkable. One of the PIs on the project, very experienced Alzheimer's researchers like, yeah, we've never seen anything like this. So that was an MCT supplemented ketogenic diet, but we also we've done some research with ketone ester. So performance, you know, animal models, we see it in humans, the data is messy and it's hard to make sense of it. My general opinion, my speculation is that ketones probably have a small effect on exercise performance in the context of aerobic performance. And in regards to strength performance, my ideas have that about that have been changing over the last couple of weeks because we're giving ketones supplements to some CrossFit athletes and they're breaking PRs. But I think it could be potentially a placebo effect, but since everyone excluding one person out of dozens of people, I think there is maybe something more. But I think ketones with the caffeine, especially ketones also with caffeine, are a pretty powerful, organic aid. So I would loosely say that that's probably a performance enhancing supplement, the combination of ketones, caffeine and electrolytes. But I think where ketone shine is using exogenous ketones as a means to preserve performance resilience in extreme environments. So that's in the context of hyperoxia. So that's what I study. So of course when you're not having a seizure and your neurological function is maintained and preserved in the context of extreme hyperoxia, like three or four or five atmospheres of oxygen, high pressure oxygen, that's going to be advantageous. But on the other end of the spectrum is hypoxia, right? So a lot of people who are mountain climbing, running, cycling at hypoxia, we know if we put athletes on a treadmill or bike in a hypoxic environment and give them glucose that the performance enhancing effects of glucose are not observed in hypoxia, which is kind of, you know, interesting. Whereas it's also shown that there may be an inhibition under hypoxic environments of pyruvate dehydrogenase. So there might be some pdh deficiency or some snag or bottleneck in metabolic pathway associated with glycolidic energy production under hypoxia. And you would think that hypoxia, you know, chronically it activates like hyphuan alpha and you have increasingly palysis and transporters and things like that. But in the context of, you know, exercise performance under hypoxia, carbohydrate supplements don't seem to help. Whereas there seems to be, and it was brought to my attention in a couple of reviews and also serving on grant committees and stuff like that, there seems to be a good rationale for the use of ketones for fueling performance in a hypoxic environment. And that could be very strategic and beneficial in like a military setting or like a space, you know, setting or altitude, you know, setting. So my general feeling is that ketones have a small effect at increasing athletic performance. So there's only a few things that actually are powerful, organic aids. So we have caffeine. We have creatine, monohydrate, typically there's other forms of creatine, you know, beta-aligning kind of works pretty good. So, and a few other odds and ends, but you know, there's just a pretty short list of organic supplements out there. I do think that with time as we understand dosing and the application of specific types of ketones and certain settings that ketones will be added to that list. But I'm not sure it'll be in the top tier list, but I do think it would be in the top tier list under extreme environments. What about swimmers or surfers? Yeah, I think being in a state of ketones could be beneficial from the context of like brain injury, inflammation, and maybe just, you know, the stress of being out, you know, in certain extreme environments, or when we're exercising too, we're overproducing oxygen for your health. We're using oxygen for your radicals and these in part and adaptive response to the muscle too, so there could be a benefit to increase oxidative stress. But I think the ketones, I think the real benefit of ketones are not, I'm talking about this in their response and I think your question is in the response to an acute setting. Like consume ketones, go exercise, you have a certain sort of organic ketogenic diet, yeah. So where I think exogenous ketones help will help, and when I was talking that they would be added to the short list of organic aids is use chronically in as an adaptive response. So when we exercise a lot of bad things happen, if we pull blood, you know, there's inflammation or active oxygen speech, things like that. If we use exogenous ketones chronically over time, I think it will help to facilitate the adaptive response to exercise over time. So suppressing inflammation or chronic inflammation, which would sort of enhance or augment adaptive responses to exercise over time. I think there's a good rationale for that, but the science is not there yet, but science is being done now. So like rodent studies are being done, I'm aware of a couple of human podbiltrials that are studying this. So what about like maximum, like doing a maximum effort, like you're doing some kind of sprint, you know, because you do need, you're going into a state where you're mitochondria or can work hard enough to produce energy, you need glucose, right? And if you're taking, if you take one of those big boluses of ketoneaster, drop your glucose, what's that going to do for your, for your sprinting. That's, that's a good point. So one of the criticisms of the ketogenic diet was that in inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Whenever we're doing carbohydrate restriction, we're limiting glucose availability, but also lowering insulin. And by lowering insulin, especially that inhibits glycolic enzymes, like hexachinies, it also, like the glucose, the, the, the transporter for glucose gets internalized into the cell, if, like, so you don't, you know, the glycolic flux is essentially decreased. But I think if you follow a ketogenic diet where you intermittently add small amounts of carbohydrates in, you can keep that pdh from being reduced. So there's, you know, I think I've seen data to indicate that severe carbohydrate restriction could decrease the production and the activity of pdh. This is actually what happens with Alzheimer's disease too. So with Alzheimer's disease, it's pathophysiologically linked to impaired glucose metabolism. So if you do an FDG pet scan, the pet scan shows glucose hypomotabolism in the brain scan. So alternative ketones, as an alternative energy substrate, makes sense. In the context of, you know, athletes, you're kind of doing that with chronic ketosis. It decreases the glycolic pathway, but your muscles and your heart and other tissues actually use fatty acids for a source of energy. The brain not so much, right? So, and also when you're on a ketogenic diet, then your feeding ketones to the brain. So the brain's kind of like a different story. But I do think that it gets over blown. I think, you know, very severe carbohydrate restriction will decrease pdh, and then that will impair exercise. So, you know, it's a very rare exercise performance with maximum exertion and aerobic. But I think that it's really important that if you do a low carbohydrate that you have to train under those conditions. You know what I mean? So you have to, you can't implement a ketogenic diet or low carb and then train and expect to maintain the same performance. You have to put your body into that state of ketosis and then train very hard to induce those adaptations. So, it's possible for your body to perform and maintain your performance in the context of insulin suppression and low glucose availability. So those adaptive processes will then come to benefit you, come game time or performance time, where you can then titrate the carbohydrates back in in small amounts. So this is just called metabolic flexibility, right? So train low when your glucose is low in your insulin's low in a semi-facid state. And that will induce metabolic adaptations, I mean metabolic flexibility that will then benefit you in the context of the actual event where you can add and titrate carbohydrates back in or mix fuels. So you want to be able to optimally use glucose fatty acids, beta hydroxybutary ketom bodies lactate to which is an important fuel. One of the things that I used to take when I was mountain biking was cytomax, which is alpha-elipolylactane, which is like lactate as an energy zone. And my original interest in academia as a post-doctoral fellow was actually using lactate for brain injury, like stroke and hypoxia. And I was tinkering around with a hippocample brain-sliced preparation doing different measurements on that. And somehow I just got steered towards ketones, but I always wanted to revisit the lactate thing because yeah, I think there's a lot that can be done in formulating more of a comprehensive, multi-fuel delivery system for the brain. And lactates been a bit underappreciated and kind of stigmatized and criticized, but I think it's got a lot of potential. Yeah, really good info. I've been reading some meta analyses over the years about training in a fasted state versus fed state and how you know if you eat before you know you go for a run or something that you know a lot of the mitochondrial adaptations can be blended. And of course a lot of those studies are using high refined carbohydrate like some toast with jam. You know where and I've always wondered like you know what and there is like sort of a cut off where if you're training in a fasted state for longer than an hour you're going to have performance drop off right. But I've often wondered if these studies were done using a more modified adkins diet or some form of a ketogenic diet. Those adaptation mitochondrial adaptations that are being blended somewhat with you know high refined carbohydrate fuel intake prior to exercise. I wonder maybe that wouldn't happen. Yeah, I think it comes down to like nutrient sensing right I mean it's the whole thing going back to autophagy and like you know and just entering a state of ketosis that if we're in a state where like amp kinases high like emtores low you know. insulin is low that that whole pathway is low when you exercise in that state it may not optimize performance but it will optimize the adaptations that could serve you later on for performance. And then when it comes time to you might want to train sort of in a fasted state to induce adaptations and then tinker around with different fuel sources periodically to see if you could further augment your performance. You know, but I think I think we need to that that's why we need to really periodize our training under certain contours you know training to force adaptations and then there's sort of game day nutrition which is going to be a little bit different than training nutrition if we want to force out of you know if we want to maximize our performance. So but one thing you don't want to do is actually radically switch your dietary approach or supplement approach just prior to you know you don't want to train for an event and be like oh I want to start slamming you know MCT's and ketoneesters and stuff on game day know you want to experiment with it very methodically you know before you do that but I do believe that the health benefits are really important when it comes to exercise. You know and then not only to help benefits but I think you're going to get more adaptation in regard to maybe not so much for power lifting and strength training and things like that but I think for a rovac performance and just cardiovascular benefits and just actually benefiting at the level of the skeletal muscle and the nervous system to benefits. So speaking of the nervous system this is this is one area where I in my opinion ketosis ketogenic diets really shine and I'm really what what has thoroughly convinced me is you know just overwhelming evidence that you've talked about with. The effects on the brain and epilepsy and other types of brain disorders but also some of the preclinical studies that have come out of our mutual friend Dr. Eric for it in and I know John Ramsey also did some publications where they fed mice. In the case of Dr. Verdun study mid mid life they started I'm on a cyclical can it ketogenic diet and I'd love to get your idea thoughts on why. He said the reason it was because the mice were over-edying which I found to be interesting because I've always been satiated on a ketogenic diet but anyways. A lot of new on-series can do that but also the thing that was so striking and you know much more about the details of these studies and I do but the effects I mean their their health span was improved their median so their median lifespan was improved so they were dying they were dying less earlier but. The maximum life span I guess wasn't affected but the effects on the brain and cognition like you said you know that these the older mice had better cognition than younger mice and when he said that I'm like. You know like that's really. So things are magnified in rodents so I'll say as far in. Yes my question is do you think this is going to translate. Rodent model studies are in very very informative especially mechanistically not always predictive there are some of the nuances that. There's different strains of rodents that will overeat ketogenic diets and some like early studies before. Some of some colleagues were feeding it and said this is not going to work they're hoarding the food they're eating they're getting blown up there's like this is obeseogenic you know. So the high fat you know there's a question there's a lot of high fat diet research that. Just tractors of ketogenic diet will point to and say this diet is you know cause all these bad things but that's a westernized obesity. So what doctor verdine use in ramsy. So they did actually the study that I really wanted to do and they probably did it better than I could ever do they have really great molecular tools and everything and they did it in a very clever way. And I kind of from my understanding they did and the results were to be expected you know I think the results are what I would expect. So my understanding is that they did the cyclic ketogenic diet because yeah they didn't want them to gain weight which couldn't get. So I have to look to see what animal model they use but the C57 black six mice will a ton of the ketogenic diet food and they don't gain weight. Whereas other depending upon the strain and then we have the VM decay mice that we use for our cancer research and they tend to it correct their eating behavior meaning that if you're not going to eat it. If you give them the standard diet, add libidum they just gain weight like a couch potato but a ketogenic diet they will lose weight and everything improves. So they're like the other and the C57 black six are kind of like athlete mice I think were the other models are more like sedentary mice or not as as active. But what we found I have to look exactly at the feeding protocol but when we did a little bit of calorie restriction our calorie restriction is just putting. You know five or six grams of food into it every day and then they eat it within an hour and then they essentially fast for 23 hours and then eat it again. But you have to individually house the animals and then sometimes if you house them together they'll start like fighting and eating each other because they're kind of hungry. But one thing that we saw very consistently early on is that I'm mild amount of calorie restriction makes these mice like super mice like they become you know they're thinking faster they are really thriving in the context of a calorie deficit. And I think that goes back to human evolution too so we survive today because we end out of the experience food scarcity and limited food availability and in the context of being hungry. That enhanced our cognition and even exercise performance to be able to acquire resources right. So the same thing I think is happening in their mice and it could be I have to look at the weights of the mice but a lot of it's kind of like weight dependent and producing that energy deficit. But you just get a whole plethora of things happen in regards to suppressing age related chronic diseases with just a little bit of dietary restriction seems to unmasst this. Probably because with a standard rodent child fed ad libidum they over eat and it just basically fuels metabolic derangement that contributes to early onset age related chronic diseases and also the formation of spontaneous tumors. And I think in their studies maybe both or at least one maybe both studies showed a suppression of spontaneous tumors too so this has major implications I think. We're very interested in actually taking animal models that have inducible tumors for example. You know various genes that will kick on at 200 days and then form spontaneous tumors or a melanoma model where you subject to UV radiation. And if they're fed a cute giant can you suppress that people don't do these studies because the NIH doesn't really fund like cancer prevention research. But I feel like these are the most important studies that need to be done you put a wide you put a variety of different. And so the rodent strains under different conditions that are known to like induce tumors and you feed them you know a low carb diet or ketogenic diet that you could actually feasibly maintain and do. And you see if you could suppress these spontaneous tumors but that's what they did in this experiment and they showed like you said enhancement of cognitive and learning ability. Related the older mice learned better than the younger mice. I know in John Ramsey's in publication Dr. Verdun mentioned also in the podcast when we had him on a few years ago that they they had a diet a time-shrug defeating aspect to it because they were feeding the animals. Proportion so very specific proportions they were and they were only you know. They were only given their food at you know when the when the people the scientists were going there and to the house and given the food so they had this sort of dietary restriction component to it. Whereas Verdun's they were ad libidum that they were going on and they were cyclic they're going on the cyclic ketogenic diet. And Ramsey's data was more pronounced like you mentioned the combination of the dietary restriction plus ketogenic diet seems to be like secret sauce in a way. But you know to me it was and again like you said it's you know the animal you know wrote in research isn't necessarily predictive of what's going to be you know occurring in humans. But certainly is promising in my opinion and it's got me very interested in it and you know I've got an urge to general diseases and on both sides of my family Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. So I'm very interested in you know any types of life and I also have genetic factors there I play as well. So I'm certainly very interested in any sort of lifestyle factors that can mitigate that genetic risk which as we know that many things that you can do in the lifestyle that can help. But this doing a some sort of modified ketogenic diet cyclical maybe you know because it is for me hard to sustainably do it all the time you know. That's random it fast and kind of comes into because people don't have to tinker around with the I mean the foods that we are super important just like limiting process sugar. Carves things like that that's going to move the needle like quite a bit but there are some people that I know like family member and they there are just some people who are not going to count carbs even. To do that you know there's just not going to happen but so but eating within a predetermined time window is pretty easy for that's like a good introduction and I think if once you start doing that then you start realizing how good you feel in the smile is dedicated to us. And then you start maybe that becomes the entry point to where you start manipulating your food and your macros and things like that. So happen with those totally. Yeah, yeah. In that very order I mean I practice a lot of time or sugar eating and search the notice in the morning was in stuff it was like. I'm just so much sharper and my anxiety was a little bit lower you know believe it or not while I was not eating. And so I decided to experiment with the ketogenic diet and while I did do it as you mentioned earlier in this podcast. One of the most pronounced thing I noticed and this is totally subjective was my anxiety level was so much lower and I mean very noticeably I'm somewhat of an I mean I've got some anxiety you know that can kind of kick in and. And I performers are like that though so that's like pretty much a stage of personality. Yeah sure and then you you leverage that into productivity. Yeah, yeah, but I did I felt like it was it was very noticeable for me and with the anxiety and then you know it's like that feeds into it. What's affecting anxiety what else in the brain is it affecting you know cognition wise you know if you're anxious it does sort of limit cognition in a way it can kind of like you know distract you and. And you did this back like in grad school you started doing this I started doing it like before big talks I would. And then I think I got into my postdoc and I started tinkering with intermittent fasting first and just carve I was like wow this is how I feel. You know, especially when I kind of diited and brought my weight down a little bit. It's like wow I just feel like super calm is like I can't even get anxious under certain conditions you know so. Well, I didn't do a ketogenic diet. Like I'm a trophy almost too. Yeah, well I didn't do the ketogenic diet until I've recently like this was like last summer but. Caloric restriction I used to do a lot of that combined with exercise as well so it was kind of like I was getting in ketosis without you know. With exercise and juice. Yeah, I mean I was running you know this was this was like. Like even before grad school by like early in grad school to I was running like 10 miles a day and I was doing that like 45 times a week. I was really you know I had gone I had gone almost to an extreme to where it was like I changed my menstrual cycle where I wasn't getting it because I was very active and then I was I was doing a lot of color which I felt great. I mean I really did. But that was you know that was actually a long time ago and it wasn't until like sort of my time restricted eating when I had such and on the podcast back in 2015. I mean that's when I really got hardcore about trying to like time my time went my food intake and and following that really you know obsessively for the last you know. The event like six or seven years you know that that's really help but the ketogenic diet was also unique and I and I do when I sort of incorporate that into my I want to do some kind of cyclical version of it like I want it I really want to and I want to you know. I measure my biomarkers and all that which I'm doing together so you're still doing intermittent fasting yeah and doing together you know as well. I know that's the key like people think it's one or the other whatever but low carb intermittent fasting so just a modified you know that probably has low carb intermittent fasting probably has more benefits than chronic ketosis eating like throughout the day I think we're the normal. And maybe even they're beautifully from managing because I'm communicating with adults that have epilepsy and the reforming kids you know they break through seizures but then. They take the same diet same calories and then do an intermittent and this is not promoted in the world of epilepsy but when they take their ketogenic diet where they're having breakthrough seizures and they implement time restricted feeding then they get seizure control again. So I think the people in the trenches know this like the neurological teams and dietitians they realize hey well if you can do this they don't it's not part of the medical literature but they know this intuitively just because of the information people are putting out all the information on an fasting. You know Mark Matson has been studying this stuff since the 90s and I first stumbled upon his stuff in grad school and it always kept his papers with me I was like showing people it's like look at this why don't people looking at this research it's like so important. I haven't read this book yet, but he has a new book out to it. Yeah, he does. Yeah, we had inspired me. I think that's how I got inspired into the ketogenic diet. It was looking at the rich the calorie restriction and in fasting and then that led me to ketones. But it was Matson actually that actually sparked my fire and then that led me to some of the ketone researchers. I asked Mark this question when he was on the podcast and I'll kind of ask it to you in reverse. And that is we and you've mentioned a little we've already kind of sort of touched on it but like what do you think the overlap between being on a ketogenic diet or monofried ketogenic diet is with intermittent fasting. Whether we're talking about these epigenetic changes with spheta hydroxybutoraping and epigenetic modulator, signaling molecule, autophagies one that I'm very interested in as well. Yeah, two things in my mind. Insulin and insulin signaling like IGF1 activation of amp kinase, IGF1, M2R that. But also the ketones as a drug-like mediator on not only alternative energy substrate but also as a drug-like mediator for all these different things like suppression of inflammation, activating epigenetic effects and things like BDNF which I think, you know, Matson's work actually showed that many of the benefits of intermittent fasting were associated with a bit hydroxybutorate induced growth factor effects on like BDNF and things like that. So I see there's the hormonal effects of intermittent fasting are replicated with a ketogenic diet and then the hyper ketoneemia that's associated with intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet then have their own effects through beta hydroxybutorate and ac2st. So that's two main things but there's a whole it's playotropic, right? So the ketogenic diet, given talks to pharmaceutical companies where I go there and they say well, but key in on the mechanisms that we can sort of drugify, right? But the end summary slide is like a dozen or more mechanisms and there's probably many more that are all sort of working in synergy. And I think that becomes the reason why the ketogenic diet works when drugs fail because you have drugs work through a GABA-urgic mechanism, the drugs work through suppressing glutamate. You have a variety of anti-uptic drugs that work through different pathways, but combinations of them used in high dose often work initially than they fail and then patients are put on a ketogenic diet and it works. So the ketogenic diet is working through a mechanism independent of what we know these pharmaceutical drugs are working. And that becomes the complexity of metabolism is very daunting, right? And the key in on something that's really having and it could be depending, the ideology of epilepsy is largely unknown and the ketogenic diet works seems to work through all these different types of epilepsy, whether it's like tonic, clonic, there's drombase and drone, there's different metabolic, there's absenteeers and the ketogenic diet seems to work across all these different seizure types, probably because working through all these different mechanisms. What do you think about a ketogenic diet for the treatment of neurogenetic orders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease? I think there are different subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. Again, I think the ideology of Alzheimer's is complex and there is probably a metabolic phenotype that dr. Medicine talks about like in his book and I think that phenotype would be very responsive to the ketogenic diet where you would screen potentially screen for these patients by doing an FTG pet scan and if you see, you know, there's like brain atrophy but if you see a dim pet scan then a metabolic intervention may be a good, you know, approach with that. I could tell you just by communicating with hundreds of patients over the years the ketogenic diet works remarkably well for some patients and has no effect on others and I don't think it's ever hurt or decreased anyone's cognitive, you know, to pass fear anything that I'm aware of. Typically, I'm by, I get biased feedback and be more telling me that's working but, you know, I've seen it not work too. Dr. Mary Newport was one of the people that really inspired me in the beginning actually brought her to the University of South Florida and she actually gave a lecture. She used to lecture for some of my classes and at the time that early time she would bring her husband's Steve. So I don't know if you know that there was a case report written on the use of bed hydroxybutary ester as a therapy and this case report was her husband. And I witnessed that her husband, she had many more years. Well, you know, years, maybe like five or six years just from an outsider looking in it seemed like she had that amount of time extra with her husband, the spend because of the keep a genetic intervention. And early part, it was just coconut oil and then she realized I coconut oil had medium change triglycerides and then found the patent by Sarah AC1202. And the active ingredient was, try a kiprillic triglycerides. So she went out and bought MCTs and then had an effect. But then learned about the ketone ester and the ketone diet and was administering that and that was helping him. So when 2009 she was a guest speaker in my class and then we went out to eat and her husband was shaking with Parkinson's disease like symptoms. She had Alzheimer's disease and then he had a vial of MCT and coconut oil and when he can soon that when about 15 to 20 minutes the tremor stopped and he became animated and was commenting on our conversation. So when I saw this in 2009 I realized that he was not really, it wasn't the food he was eating. He consumed that supplement. It elevated MCTs in his blood which can also cross with brain barrier but produces state of hyper ketoneemia and that acutely stopped the tremors he was having and he became more animated and that was. Being in contact with her and seeing this and witnessing it and also seeing his clock test and the minimensional status exam. Our state exam convinced me to go in that direction for my research. So there's no doubt he was a metabolic phenotype but he was also apoe for positive. So which is very interesting, right? Because we talked about you know different dietary interventions. So there was no doubt in the study of Exera in acetol02 the apoe for phenotype were the ones that were not responsive to hyper ketoneemia. But he's apoe for and he was responsive and I saw it with my own eyes and then that motivated me. Actually the first study that we did was an Alzheimer's mouse study at the Alzheimer's Center and then I developed the ketoneester because the funding agency did not want to look at the diet process. So we focused on the ester later in the seizure studies. It seems like you know with in particular some of these neurodegenerators like Parkinson's disease I mean you mentioned the tremor that you know the standard care of treatment you know like carbolabodopa. There's a lot of terrible side effects with time. And if there was another possible either adjunct treatment or alternative in some way or something that it should really be explored more and you know like with for example if you could. I mean ketogenic diets are so why do they accept it now for epilepsy? Like what about some of these other brain disorders? Is there any movement in research to kind of push to our understanding of whether or not ketosis is going to be beneficial for other diseases. And then the other type of brain disorders. I mean yeah it's so much easier to do a ketone supplement as opposed to a ketogenic diet for randomized control. Then it will try to very hard with it with a ketogenic diet right but with a supplement you can have a control you can do things so I think those studies are happening and we know that. You know just by virtue of the ketogenic diet altering brain metabolism brain pharmacology we know I mean I observed early on that this is going to be important for many different neurological disorders and then and cancer too. So that's why we got steer towards you know so I didn't want to initially you know study cancer but the data was so compelling that we should at least test this and it became a whole another track in my research. You know that we're doing a lab. So I think we are but it's just it's slower to to go in that direction and we really do need clinical trials before we can start prescribing these things to people the ketogenic diets or the supplements. And I mean that's happening now but there's groups of people getting together. You know there's a group that I'm involved in that's associated with metabolic psychiatry and they are looking at dietary interventions for a broad range of psychiatric disorders and that could be depression. That could be bipolar that could be even eating disorders like anorexia is under the umbrella of the psychiatric disorders. So there's a lot of potential interventions there and there's clinical trials but the data is not there yet to you know be able to prescribe this to that. People are I mean people are out there experimenting with ketogenic diets. They're taking there's keep ketone supplements that you can buy on Amazon. I mean so you know there's a certain element of you know there there there are families out there that are wanting to try different lifestyle changes dietary changes. Talking to their physician about them is you know obviously recommended but I mean they're doing they're trying them and I can tell you like so my mother has she has a different types of tremors essential tremors she's got worth the tag tremors she also gets migraines and. I did do the ketogenic diet with me somewhat she like cheated a lot more than I did but I also have given her ketone supplements and it's noticeable and it's the reason why she even tried the ketone was wanting to try the ketone diet because she's very much addicted to. I mean noticeably stops her essential tremor and somewhat her orthostatic which is her legs when she stands still. But noticeably the essential tremor and the migraines she will and this is totally anecdotal. I love to hear it's awesome but she she will take a ketone supplement and it's it's it's Esther has worked for her and ketone's own so she's done the ketone start. And it totally takes away her migraines which is phenomenal because I'm not a big fan of the migraine medicine that she. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but she gets migraines that are debilitating like she can yeah good rationale for migraines yeah so yeah I get I mean a lot of emails about that I try because I'm a researcher I go in the other direction and try not to oversell it as much as I can totally because yeah I mean that that's just not very academic so. I get so much feedback and I'm so excited I went to cut and paste things and put it on social media about responses because people even said blood work or test results or their doctor. But I'm very cautious to do that because I know the power of placebo I know the power but I know what I saw. Years ago the stopping of tremors and becoming animated was not placebo because the patient at the time didn't really know that he was taking really I mean he was pretty far advanced. But in regards to migraines, the PhD student by the name of or now doctor. Eliana Gross so we wrote a review together which kind of highlighted many of the benefits associated with migraines so she was a person who had crushing migraines and discovered that the ketogenic diet and then later ketone supplements could recapitulate that and actually help to manage her chronic migraines as she had. And it was likely just like the ketogenic diet for epilepsy is working through multi-modal mechanisms so by probably increased GABA or Jectone increase brain blood flow. Some people get migraines because of like an increase in blood flow and some people because of basic constriction and we know that. The ketogenic diet and exogenous ketones increase a denison and from our metabolomic data, a denison it was not really interested in at the time was like like many fold higher relative. It was a thing that was really hot on our metabolomic data. It was like, oh, it's a very interesting. So I recognize a denison is a very powerful base of dilator for cardiovascular, you know physiology. So when you fast or even when you go on a ketogenic diet when you fast and blood flow to the brain can increase by 30%. So it's in acute you can acutely elevate it and probably through this adenison, ergic mechanism. So there's adenison, there's probably dramatic effects on brain blood flow on, you know, neurotransmitter systems energy systems and also neural inflammation can trigger a seizure. I don't like to go to anecdotal evidence, but I have a lot of people will contact me that have like herpes in plaques or shingles or different things where the virus like attacks their body and the first sign that they get is like a crushing headache and then they get like full body inflammation and then they get like sores if it's like shingles or something like that. And they'll start fasting or they'll acutely use ketone esters or ketone salts actually they've been using it. I've been recommending it and it's like, okay, please give me, you know, give me feedback and I've been giving them recommendations or not recommendations. I've been suggesting this as a potential way to mitigate the inflammatory cascade and the feedback has been pretty remarkable that they can basically stop, you know, an episode from, you know, the same thing happens, they get the crushing headaches and then usually that's a sign that the virus is starting to shed and it produces, you know, changes in the brain systemic inflammation contributes from neuro inflammation which contributes to the headache and then usually get the cascade kind of after that. So it has worked through a variety of different people and people get headaches for different reasons. So I think it's kind of like Alzheimer's where you're going to get, you know, certain phenotype will be more responsive to, to an end. I probably should mention that there's products on Amazon that people are using ketone salts where they take it and it gives them a headache. So and I think I've taken some of these because you know, I try to test as many things as possible and there are supplements out there quite popular ones where I consume it and then I just get like a headache, like a caffeine headache or something like that after that. I think that's a good, that's a very reliable sign that there's something wrong with that supplement. So if you're getting headaches from supplements and I've gotten quite a few emails about this, so I know there's listeners out there listening to this. I would say change the ketone supplement that you're taking. So and it could be the electrolytes, it could be contaminants, purity, potency, tolerability, gut issues, if it disrupts your gut, that could contribute to a headache. So but I am firmly of the opinion that ketogenic diet and fasting fasting was also used for headaches. So ketogenic diets, fasting and exotic ketones can be used to manage. Yeah, the other area that kind of is interesting leads into the carnivore cause I didn't even mention, we mentioned earlier and it is an interest in mind as well. Is autoimmune disease and I know there's been some preliminary, well last I checked maybe there's been more since things I haven't done a ton of reading on that but with ketogenic diets actually helping with autoimmune disease. I know there's been also a lot of work with intermittent fasting fasting mimicking diets, helping with autoimmune disease and so there again may be some overlap with ketosis from either ketogenic diet or fasting, helping with a variety of types of autoimmune disorders. I know you're not, you can't, you're not going to say ketogenic diets are going to help with autoimmune disease but it seems like a promising area to continue to research as well. Yeah, there's a couple, I was just teaching one of my classes yet, so there's a couple studies on MS and other of course GI associated autoimmune disorders. And I'm not a immunologist and I mean we do some work you know in measuring you know immune factors like cytokines and kind of things like that. I can say that we know that dietary interventions, nutritional interventions can be powerful modulators of the immune system and in some cases. The hyper sensitive immune system will contribute to increased intestinal permeability. So intestinal hyperreactivity is an immune response and that intestinal hyperreactivity will always lead to intestinal permeability, which can lead to impairing you know exacerbating an autoimmune condition. So I think dietary interventions are working through that way too and maybe suppressing some of the inflammatory medators. I also excited one day to the end of alpha things like that. So the ketogenic diet, interesting, can also augment the immune system in ways that makes that hyper vigilant and being able to detect things like cancer cells, right? So the the ketogenic diet enhances the anti-cancer immunity of people that are following it. Yeah, so a colleague of my doctor Adrian Sheck did research with a glioblastoma cell line showing enhanced cancer specific immune regulation, you know, with a dietary intervention. She was also using radiation. And also I think it needs to be appreciated that there's a lot of people are against a standard of care. But I think the standard of care and the context of the ketogenic diet is a much more synergistic approach. So when you give radiation, when you give chemotherapy, it's stimulating autophagine and it's stimulating tumor licensed syndrome. So you're actually like breaking down, you have bits of tumor that are entering circulation. And I actually and it's not really talked about, I always think about it in this way. When you give someone chemo, it's killing cancer cells and then you're stimulating autophagine and tumor licensed syndrome. And then that's stimulating the immune system. So you know, I think chemotherapy in general is carcinogenic, it's bad, but it's also stimulating the immune system to then attack the cancer. In the context of the ketogenic diet that a ketogenic diet, especially if it's calorie restricting, is stimulating. It's putting metabolic stress on cancer cells and actually stimulating autophagine, sort of incancers cells, is stimulating cancer cell death. And it makes the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. So you have more tumor die-off and you're also protecting the normal healthy cells. And it's augmenting the immune system in a way that's actually stimulating it more to attack the cancer. So I think so what I'm saying here is probably you can't go to any publication, but we just know from tumor biology that, you know, when you stimulate, when you kill cancer cells, you know, through any means. You can have this process called tumor licensed syndrome, which could kill the patient if you do it too abruptly, right? But that's why we're very, you know, adamant and advocating a more gradual approach, which would be like ketogenic diets, maybe metabolic drugs, and also hyperbarrative oxygen therapy or something that we studied. But it needs to be acknowledged and recognized that chemotherapy and radiation also work by stimulating the immune system, and it works better in the context of a ketogenic diet, which makes the immune system more hypervisual to be able to recognize and attack the cancer cells. So there's a lot of research being done on that now, and you know, I know the Mothic Cancer Center, which is by USF, is very interested in immune-based therapies, and using ketogenic diets to enhance like PDL1 inhibitors, like checkpoint inhibitors. There's a big, a paper just came out and a pretty high impact journal, I forget the name of the journal, but it showed that PDL1 inhibitors were greatly augmented in the context of a ketogenic diet, and even drugs like metabolic drugs, like the PI3 kinase inhibitors, are remarkably effective in promising, but they have a counter regulatory effect at increasing insulin, so when we take these things, they can target tumor metabolism, but there's also an increase in insulin, and in the context of insulin suppression with a ketogenic diet, that can unmask and augment and enhance greatly enhanced PI3 kinase inhibitors. So Dr. Luhkantley is really spearheading some of that work, and I think it's been in contact with a few of the patients in that that are doing really well, and they're using a ketogenic diet to enhance the efficacy of that. And Oglombo, glialm is one type of cancer to seem to be responsive, always being an area evidence to just, right? Yeah, that was my first interest in ket, because I started doing hyperbaric oxygen, and I saw some, I saw like cancer cells exploding under hyperbaric oxygen, so this got me very interested in cancer, it was that, and I didn't know why they were exploding, and we had a different a die that was looking at superoxide production, in the cytosol and also in the mitochondria, so what I would see is that the mitochondria would light up really quick. We were doing optical sections with a laser scanning conical microscope, and I could see that superoxide production was ramping up, like super high in super fast, when we hit it with oxygen, and then I would see the mitochondria disappear, and then the cells would rupture, they're exploding. So we're giving high pressure oxygen, and the tumor cells are taking that oxygen, and because the cancer cells have defective mitochondria, they put out proportionally more superoxide, anion, which then can be converted to hydrogen peroxide, and more reactive intermediates, like hydroxyl radical, and then that damage is membrane lipids, and then you get rupturing of the cells. So I was like seeing this, and I was like, this is very interesting, and what it was telling me is that I didn't know why it was happening, but later found out of the warberg effect, where you have a derrin. An altered metabolism, like some people say the warberg effect is the cancer cells, sort of changing metabolism for its own benefit, to redirect nutrients and biomolecules to the biosynthetic anabolic production of, you know, to further expanding biomass of the tumor. So that's why. Another people like Warberg said it was damage respiration leads to compensatory fermentation, so the sugar cell consumes more glucose. But it was sort of looking at this effect, which got me very interested in cancer and ways to target sort of cancer cells, and then manipulate the substrates. So that actually was the precursor to our cancer work with ketones, because I was using hyperbaric oxygen, and then under different conditions I started growing cancer cells and feeding them glucose and ketones, and then I would take away the glucose and keep the ketones and the cancer cells would die, and I would have glucose, and when I added ketones it would decrease proliferation. So this is before I ever published anything, but it was like, it got the wheels turning, and there's something that needs to be studied here. So I had a few different med students, replicated each other, so they could replicate it, so that gave me some confidence, and then a PhD student came along, Dr. Angela Pop, who's hosting metabolic health summit. So she's now a research associate and does research and a lot of other things, but then she actually moved this to the animal model, which was ketogenic diet and hyperbaric oxygen and then later ketones supplementation, and that was the synergistic combination. So the modified ketogenic diet we used was we took out the lard, and we put like a large percentage of the fat, and 40, maybe 40% was MCTs, and then we also used Omega 3 fats with a flaccid oil. So we, at the time, I was very interested in Mufa's impusas. So we looked at what ketogenic diet researchers were using, and it was like, well, let's make our own. So we did like 20% instead of like 10%, you know, protein, we did like 20% or more protein, 25, and then we replaced the fats with essentially MCT, flaccid oil, and then we put some fiber in there too, and then that became the diet. We actually used for the Alzheimer's research, and then we used this diet for our cancer research, and our effects were pretty robust, and I often think, you know, was it because we were using, you know, a diet high in like, you know, Omega 3 oils, and we just, we also had higher protein, which I think was a little bit beneficial, but we had high ketones. So we did different diets, and this diet, especially with the MCTs, gave us higher ketones and seemed to work really well. Super interesting. What about the, you know, the different, there's different types of cancer, and, and I we were discussing this a little bit earlier, you know, the potential for some types of cancer, release and rodent studies, to, you know, maybe metabolize some ketones, and use them in a positive way to benefit the cancer cell. Is that something? There's no doubt they do, so there's a little bit of, I think cancer cell is cancers are more heterogeneous than we sort of like to believe. I think the field that whole belief at large believes that, and that's why we have all these different cancer therapies. There are some cancers that are very responsive to the ketogenic diet, but when I think of the ketogenic diet, as a cancer therapy, I don't think of it as, I don't think of the hyper ketoneemia treating cancer cells. I think of the therapeutic efficacy of the ketogenic diet is through insulin suppression and, suppressing the insulin pathway, limiting glucose availability, and also to some extent, elevating ketones. We know this because if we put ex-articles ketones into a standard diet, we can extend the life of animals that have metastatic cancer. So we published that in the International Journal of Cancer. But what was happening was when you put the ketones in the standard diet food, they probably eat a little bit less, and it's also lowering blood glucose and changing metabolic physiology. But it may not be, and then the reviewers rightly asked, they said, well, go do a calorie restriction group. So we took a standard diet and calorie restricted like 25%. And we saw an increase in survival, but it was nowhere near the increase in survival from adding the ketones to the standard diet. So we did that control. So to get back to your question, yeah, I think brain tumors, aggressive, solid tumors, endometrial cancers, maybe certain GI cancers, maybe lung cancer, you know, are responsive. The cancers that are associated with metabolic derangement are probably responsive. Also cancers that are more aggressive are more glypholytic, so they're more likely to respond. And brain cancers are good. A good cancer to study because you get seizures with brain cancers, and because the tools, the treatments are so limited, like little less to them, though we just know that the standard care does not work. So you want to use something. A dietary approach can then potentially make the existing drugs work, or augment the many different factors that could make the brain cancer more responsive. To the tumor. But there are different mutations. There's one for melanoma, B, Raff, B, 600 E mutation, I believe, which changes the tumor metabolism in a way that can actually maybe cause a CO acetate to be used as fuel. Some cancers may respond to ketones in ways that are different than other cancer cells, like the brain tumor cells that we've studied in the lab. So in particular, there's a melanoma cell line at least that has a B, Raff, 600 B, Raff, B, 600 E mutation, I believe. And in those cancer cells have been shown to use acetylacetate as potentially an energy source, but also for biosynthetic reactions. And I suspect there's a variety of during cancer cells that can use ketones not only as a biosynthetic molecule, but maybe even for energy too, but I think largely cancer cells that are more aggressive have reverted back to a glycolidic phenotype, where they are primarily relying on fermentable fuels. And that includes glucose and glutamine, are the two fuels. And cancer cells that are more glycolidic and very sort of damaged in their respiration due to the hypoxia of expanding tumor mass. So as a tumor grows, it outstrips its ability to supply blood flow and oxygen to the tumor, so it becomes hypoxic, and that further damages the mitochondria. So it causes the tumor to be more glycolidic and less of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. So literally this would mean that tumor cells, especially the core of expanding tumor biomass, would not be able to use ketones as an energy source, so it might a congerial energy event. So in that way, we think that ketones are not an ideal fuel for tumors in our model systems. It's very clear that they cannot run in the absence of glucose, tumor cells die, whereas even in the presence of consistent glucose, when we add ketones, there seems to be a decrease in proliferation. And we think that could be due to a ketone induced decrease in hexaclionates, which is a glycolidic enzyme. So there's a lot of potential, I think, for using ketogenic diets as an adjunct therapy, and then maybe some potential as using exogenous ketones, as it means to influence the tumor microenvironment, and also to influence essentially the metabolism of the tumor as a whole. Also, as you mentioned earlier, with Dr. Eric Berden and John Ramsey's co-publish studies, there was a reduction, and there's a permissible preventative mechanism as well, with, at least, according to animal research, there being a reduction in spontaneous tumors in these rodents, seems promising to study as well. If there's any way we can reduce cancer incidents, it's always easier to not get cancer than to try to treat it. Exactly. So that's also really a sort of interesting and promising field that. And I think, I mean, those results were impressive. So suppressing tumor growth through probably IGF1 and M2R, and just suppressing keeping inflammation low, and many other, you know, biomarkers. I think it's optimizing to do that. But if we take these ketogenic diets and optimize it with specific phytonutrans, and we add some fiber in, and we add, I mean, then I think, then it becomes difficult to figure out what's doing what, but I do feel that there's some synergy in optimizing a ketogenic diet with plant, we know fiber, and phytonutrans that we know have anti-carcinogenic effects, like, curcumin and tumor, and egcg, and, you know, there's groups at the cancer institute that spend their whole life studying just a handful of these phytonutrans, and they show that has remarkable chemo prevention effects. So we should be incorporating these into ketogenic diet. Which brings us to the all meat. No carbohydrate diet, really. Yeah. There's a lot of people that sort of feel like they've done a ketogenic diet, and they need to graduate somehow to another level of zero carb. Yeah. What are your thoughts on, I mean, well, I'm not sure if it's like, I think it's going back towards kindergarten. So I do think there's no doubt that a carnivore diet is beneficial for some people, and I think it's therapeutic in some ways. It is a form of a ketogenic diet. I followed it, actually felt pretty good on it, subjectively, but objectively, my biomarkers were my LDL. I think it was doubled on it, and then my triglyceride started to creep up. So this was a little bit of a concern for me, like, if you have the fat pathways, we're a little bit backed up. For example, if you have an inborn error metabolism, like carnitine deficiency, either primary or secondary, a tell-tell sign is like an elevation of triglycerides, hypoketoneemia, and then you have like, you know, a lot of a cascade of different things. Like you're just not metabolizing fat as well as you should be. Whereas we know that certain omega-3 fatty acids can actually increase the carnitile, you know, transferease, and actually augment fat oxidation. Certain fatty acids can. For me personally, I felt good. I felt fine, but my blood work was a little bit concerning, and when I went back to just adding more fish and omega-3 fats and more plants back into my diet. Maybe it was a fiber, maybe it was by the nutrients. I felt just as good, but I brought my biomarkers, especially my triglycerides came back down again. But I think the, you know, depends on the type of meat that you're eating, the amount of food that you're eating, if you're eating the carnivore diet, and creating a calorie deficit while you're doing it. I think it could be beneficial, but I don't think it's something that would be sustainable or optimal long-term. So it could be sustainable. It is for a number of people that I know, but I guess the question is is the optimal, and I have no science. I'm not aware of any science that supports a carnivore diet is optimal for treating anything, although I've been in communication with people who have benefited greatly from it. So I'm not going to criticize it too harshly. It is a form of a ketrachan type. I mean, it's like, as you mentioned, it's like, well, are these people severely caloric restricting themselves? Yeah. What are they just getting off of a terrible diet that's... Yes. There's so many factors, and again, it's like, well, you know, it's the lack of fiber. Lack of fiber, and you know, the phytonutrients, which kind of brings it back to the fiber issue, right? Because it's obvious that we could do well off no fiber at all. So the question is, like, you know, is fiber necessary? I don't think it's necessary, but I think it's optimal. So I think excluding it altogether is not doing our bodies any favor. And I think when we add it back in, there's just so much good data on fiber that it's hard to ignore. So that's why, you know... What do you think the colonocytes and getting the buterate from fiber, like, what do you think is happening in the gut? And someone with a no fiber diet, like what... Like the buterate is so incredibly important for gut health. It is. Yeah. It's a primary fuel for colonocytes. And so... I don't know, but I do know that if it caused like a massive disruption of the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability, it would show up on blood work as like HSCRP elevation. My intended actually went up like from point one to like point two or point three. But that's like now that... So I think humans are omnivores and they're incredibly adaptable to any kind of diet. So, and I think that dietary diversity might be a good thing. But you have, you know, populations of people like in Africa or other areas where they just eat like one food all the time. And it could be like some corn meal or it could be whale blubber. And another... And they do perfectly well. They survive. They live a healthy life. So that's... It's just staggeringly remarkable that we have the metabolic flexibility and adaptation to eat almost anything. You know, the question is what is optimal? Should we even be eating such a huge diversity of things? And I think that could be beneficial, at least, you know, it gives us an array of different things that we can eat. And we're grabbing nutrients from different areas. But... But yeah, I am kind of a little bit neutral on the carnival diet. I think it's beneficial for some, but I think it's suboptimal. As a ketogenic type. And as you mentioned, there's just a lack of empirical evidence. There's an example of that. Yeah. Which, again, is compounded all the time by many things. But yeah. There's really not a lot of research that's done. I mean, published and peer reviewed and actually... Yeah. But there are people doing it and they're thriving on it. That's true. They've corrected various... Everything from autoimmune disorders. You know, there's super high achievers. You have Sean Baker who's just like a physical specimen. And he's just eating nothing but meat and doing very well. And I don't know. I haven't seen his blood work, but I think it's okay. I mean, he's smart enough. But I do think that if you're eating a carnival diet and you're getting surplus amount of calories, which I kind of did because I added just a few pounds. And I think that negatively affected a lot of my blood work. But if you eat a carnival diet and a calorie deficit, then I think it could be therapeutic and potentially helpful. So it all comes down to calories. People ask me if the calories matter. I think they most certainly do. You need to appreciate that. Because a lot of the QJN diet community, they say don't count calories, just count carbs or, you know, it's as a calories don't matter if you eat this way. But calories absolutely matter. You mentioned having a... you do intermittent fasting sort of, sickly and is it... like how many times a week or how many meals a day, like, you know, is it something that you alternate each week? My normal pattern is to have like a small, ketogenic breakfast. And then more or less fast through midday. I'll have like a ketone supplement or maybe a small coffee, but not past two o'clock. And then I eat wheat dinner typically between like five and six. Probably try not to do a little bit later if I'm working ways and then this later. But I consume the most like 80% of my calories between the six and nine p.m. I know nine sounds kind of late, but we go to bed around, you know, 11 o'clock. But I get the bulk of my calories probably with dinner, which is around like six, five, five or six or six. So, and most a lot of my protein too, but in the morning I eat a ketogenic breakfast, lately I have been eating waffles and making waffles. There's different ketogenic waffle recipes that are really, really good. So I've been experimenting in the kitchen a bit with my wife. What about your exercise routine? Yeah, I try to do some form of exercise every day. I mean, we have some pretty, we live on a farm, so farm work, hockey pies, probably about 10 to 20 hours a week of my time doings. And that's good outdoor activity, getting sun, exercise around the cows. We walk our dogs, you know, usually like twice a day, and then I do resistance training. No less than twice a week, but sometimes I try to get four times a week if I can. And then I like to do a lot of body weight exercises. And you think when you're traveling and you're pretty busy, like chin ups, push ups, dips. A lot of chin ups are probably like one of my favorite exercises, pull ups, chin ups. And then you're doing some hot tub therapy. Hot tub therapy, yes. So the benefits, so your article on sauna and just hyperthermia in general. So I did some experiments measuring my core temperature and showed that I can getting the hot tub to about 105 to 110. I can get my body temperature up to about 102 within about 15 minutes. And I really believe in looking at the literature. And also after I do this, I then measure wife measure my glucose and my blood pressure comes down. To be unlike my blood pressure, like the lowest it's ever been. It's like 97 over 60 or 58 or something. It's really low. And I always trended on the higher end of systolic, especially like 130, 140. I think during grad school was like 45 consistently systolic pressure always ran a little bit higher systolic. Although I had carried more massive time. But the one thing that has really moved the needle and my blood pressure has been not changing anything and just doing what I'll call heat there. That's awesome. That's awesome. Right at down by a 10% and that was like measuring like five times a day, blood pressure throughout the day because I became. I would love to have a continuous blood pressure monitor. That would be really cool. But my continuous glucose monitor with the levels health app is very insightful and gives information. And I can do like a comparison of this meal, risk that meal and sauna versus, you know, cold. I can actually, I can market and time market and do a CGM comparison. What's the best way to measure your actual key tones? Is it blood, breath, what's. Good question. Yeah. Best versus also most like like easy for people as well. I mean they're both kind of important. Again, like people don't like to say it depends. So that's my answer to a lot of things. So it's context dependent. The clinicians that are managing epilepsy patients say that urine is great and they're not going to change from urine. And they're doing because they don't want to print the kids finger too, right? So I did blood. I like using the glucose ketone index. The ketone. It's your glucose over ketones in a millimolar concentration. So if you're fasting, it takes me about 72 days, 72 hours to get, although they're the guy fasted for 360 or 80 days. Fasting for 72 hours gets my glucose ketone index to one where my glucose comes down to about 3 millimolar. My ketones come up to 3 millimolar. So that would be a glucose ketone index of one. And it's my belief, although I haven't measured LC3 and other components of the auto-facosome. It's my belief that achieving and sustaining a glucose ketone index of one for 24 hours will induce and perhaps maximize autophagy. No doubt that you can get more benefits five, seven days. But then at five days and seven days, I see a suppression in testosterone and other things. I don't like. So for me, three days is like the sweet spot. I can achieve a glucose ketone index of one. And then my breath acetone is off the charts. And I think breath acetone is probably your best ketone to measure if you want to lose fat. So all the carbons of the acetone you're blowing off essentially are from fat. So when you look at the device and it's reading like 40, it's like, you're just basically exhaling fat carbons. So from that. So I think breath acetone is great because with beta hydroxybutorate, I could be at 2 or 3 millimolar and just walk around the house or do some activity and then I'm back down to like below one. That's because your body's using the beta hydroxybutorate as fuel. And if you have a calorie deficit, you have a high tissue uptake of beta hydroxybutorate, right? Whereas my breath acetone seems to be more stable and a better correlate of fat oxidation. So and it's also easier. So if you're blowing into a breath acetone meter five times a day, that's a lot of money in strips and a lot of poking your finger. So I use the readout health biosense device and I don't know, I've blown into mine like a thousand times and that would be cost prohibitive from a ketone monitoring perspective and a lot of finger prick associated with that. And it has a pretty cool app and also a fasting sort of meter in with it. I think they collaborate with zero fasting. So I think there's some collaboration there, but it can show you if you're doing a fasting and using that. Although it's more of a clinical device, but it's now it's broken into more mainstream. So it's an FDA approved class one or whatever physical device medical device for measuring ketones. And I became interested in acetone because it correlates with seizure control. So I recommend it to parents who have kids that are managing and they don't want their fingers prick and the urine ketone strips are not very accurate. So to answer your question, I think both of blood ketone measurements, if you're just starting the ketone diet, it may be good to just use urine to say yes your incitosis, you're not. It's like semi-quanotative and then spend the money to get a ketone meter, like the ketone mojo device, probably one of the best and then a breath acetone meter is good for people who are doing fasting and for people that are really interested in weight loss. What about using blood glucose levels, like as a proxy, like is there? That's like super interesting. Yeah, we had an NIH workshop sort of on this and I brought this up as a continuous ketone monitoring or continuous glucose monitoring system. And now you have the ketone monitoring system. With Abbott has a lingo device, which does glucose ketones lactate and also alcohol. But at CGM device is like the ultimate device to look at dietary adherence to a ketogenic diet because it should be the trace should be completely flat. And if there's big excursions in that person's non-on-a-cute, I guess if there are under stress or there are exercising really hard, you might get a blip, but generally speaking, like a CGM trace is a very, very good way to tell if someone is adhering to a ketogenic diet. So these things should be used, I think, and generally speaking, the community also feels that this needs to be used, but it's an off-label use. Is there like a level that's like a range or the beer, like, if you were to give an estimate, guest-demon of what the host level, like to, to like, for a huge ant diet for real? Yeah, to say, like, I'm probably in ketosis because my blip glucose levels are X. Yeah, why could show you on my, so what was very interesting when I woke up this morning, I spiked 40 milligrams per desolator. I've never seen that before, like, ever. And so my CGM trace typically looks like probably now it's going to be maybe I'm excited, maybe it's all over the place, but it's going to look like, so I didn't, what I, I said it to, I added, like, an extra 30, so it wouldn't go off negative, dirty, but right now if you subtract 30 from that number, that's, that's what your CGM trace should look like on a ketogenic diet. And you've wearing youth worn as a family. Yeah, I'm before. So I'm 74. Yeah, so, but when I woke up this morning, it's not, I had a big, I only have maybe, like, four and a half hours. So it could be that it could be that different time zone or something. Oh, yeah, totally, that's it. I mean, when I, that was the first thing I learned from my CGM was, because I started wearing it when my son was, like, four or five months old. So I was, I was really like, I was waking up multiple times, breastfeed, and, you know, I mean, so my sleep was insanely disrupted and fragmented and my blood glucose was just out. It was just going out of control and it was always on the nights when I was like, like, waking up multiple times and not getting enough sleep. And, and that was like one of the biggest things I learned from my CGM. That was surprising to me. Where were your highs? Like, I'll hire your highs. So my spike to almost like 130 or 140, and that's unheard of. Like, I've never seen that, but that just could be due to the time change and getting about half of the normal sleep that I get. I can't. I mean, I feel fine now. But okay. It's been to the years, but they were very variable. Yeah. It was something like that. It was above 120. You know, like, where it was like, this is post-prandial level. Like, you know, like, this is pretty, like, you know, intense, you know, like a robust effect. High intensity training. I was doing a lot of spin class and stuff, like, hour long, like, pretty intense. That was really, that would help. Like, so if I do the spin and then have the disruption that night after the spin, it was way better. Like, my glucose was way better. So like, the exercise totally helped negate some of the glucose dysregulation. I don't know what exactly was happening, but my glucose spiking so high. So, so that was also a learning. I learned so much from the CGM. Yeah. I haven't worn it for a couple of months because after re, I think I'm going to do levels. Because my prescriptions, like, levels was great. Yeah. I'm like a cat. I think I'm going to move to levels. So I did, I'm not going to mention the other, but I did a couple of different companies and I just wore it. But levels, well, they're in bed now, but the difference about levels is that it's kind of coaching you. And you also have the option to, I mean, you could just push and get to a nutritionist. So I guess that's good for people, maybe not like us, but for the average average. But it has so many features built in where I exercise. It'll say, you know, what did you do here? We saw that you exercise. So it, it learns my body even if I have a couple of coffee in the morning. It learns my sort of dawn effect. And I just take a picture of my food at event marks it. And then it sends me an email the next day of the picture of my food. My average glucose effect, my metabolic score and things like that. So it's so easy. Otherwise, I mean, you could just buy a CGM. I guess if you had someone prescribed it to you and just look at the CGM trace and then make your own influence. But I kind of like having, as long as I engage with the app and I take a picture of my food and everything, I get the email the next day. And that tells me what happened to my glycemic response the whole day. And it also gives me a weekly thing. So all I have to do is just engage with the app once a day. And it sends me like a daily report and also a weekly report where I could see like every day. And there's so many features. I don't even use like 90% of the features, but I use like 10% of the features and it's very useful to me. And I think so we're doing a clinical trial right now with CGM. And people have apfeteague, not everybody wants to be on an app all day. But you can engage with it as much as you want or just you know engage with it. Two or three minutes per day is enough to really be getting a lot of insight into your metabolism. I found just even just wearing this EGM without even having to do all the app stuff. Really helped me figure out what foods that I should be eating and portion sizes and all that stuff because it was like. Well we're your biggest surprises. The cook spinach was the one because I was like, oh, the sugar and it is a local I see making. Yeah. But what you said makes a lot of sense. I think that was that was a big surprise. And then another really big surprise was like a lot of these like cauliflower rice. You know like I was traveling in part on part of this you know where I was on the QJ diet. And so I would like order food that was like this is keto and you get something. Yeah. This is keto and I'm like this is not keto at all. It's like spiking me so high and then you like track down the ingredients and it's like sugar. And I'm like really you're calling this keto but you actually have added sugar in it. Yeah. Other surprises where I was taking some my collagen gummy chewables that didn't have any sugar allegedly. Yeah. And my blood glucose just went through the roof and I'm like what's in this? Yeah. Something same thing. I tried some kind of sugar free gummy. It shot me off the chart. Yeah. And all the bars that I get sent. Yeah. 90% of it. Yeah. The only bar that has completely ketogenic is keto brick. So it's like the brick is 90 grams of fat like and I think 20 like maybe 30 grams of protein and like hardly any carbohydrates. And it's a thousand calorie brick. And that's like truly the only ketogenic you know bar. There's a bunch of bars out there. Keto brick. Oh there's I mean if you go to Costco now it's like. Oh no everywhere. Yeah. I mean it's like keto everything. And it's I haven't yet defined actually something when you will turn around the back and you look at the sugars and the ingredients that like one of these things that was like this coconut keto crunch and my mom loves coconut she was doing keto and like order done on instant car and then I came and I'm like, there's a lot of sugar in this. This is not keto like and how like how dare they call it keto it's so misleading again takes us back to the beginning where it's like this ketos become. It's very much become trendy and it's almost like this marketable thing and you know, I think the Essence of ketosis and some in loss somewhat so It's really been nice having you to talk about all this. I want to talk even longer, but we probably should wrap this up Thank you so much Tom. I want to we're gonna have dinner tonight and talk more so that'll be great but and I want to I want to talk to you about All sorts of things but like for people people that want to learn more about Your research they want to follow you. They want to learn about metabolic health summit or You blogs your you know all those things. There's the best places to find you on social and all those Yeah, thanks for asking. Yeah, keto nutrition dot O R G so keto nutrition dot org and We have a blog there subscribe to the newsletter When this podcast comes out we'll put it in the newsletter of course and a lot of other information that we don't I don't post anywhere else as a newsletter as you do too So subscribe to your newsletter which I did and it's like awesome source of information Metablog health summit which will be happening may fit through the eight Amazing event. We have clinicians, you know basic scientists and Entrepreneurs scrambling to this area and influencers It's an amazing event in Santa Barbara, California. I'm excited to be a co host for that and Yeah, I guess yeah Most of the information that we promote will be on our blog on our website I personally do not have any products people always ask me down what your ketone product I don't have a ketone product but I do support a number of different companies and it's on the website The exogenous ketone product that I use is keto start keto brick is my go to keto bar. I get that question asked all the time and Keto brains is a coffee creamer that I use got alpha GP C The anine it's got lion's mane in it I've also got C8 so these are three supplements that I use pretty much on a daily basis not a huge supplement guy These are supplements we love and promote on that website and you're also on Twitter on Twitter Yeah, if you search my name always forget my Twitter handle but on Instagram Twitter Facebook I like to share in new literature that's out our publications and others in the space so I try to be a resource not as much as you But which you put out amazing information and truly appreciate you giving me this platform to give my information to your followers Oh, thank you. Thank you for all your research. Don't mind I'm looking forward to more and To have future conversation. Thank you

Hello everyone, welcome back to the podcast. I'm here today with Dr. Iran Ilinoff. He is an MD PhD and a professor of immunology. He is the principal investigator of two labs, one of the Weitzman Institute of Science in Tel Aviv Israel and the other at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. His research focuses on understanding the complex interaction we have with the bacteria in our gut and how this shapes human health and disease. Dr. Ilinoff, along with his collaborators, discovered that people consuming identical foods have diverse metabolic responses that depend on a variety of factors, including microbiome composition. He also discovered along with his collaborators that bacteria in our gut are on a circadian rhythm and how this may have metabolic consequences that depend on when we eat in addition to what we eat. So I'm very excited. We're going to talk about a lot of interesting stuff, all things microbiome today. I kind of want to start off, Iran with the circadian rhythm that the gut microbiome is on and how this can relate to meal timing and metabolic responses. We have talked quite a bit about circadian rhythms on the podcast from the masters circadian clock in our super-chiasmatic nucleus and how light resets that clock and how there's peripherals circadian clocks and other organs such as the liver and how food intake is the major signal that resets that clock. So if you years back, you're labed to discover that the bacteria that reside in our gut have their own circadian rhythms. So can you talk maybe just explain a little bit about this to people? Absolutely. It's great to be talking to you, Iran. We have done a lot of research in trying to understand better how the composition of diet impacts our gut microbes and through interactions with our microbes, immediate metabolic health and metabolic disease. But surprisingly, we stumble upon a quite major discovery in which not only the composition of diet impacts our gut microbes are actually the timing of diet has an independent and very peculiar effect on the composition and on the function of our gut microbes and through these time dependent interactions our gut microbiome can independently impact our metabolic health or our propensity to develop diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. And basically the discovery came across a very laborious project in which we tried to characterize the composition and the function of our gut microbes at different time points along with 24-hour cycle. So basically my students sampled mice or humans each for every four hours of an entire 24-hour cycle. And then we were surprised to find that many of the functions of our microbes change in very consistent manners along the course of a day. Now this was super surprising to us because if you think about it, our gut microbes leave completely in the dark so how does they know that it's day or night and change their activity so reproducibly at the exact same hours along a 24-hour cycle? And this set to three years of intense research and the answer was that our microbes sense the timing in which we eat or do not eat and change their activity accordingly. In other words, during the day when humans are awakened eating the microbes behave in one way but during the night when we're asleep they behave in very different manners and in mice which are awake at night and sleep during the day this activity is completely off. So I have a follow-up question for you. We, you know, there's been a lot of research that have looked at how many genes in our body and particularly genes that relate to metabolism are controlled by a circadian rhythm and so for example, you know there've been quite a few studies now that have shown that people are if you give them identical foods in the morning versus the evening time and you look at post-prandial glucose response for example. You'll see that people, you know, the post-prandial glucose response is much higher in the evening people are more insulin sensitive in the morning as well. So to the bacteria in our gut, is there a role that they play in energy production in perhaps the post-prandial glucose response for example? That was one of the most surprising and intriguing part of our discovery. Not only did we discover that the timing of our diet impacts the composition and the function of our gut microbes throughout the course of a day we found that this amazing angle between our diet and our microbes also signals to the host to mice in some cases and to humans in other studies which we conducted and basically this circadian microbial activity builds into the circadian clock which homox every cell and organ in our body. In other words, the microbial circadian rhythmicity is a critical part that participates in disorderly, the urinal behavior of ourselves and our organs at different locations in our body and once we disrupt the circadian microbial activity for example by changing the patterns of our diet or by subjecting mice to jet lag behavior the microbes go crazy and stop behaving in this orderly manner throughout the course of a day and this directly reflects on how the host behaves in its normal circadian behavior and we found that once we disrupt the microbes, the host is now susceptible to develop obesity and peptidarities which is exactly the set of diseases which all my humans which feature acronic disturbance in their wakes, the patterns such as shift workers that are at a substantial risk of developing obesity and peptidarities and for many years we didn't know what was the missing link that caused this risk behavior and now we think that at this part of the answer lies within the microbes themselves. Do you think that there's any potential solutions for example shift workers who are awake in the evening hours and eating food? So we've learned a lot about time restricted eating or time restricted feeding and how that can potentially positively impact a shift worker's metabolism if they try to limit their food for example into a certain time window maybe 10 hours rather than eating throughout the time that they're awake at night. Do you think that this also has implications for affecting the gut microbiome as well doing this time restricted eating if you are a shift worker or even in general? Absolutely and what we've discovered at least in mice and also to some extent we and others have discovered this to occur in humans is that the dominant factor that determines the urinal activity of microbes throughout the course of a day is the timing of our feeding and when we disrupt the timing of our feeding for example by subjecting mice to a shift worker kind of lifestyle or jet lag or even in genetically clocked efficient mice we disrupt the macobel circuit in activity. However if we take all of these disrupted conditions and now we time restrict the feeding of these mice to imitate the normal eating behavior in non-destrupted mice then we can completely restore the microbiome circuit in activity and it's a fact on the metabolic and immune function of the house. So it's least in mice and to some extent humans indeed time restricted feeding could restore and altered microbial behaviors across a behavior across the course of a 25-hour cycle. However if you think about it this does not really solve the human problem because if a doctor or physician or a nurse in a hospital has to go through a night shift and therefore features a disrupted the microbiome and a risk of developing obesity impact today because of the disrupted microbiome you cannot ask a nurse or a physician to eat after they've been awake for in the entire night just so they restore their gut microbiome composition and function. So what we're trying to do is to decode the molecular mechanisms by which our microbes communicate with our host cells at different time points throughout the course of a day and when we understand what goes wrong what gets disrupted when the circadian rhythm is disturbed maybe we could develop new interventions that would enable the microbes to now correct the signal to the host and to avoid these risk behaviors and these susceptibility to disease. If some of these microbes there so they're obviously sensitive to the feeding fasting period so food intake versus not eating what about the composition of the food like does that play a role does that matter in addition to some of these these micro species that are that are inactive on their diurnal circadian rhythm. I think that of all the different environmental factors that affect a human and surround us our stress levels the medications we take where we live and how we we conduct our lives the composition of the diet is probably the most important and most dominant factor which impacts our gut microbes and and this has been shown by us in the personalized nutrition project but it has been extensively shown by many others and and I think it is safe to say that of all the features that we and others are studying there's nothing more important and dominant than the composition over diet. Well let's talk a little bit at dive into that a little bit like you know maybe starting with some of the macro nutrients like how do the composition of our diet including proteins or carbohydrates complex carbohydrates versus you know a simple carbohydrates or even fat in the type of fat saturated fat versus polyunsaturated fat or monounsaturated fat. How does that affect or whether we eat a plant-based diet or animal-based diet? How does that affect the composition of our microbiome? That's a great question and to be honest I think that our very young field is only beginning to mechanistically unravel these complex effects and there are many different types of effects by which micro and macronutrients in our diet could impact our microbes. For example some of our nutritional inputs could serve as an energy source to microbes and some microbes would preferentially digest some but not other components of our diets. So there is as you may imagine there may be a competitive advantage to some microbes over others depending on the diet that they're exposed to. Other impacts could relate to an even more in a magnetic part of the microbiome which is bacterial bacterial communications and we increasingly know that we have trillions of bacteria in our gut and these form ecosystems or communities in which they're very marked and poorly understood communication channels between different bacteria that determine who would survive, who would flourish and who would not. And these also many interesting aspects relate to signals that are obtained from our diet and a third example of how diet composition could impact our microbes relate to the host and many of our dietary components are sensed or are absorbed by the host which changes its behavior in response to these compounds and the host could be you know regarded as a very sophisticated incubator that houses all of these microbes and by changing its behaviors or its conditions of the host in response to that could change the relative composition and function of different microbes over others. What about you know there's their their people you know living in in certain parts of for example Africa that are you know they eat a very very like from day to day the diet's very similar you know they're eating lots of complex carbohydrates for example I mean it's a very much they eat the same meals like almost every day versus someone living in like you know in the western world and the United States for example where there's you know the diet's very so much from person to person and depending on like processed foods versus you know eating whole foods you know how how stable is the microbiome if for example we were to switch diet so if someone in the western world was to eat something more like you know plantains and these you know complex carbohydrates and and vice versa. Yeah it's an excellent question and the answer is that it really depends on which resolution you're looking at the microbiome in terms of its stability so just to give you an example if you look from from a bird's eye view way from up top at an adult person's microbiome and you're talking about a healthy adult with a relatively stable lifestyle then the microbiome composition over time in that adult would seem very very stable. We we discovered that even in industrialized nations people are usually exposed to no more than 40 or 50 components of of of dietary dietary composition in a routine lifestyle so the variation in our individual exposure to food is much less than then you would expect and if you just you know looking to the composition and the function of the microbiome from from this resolution you would find that it changes very in a very minor manner between the age of three until we get to an old age or if we develop disease or change our lifestyle. However if you dive deeper into the microbiome you would find that there are more interesting changes that are you know more subtle and and characterize our healthy being. For example there are studies in Africa looking into rainy or dry seasons which are characterized by different exposures to different crops and different foods and you can see that these are very consistent and very reproducible change that that is based on the changes in the in the in the in the seasons and and what they represent. If you look even closer as we just discussed even at a 24 hour cycle you would find that the microbiome is what we call stable and stable it is stable but it oscillates throughout a 24 hour cycle in a very reproducible manner and this relates to a healthy state. Now when you start adding into it all the perturbations and all the exposures that the human may be experiencing for example changes in diet as you highlight changes in where we live changes in our health status in our stress status in the medications that we eat all of these environmental signals or cues reflect on our gut microbes in a way that may impact our physiology or risk of developing diseases. What do you think about for example a vegetarian diet versus someone you know it's become it's become quite popular actually in the United States this carnivore diet where people actually cut out all carbohydrates and they eat only meat. How is that going to impact the microbiome or do we know? Yeah there are very elegant studies early on from from the kind of birth of the field by researchers such as Jeff Gordon and Fred Beckett which have shown that you know if you are broadly change the composition of the diet from one type to another for example from a veggie to a carnivore diet you very reproducibly change in an average in a population average you very reproducibly change the composition of the microbiome into one which accommodates better than you and this is kind of when you look at relatively lower resolution into the microbiome. However if you look at a higher resolution and this I think was one of the exciting discoveries that we came across in the personalized nutrition project you would find that even within the same diet people react very differently when you look closely enough. So the answer is a complex one you know in 2015 we've conducted our own kind of mini trial in which we took a group of healthy human individuals and we've asked them politely to eat only white rice per week then only you know steak for another week while we extensively measured them for their microbiome and we found indeed that the microbiome changes in a very reproducible manner even if the starting configuration is different between people the direction of of the changes very similar when you look at the same bacteria in different people with respect to the response to the same dietary change but when you look at a more relive scenario you would find that people are uniquely responding to dietary components even if they're exposed to the same exact diet and this is the whole mark of the personalized nutrition approach. What role does microbiome diversity play in for example the you know metabolic responses to food like post-Pranial glucose response or you know when it comes to our personalized responses to diet? Well if you're thinking about microbial diversity or the richness of a given microbiome there are many interesting observations that try to relate the loss of diversity to a propensity to develop this disease. So for example if you look at indigenous populations of humans hunter-gatherers and so on and so forth you would find in some studies that diversity of the microbiome can be tensed for the higher than the average diversity that we can see and measure in the same human beings when they live in modern quote at quote society during industrialized society and and people have tried to link this amazing reduction in diversity to the modern a risk of developing diseases such as obesity type to diabetes fatiliver and even cancer and other diseases. However the causal role implicating the richness first say of the microbiome to this disease is still merits further investigation for the jury is still out there although I must say that in many microbiome associated diseases we indeed see a reduction in diversity that characterizes the disease state whether the diversity reduction is by itself a risk factor to the development of disease or whether it just reflects the emergence of dominant disease causing microbes is an open question that at least to my opinion has not been sufficiently answered yet. Speaking about the diversity and how it changes the question is how it changes throughout the lifespan so you mentioned you know a few minutes ago about the microbiome being pretty stable generally speaking after the age of about three so kind of this is a two-part question one would be what factors like it seems as though during early development it would be very important if if that's you know if you're shaping the overall general stability of the gut microbiome in the first three years of life what impact you know for example feeding your infant and young young child you know breast milk which has things like human milk, oligosaccharides and a variety of factors that have been shown to be very important for the gut microbiome and shaping it and then also you know what foods you do feed your child or antibiotic use or factors like that do you think that the parents should be focused somewhat on the the health of their young young growing child you know gut microbiome in those first three years of life or exposing them to for example you know soil and and other you know bacterial exposures that they're getting from the environment. I expect that the data we have is thirdly points toward that direction so so there's lots of lots of data emerging in animal models and also quite a lot of data emerging in humans that suggest that the critical window of opportunity in the first three years of a human's life is the window in which we shape our adult configuration of the microbiome and this window of opportunity is also a window of risk is one in which you know the microbiome can be influenced both by our parents and our immediate surroundings but also by what we eat what we're exposed to and the amount of environment that are micro-sense and and this kind of brings a little bit of a paradox because we as humans were raised in the last two centuries to to be afraid of of microbes and of infections which justifiably were the leading cause of death in humans the familiar in the years but we now are slowly realizing that by overly protecting our children from exposure to these microbes that surround us in every you know every material that surrounds a young child may predispose to an under development of their microbiome in other words by subjecting kids to an overly sterile condition we may be harming them by not allowing their microbiome to shape in a diverse enough manner that would train our immune system and and would impact our healthy metabolism in a way that would result in health in years to come and and especially in mice but also in to some extent in humans it was shown that early life exposure to antibiotics for example could save lives in many cases but the price that we may pay is an increased risk for these diseases such as asthma these are elegant studies that were performed by my friend and colleague Brett Finley and to obesity in later life and and and other diseases so you know the proof of causality especially in human in human patients is very hard to achieve but it seems that the majority of evidence from the decade and a half of microbiome research is certainly points to that possibility of that direction. I remember my son is now four but when you know when I was really new mother I remember coming across a study where early life exposure within the first year to to dirt like you know dirt and obviously the bacteria that are in the dirt it seemed to be protective against later development of asthma was a big one I think there is you know auto immune type of you know response and so I really and you know as you mentioned you know we this hygiene you know obsession that we have in industrialized nations you know which you know there's a good rationale behind that but you know we all live in these buildings and you know not many people have any dirt or trees or just you know sand and so you really in some cases have to make an effort to go out and expose your young child you know let them play in the dirt let them get dirty and so I definitely try to do that as much as possible when my when my son was you know early during early development so I totally agree and and this is supported for example by epidermiological evidence of some of the auto immune or auto inflammatory disease is being much less prevalent in kind of you know quote unquote dirty or countries or countries in which the prevalence of exposure at early life to environmental infection is higher as compared to cleaner quote unquote countries which suffer from and from a marked increase in in this auto immune or auto inflammatory diseases they're very elegant studies by my colleague Martin Blaser from NYU showing in my sense I think also humans that that this overly this this this think the position or or changes on the development of the microbiome could impact on the susceptibility to develop disease such as inflammatory bowel disease in later life so this link certainly has been suggested and to some extent has been demonstrated to probably occur a form of proof of causality in diseases which may take many years and even decades to develop is very hard to achieve in humans so there too I think that the supporting evidence is is very robust but in order to get a completely you know finalized proof you know it would take more time to you so the the kind of the question I have is like is there we're talking a lot about the environment how that shaping the gut microbiome and it just sort of came to my mind like you know there there's some women for example that you know have IBD irritable disease or something for for whatever reason I don't you know whatever the cause causal factor is is there a genetic component or something that can still influence the microbiome composition let's say that woman has a child and you know like is there some sort of trans generational effect of microbiome like what if you know this woman had a lot maybe she's got IBD because she had serial exposures to antibiotics combined with you know poor poor meal timing or you know who knows with the combination of environmental factors could have been to influence her microbiome does her does the mother's microbiome affect the child's microbiome is there any evidence of that? Well I would divide my answer into two parts first of all every child is born sterile to the best of our knowledge and acquires his or her microbiome during the new natal period from his or her immediate surrounding which mainly consists of their parents who are very close to them so in addition to to many other environmental factors it seems that a child's microbiome is very much influenced by that of their parent and especially their mother in cases in which the mother you know takes more care of of a baby than than the father. With that said the question you're raising is a fundamental question in the microbiome field which if I were to refresh with ask whether the microbiome is shaped by our genes or by our environment and and this remained an open question for many years until we conducted an ambitious study in which we took 500 healthy individual and we comprehensively profile their microbiome and assessed as much as we could many of the environmental factors that influence them including their dietary habits and so on and so forth and we sequence their genes so we characterize their human genome so for the first time we could directly compare the influence of our human genome and our environment on the composition and the function of the microbiome and also to compare the potential contribution of the microbiome and the human genes on different human traits and the answer was an intriguing answer what we found was that most of the effect shaping our microbiome comes from the environment only 1.9% of the variability in the human microbiome could be explained by differences in the human genes. Well close to 99% of the variability in the human microbiome was explainable by factors coming from people's environment. That doesn't mean that the 1.9% of the genes is not exceedingly important there could be some genes there that are exceedingly and dramatically important in generating a healthy microbiome just tells you that the weight of the effect is mainly coming from the environment and this is very encouraging because the environment in contrast to our human genes could be modulated. So if a microbiome changes for any reason to a configuration which favors this disease we could hopefully find ways by which we modify the environment that is sensed by the microbiome in order to reverse it back to a healthy configuration. The second revelation from the study was equally interesting to us and what we found was that some human traits were only impacted by the human genes. So for example if you look at human height it is not affected by the microbiome whatsoever so almost all of the explanation for differences in human height came from the human gene and not from the microbes. However when we looked at a number of metabolic parameters such as weight, weight to heat, pressure, cholesterol levels than many other metabolic features we found that the microbes, the microbiome and the human genes had independent and very substantial effects on these traits. In other words the microbiome and the human body or the human genomic system participate in the determination of our healthy metabolism and our risk of developing metabolic disease. I just brought up a question. I want to circle back to dietary composition because you've done so much work on that but that's what you just said brought up a question in my mind about cholesterol. The microbiome having an independent effect on cholesterol, we do know that genetics plays a role as well but do you know is that have you or any of your colleagues looked into the mechanism for that or multiple, I guess probably multiple mechanisms? I'm thinking along the lines of inflammation and how when there's an inflammatory response cholesterol is produced. That's a well-known thing is that you should always have at least an end of two when you're getting your cholesterol levels measured because you know if you have some sort of stressful event or something that's causing inflammation or if you're sick, you can have you know high cholesterol levels and that's not necessarily indicative of what is your cholesterol levels are. You're absolutely right and I can tell you that we and several other groups have reproducibly found that different aspects of healthy cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in humans and in mice are modulated by the gut microbiome. So for example in the personalized nutrition project and in interventional trials that were followed as part of this project we found that modification of the personalized nutritional recommendations could lead to an improvement in HD alcoholistoral, the good cholesterol. Another group from the UK conducted a very ambitious follow-up trial similar to the personalized nutrition project which we started with a called the predict trial and in this trial they could show something very exciting which is that the microbiome and the host could use to predict a person's triglyceride levels. In other words not only did they associate the microbes to features of fatty acid metabolism or triglycerides which are one of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease they could use data coming from the microbiome in order to predict a person's level of triglycerides which provides another stronger proof to the possible causal association between the two features. Do you think that some of the confounding factors in the many many studies that have been done for example on saturated fat and you know the role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk or in certain biomarkers that indicate cardiovascular disease risk like high cholesterol, LDL cholesterol for example. Do you think that you know there's there are conflicting there's conflicting data where it's it's not always bad but it does seem to be bad so is there a microbiome component like in in the way your body responds to saturated fat? I think the you know the specific answer is I don't know but the conceptual answer is that in every study that we look or conduct we find that inter-individual differences in the microbiome could play a role and potentially explain variability between studies in their outcomes even if they seemingly do the same thing and reach different conclusions. In a can give you endless examples for example our own studies on non-nutritive sweeteneres or artificial sweeteneres suggested that the microbiome is a very major player that modifies the response of some people but not of other people into some of the nutrients and if you look at the body of evidence suggesting that nutrients adversely or favorably impact the human body you know it's all over the place and and the results are very conflicting with the other and people you know spend their career fighting with each other while some of the explanations could lie within inter-individual variability in their physiology including ones that are related to their microbiome. Since you mentioned the artificial sweeteneres maybe we can kind of dive into that just for a moment because it's fascinating work that your lab has done on the metabolic effects of for example artificial sweeteners but also like food additives and multifiers so you mentioned that that people had diverse responses to artificial sweeteners what were those responses like yeah so the study that we've published mainly focused on mice and in mice we studied several artificial sweeteners but we mainly focused on saccharine as a very marked example and what we found to our very big surprise was that mice featured a counterintuitive disturbance in their glycemic responses when they were exposed to saccharine and this was driven by their microbiome so for example when you exposed mice to to saccharine a different doses and took the microbiome after this exposure and transferred it into germ for a mice that never saw saccharine they developed the same disturbances in blood sugar control as those of the donor mice and so this was a very complex study that provided a proof of concept that some dietary compounds that we use mainly modern dietary compounds that we regard as inert because they don't seem to directly impact our body may impact our body in peculiar ways indirectly through their effects on the microbiome and and this I think a proof of concept study was followed by many other studies you mentioned multifiers and there were studies on food colorants and and and and other ingredients which may bear effects in some people based on the on their impacts mediated on the gut microbes and and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing the safety and and the inertness of such substances. Where the levels I think I recall reading the levels of the dietary emulsifiers were even perhaps in levels that were relevant for humans. Yeah and and you know in some of the mouse studies the levels were higher than in humans but many of them the levels were you know very similar to the ones observed in humans you know it it's it's difficult to directly compare mice to humans the metabolism is not exactly the same and we need to say you know to say that out loud the concepts in in many cases are very similar and the effect are very similar but mice are not humans but at least they suggest that such impacts could be could be happening and you know the burden of proof is on us you know before we recommend substance we need to to make sure that at least sufficiently we we understand what it does to our microbes what it does to our human body to make sure that we do know her. So so not every mouse based study could be directly translated into humans but many of them provide an intelligence hypothesis that needs to be ruled in or ruled out in human studies that follow. Well said were there any preliminary human studies that were followed up with with the artificial switners and or the emulsifiers. So with the artificial switners as part of the original study we we published a very preliminary smoke kill study suggesting that personalized responses to saccharine in humans do occur and it could be even transferred upon microbiome transfers from human into humans into germ free mice. This was a very small preliminary study that we and others are trying to follow up on in larger control trials that are hope would teach us on potential personalize effects in how we can anticipate them or predict them in ways which would keep the use safe while you know letting people enjoy sweetness. But but I would certainly say that there is emerging evidence that the findings that we came up with are not only reproducible in multiple animal models you know starting from flies and all the way to to mice rats and and and piglets but they may be relevant to humans. The jury still out there this is a very young field will wait for more result. Well if I can give you a suggestion I think most people nowadays don't consume saccharine like they did 30 20 years ago. The big ones that I know a lot of people would be interested in in knowing whether or not they're affecting the microbiome in a good or bad way or if they're neutral and their effects on metabolism as well would be some of the non-nutriative sweeteners that are from natural sources like stevia or the monk fruit extract. So if you guys are interested in looking at that I think that you know many people would be very very interested in in in that data as well because a lot of people consume it. I can only say we're on at the state to end. Great. So we've been talking quite a bit about obesity throughout the podcast and how the microbiome is affecting obesity and I want to kind of dive into that a little bit more but before we get there I just have one question and I'm not sure directly relates to your research I know you've written about it and well really well done review articles that you've published. The effects of omega 3 fatty acids on the gut are super interesting. I'm a big omega 3 fan and I remember reading you know a couple of studies coming out that were very quite surprising to me how the omega 3 was affecting the gut microbiome in what I thought to be a positive way. Yeah you know omega 3 is a classical example of of a compound which has been suggested to be very beneficial to the human body in different manners but it also bears surprising impact on the gut microbiome and this needs to be taken into account in assessing the overall effect of these compounds on different people because different people have different microbiomes and so the effects on the different people's microbiomes could determine the different outcomes upon consumption of omega 3. So I you know these are not my studies whether I can only tell you that in every single example of a food component or food additive that we've tested and we've tested thousands of them in over 100,000 people that underwent our personalized nutrition pipeline or project we found that people distinctly react to foods or food components or food additive even if they're exposed to the same exact amounts of the same exact component and this includes fatty acids such as the ones that you've been asking about and you know we don't know exactly what the complex array of causes are that determine this individualized responsiveness to different foods this is a huge black box which we bypass computationally but it seems to involve both factors related to the host factors related to our lifestyle and factors related to our microbide. So it definitely seems like you know understanding more of these environmental factors including the microbiome compositions extremely important especially for you know sort of illuminating the conflicting data out there for you know you'll you'll find all these studies where one thing's good for you but then another study says it's bad for you and you know so it's it's definitely a lot more complicated than we originally thought but I want to kind of shift gears and talk a little bit more about obesity because you had a very recent study actually that was very interesting and looked at some of the potential mechanisms behind why people that are starting out overweight or obese go on some sort of dietary program to lose weight and yet they tend to gain that weight back quite easily so can we talk a little bit about some of that recent work absolutely and and did this phenomenon which is medically called recurrent obesity but is more wildly known as yoobicity. Characterizes up to 80% of all obese individuals worldwide so this is the most common pattern of obesity that we know of yet we have very little clue on what drives it and the pattern is as you suggested a person who gains weight for any reason and then goes on in one of many different diets that are out there and most diets are very efficient in reducing weight in short term because they involve color restriction so that person diets and one of these many diets loses weight back to his or her original low body weight but then within 12 months of successfully dieting 80% of people go on to redevelop obesity or regain all the weight that they've lost and even regain a little bit more than they originally had and from cycle to cycle of obesity and dieting attempts we seem to get more and more obese until we gain we become formally obese and this is exactly the pattern of recurrent or yoobicity. Now if we're trying to or if we're starting to scrape the surface in understanding the molecular mechanism that drive obesity we know very little about this driving about this recurrent yoobicity phenomenon so we tried to study 18 miles and we developed 304 different animal models that recapitulate this recurrent obesity behavior in humans. In other words for example we took a mice we put them on an obeseogenic diet we we gave them a diet preaching in fats and sugar they gain weight and we switched them into a low fat diet the diet at the back to their original level and then we re-exposed them for a second and a third and a fourth cycle and what we could see was exactly the same phenomenon that is observed in humans. From cycle to cycle mice seem to regain more and more weight even when they started from the exact same weight as never obese mice and we're exposed to the same exact diet this is the exaggerated weight regain that factorizes yoobicity human. Now in order to try and study and understand what the drivers of these behaviors are we looking to tens of different parameters that can be measured in mice after they successfully died to look for something in the mice following the successful diet that could store a bad memory of their previous obesity and it seems that everything seemed to normalize after a successful diet all the hormone all ending endocrine and the metabolic features that you could measure totally normalized after a successful diet other than the gut microbiome. When we measure the gut microbiome it seemed to be persistently disturbed as though the mice were never dieted it had a configuration which was very similar to the one that we observed during obesity and when we took this microbiome that never normalized after a successful diet and transferred it into germ free mice this mice developed obesity and type to diabetes meaning that this post diet in microbiome stored a metabolic memory of past obesity that predisposed the mice to an exaggerated weight regain the next time they were exposed to an obesity genetic diet and when we probed even deeper into this memory microbiome we found that it induced and this trade of exaggerated weight regain by altering its ability to degrade dietary compounds which are called isofthlavinoids. Normally we found that isofthlavinoids from diet are degraded by the microbiome to compounds which swimming to adipose cells and signaling and signal to them to release more heat and store less fat when we are exposed to an obesity genetic diet but when these compounds were missing after a successful diet the adipose cells the fat cells were no longer given the signal to release heat and not to store fat and now they were storing more fat and making the mice more obese as compared to non-yoyo obesity mice. In other words the microbiome was driving this exaggerated weight regain tendency by changing its metabolism of distinct molecules coming from our diet. I remember correctly some of these distinct molecules were phyloginoids like apogenin which is high in for example parsley and norinogen, norinogenin or non-yoyo pronounce it but it's from grapefruit really essentially and so there's bacteria that are degrading or metabolizing these phlavinoids and the bacteria there's the obesity is causing a decrease in these types of bacteria that correct. So the bacteria normally actually generate these phlavinoids for more complex phlavinoids by chemically modifying them. Once this obesity and then successful dieting occurs the change in the microbiome that is so persistent means that the microbes are no longer able to generate these compounds and this leads to cascade of events that results in more fat accumulation per given diet leading to exaggerated weight regain. So do you think then that perhaps consuming foods high in some of these compounds like grapefruit or and or supplementation would help with that if your microbiome is not producing those compounds but you need those compounds. Is that correct? Am I understanding that correctly? It sounds that the microbiome is not producing the compounds is that the microbes that are degrading these compounds are expanded in these obisogenic conditions and therefore there's more degradation of these compounds and less of them that survive this microbiome activity and indeed at least in mice what we found was that if we intervene by resupplementing mice with these now missing metabolites we could avoid or treat exaggerated weight regain and the obesity that it induces. A different approach that we've used in mice and seem to be highly effective is the replacement of this bad memory microbiome with a microbiome that had the ability to generate the right compounds and by fickle microbiome transplantation at least it must be could reset the mice to not develop this cellular obesity phenotype. So it seems by understanding the molecular mechanism that drives the obesity in these distinct states one could intervene through the microbiome or a TC mice and reverse distendency and therefore treat obesity or a millioritobisity at least in these contexts. Do you have any plans to look in humans for example that you could give them a supplement with these with these flavonoids to see if that how that affects the metabolic outcome? It's not only plans it's an ongoing trial that is aimed at utilizing the many pipelines that we've developed in mice to measure these effects and to measure the possible microbiome impacts on recurrent obesity and to study them in humans of course humans are much more complex animal than the mice but many of the concepts seem to hold also in humans so we're studying this in trying to understand what happens in humans which are the bugs and the molecules that they secrete which may contribute to this bad microbial memory that we have identified in mice and how we can intervene in humans through different approaches including metabolites supplementation that would reverse or treat a recurrent obesity in humans. It's very exciting I look I eagerly wait for those for the for the data. You mentioned that people that are you know can six can successfully lose weight by a variety of diets and a lot of them have to do with caloric restriction in other words they're just eating less food and and how that's you know that helps with weight loss. What effect does caloric restriction have on the gut microbiome? I think that's very interesting to note that just like the findings that we in many others after us have noted with respect to recurrent obesity and it's effect on the microbiome and downstream metabolism. Equally interesting studies have recently came out that suggested caloric restriction may have peculiar effects on the microbiome that may drive its beneficial effect. There are many studies suggesting that periodic food restrictions such as you know those 16A diets and many others may have beneficial metabolic effects although you know the jury is still out there I need to be careful as some studies have been showing less impressive results but at least some of the effects may be mediated by the microbiome. Certainly we see in these studies that caloric restriction or periodic avoidance of food has distinct changes on the microbiome and these may contribute to different metabolic outcomes that are measures in these studies. I want to talk a little bit about you know we just touched on it in a moment ago about our gut microbiome being these little factories that are turning out different compounds and metabolites. I think it's referred to by you and others as the microbiome metabolism. Yep. Can you talk about maybe just a couple of you know they're they're they're producing compounds that could be beneficial in some cases as as we've talked about but also compounds that may not be so beneficial. Absolutely and they're increasing evidence suggesting that one may regard our microbiome among many other descriptions as a biochemical factory that generates or modulates many thousands of small molecules that could be potentially bioactive in our cold metabolites and what we find super interesting about these metabolites or these small molecules these A that they have in many cases a peculiar chemistry you know that we've not recognized before and B that these molecules in contrast to the microbes that make them can if flux can influx can slim into our sterile body where they can reach a very distant um cells and organs and impact them and by understanding the unique physiology or the unique effect of this small microbial uh secreted molecules one can start to understand how some microbiomes that living one place could impact health and disease processes that occur miles away. For example gut microbes impacting the brain or the joints and many of these effects could be mediated by these small bioactive molecules. In fact we and others have measured the small molecule per per per twar in peripheral blood of both animals and humans and it seems that around 50% of all small molecules that are found within our peripheral blood may originate in one where another or be modulated in one where another by our gut microbes. So it's a it's a big it's a big thing because it means that our microbes could be regarded as an elected organ that has very distant effects that were not previously anticipated. I think most people that have um that are you know listening or watch our watch our podcast or familiar with some of the beneficial metabolites that are produced like these short chain fatty acids like uterate or propaneate acetate um but and and there effects on on modulating the immune system and and I think there's been just overwhelming evidence at this point that there's a role in these short chain fatty acids for you know playing signaling molecule role with a um effect T regulatory cell activity and or production for example what about uh the flip side of that about compounds that are produced um biobacteria in our gut that are not beneficial and what role for example like leaky gut or you know what would be more um technically intestinal permeability some compounds that can be you know produced or this concept of metabolic endotoxemia and endotoxemia for example maybe what role that could play an even cardiovascular disease risk. That's a great question um and it leads to to an observation made by clinicians that decade before decades before we knew there was a microbiome or appreciated the potential magnitude of the effect of a microbiome on human health and and and and this relates to the ability of the gut to withstand the huge antigenic and foreign molecule burden that it sees every day in the form of food and the trillions of microbes that are in the intestinal lumen and are you know separated from our sterile cells by only a single layer of intestinal pitheal cells and and throughout evolution our human body has developed amazing means to kind of provide this protection from invasion of foreign molecules into our sterile body while preserving the ability of our intestines to absorb food or food molecules which is totally critical for our existence what we observed for for many decades was that this healthy leakiness of the gutted and able to absorb food is disrupted in some disease context leading to an altered ability to withstand or to separate this foreign as an object or this foreign molecules which now penetrate into the human body and they ignite they turn on the immune system in ways which lead to disease and and this leaky gut or this altered gut permeability as we call it seems to constitute a common denominator factor which is found in many these states such as heart disease many cancers, many other immune disorders and and and for many years we we did not understand the precise mechanisms by which this leaky gut forms and what the consequences of this a leakiness are on human health. In the last decade there's been a lot of research focused on trying to understand this important concept which we've contributed was an understanding that diverse molecules that are secreted by gut microbes are critically important in determining the normal state of leakiness that allows us to food on the one hand but blocks all the foreign molecules that we don't want in our body from entering the body under normal circumstances and once the conditions arise that lead to the disruption of this normal barrier function which leads to leakiness then this leakiness result in the influx of molecules from the gut into the sterile human body which contribute to disease states or to exacerbation of disease in different contexts. So it's just another important mechanism by which our microbes could lead to an increased disease susceptibility or to new severe symptoms in a previously present disease based on their effects on the gut barrier. What do you think the main contributing factor environmental factors to you know this quote unquote leaky gut or you know this you know disrupting the balance you know of the gut barrier where you know you're you're basically your immune cells are now sort of having contact with the bacteria in the gut and it's causing this immune response like what are the like a couple of the top main environmental factors that cause it's a great it's a great question and and we need to understand that this barrier which we refer to is also a very complex structure and it is composed of the lining cells of the gut the the epicelial cells of the gut which are characterized by very very specific connections to one another which are tightly regulated tightly regulated connections between the cells could be influenced by molecules that come from food they could influence by molecules that come from the microbes and once this regulation is disrupted then leaky gut occurs a second part of the barrier is the mucus flare that overlays these lining epicelial cells and the mucus there in the gut is exceedingly important in separating the bacteria and the food molecules from physically attaching to our human side to their epicelial cells and it is increasingly shown that the generation and the preservation of this protective mucus is also regulated by a number of bacterial and environmental factors such as medications, toxins and food components so the more we learn the more we realize that these protection barrier related processes are intriguingly impacted by the environment and by relays of the environment on our gut microbes. Do you think the food composition component is something that is more of an individualized there's an individualized response to that that could affect the gut permeability or is there some general phenomenon like you know too much sugar and combination with saturated fat for example you call this an opicigenic diet. I think that you know the more we looked the more personalized we see that the effects are so just to give you an example of one food component that would impact some humans but not others let's talk about siliacs. It is very siliacs that is mediated by proteins that are present in in in in certain crops for example glazedin is is the major protein that is is the part of bread it but what makes are those sticky and what makes are very tasty and in individuals that suffer from a genetic susceptibility to develop immune reactivity to to this protein then a cascade of immune occurs that leads among many other changes to a leaky bowel or to a leaky gut which contributes to this state in the siliac patients. So this is a a I think a nice example of host genetic risk factors combining with food components that that these at risk individuals are exposed to that lead to a clinical manifestation of disease in this case Siliac. But I think this is just the the people of an iceberg and many of the complex diseases that we call a multifactor of diseases because we don't know what causes them, such as heart disease and even maybe some cancers are caused by a combination of genetic risk factors coming from within the body and food and microbial components that contribute to a second heat, which leads to the clinical manifestations of these diseases. One could argue also that the lack of dietary composition or lack of a type of food could also play a role as well and I think a big one there would be these, what I'd like you to kind of dive into a little bit but the fermentable fiber. And so there's the prebiotic, the probiotic, which most people are familiar with and then there's the postbiotic. Can you describe the differences between these? Yes, so these are kind of turns that are aimed to simplify the different, or some of the different interventions which are heavily researched in the young microbiome field in trying to modulate the microbiome and its interactions with the human body in trying to generate maltreatment. So prebiotic interventions are classically defined as a food related interventions that are composed of dietary fibers that are aimed to quote unquote, make our microbiome healthier, whatever that means. I think that our personalized nutrition approach is the more data-driven development of this prebiotic intervention. A probiotic intervention is one which involves the supplementation of exogenous microbes that we hope would be welcomed by our indigenous microbiome and impact our body in a favorable manner. And a postbiotic therapy is one which utilizes these small bioactive molecules which I've mentioned before, these metabolites. And once we understand whether a metabolite is missing in some disease context, now we can supplement this missing metabolite by a postbiotic therapy, thereby bypassing the entire microbiome or the entire microbial ecosystem, which is so difficult to intervene because of an inter-individual variability. So that's postbiotic therapy. And on top of it, one could add other interventions such as the Ficol Microbiome Transplantation, phase therapy and other eradication therapies that are being developed and more interventions that are being explored. I do want to get into phase therapy in a moment, but before we go there, your lab has published some research that has, or some data that has indicated or suggested that probiotics or supplementation with probiotics may work for some individuals, but perhaps not others. Why, what was the mechanism for that? Why is that? Yeah, so like anything, or almost anything that we study, especially in humans that we find that the indigenous microbiome and its distinct inter-individual uniqueness, plays major, unappreciated roles in determining many of our microbiome dependent health outcomes. So when we studied probiotics, or we studied 11 different types of commonly prescribed over the counter probiotics, and we studied them both in mice and in humans, in probably the most invasive microbiome study performed today, we found that in a round half the people that we've tested, when they take these probiotic bacteria and supplement them into their diet, the probiotics are met with a very hostile microbiome, indigenous microbiome, which does not let them colonize our gut even temporarily. So you take these probiotics in these cases, and they end up very rapid before one end to the other. And by sampling these volunteer participants by invasive colonoscopine andoscopy, at different stages of probiotic exposure, we could find that individuals that consume probiotics, but are not able to colonize these exogenous bugs along their gut, we could see absolutely no impact on the gut responsiveness to these exogenous probiotics. However, in the other half of the individuals, the microbiome was much more welcoming, and when they were eating the probiotics, the probiotics that this temporarily were able to colonize the longer gut. And in these individuals, we saw that these exogenous microbes, indeed had quite significant impacts on our measurement of human responsiveness, at least in the gut. That tells you that even the colonization of exogenous probiotics is highly individualized and is mainly determined by the composition and the function of the indigenous microbiome and how it welcomes these new microbes that come into the neighborhood. I have about three follow-up questions for you on this. So for one, is it known what exactly the, what's regulating this, whether or not there's residential space or space made available for a sub-emental probiotics to colonize? Is it just the types of bacteria that are a little bit friendlier to say, yeah, you can come stay here or are there other factors that also regulate whether or not there's any residential space available? This is a great question. And the more we answer the more we realize that this interaction between different microbes, whether there are members of the indigenous microbiome, or members of the microbiome meeting these exogenous probiotics, the nature of these interactions is highly complex and poorly understood, and is probably composed of many different ways of interaction sometimes. The microbes just complete for space or complete for food. So if one microbes is more adapt in eating the food at the expense of another, then it would expand and would not let the other rise. Another potential set of interactions are mediated by the secretion of what we call anti-microbial peptides, which are these types of natural antibiotics with some microbes are able to secrete which inhibit others. So you can see that some of these interactions are very hostile, while others could be very supportive in providing nutrients by one microbe that would enable the survival of another. So it's a whole big zoo of interaction that we're just trying and starting to unravel. But the one take on message which we've already discovered and this was quite shocking to us was that both in the human and the mouse setting, when you disrupt the indigenous microbiome by the administration of antibiotics, for example, you kind of empty out the neighborhood and now you give probiotics. Now the neighborhood is empty and the probiotics are no longer met by resistance and now they can colonize the gut. But the result of this colonization is not always positive and what we've discovered was that in people who were given probiotics together with antibiotic administration, which is a very common practice around the world in the US for sure, the probiotics were now able to colonize the gut because the indigenous microbiome was at least temporarily eradicated by the antibiotics. But now these probiotics were very persistently inhibiting the return of the indigenous microbiome after antibiotic exposure was no longer present. In other words, by giving probiotics together with antibiotics, we may be protecting some individuals from the adverse effects associated with antibiotic treatment, but the price that we may pay is the creation of a chronic disturbance in the composition of our gut microbiome with the microbiome, with the probiotics very aggressively refusing to leave the neighborhood and colonizing the once diverse gut and not letting the microbiome repopulate and recolonize. And this could have long-term effects in predisposing individuals to chronic diseases which we and many others are researching. And this tells you that probiotics, we're not against probiotics, we're just very much in favor of studying them in a very comprehensive manner in order to make sure that we understand their functions, their personalized effects and their possible long-term influences whether they're good or bad on human subjects. I guess there's a lot of questions that also do arise from that data, including the indigenous microbiome composition before the antibiotic treatment, for example, perhaps it was not a good one. So then you wonder, well, maybe I don't want some of those bacteria to be inhabiting my gut again, or perhaps the timing and the quantity of the probiotics. So maybe you shouldn't just be overwhelming your gut constantly with them, but maybe if you want just to see it a little bit of some of these Bifidobacteria or some bacteria that may be beneficial, is that something that you guys are looking into or are thought about? I totally agree. I don't think that these results per se tell you anything definitive that is a take-home message. It tells you that we need to be careful until we know better. It also tells you that potentially, if you could combine antibiotics with probiotics in a disease-de-microbiome setting, then they could potentially be beneficial. You know, get rid of a disease associated or disease-positive microbiome, replace them with probiotics to keep the niche occupied and then maybe you'll do something good to diseases. All I'm saying is that we need research and we need evidence and I oppose, you know, careless manufacturing of probiotics, just because they don't impact the taste of food and other people's research suggest that what we call precision probiotics or next generation probiotics may be bugs that don't smell the best, maybe they're not the tastiest bugs, but they may be most effective in colonizing the human gut and positively impact our health in different contexts. We just need to understand how they do it to tailor them to the individual and to make sure that they're safe. Two questions to follow up on that. Do you think that one, the amount or the dose of probiotic or the colony forming units, for example, can play a role in whether or not a probiotic can colonize if there's any at all. And two, do you think that these probiotics, perhaps they're not colonizing, but they're exerting a therapeutic effect as they are flowing through the gut and particularly in people with a disease-like colitis or inflammatory bowel disease or something, obviously that would be a disease that originates in the gut. Do you think there would be a benefit even if the probiotic is not colonizing, but just the fact that you are flow through and it's helping a person with some gut issues? That's a good question. And I can tell you that our, at this end in the strings that we've tested, we've given the volunteer participants quite heavy doses of these probiotics. So when they were not colonizing, they were not colonizing. And we are the first to study this colonization pattern, not in stool, which is where most of the previous studies have looked into probiotics. We found that stool is very problematic in assessing colonization, because even in people who do not colonize it all with probiotics, they end up accumulating in stool because that's the natural way where they go. So you need to really sample inside the gut or they can understand whether a person colonizes or not. So in the people who did not colonize, even when we gave them high doses of these preparations, we could observe absolutely no colonization, even when assessing it by very, very, very sensitive means along the gastrointestinal tract. Now whether they could have some effect when they're flying through the luminous way to where they end up, beautifully, maybe, but it's, in my view, very unlikely. You're talking about, about blood that's the crit molecules that are kind of dispersed in an ocean. They're diluted in an ocean. And to think that they would be physiologically effective when in the middle of the ocean, is at least the radically possible, but I think the burden on proof of proof is on claim it. My hunch or my assumption is that most of the effect that one would see from exogenous bacteria, for example, from precision probiotics, would be expected to exert along the buccosal surfaces, where the microbes meet the epithelial cells where they adhere to the epithelial cells, or to the weakest layer. And where the distances are such that the crit molecules could reach their destination without having to pass through this giant ocean? Yeah, I mean, that definitely makes a lot of sense. Perhaps there's a role for dose in the bacteria, having any sort of therapeutic effect as flow through. I know there, I personally, you know, read a quite a few studies on a certain, very high dose probiotic over 400 billion bacteria. Many of the studies at the time, the bacteria was, the brand was called VSL number three, and then it was like re, another, the formulation was like done again, and it was called disbiome, but many of the publications, clinical studies, you know, including as well as animal studies, but there have been benefits, for example, on like colitis or your wildbows syndrome with taking either 400 or 800, you know, colony forming units, so like, you know, 800 billion. So much higher dose is than you would find in something on the shelf of a grocery store. And again, it might just be, you know, a very transient effect that's happening, you know, preventing diarrhea, for example, when you're taking a high dose probiotic or something like that. But I cannot really tell it, but I respect, respectfully disagree that the level of incidence is even close to one, which would make me recommend these for IBD or for any disease. And the evidence is that not a single probiotic preparation to date has been approved as a medical intervention by the FDA or by the European counterparts of the FDA. So again, I'm not against probiotics, but I think that just like any human medical intervention, probiotics should be assessed by evidence-based medicine and proven to be effective in certain preparation, certain doses, certain medical conditions, and not assumed to be effective before we test them and before we prove them. Well, you mentioned something earlier about the combination of perhaps even probiotics with bacteria phage or a combination of antibiotics with bacteria phage. Can you explain to people what bacteria phages are? Absolutely. So bacteria phages are intriguing viruses that in contrast to the viruses that we all, you know, suffer from these days, are viruses that do not infect humans and they do not infect any mammals or any eocaryotic cells. These are viruses that only infect bacteria and only attack bacteria. And these viruses are exceedingly common in nature. You can find many types of these viruses in our environment. And in fact, these viruses are the big enemies of the bacteria that surround us. So there's kind of an arms race between bacteria and these bacteria phages, which is attack bacteria, with the phases trying to kill bacteria and the bacteria developing means of defending themselves against these viruses. It's an intriguing arms race which led to some groundbreaking discoveries such as CRISPR, which is one of these defense mechanisms which has been now massively exploited by science in order to genome edit, for example, a genes of interest. So this is what occurs in nature. What we and others are thinking about in utilizing phages is that we have a huge unmet need in the microbiome field. Imagine that you find a member of a microbiome bacteria in the microbiome which contributes to disease. Contributes to IBD, contributes to cancer. What do you do? How do you get rid of this bacteria without harming the entire microbial surrounding that is so important for our health? Antibiotics are very limited manner of doing this. Antibiotics are not specific. They have big adverse effects. They result in the emergence of resistant strains. So you cannot use antibiotics forever for your entire life. And many of the disease causing bacteria in the microbiome are antibiotic-resistant. So what do you do? We have a really an unmet need in having no means of taking out a microbiome from the microbiome when we want to eliminate its bad effects. And so we thought that phages could represent an attractive means of attacking a bacteria without impacting the entire microbiome because phages are very specific in their targets. A given phage would only attack a certain family of bacteria that has receptors which the phage recognizes. Now I told you before that bacteria, as part of these arms rates, have developed very strong defense mechanisms against phages. So if you give just one phage, it is very likely that the bacteria to attack would generate defense mechanisms that would make it resistance against this phage. And so your therapy would not be successful. So what we are doing, we are generating cocktails of phages that are targeting the same bacteria through different receptors or different mechanisms. And together these phages are killing the bacteria without allowing it to develop these anti-phage defense system. And if this is successful, and we're now in the midst of clinical trials, we would be able to really take a needle out of the haystack by targeting a single bacteria or a single type of bacteria without killing the entire microbiome and causing a substantial collateral damage. I wasn't aware that the bacteria were developing these defense mechanisms. You can think about it as similar to antibiotic resistance in a way, I guess. But what are your thoughts about then perhaps a future where we have this targeted type of treatment where in addition to maybe your bacteria phage cocktail that's targeting maybe one or perhaps two of the pathogenic type of bacteria. And then combining them with a commensal type of bacteria in terms of allowing this precision probiotics in a way, perhaps I don't know, maybe there's another name for it, but where you're actually allowing the types of bacteria that we know are commensal that maybe perhaps these people are lacking, and this is a way to actually get them to be colonized. Absolutely. And I totally agree with what you suggest. And I think at the very young microbiome field, we're at the stage of understanding more and more of these interactions and the roles of different bugs than their communication systems. And also are increasingly busy in generating these new treatment options that hopefully would be put on the clinical shelf in years to come. But I am totally with you with the prospect that these new interventions would be combined with each other in contributing to what we call personalized or precision medicine. In other words, I would speculate that exactly as this suggests a phage cocktail that would eradicate a family of bacteria with some of the microbiome would be successfully combined with a probiotic, or maybe a precision or next generation probiotic, which would have the ability to colonize in a given person and would replace the niche. Now, free from this contributing micro. So a combination between probiotics and stages between dietary interventions that would enable better probiotic activity and solid softwares are what I anticipate for our future. What do you think the potential timeline would be on this ultimately replacing some of our current ways of antibiotic treatment, for example, which is a very blunt sort of uses a very blunt mechanism as you mentioned it wipes out everything, good and bad bacteria. Yeah, I mean, when we, criticize antibiotics, we need to be very careful, antibiotic interventions have amazingly transformed human lives, human health, human medicine, they increase, I think, close to 30 years of lifespan within a century and at least partially to care of what is considered to be our number one, two and three cause of mortality from millions of years. However, as we discussed previously, antibiotics are also associated with many prices that we pay and we're just beginning to appreciate what they do to our microbiome. I don't think that the current medical interventions would be replaced, but I'm very helpful that we would be able to implement them with new precision data driven approaches that would enable to increase the efficacy of these treatments and to be combined with them. As to the timelines, you know, there is quite a hyper or overhype with the very microbiome field. And partially it's justifiable because, you know, in a matter of a decade and a half, we've discovered that our human body, in addition to the 20, something thousand genes that are encoded in our human cells, also contains three million and more bacterial genes that we didn't appreciate it and we didn't know anything about. So this is for sure, at least in my view, our revolution, but we're only at the beginning of understanding this new world. Remember that, you know, it took decades for cardiology to get to a point where, you know, Catholicization and all the fancy interventions that are saving lives today has been matured and developed for clinical use. We're only talking about a very infant field, lots of research, lots of advances, but also lots of challenges. I don't want to give a time estimate, but I'm hopeful that within the next decade, we will start to see some interventions maturing in a data driven way into the clinical shelf. That would be great. What role do you think, or what role does this so call, the vieroom play in human health and do you think that science may yet find that viruses modulate health and a past like in unexpected ways? Absolutely. And I think one of the only reason we're so much into bacteria in the microbiome, especially in the gut microbiome is because we have the tools and we're a little bit lazy and kind of searching under the lamp and going where it's constable, but the more we probing to the vieroom and the fungome and the parasitoom, we find that there are whole kingdoms within our microbiome, which are understudied and underappreciated, but nonetheless, I think that they have potential huge impact on how the human body behaves in health and on the risk of developing disease and even on other kingdoms within the microbiome. So these huge amounts of exciting research to be conducted in decoding these roles of these other kingdoms and the future will tell us. Well, it's very, very exciting. And I kind of just wanna follow up, I do wanna ask you about some of the top lifestyle modifications and I know that we've been talking a lot about personalized nutrition. So it's challenging to answer that question, but before we get there, just out of my own interest, we've talked a lot about the compounds that are generated in the gut, perhaps from many of the bacteria in the gut and how these compounds can have beneficial effects on human health and also can have detrimental effects on human health. And there's one compound that I've been following for a while and I continue to follow and it's a compound that is associated with atherosclerosis and heart disease, it's TMAO. And it's produced from precursors like alcohol and teen or even colon, which are found in red meat and eggs respectively. But you'll find a lot of conflicting evidence looking at, for example, the observational data epidemiological studies where you see people, you know, people that eat red meat and or, you know, eggs. If they are healthy and they don't have metabolic disease, they don't have to have diabetes or dyslopidemia, they don't have unhealthy lifestyle factors. So for example, they're active, they don't smoke, they don't excessively drink, they're, you know, not overweight. That they, they actually don't have a higher cardiovascular disease risk or mortality or alcoholism or mortality as people that are not consuming those types of foods that are high in, alcohol and teen are calling. But you'll see people have unhealthy lifestyle factors. They do have an elevated risk. And so there's, again, a lot of you'll see a lot of conflicting evidence and it's, you're trying to figure out, well, what do I eat, what do I eat, what do I not eat? What role does the microbiome play in the production of the TMAO, which is, yeah, it's a great question based on a great set of stories by, by Stenheisen's group, which I think a contribution, a very important concept to understanding of how do microbiome cooperate with the human body in generating, generating together compounds which may impact human health. So in this particular case, we're talking about a connection between dietary compounds such as calling and carnitine, which are they adjusted by the microbes into a compound called TMA, which then inflexes into the host and is further converted by the host by the liver of the host into TMAO. And this TMAO swims into the circulation where in some instances it could impact microfagions that form blocks that are responsible for as a risk versus and it's potentially devastating health effects, how does these brain disease, kidney disease and more. So from a fundamental microbiome perspective, this is a fine example of a cooperation that exists between dietary cues that are perceived by the microbes and then further modulation by the host that leads to health outcome. Now you're absolutely right that if you look at a health perspective, and now I'm speaking as a physician, you know, you kind of explain as a risk to resist by just one factor. You cannot say that you know, a one type of microbial reaction or one type of food or even one genetic risk factor in a human individual would explain the entire spectrum of these huge and highly variable disease. But by definition, these common multi factor diseases are influenced by a combinatorial collection of risk factors. And I think what is fascinating a study has provided was the proof of concept on how mechanistically one could explain the influences of particular types of diet and the microbes on the risk of a particular of developing a particular disease in some individuals with other risk factors that contribute to this disease. So I would never expect that every individual that would be exposed to the same levels of carnivore or would feature the same bugs that convert colline into TMA would develop heart disease. It's a combination by many different risk factors. Coincidentally, we've recently published another study focusing on a peculiar type of obesity that develops after the station of cigarettes smoking and to make a long story short we found a similar cooperation between the microbiome and the house in generating compounds that could drive this obesity phenomenon after smoking cessation. So it seems that the concept which we termed the hollow-bind concept in which you can regard a human as a combined set of microbes and human cells could contribute to many of the more complex health outcomes that are so concerning to many of us. Well, with that said, this has been a really interesting conversation around thank you so much. I just we've talked a lot about precision medicine, personalized nutrition and how people respond differently differently to foods. So it's a little hard to come up with a top lifestyle modifications or to improve got health. But in your opinion, are there some low hanging fruit? We are not there in terms of our precision medicine and personalized nutrition yet. We're getting to understand a lot more about it thanks to research from your lab and others. But are there some low hanging fruit? Things that like, you know, maybe perhaps consuming foods that have some of these fermentable fibers or prebiotics that you mentioned or fermented foods that also have probiotics. Things like that. It's a great question and a question that I'm being asked very often. I can tell you that what we've been discovering in our own studies, even without looking into the personalization aspect, is that some of the behaviors which your grandmother is would recommend to you are also beneficial in terms of what they do to the microbiome. So for example, maintaining healthy sleep patterns and avoiding as much as possible. A right-to-explete behavior has very profound effects on our measurements of the microbiome and how it impacts our regulation of weight and the glucose or sugar metabolism or the avoidance of type to diabetes, for example. In terms of fibers, you know, in general, I think that the data is quite solid in promoting fibers as a good, you know, family of foods to consume. However, I must say that we and others are engaging very exciting studies which suggest that even with fibers not all fibers are created equally. In other words, even fibers are composed of many different chemical formulations that differ from each other in the way that they are consumed by the microbes and impact the human body. So even with fibers and with the general beneficial effects that have been observed with them, it seems that some fibers are better than others and we're trying to contribute towards new knowledge that would refine these recommendation in different individuals and with different fibers. You know, smoking seems to be a universally bad behavior from many reasons, but when we measure what it does to the microbiome, we were intrigued to find that many cigarette related chemicals not only reach the systemic circulation, but they actually penetrate the gut and they impact the microbiome towards a disturbed composition and function. And this has its own independent effects on, for example, the risk of developing obesity after you start your attempt to stop smoking. So all of these behaviors which in many cases we know are probably not good for us are also not good for us in terms of their effects on the microbiome. Beyond this, I think that we need data, we need knowledge, we need to increasingly learn to harness diet to the individual in order to really optimize the power of the microbiome in impacting human health. And what about the timing of our food intake, which you said that's a pretty top. I can tell you that in our personalization, machine learning algorithms which are used to predict a person's dietary responses in a very accurate manner, the timing of our diet and even the timing of our meal last night, are part of the features that are used by this unbiased algorithm in order to form its very accurate predictions. In other words, it seems that the timing of our diet is important for many different aspects coming from many different studies by us and by others. What we do with it, in addition to trying to time our diet in a kind of normal and routine manner, is still under review or under research. So this algorithm that you were just referring to, so this is a top company that was, was it started by you or. Yes, so basically the personalized nutrition project was an ambitious project which was headed by me my colleague Aaron Siguller was the mathematician from the YS-1 Institute of Science, we started with this project back in 2012 and this was a study that was first published in 2015 and formed the cornerstone of what we call personalized nutrition today. And in the study we analyzed the data from a thousand individuals in Israel that kindly gave us the week of their lives and we measured and collected an unprecedented amount of microbiome and host related data, including a smart phone app that was used in the study. And the continuous glucose measurement that generated very accurate measurements of sugar responses to food in a week of fall up and then a very sophisticated machine learning and AI technologies were used to generate predictive algorithms for each individual that are able to accurately predict a person's sugar responses to any given food and this. Your requirement was the basis for personalized nutrition because it allowed us for the first time to formulate diets that are different between individuals but would hopefully lead to normalization of blood sugar levels and this was tested by us in different contexts including recently in a long term randomized human trial. And we have a very important question which compared this data driven personalized approach to the gold standard American diabetes association recommended diet and we've quite convincingly showed that this personalized science driven approach was outperforming the current one size fits all diet in a large group of prediabatic individuals which are individuals already predi-sposed to develop disturbances leading to type to diabetes. And this set of discoveries has been repeated by other groups across the world and is gaining track and basically tells us that data coming from the host and data coming from the microbiome could be combined using advanced technologies in order to predict and maybe to impact dietary interventions at different clinical context. So this company I know it's called day two and does does a person have to wear a continuous glucose monitor or like you know there's a bunch of biomarkers that need to be done to to try this out. Yes, that's a great question and and just just to make clear to our audience all all the research that I've stated was academically done in an academic setting without any company involved. But following the publication the whitesman Institute of Science have licensed the technology to a spin of company called day two which further developed it for massive use and apps scaling by many more individuals. What the advantage is of day two as a company is that now that they've performed over a hundred thousand test on 100,000 people and more quality of data that was collected is so great and there is delusion is so great. The people that are now engaged no longer need to go through all the procedures that characterize the early studies and they don't even need to wear our continuous glucose monitor anymore. In other words a person can now provide a tool sample that can be shipped through the mail plus some commonly available clinical parameters that they can provide to the internet and then an accurate prediction of that person's black semical responses or sugar responses to foods and recommendations that are peculiar and specific for that person could be provided because of the background. Data-based that was already created now. I'm not part of the company. I'm the one of the two scientific founders of the company, but the company is now running on its own and mainly in the US and is available in the US and the findings that we discovered have been reproduced by others in other human studies in the UK and in the US there are. Other commercial entities that are developing the same approaches. I can tell you that in the book we published called the personalized diet. In addition to our story we also describe kind of a do it yourself a non commercial way to exploit these discoveries for example by buying a glucose monitor that you know you can purchase in your local pharmacy and by skin tracking yourself and measuring your blood sugar responses. After some of the foods that you usually consume at your daily lives you can now start to tweak your diet and to changing ingredients in your diet in reducing your sugar responses after meals. So you can do it yourself in a no of course much less sophisticated manner. But you can use the same principles that we've discovered in changing elements in your diet and making your sugar responses lower. So it sounds like you're a proponent of people wearing a continuous glucose monitor. I've worn one for the past almost three years and I have learned and immense amount of very interesting information from from wearing one probably one of the most surprising ones early on. I started wearing it on I was a new mother and was the effect of slack of sleep on how the way my body responded to the same foods. I've always eaten in terms of my post-priniod glucose response and it was completely out of control when I was My sleep was disrupted. There are people that their scientists and researchers out there and physicians that do not like the continuous monitor You know glucose wearing approach because they claim that it you know urges people to not eat a healthy fruit or something like that because it may elevate their blood glucose level. What do you think? Well I am not sure I would like to propose that every person wears a continuous because monitor but I respectfully disagree with those who say that you know measuring yourself or or using science and technology. In order to improve you know what you're doing your daily lives would would would be wrong. I think that you know this regarding all the advances the science is proposing to us and not utilizing these advances for benefit. So we would probably make us miss a lot of the of the good that science has to offer. So by you know by wearing a continuous look as monitor you probably experience many surprises and maybe you know we've done thousands of people and I can tell you that almost in any person that we've measured we found counter intuitive surprises. And I think that's why we have a lot of people who are not able to find their blood sugar to the roof and the tomatoes now you combine tomatoes with some white bread and the response goes down. So you know by not doing the experiment or by not measuring themselves they would avoid themselves from the benefits of knowing what is good and what is less good for themselves. So I'm all for measurement. I'm all for knowing and for doing this rationally and carefully but doing it. I'm 100% agreement with you. So your so your book is the personalized diet. You corrode it with your with your collaborator doctor Aaron Sengal. So you know for your out see gal. Yes. Okay and day two which is now licensed by the white's men Institute. Per science is is the the app you're talking about but again thank you for talking about the alternative approach with perhaps even people getting a continuous look as monitor. If people want to follow you you're on Twitter your Twitter handle is a Lena of underscore lab so that would be ELI and a V underscore lab LAB and you also have two lab websites if you if you Google your name. You're on. Yes, you're on a lot of I L I and a V you'll find you'll find all the lab research that you're doing phenomenal I mean amazing impact that your research has on our understanding of the interaction between the microbiome and in our in our gut and human health and I'm so happy that we were able to connect and have a conversation today. I've been a big fan of your research for for a long time now so thank you so much for coming on the podcast and taking time to have this very interesting discussion with me. It's my absolute pleasure and and great talking to you, run the.

You can't out-science hard-training. You've got to do the work if you want to get the results. Your body is so made to move against stuff that if you don't do that, you are drastically accelerating your aging and your cognitive decline as well. I don't think seed oils are innocuous from the perspective that in the last few decades, added oils are one of the biggest source of increased energy in the American diet. You carnivores would lose your absolute minds if anybody dared suggest that it wasn't good for you. And so it just very clearly points out the asymmetrical application of logic. Hey everyone, I'm sitting here with Dr. Lane Norton who needs no intro. He is a scientist, he's a PhD in nutrition, he is a fitness industry influencer, and he is also a professional bodybuilder, power lifter, he's an author, serial entrepreneur, the list goes on and on and I'm super excited to be sitting here today with you, Lane. You and I, we've had interactions over the years on social media and it's a long time coming that we could just sit down together, meet each other, have a discussion. I have a lot of respect for the things that you put out on social media on YouTube, the way you look at the evidence and really in particular your overall view of health and fitness and how practical of a view you take evidence based and really just it's influenced me over the years. So I'll say that. So excited to have you here, Lane. Yeah, I'm excited to be here. I think we had quite a few conversations off camera about, you know, I didn't start out like 10,000 foot view. I started down as a biochemist in the weeds and thankfully just had a really great experience in graduate school where at a PhD advisor who had the same background, BS and biochemistry, PhD nutrition, his name is Dawn Layman, a legend and protein metabolism and he just did a really great job of like understanding the biochemical mechanisms, understanding how they fit together, but also understanding how to that look on a global level, what actually pans out in real life. And I just think I just got so lucky without experience to be able to kind of like synergize those things, you know. You also have this very unique background because you are a professional power lifter bodybuilder, you have been for many years. You know, you're coaching people, you've coached thousands of people. In fact, I kind of want to start with, I'm interested in understanding like what are some of the common themes that you use in your coaching to help people be successful? And what are some of, I would say, the misconceptions, the common misconceptions that you that you see, you have to address in order for them to be successful. You know, I think if we zoom way out again, like the people end up spending a lot of energy and time on stuff that just doesn't matter that much, instead of just really focusing on the big rocks, the big boulders, right? And one of the things all, one of my favorite quotes is the magic you're looking for is in the work you keep attempting to avoid, right? So for example, I did a post about red light therapy the other day. And the post was not, I didn't think it was negative towards red light therapy. It kind of said, hey, here's what it might do based on these research studies. Here's the limitations. But please keep in mind where this fits in the overall hierarchy of things. Like this is a very small piece of a puzzle compared to sleep, proper nutrition, exercise. You know, and I think there can be so much stuff floating around in the fitness of Ospere, is that a way of saying it, that you and I is having the background, we can pretty easily detangle like what the kind of hierarchy of stuff is, like where the most important stuff is. But I think for the average person, they hear these things, they don't really know how to slot those things into order. You know, and I've found so many people like really have an issue of paralysis by analysis of, I don't know where to start, so I'm just not going to start. And so a lot of what I do with my coaching, and less so now I do less one-on-one coaching now, I have a team of people who work for me, is really just trying to like get people out of their own way in terms of just saying, hey, you don't have to be perfect. We just need to get you to start doing stuff. And yeah, you're going to screw up, you're going to make mistakes. But we are going to learn from those mistakes, we are going to see where your stumbling blocks are, and we're going to help remove those barriers to you being able to be consistent. Because at the end of the day, really, that is the big, like the biggest lever you have is consistency with nutrition and training. And we were talking yesterday on the phone, and I think a really good visual example was given by a guy in social media named Ben Carpenter who's a dietitian. And he had a, he had two bowls of marbles. One was, I think, colored blue and one was colored green. And he said, if the blue ball, I might mix up the colors. But if the blue ball represents like highly processed junk food, and the green ball represents, you know, good, whole, single ingredient foods. If somebody's diet is the, the, the bowl of all junk food. And we take one marble from the bowl of, you know, quote, unquote, clean good foods and put it in the other bowl. Does it change the overall diet? And he had everybody say no, right? Like one, if you eat like junk most times, but you have one healthy meal, once it's going to do very little, right? So why do we think it goes the opposite direction? Where like you have one unhealthy meal, all said you just undone everything you've ever done, right? And so I try to get, I try to meet people where they're at and get their mindset out of perfectionism and just get it into execution. I think that is the biggest dumpling block, because we have a lot of people who just really are afraid to try and fail and just get into execution mode. And I think one of the most liberating things for me was that background and being a competitor and failing a lot. And just it just got me over the like, oh, this is just part of it. Like, and as you know, like from doing a PhD, I'm sure you had plenty of stuff that just didn't work. You know, like the number of experiments I came home with tears in my eyes, because I couldn't even get the analysis to work. Like I spent probably a year and a half going through every step of our analysis of muscle protein synthesis, because I wasn't getting any data back trying to figure out where is the kink in this chain. For those who aren't familiar, like muscle protein synthesis, to do like 50 samples, probably take you a week to get actual data back, because you're grinding frozen tissue frozen and liquid nitrogen, and you've got to keep it in an liquid nitrogen in the whole time, like doing just 20 samples of that probably takes four hours. Then you've got to homogenize the tissue. Then you've got to separate it. You've got to take it through various reactions so you can get protein bound amino acids versus intercellular amino acids, because you need the precursor pool. And then you have got to take it through GCMS, but you have to do several reactions before that, because it's got to be detectable in the GCMS. And so you go put all this work in, and then a week later you find out, yeah, I didn't actually do anything. Now we've got to go back to square one, right? And so probably did that for like 18 months. It was actually a lab made of mine who kind of figured out where the kink was. We had residual acid and the samples, but point being with all of that, it was like I never, if I wasn't willing to go in and fail repeatedly, I never would have gotten to the answer. You know, and I just think so many people are stuck in being so afraid to just go. And when I say fail like, okay, you go out. You have a stressful day. You come home and you stuff your face with ice cream or something like that. Okay. Well, and I had, I had a client, I'm actually thinking of right now who was a hedge fan manager. And we started working together, he was probably binge eating almost every day. And I, every time it happened, I said, okay, first of all, they're holding yourself accountable is good. Shaming yourself is not going to facilitate behavior change, okay? Because it makes you so sensitive to the behavior that any time you get close to it, you're just going to be black or white or nothing. So, and then I said, okay, what's the antecedent to this? Okay, you have a stressful day at work. You get home. There's not foods readily available that would be more conducive to your goals. So, like, okay, hey, you know, nobody's like this, but I'm like, you have means meal prep service, right? Like, I'm not saying you have to eat these every meal, but like at least having them available. So, if you're home, you're hungry, have this available. And then he would end up night eating as well. So, he said, okay, lock your door, you're bedroom door on the inside, so that when you're going out to the kitchen, you have to unlock it, and then put a little, uh, like lock, put a little lock on the fridge or something like that, or whatever you tend to get into. Of course, it's not going to keep you out, but a lot of times those behaviors, a lot of people like to think that they're behaviors are all choices, and it's not. We're on autopilot for so many things. And just that moment of mindfulness of having to actually like enter in a code or something like that, sometimes that's a game changer for people. And I even said to him, hey, if you have a stressful day at work, when you're driving on your way home, say out loud, man, I just had a stressful day. This would be a situation where I'd be more likely to binge eat. Just identifying it is going to drastically reduce the risk that's going to happen. So over time, this guy over the course of a year, I think he lost like 35, 40 pounds, and he got to the point where he was binging maybe once every two or three weeks, but he would still get really hard on himself about that two or three weeks. That interval, I said, hey man, like, look at how far you've come. Don't let perfection be the enemy of really good. Like this, if I showed you a snapshot of where you're at now versus where you were, and I said, this is where you're going to be in nine months. My guess is you would have taken that all day every day. You know what I mean? And I said, listen, everybody has something they struggle with. They're not being binge eating some people struggle with, alcohol moderation or gambling or pick your poison. The likelihood that the inclination for just like the impulse for that to go away very unlikely. You're probably going to always deal with a little bit of that impulse. But learning tools to manage that, that's where it's at. I think so many people are really hard on themselves, not only do they, are they hard on themselves about the behavior, but they're hard on themselves for even having the thought. And so again, I really just try to meet people where they're at and try to just get them in an execution mode. One thing I do say to people is like, Ron, if I said to you, I want you to go become the best three-point shooter you can be. Okay? Now you can't get any instruction. Can't even watch YouTube videos. But if all you did, every single day for 10 years was go outside and shoot three-pointers for two hours. You're not going to the NBA, but I bet you'd be pretty darn good at three-pointers. You know what I mean? And just understanding that, you realize it is the mass action that makes the difference. And so I just try to remove those barriers for people to just go and start executing. What about the whole food versus the process and junk food and bad stuff? What about people that are coming to you, that are so many different diets that are bad diets for weight loss? And if someone does want to lose weight, they want to increase their lean body mass, maybe body recomposition, and I know we're going to talk about training and stuff. What do you, is there a calorie amount that you sort of start with as it based on their body weight? Is that something or do you think about the actual composition? Are they doing low carb? Are they doing high carb? What's your approach that? So the most important thing is calorie intake. Energy intake versus what you're expanding, but how you get there is what's really important. People can kind of conflate the physical law of thermodynamics with tracking calories. Those are not the same thing. Like I can say, it's a rule. I don't think anybody disagree. If you want to save money, you've got to earn more than you spend. But now, keeping a budget can help facilitate that, but you don't have to keep it budget to save money. And just because you keep a budget, doesn't mean you will save money. So I kind of really, I try to give people to understand and separate those two things. But yeah, as calories the most important thing, but what I try to do is one figure out, okay, approximately what are they expanding per day. And the best way in my opinion to that is, if they have been tracking, okay, what are you eating now in general, what your body weight doing? Right? Because if they're logging relatively accurately and their body weight's not changing, I mean, you can put whatever you want into a calorie calculator, but that is their maintenance calories. That is their energy expenditure, right? And so I like to start there and then if people haven't been doing that, one nice trick I like to do, as you know, when you monitor behavior, behavior changes and we know this right even down to like photons, right? So I'll say, okay, if you don't know it, we're just doing me a favor, just track for the next three days. I want to change anything. Don't change a single thing you're doing. In fact, if you're eating junk food or if you're eating, what you think is too much, that's great. Then we have a bigger shovel like your energy expenditure's higher than we thought. We have a big shovel to dig you out with, right? So please don't change anything. But what invariably happens is it's a very instructive experience for them because they'll start tracking and realize, oh man, I was eating a lot more than I thought because I was having a bowl of ice cream that I was thinking was a serving and it was three. Or, you know, I still know people, if you're going to be disappointed, we have a serving of peanut butter, you know, if you want to be depressed. Or they do track accurately, or sorry, or they see what they're consuming and they change their behavior already because they're tracking because they're monitoring, and I mean, if you look at studies, it's very consistent. People under report their calorie intake by 30 to 50%. Yeah, there's a very classic study in 1992, New England Journal of Medicine. They had people who self-reportedly were weight loss resistant. So these people claim that they were eating 1200 calories a day. They specifically wanted this population. And these were obese people and they said they put them in metabolic ward so they're tracking their their their energy expenditure and a metabolic chamber and they know exactly what they're eating. And they even told them like, well, well, no, if you're eating more than you say. And they also looked at lean mass, BMR, total energy expenditure. So what was really interesting, this was one of the first studies that showed that obese people didn't have slow metabolisms. And like at first, you know, the first few decades of us trying to deal with the obesity crisis was us like looking on the metabolism side. How do they must have slow metabolism? So we've got an increased mental health rate. And now we know it's the appetite side that has a much stronger effect on body weight regulation. I mean, it's so funny when people say to me, well, I have a slow metabolism. That's why I want to take those in pick. I'm like, well, if you have a slow metabolism, the Zimbeck's not going to help because it doesn't create your, you're increasing my metabolic rate. It is a very powerful appetite suppressant. So in this study, they looked at BMR, total energy expenditure and found that basically people's lean body mass explained about 70 to 80% of the variants in BMR and total energy expenditure. You can almost draw like a straight line through it. Can you explain that to people because they think it's important, right? Like, and that was kind of a follow-up question is like, well, we're training comes into this picture. We're muscle mass comes into this picture. We're muscle mass comes into this picture and why? Like, how is that a really important, like, lever that you can pull to help people like body recomb, tell people lose fat? Yeah. So lean mass, just be clear, lean mass and skeletal muscle mass, often get used interchangeably and they're not. Lean mass is a relatively good proxy for skeletal muscle mass, but lean mass versus fat mass is a two compartment model. Like for Dexa, for example, you'll get fat mass. So literally all fatty tissues will go into a bucket and then everything else goes into a bucket. So we're talking bones, skin, undigested food, fluid, like all that kind of stuff. But in general, adipose is a relatively, it's not an inert tissue. We used to think it was an inert tissue. We know that's not the case anymore. But it has a very low energy expenditure relative to other lean tissues. And actually, skeletal muscle doesn't have a super high energy expenditure for a lean tissue. It's actually one of the slowest if not the slowest. Like, lever and gut tissues have a much higher metabolic rate. But your skeletal muscle is your biggest overall lean tissue. And I would argue you're biggest organ. And so it's effect, you know, having an extra 10 pounds of skeletal muscle because it's so much, it does have a profound effect on, you know, your energy expenditure overall. So when they looked in the study when they standardized for a lean mass, they saw basically no difference, no statistical difference in anybody's metabolic rates or they're totally energy expenditure. And when they tracked their intake, what they found was they reported 1200 calories day, but on average they were consuming about just over 1800. And they also over reported their physical activity by 47%. Now, I think a lot of people will look at that and go. So that, when I present that data, a lot of people get really upset because no one likes being called a liar. I don't think people are lying. I don't think that's what it is. I think we look at ourselves with roles colored glasses. And we look at serving sizes and we tend to like just give ourselves a little more grace than we probably should. Right. And even yesterday, I did like a day of eating while I was traveling. And I show like I went out to lunch. I got a salad, grilled chicken. You know, I said, I said, can you put the dressing on the side, put the cheese on the side, right? And I just used a little bit of cheese. I used the dressing. And but still like after I added everything up, I'm like, there's over 30 grams of fat in the salad. A lot of you guys would have the salad and think, oh, this is low calorie, right? No, the salad was 600 calories, you know? And so if you think and then look at, you know, take for example, like the cheesecake factor, you look at the salads or well over 1,000 calories. And so I think many people do think they're eating healthy and just don't really have a great understanding of how quickly energy can add up if you're not very mindful about it. So this study kind of put the cabash and that's been it's been supported by a lot of follow-up studies as well showing whether type 2 diabetic, obese, stonobies, it basically boils down to lean mass explains like 78% of the variance in metabolic rate. And then the rest of the variance in total energy expenditures is physical activity. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. About the lean mass, let's assuming a lot of that is skeletal muscle as well, right? Sure. So what about the fact that your skeletal muscle is also a big sink for glucose? How is that? Do you think you can you can't really ignore that aspect as well, right? I mean, in terms of the big picture you're talking about? No, no, I tell people like exercise is one of the only things that you can do independent of weight loss that will improve all your health parameters, you know? And we like in layman's lab, the amount of exercise you need to get massive benefits is such a small like I got in trouble because I called it a disgustingly small amount, but it really is. Like there was a research study done looking at vigorous physical activity, not even continuous, but just like throughout the day, cumulative. Four minutes vigorous activity per day reduced cancer risk by about 20%. Okay? And then if you got it to 10 minutes, I think it was 30%. Right? And so it's like, I'm sorry, you got four minutes, you know? And some people will say, well, it's a cohort study XYZ, but we have randomized control trials looking at very short bursts of exercising improvements in glucose metabolism, blood lipids, inflammation, and then now the cognitive stuff too. There was actually a recent randomized control trial where they took people with major or men, with major depressive disorder or general anxiety disorder, and they had to do two, 25 minute sessions of resistance training a week. That's it. And it was for eight weeks, and the improvements in major depressive disorder, and general anxiety disorder, the effect size for major depressive disorder was 1.7. Now for those who want to familiar with effect sizes, 0.2 is a small effect size, 0.5 is a modest and 0.8 is anything about 0.8 is considered large. 1.7 is massive. And SSRI's fall between like 0.3 to 0.8, like usually the best you see is about 0.8, which again, I'll tell people, what I'm not saying is that we should just get rid of SSRI's number of exercise, because sometimes maybe somebody needs an SSRI just to get them out of bed so they'll actually go exercise. But like if we're looking at how powerful that lever is, it's amazing. And then you look at the effects on bone health, you look at the effects on just mental health cognition, even short-term exercise improves cognition. I think there was just a recent study showing that that even in a cute bad of exercise can improve. I think it was memory formation. I could be wrong. And so I think again, one of the limitters is I try to meet people where there are, is like, hey, you see me train for two, three hours a day. But that's because I'm trying to be the strongest person in the world in my weight class. You don't need to be doing that. Like, just even if you just go walk vigorously for 30 minutes in a day, you're killing it. You know, like, but of course I would recommend people resistance train because I think there are so many benefits with that. And yeah, it just doesn't take that much. That first of all, okay, I sort of say, you are, we are speaking the same language like the, all these intermittent, they're actually called the Villapas studies and Marty Kabbalo with part of that. I had them on the podcast, talked about the research and it was, to me, it was just, it was amazing that they had these fitness trackers like you said. It was like, they went out and did these little short bursts of physical activity and it had a profound effect cumulative, right? And so how easy is it to do like two minutes of like, you know, climbing, like, spreading up the stairs or whatever? I actually work out mostly for the brain benefits by the way. Like, mm-hmm. Like, if I don't get some form of exercise, whether it's resistance training or doing some more cardio, like I am not in a good space in my head. Like, I can, those colored glasses are gone. I can see the negative and a lot of things, comparisons, I'm just in a bad mood. Like, it's, I am a very different person if I get exercise versus if I don't. And so it's like, for me, exercises, it's necessary. It is the part of my wake up and like, you know, like, every type of exercise. If it don't, then I'm, you know, not in a good position. And so I think what I'd like to point out in that is, you have made it a habit as part of your lifestyle. Then it's not, can I go exercise? They do have time for it. It's, no, this is, this is on the top list of this is going to get done, right? Just like brushing your teeth, right? And I think one of the things that I really try to hone it on people is try to get away from something having to feel good to get you to do it. Okay, like, sometimes I love to train. But it doesn't feel good all the time. Like, they're, they're last week when I was out in, or two weeks ago when I was out in LA. And I had a long travel. I had missed a session because my, one of my podcasts ran really long. And so I was going to have to combine like a couple sessions and I hadn't slept well and all this kind of stuff. And I'm like sitting in the car like, come on, you can do this. You can do this. But for me, I just got very used to, my feelings are going to fluctuate based on who knows what. And so I'm going to go in and do the things I know are conducive to me being in good health regardless of how I feel about it. Because if you're waiting for it to feel good, I mean, feelings are like the wind. And if you're kind of basing how you act based on that, you're just floating around. I mean, do you feel motivated to brush your teeth? No, you do it because you know if you don't brush your teeth, they're going to go to crap, right? The same thing happens with your body if you don't exercise. And again, it doesn't have to be a bunch of exercise. But speaking of the cognitive, I mean, I was diagnosed at age six with ADHD. And honestly, the more, like, as I look back, just thinking about it now, the more I got into exercising consistently, the better my performance in school got. And like, even now, even though I told the people you don't need to train for two or three hours, I am such a hyperactive, brain going a thousand miles an hour, then if I didn't have that, my best friend tells me all the time, he's like, dude, I wouldn't want to see you if you couldn't train for two hours. He's like, I would not want to be around you. You'd be intolerable. You know? So for me, I think, you know, they say that the sport chooses the person, not the other way around, right? I think maybe subconsciously there was some of that that I just like felt better overall and loved doing it, you know? But for people out there who are struggling with it, whatever, listen, whether it's CrossFit, powerlifting, bodybuilding, just going to gym doing machines, I don't care. Like, any of those are going to get you massive benefits relative to not doing anything. And actually, there was another study that just got published, I just covered it. They did a randomized control trial, I think it was in an order country, I want to say Denmark. And they had people over age 65 do a year of either high intensity resistance training, meaning they were getting them within a few reps of failure on each set, moderate intensity, which was like bodyweight stuff, bands, they were staying further away from failure, but they were doing some resistance, or, no, I know resisted training, but they were active. Like, I think the average step count per day was like 9,500 in this cohort, which is actually pretty high. So these were active older people. So they did that and then they had follow up, they had a follow up at one year and then four years like, and then three years after that. So four years total. And they actually looked at people who stopped resistance training for the three years after. They still had an, in better strength, better lean mass, better cross-sectional area, those like, yes, it, they had less than their peak after they've been doing it for a year, but it had this protective effect against age-related decline and sarcopenia. Because the other two groups, the moderate group kind of, probably didn't, wasn't statistically powered enough to pick out some of the differences, but the, they declined significantly. Of course, the group that wasn't doing their size declined significantly. And even the group that did that one year of resistance training, four years after they started had less visceral fat, too. So it's like, one of the things people ask me is, I'm this age, my tool to start. Or I'm, I'm this, I'm, could I resist this trainer? I do that. Everybody, if your spinal cord works, you can resist in strain and it's good for you. And in fact, right across the street at University of Illinois, right in my PhD in the exercise, physical department, they're doing a study in frail elderly. The basic, we're talking about people who had trouble like kind of standing up, you know. And they started, their progressive overload was they started them sitting down to a high chair and doing reps with that. After I think it was 12 or 16 weeks, I can't recall those specific details of the study. They saw significant increases in lean mass, cross-sectional area, muscle quality, you know, it's image bite in my eye. They got so much more functional. Some of them were able to squat down to like a chair like this and stand up or even lower. And so I think resistance training's gotten this bad rap because a lot of people view it as it's like really aesthetic, narcissistic thing because of bodybuilding and yes, there is that component to it. But like your body is so made to move against stuff that if you don't do that, you are drastically accelerating your aging and your cognitive decline as well. It is pretty scary to see how quickly, and just look at the research on people over age 65, if they fall and break something and go to the hospital, I don't know that you are an ecstasy, but I think it's better than 50% chance that they are dead within a year. Like it's a pretty scary statistic. And there is a, as a stuphyl-ups like to call the disability threshold, right? Where it's like okay, then one of those things happens or, you know, then another one they should add up in that function and then. Right. And then it's like all of a sudden they are not mobile anymore. You know, they are not independent anymore. And you are absolutely right, those things do add up. And I do want to, there were some people that had some questions about aging as well. And you know, with everything you just said, obviously it's doing something is important. And sometimes not obsessing over the perfectionist type of program to do and all that. But I'm going to, I'm going to ask you some questions because people do ask these questions. Sure. You know, first and foremost, training for strength versus muscle mass. Is it like, do you train differently? Like is there a different type of, are there sets and the reps different? Do you think for training for mass versus strength? Yeah. So the two are all things being equal. If you have more contractile tissue, you'll be stronger. Right. But strength is not just muscle mass. It's also neural drive. It is how many fibers can your motor nuance recruit. Like there's a lot of things go, it's technique. A lot of things go into it. And strength is a specific skill for talking about strength as assessed by a one rep maximum. Right. So if you take untrained people into into a lab and you have them like work up to say a squat max. Right. What you'll find a lot of times is somebody will just smoke something. You go up five kgs and they get stapled with it. And it's like, wait, what happened? Because they don't, they haven't practiced that skill. And they don't know how to one, they just don't have a grind to rep and be uncomfortable. But two, as you go higher to a one rep max, you're recruiting more muscle fibers. Fibers tend to be recruited in order. There's some challenge to this research, but they tend to be recruited in order from smallest, oxidative, up to, you know, middleing kind of hybrid fibers up to your glycolitic large. Right. And so if you do high reps with low weight, you'll still eventually recruit those larger muscle fibers as you get close to fatigue. But if you're doing a one rep max and it's a true one rep max, you're having to get everything you possibly can. Right. So it's a very specific skill. So it comes to reps and sets for powerlifting. You do the number of sets you, let me go back. So let's talk about building muscle first because it'll help frame it better. What seems to be important for building muscle is a few things. The first is mechanical tension. And understanding that mechanical tension is cumulative throughout reps and sets. So when I say mechanical tension, I think a lot of people misinterpret that is, it's got to be heavy, you know, and I'm like, well, if you want max mechanical tension, just do the most is centrically loaded exercise you can possibly do. That'll be the most mechanical tension for one rep. But it's really about what is the number of hard sets that you do. And by hard sets, I mean proximity to failure. Now, the research seems to suggest for a muscular hypertrophy. You have to get within a few reps of failure to really maximize the response, but you probably don't need to go all the way to failure. And this is probably conflated by the fact that if you're always trained to failure, especially compounds, your performance in the load you can use is going to drastically fall off. For example, if I did a 10 rep max set of squats, like my absolute best, I actually remember the set. I did 530 for 10 reps. I think something like that in squat. After it was done, I had to lay down for 15 minutes. I couldn't move. Like physically could not move. If you asked me to do that again, I'm out of gotten, I don't know, two reps, something like that. And so if you're doing that big compound movements like that, it's going to be hard for you to actually get a lot of effective sets in because it's so fatiguing. Now isolation stuff, a little bit different, single joint movements, a little bit different. You can kind of push those a little bit harder and actually probably should push those a little bit harder. One of the best descriptions I heard was intensity is the medicine. So hard sets close to failure is the medicine. The number of hard sets or the volume will call it is the dosage. So we have several meta analyses now and meta regressions, kind of suggesting that there's kind of a dose response between number of hard sets you do and muscular growth. I mean, we've even seen it like specifically in the triceps. There was a regression by James Krieger that even up to like 27 to 45 hard sets per week on triceps, produce more muscle growth and I think like 15 to 25 sets per week, something like that. So now again, I want to couch that with you're going to get most of the benefit. If I am always looking at things like how can I be the most muscular strongest human being I can? But for the average person, if you just want to grow some muscle, you don't have to do that many sets. But the point is it does seem to be kind of a dose response. How do you know if so? I'm sorry, going for someone that may not know what their failure is. How do you identify close to failure? That's actually where practically I think most people probably should train to failure at a certain point because otherwise it's really hard to determine what failure is and actually there are studies on this and on average intermediate and beginner lifters underestimate their repetitions they can achieve by about five to six. So for example, in a study they might have them say, like intracet, say, on their eighth rep, how many do you think you have left? Two. Okay, then the next set, they actually, they y'all, then they blare music, they're like hyping them up and they'll get 15 reps, right? And so I think a lot of people, if they've never trained to failure, they viewed failure as kind of like discomfort and in fact it's funny because I've had people say, well you and I'm going to get into this about the strength stuff, I almost never trained to failure, especially on compounds and say, well you, I've had people say you train like a was, you know, you I'm like, so okay, so that's set of 10 with 530 that took me out honestly, took me out for a week after that to be honest. You're saying if I stop two reps short of the 10th rep, that that was an easy set. I can tell you every single rep of that set was hard and felt uncomfortable, okay? And so I think people, if they've never trained to failure, it probably is a useful experience to do with a spotter under conditions like be smart, right? But I do think it is useful. Now, when it comes to bodybuilding and growing muscle, what do you train to failure or stop shy, similar effects? But you probably want to stop on compounds and again, I'm guessing based on some of these meta-regretions. I could come out, I could be a little bit off, but I think I'll be pretty darn close. On compound lifts, big compound lifts, probably you need to get within two to three reps of failure to get the maximum benefits for isolation, probably one or two. But for powerlifting, this is where it gets quite different. And again, there are bodybuilders who train to failure in every set and are very strong. There are power lifters who are very strong, who don't look super muscular. And so people will, there's actually like some people in the scientific community who will say like things like muscle mass doesn't matter for strength. I think very strongly that they're incorrect, and there are people who will say, well, strength doesn't matter for hypertrophy. I think strongly that you're also probably incorrect, okay, because all things being equal, let's take somebody who wants to grow muscle. All things being equal, if they are stronger, they can create more mechanical tension. They can do the same reps with more weight, okay, that's a bigger potential. Take somebody who's a power lifter. All things being equal, if they have more muscle mass, they will be stronger. And you know, one of the things I tell people is, well, if muscle mass doesn't matter for power lifting, that I'm just going to lose 40 pounds, drop down to, you know, whatever weight class I need to hit well records, you know, like, no, it matters. Mass moves, mass, but I think people, for example, me, I held a World Records squat for almost a year, hit 668 pounds in 2015 at IPF Worlds. And I don't, I've got good legs by most people's standards, but if you put me on a bodybuilding stage, I'll never have the best sets of leg on stage. And they'll see somebody who has really great legs, well, they squats 500 pounds. And the, the, the conclusion will be, okay, well, muscle mass doesn't matter for strength. No, because that person, for them, because I don't know what their more new on recruitment is like, I don't know all that kind of stuff. But all things being equal, they have less muscle, they be weaker, they have more muscle, they be stronger, right? So same thing for me. Now, when it comes to strength, the purest expression of strength is force, right? You have to produce force. And that's mass times acceleration. I actually mass times acceleration squared, I think. Physics, physics people, please check me on that one. But there's a, there's a mass component, and there's a speed component to it. So you can move a given load with the same force as you move a heavy load. You'll just move it faster, right? So now if it's heavy load, you can apply the same force, but it's going to move slower, right? So then we call this the strength velocity curve. So one of the things that my coach Zach Robinson really kind of pioneered talking about and he came out of Mike's Ordus's lab at FAU was he said, you know, a lot of power lifters are people who are trying to build strength, train with a lot of fatigue. You know, they're training very close to failure. You know, they're doing heavy sets. And that is one thing that's very important for strength. If you want to get better at a one rep max, you have to be doing sets with, you know, heavy singles, doubles, triples, because that is a specific skill set. You need that one learned how to grind hard reps and two just feel what heavy weight feels like and how to manage that under stress. So you need those sets, but then volume is also important for strength. There's quite a few studies that show that, but interestingly, he did a, I believe he did a meta-arrition looking at hypertrophy showing that proximity failure kind of is linear associated with more hypertrophy. So the closer you got to failure, the more hypertrophy you got, the strength regression didn't show that. And I had no association with your proximity to failure. And so one of the things they said is with strength, you're always managing kind of expression with fatigue. So if you're training heavy a lot and going close to failure, you're doing a very specific skill, but you're also inducing a lot of fatigue, which is going to reduce the amount of strength that you can express. Whereas the way we kind of train, or we train speed, is what I'm doing my compound squat bench press deadlift. I'll do one set or maybe two sets of a heavy single double triple, maybe four reps. And then we'll do back off that are much lighter, but we're doing multiple sets of them as fast as we can. But like the speed of the rep is fast as we can. And they've actually shown that you get better strength results not training to failure compared to training to failure, but you do have to do some heavy heavy sets, relatively close to failure. And it's probably because like I said, failure just induces a lot of fatigue and that's going to mask how much strength you can actually express when they test it. So in general, this is kind of a new share of the lot of people don't really need to worry about. I'd always tell people, you know, I'm 90% sure that you're not training too hard. I'm almost sure of that, okay. There are people who do train too hard. There are people who over train themselves. There are people who put in so much fatigue that it's going to mask their results. But for the most part, most people, there's so many people I see online who think they're over training and I'll look at their training and I'll be like, no, no, you're not over training. And if you are, you're not sleeping well or your nutrition's crap or something like that. For people that are not power lifters or even professional bodybuilders, what are, you know, perhaps someone that you're, what approach your coaching business or something like that, who are wanting to, you know, they're wanting to gain some mass and function and strength everything. You know, not like a competitive level. But like, what would you say, like, how do you do exercise selection like choosing a hacksquad over a barbell squat or doing a bench press over dumbbells? And then also like, are there certain, like, if you were to like, are there like the top five exercises for like for each muscle group that you would consider? Okay, so this is where it's going to be a nice segue of us of talking about X's nose versus practicality, right? So I realized within a couple years of coaching people that, oh, the X's and O's aren't really what matters. It's just getting people to do this consistently, right? And so it took me long to realize that for training, but it still applies. And what I mean by that is when it comes to exercise selection, for example, if I was putting together a program for somebody and they weren't going to compete as a power lifter and they just wanted to grow some muscle, I probably wouldn't program barbell squats. Only because it's a, you know, relatively high fatigue exercise compared to something like a hacksquad, which is still a compound, it requires less balance and learning. And the research shows very clearly now that, that machines produce as much hypertrophy as as free weights. We used to have this like feeling that, oh, no, you got to barbell squat, you got to do these big compounds. And that's what builds mass. And, you know, we have the research to show that's not true. We have the practical examples to show it's not true because Phil Heath won seven Olympias. And I don't think I've ever seen the guy touch a free, freeway barbell. I'm sure he has. But for the most part, he trained with machines and built one of the greatest physics of all time. And people might say, well, those guys are on drugs. Yeah, but all of them are on drugs. So if we see similar results with different training styles, I mean, those sorts of things are equal, right? And so the research supports that. So, but here's where practical segues with that. So, I trained very heavy with freeway movements. And for me, it was the best exercises for growing muscle. And here's why. Because that other ship was boring to me. Like high reps with isolation stuff put me to sleep. But you all load up a freeway barbell back squat. I now, I said, I'm hyped up. I'm excited. I'm going to work harder. I'm going to be consistent at it. And so for me, even though training like a power lifter is not maybe how you draw upon paper, somebody to be best for hypertrophy. For me, it was because it got me excited about training legs two, three times a week to get in all that volume. I needed to actually build that muscle. And I had a client one time who loved CrossFit. He loved CrossFit. He's like, you know, I know it's not the best for building muscle. And I go, you know what, for you, it might be. Because like, dude, you told me when you tried to do bodybuilding training that you hated it and you stopped going to the gym. So we have to start with compliance first. Like, you can have the best program on paper. But if you're not actually going to go in and do it, like, it's not going to work. Right? And so I worry about for the average person, what gets them excited to go, what, you know, exercises do they enjoy that they have low pain with, right? And what will they execute consistently? Because within that for growing muscle, the world is your oyster. Basically, the things that matter, because I kind of got off track. But mechanical tension, number of hard sets and muscles at long lengths. Meaning, there does seem to be quite a bit of research that even when you equalize for proximity to failure, if you aren't taking a muscle to a long length under tension, you're probably not maximizing the benefits of it. And so there's if you look at research where they do partials of like the contracted, the more contracted, partial of a lift. So for example, if you're doing a squat, so doing full range of motion versus a half squat, right? You get more hypertrophy doing the full squat. There's quite a few studies on this. But when they compare partials in a lengthened position, so say, if you're just doing the bottom part of a squat in a partial, which by the way sounds horrible, compared to a full range of motion, you see similar hypertrophy. So it appears that that putting tension on a muscle in a lengthened position is important. So those are kind of the three things I look at. This, you know, mechanical tension, number of hard sets, training at long muscle lengths. Within that, the world is pretty much your oyster as to how you do it. Now I will say, I was in the camp for a long time of this whole, like you can't grow like regional portions of muscle based on like how you do exercises. Well, that was one that brociates might have been right on. It looks like I was wrong on, right? Because there was actually, there was a study that just came out looking at, I think leg press versus leg extensions. And they showed that leg extensions preferably activated the rectus for moreus. So it's kind of like the middle part of your quad, I think I got the muscle right. I, and then the leg press, act it, preferably grew the vastus lateralis. So you probably want to do both, right? Because there's some people out there saying, oh, you need to use the compound. So you don't need to do any isolation. Well, if you want to get the most out of your regional growth, it's probably good to mix it up. And I think, again, something I changed my mind on about 10 years ago, it's very big on like daily, undulating periodization, which is basically like you're changing up your rep schemes, work out to work out, right? Like maybe if you're doing squats, you might do like um day one sets of 10, day two sets of seven, day three sets of four, you know, and by one, two, three, I mean, just your squat days. And I thought that the research suggested that that was going to be better than just doing like straight sets or linear periodization and turns out it doesn't seem like it really matters. But what I will tell people is practically a might matter because people do well with variety. I mean, you know this about dopamine and variety, right? And if you get a new workout, you get excited about it, right? Like, and I, it's funny as a scientist, I have a hard time getting myself placebo, which is actually really annoying because placebo's great. But even now, whenever my coach sends a new training block, there's a little bit of like, you know, like, it a little bit excited. So I think variety is important because if you're just doing the same thing over and over, it's too easy to fall into. Well, I do this way for this many reps, for this many sets, and you stop progressively overloading. Whereas when you change it up a little bit, now you have a little more motivation to kind of, you know, not settle into a normal routine. But that can go too far too. I see people like change their workout up every single session. And I'm like, you're not actually getting as many benefits as you could because you're not getting used to an exercise for certain number of reps, which allows you to get stronger when mechanical tension probably grow a muscle over time. So when it comes to people who aren't going to compete by my marketing, about lifting, mostly what I look at is like, hey, do you know if there's exercises that you really like and have access to? Is there anything that gives you pain? Is there anything that you know motivates you more? Like I know some people are like, I love high reps. I love the pump. I want to get cool. Let's do more high reps. Because again, when we look at equated sets in terms of proximity to failure, when they compare low load training, and I think even down to like 40% of a one-rette max versus high load training, they don't see differences in hypertrophy. Now, I could make a double's advocate argument that perhaps those studies, you know, because a lot of these studies are eight to ten weeks. Maybe over time, somebody training with heavier loads might produce more hypertrophy because they'll get stronger. And so maybe by getting stronger, we'll make hand-cultension. But, you know, I can't really say that now based on the research. But even if it was a difference, it'd be pretty darn small, which for practically for most people out there, I tell them, you know, if you're just training hard, you're getting 95% of the way there. And I use this example, because people will all the time send me videos of IFBB Pro bodybuilders training. Like, look at how they're training. This is a science, but how can you explain this? I'm like, yep, but they trained really hard for 20 years, like every day. Right? And so that mass action is going to wash out a lot of these little differences. And most of the people who worry about these little differences are never going to actually get to express them because they just don't train hard enough. And one of my favorite quotes was actually somebody said, you can't out-science hard training. You've got to do the work if you want to get the results. It also, you know, I've had this conversation to some, I mean, a little bit of this conversation with Stu Phillips and Brad show and failed about, you know, training failure, lifting heavy and, you know, things that you've given, you've given some more details as well. But it's what's nice about it and what I like about it is there are a lot of people, a lot of older adults, women that have been scared of lifting because of the, like, oh, no, I got to lift heavy and I'm going to injure myself. I'm, you know, I might bulk up too much. I mean, we can talk about that, but like it does give we, you know, once I found out it was like, you don't have to lift heavy, you just put the effort in to teach yourself, you know, now I'm lifting heavier too, but, but like I started, like to get into, like, even starting, that was my end where it was like, you know, okay, like, I don't have to, like, do this, like, scary thing. Although now I love it and I'm like wanting to lift heavy, but being strong is fun. Anybody who can lift heavy, I'll tell you, if you can lift heavy and you don't have pain, it's fun. I haven't come across one person yet who doesn't like loading up a big squat for them hitting it and doesn't get excited. I did want to ask you one follow up on the squat. Hacksquat versus like a barbell squat. Yeah. Now in terms of, you know, muscle growth, it's going to be different. It's going to be similar. What about functional, like function, let's say an older adult, you know, getting up out of their chair, like being able to like avoid the fall. Do you think it's the same? It's hard to know. One of the pins on how we define functional, right? Like how we test it. If we're talking about like preventing falls and that's a great point that you bring up because a lot of people get so focused on bone density, bones, we don't want to break bones. Well, if they didn't fall on the first place, you know, and by the way, the best thing you can do for bone density is lift weights. Like anything you can do nutritionally, pales, and comparison is to what lifting weights does for bone density is a massive effect on bone density. So what I would say is probably all things being equal, the free weight will probably be better. I'm not aware of any data that actually assesses this. But if we have 65-year-old woman who's never put a barbell on her back before, that's a big ask. Squats feel really weird if you've never done it before. Seeing a well executed squat now, like after having gone through it so much, and I'm sure you too, you realize, wow, that's actually a very technical lift. Like that is a thing of beauty to do that well. And so I think a lot of times, if I if I really wanted to get somebody doing that, I'm probably going to start with them like doing like a goblet squat or something like that to a box or something that they can execute with relative confidence to start because if I just put them on a barbell squat, it's going to feel weird, maybe they're back hurts, you know, whatever. But, I mean, again, I look at that as I just want to get them back from more sessions. So if what they'll do is a hacksquat or a leg press, hell yes, and then hopefully over time, you know, we can walk them into some more complex stuff, but I'm totally good with people. And hey, if all they ever do is hacksquats, they're still going to be Eons better than somebody who's not doing anything at all, right? And even leg extensions, you know? So yeah, I don't let the enemy of good be perfection. And it's so funny, there's so many myths around lifting and heavy lifting. And I don't want somebody, what I will say is most people, if you progressively load correctly, lifting weights is going to reduce their pain. Now when you're older, you're going to have pain. Okay, my dad is setting her. I love my dad. He's one of the most wonderful human beings I've ever met. But he doesn't lift, right? He has sciatica. Okay, he has more back pain than I do. I scored over 600 pounds. I've done lift over 700 pounds. And yeah, I get some some aches and pains here and there. And I've dealt with some back issues, but you also got to keep in mind, when you're trying to be the strongest person in like your weight category in the entire world for your age, the amount of training, dose I need to make progress is going to be almost right next to what is going to over-training increase my risk for acute injury. And so I've always got to walk that line very carefully. But in studies looking at lower back pain and lifting, they show it decreases lower back pain. Like because one, you decrease your sensitivity to pain because you're progressively loading those tissues. One of the worst things you can do is to not load tissues because then they do get really sensitive to pain and pain is a whole mother. Like that's another rabbit hole I went down that's there's so much woo around what causes pain, injury. We talked about this a little bit. But yeah, in general, if you lift weights when you get older, you'll still have some pain, but you'll be strong and less sensitive to that pain than somebody who doesn't. This kind of leads to some of the questions that I was wanting to ask you about, again, when I say you are obviously an outlier, I mean, you're a professional power, power lift or bodybuilder, but generally speaking like how do you or how do you coach people to do as much as they can prevent getting injuries or lower your risk, I would say. Lower your risk of injuries, then the proper one says. Warm ups, stretching, but then again, once you have an injury, how do you push your saying pain, you get better with lifting, so then how do you approach once you actually have an injury, like what do you do, or what do you coach people to do as well? So I'm not a pain expert, but I've talked to a lot of pain experts, I've read a lot of the literature and I have my own personal experience as well, the lines up with the literature. And I will say, man, this is something I really changed my mind on for a long period of time. The stuff I thought reduced pain and injury versus what actually did, so different in the research literature and honestly discovering the bio-cycle social model of pain was a game changer for me. Because after I said that's quite a little record, I went through like seven years of really bad back pain, hit pain that pretty much prevented me from competing. I wasn't able to get back to worlds until 2022 when I won, because 2015 I just got a silver medal overall. And it was, so the things that are big levers for let's just take injury first. One big increases in volume, in training volume, and load when you aren't prepared for it. So there's a lot of people out there who they'll get, you know, let's do this challenge, let's do this bad idea. If you are drastically increasing your volume or your load, that is one of the big risk factors for acute injury. Okay? So when we say progressively load, like even my coach, if training is going well, and I'm getting much stronger, we don't jump up load very fast. We're still only increasing, you know, five, ten pounds a week. Because we know it's possible that I get stronger faster than my overall recovery can tolerate, right? So we're careful about how we increase load. Putting the tissues in under stress progressively is a big injury reducing factor. So and now I was actually watching a quarterback on Netflix, which followed a few different quarterback, they're following Patrick Mahomes. And one of the things I did like that they were doing was the his trainer was saying, you know, we put him in a lot of different positions, under stress and load over time so that the first time his tissues deal with this is not in the middle of the game. And so a lot of people think, for example, like form is really important for injury prevention. There's not a lot of research that actually backs that up to be honest, like take roundback deadlifting. There was a study like I think it was a meta analysis looking at rounded back deadlifting versus straight back deadlifting or degrees of flexion in the disc. And I mean, everybody would think, okay, roundback deadlifting it raises your risk of injury and it didn't really. And you see some top power lifters deadlift with a roundback mostly rounded in the upper back. And so you go, how is that possible? And then even like like knee cave, knee valgus on a squat, right? That's where your knees come in. One of my friends is probably the best female squatter in the world, drug free. She's squatted 496 pounds and 150 pounds bodyweight, her name's Lea Bavowaw. She's the friend. She's a French national champion. But her knees cave when she squats. But she's always done it that way, which means she started out doing that that way when the load was light. Her tissues adapted to that and it's not really a risk injury risk for her. And actually I used to deadlift with a straight back and found that when I was fatigued, my back would start to round and that's when I would get injured and have pain. And about five years ago, I changed, I said, okay, let's try this whole tissue and an adaptation thing. And just pull the way I pull when I'm fatigued because if I'm training for powerlifting and trying to get stronger, I'm not to I'm not to train under fatigue. I've had way less back pain and I don't think I've had any acute injuries on deadlift. And so because you progressively because I progressively loaded those tissues. Now, if you're I think all things being equal, if you can deadlift straight back, do that, right? But I think the idea that we need this like perfect form to prevent injury, actually the research shows people who believe they need really good form are actually more likely to have pain and get injured than people who believe that they're resilient and strong. And actually people who get injuries, mindset is actually a big factor for recovery. People who believe that they are strong and resilient recover faster from injuries and have less pain than people who believe that they're fragile. And this gets into the really the bio-cycle social model. So the the other big levers for injury risk are psychological stress. That is a massive, massive lever for acute injury and overall pain. So if you look at fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, in fact a lot of the autoimmune disorders are very tightly associated with psychological stress and psychiatric disorders, IBS as well. And they show there's this really classical pain study. I think they did a skin pressure test. And they standardized the pressure and they had people rated zero to 100. Zero being absolutely no pain whatsoever didn't feel anything, 100 being most painful thing they've ever felt. And the average was like I think it was around a 50. But the spread was 4 to 96 if I recall correctly. So for somebody, it didn't even hardly register. For another person, it was almost the most painful thing they'd ever experienced. So pain is not what we thought it was, which is your body's a bag of meat hooked up to your brain. And if you poke the bag, cut the bag, burn the bag, cut the bag, your brain sends the signal and goes awy. And now we know what happens in the mind affects the body, what happens in the body affects the mind. I mean, look at the going the opposite direction, look at the exercise studies on cognition, on depression. So what happens in the body affects the mind, it goes the other way as well. So psychological stress, that by far, is this single biggest thing I changed in my life that got me into a low enough pain state to actually get competitive again in power lifting? And that started with getting better at stress management techniques, going to therapy, started doing hard work of setting boundaries with people in my life. And even left a very stressful relationship. And I'll never forget like this light bulb moment. And again, not saying negative thing about this person, like it was stressful for her too, right? It was not a good match overall. It was a very toxic dynamic. And two weeks after leaving that relationship, I'm like, what is happening? Because I was physically noticeably stronger in the gym. And I was even sleeping a little bit less. And I realized, wow, I'm not walking on egg shells all the time. My body isn't like, I'm not like 10 stop all the time. And this is backed up by the research that it's, there is a psychological, there is a physical toll that psychological stress takes. And so managing that has been huge. In fact, I joke with people that I have become much more zen, not because it improved the quality of my life. It improved by lifting. So I became even more zen, which improved the quality of my life, which then had like a positive effect on everything, right? And the other thing is sleep. So sleep is a big, big lever for a cut injury and for pain management. So there was a study in, I think, Army, where they looked at four hours of sleep a night versus eight hours of sleep a night. So people either had to get yeah, I think it was four versus eight. And I forget the duration. I think it was two or three months. And they found that people who were sleeping four hours a night had a 236% increased risk of acute injury versus people who slept eight hours a night. That's a massive difference. And people who sleep more have less pain. And you can just bundle it up all into that kind of like stress management. The long story is, it is about your overall recovery status. And psychological stress, your beliefs about pain, your sleep, all that stuff impacts it. Now when you have an injury and you have pain, you know, we've all, but a lot of us have gone to the doctor and they've been like, okay, that squat gave you an alley. Don't ever do those again. But you have to understand a lot of doctors, especially GPs are not trained in modern pain science. And they're thinking about liability. If you, they tell you, you know, you could put, you could go back in and squat again. You just need to like start off slow and manage your pain status accordingly. And if you fliers up, you know, back off on your volume, like that. Because if somebody goes back in and gets an out another alley, they go, well, that doctor told me to go squat. I'm going to sue him now. Right. So a lot of doctors are thinking about just minimizing their risk for litigation. But there's something called exposure therapy, which was the other game changer for me. So to explain it, let's take it from like, I'm sure you've heard of exposure therapy for like psychology, right? So for example, via the fear of spiders. If you just take me and stick me in a room with a bunch of spiders, that doesn't, that's not exposure therapy. That's like traumatic and it's going to make it worse, right? That's like if you have pain and let's say, uh, for example, I dealt with, um, back pain that was triggered by me squatting below parallel and then having a fast and then accelerating the lock out. Okay. So it was only at the top and it was after I squat a below parallel. So it was very specific pain. If I wouldn't end try to do heavy squats, it's just going to strengthen that that pain while I'm while I'm, uh, pain sensitive. But what you probably should do is exposure therapy. So that heavy squat, that's like sticking me in a room with spiders, right? It's traumatic. But if you wanted to manage somebody's first spiders, maybe you put them in a room with spider that's under a glass case and they just sit there with the spider and then over time, they bring it closer, over time they take the case off, over time you get better at managing, um, that pain is kind of the same way. So when I dealt with this, so I was dealing with that as well as hip pain that prevented me from really doing any kind of heavy squats. And so I went in the gym one day after reading about exposure therapy, that's okay. Is there a squat variation that I can do that's low enough pain that I can touch it without it getting worse? Because the research shows like if you're recovering from injury, first off you have to get the initial like high pain since it's heavy under control. And so that may involve rest and just walking or active recovery. But once it's under control enough, you kind of want to touch the pain without doing enough to make it worse. And the more you do this, the better you get it kind of knowing when to walk that line. And so I found okay, I can't do a full squat with my normal velocity. But I can do a slow tempo squat to a pin that's about six inches above parallel and then do a pause and do a controlled ascent. And I can do that and that that seems to be okay. So I started there. And every week, if I could, if my, if I felt okay, I'd take the pin down or I'd increase the weight or I'd increase the velocity. I pulled one of those levers or a few of them. And it wasn't linear like there was some weeks where I had to kind of just stay the same because I could feel that I was a little bit more pain sensitive. But after 16 weeks I was back squatting below parallel with not no pain but a manageable amount of pain. And then over time of managing that correctly, I got to no pain. And so that was such a big game changer for me and it really made me think about and everybody thinks if you got pain, it means there's like something wrong, you're going to make something worse. There's a tissue injury and the research doesn't necessarily support that. Like, yes, tissue injuries tend to cause pain. But soft tissue, tissue injuries heal within six to 12 months. If you're still having pain after that, it's because your brain has actually made a connection. And if you think about the purpose of pain, it's kind of a warning sign, right? It's, it's signaling, hey, danger, danger. So I noticed when I'll get pain is one, almost like clockwork if I get stressed out about something. This happened a few weeks ago. I was overwhelmed and here comes my back pain, just rearing it's ugly head. And the trigger for that, I've also found just learning that I don't have to stop doing what I'm doing. I just need to try and adjust it a little bit. So I had that a few weeks ago. So I'll go, okay, I'm going to stop above just like right above parallel, I'm going to do a slow tempo and I'm going to slow down the ascent of my squat and I was able to keep squatting, right? And now it's been getting better. I anticipate within a few weeks, I'll be kind of back to normal. And then again, before Nationals this year, I was hitting a set of 590 for a triple on squats. And on the third rep, I felt my doctor like tweak. And I was supposed to do back offsets after that. And I loaded my sets for back offs. And then I unloaded the entire bar and I was like, I can't win Nationals today. And there's like six weeks out from Nationals. But I went over to a belt squat and I'm like, okay, can I get in a position here? If you ever used a belt squat, you can you can play a lot more with like your foot position and whatnot. Can I get in a position here where I can do a squat movement with, you know, not aggravating it. I could. And then I again, I found that like below parallel was aggravating for that. So I did a pin squat above parallel the next time I was in some more belt squats within three weeks. I was back squat and below parallel with no pain. And again, I'm like, okay, pain, the idea that it's a tissue injury, maybe, but also maybe not. Sometimes it's your body trying to send you a signal saying, hey, our volumes getting pretty high and we're not recovered enough, like back off, back off. And so I have learned to kind of take pain more as a, take it as it comes and not put so much judgment behind it. And it has made such an enormous difference in my training and yeah, I just long story short, the best explanation I heard. I think it was from Sean Mackie when he was on a humanist podcast. I think he said, pain is an experience and it's more like an emotion than it is. But we would normally think of us like the old school brain connected to your body. That's sort of thing. And so again, I've become big all what happens in the mind affects the body, what happens in the body affects the mind. You mentioned a couple of things. I just want to ask you about one of the sleep because, you know, there are many times when people, there's some people that get chronic, like four hours of sleep, they're stressed, they're work schedule, I don't maybe they're like a new parent, whatever, you know. But, you know, generally speaking, like, let's say you are getting poor sleep because of something social or just an event. Like, it's not like a chronic chronic thing forever, but like you even get a couple of poor nights of sleep. That's when I think that really you need to make sure you really do focus on getting a workout. And I don't mean going run a marathon, but like go and like do 20 minute interval or even 10 minute, whatever, something, you know. How do you, so you said sleep is important for lowering the risk of injury, but, and pain, yes. But like if you are not getting, if you're getting a poor night's sleep or a couple of more night's sleep, do you still think people should go and train or it is the risk for, let's say, injury with like resistance training, is it going to be significantly higher or should you just go and do, lift some weights? Like, so I think everyone should auto regulate their training regardless of whatever happens, okay? And so if you have a poor night's sleep and you come in and you're feeling like crap and it's not moving well, then reduce the load and adjust accordingly. But that set of squats, my best ever set of squats I hit, that 530 for 10, that was after a night where I literally slept nothing. But I, but I had the approach of, well, I'm going to go in and just see how it feels. And if it feels bad, I'll reduce my target load and we'll just manage it. And I felt a little shaky, I felt like, you know, I didn't feel great, but it was moving for whatever reason. And I think what people need to realize is when we talk about the risk of injury and sleep, it is, it's like that the bull comparison I made, right? Like, if you've been sleeping great overall and you have one bad night of sleep, I very much doubt it raises your risk of injury. It's more about what you're doing just like if you've been sleeping like crap, sleeping great one night is not going to up, you're all recovered and everything's back to base, like no, that's not how that works. We know like sleep deficits are tough to make up, right? So I think it's fine to go train after a night of poor sleep just on a regulate, right? If you feel worse and I, I tell this, I actually, um, I've had clients, I've had to have them stop wearing wearables, like orings or watches or whatnot, because they end up no seabowing themselves because it, oh, my, my battery is low or like my, my body battery is low or my, my, HRV is messed up and it's like, okay, well, maybe that will have an impact, but you could just go test the thing, you know, like you could just go do it. And so, and the same thing people, you know, talk about like for females, like we kind of discussed this a little bit like training for your cycle. There's really not a lot of evidence that you need to train differently for any phase of your cycle, but if you personally feel worse during a certain phase of your cycle or even a certain day, who cares if it's the cycle, if it's the sleep, if it's the whore, who cares what it is, reduce your load. I like that term, the auto, auto regulate because it's really applicable to so many different situations like people that people are in. But since you put up the women, there's also a whole, you know, class of women that are postmenopausal and, you know, some of them maybe perhaps haven't lifted weights before, they've noticed that even though they're eating the same, calorie-wise, that as they hit menopause for some reason, they're getting a little more belly fat without necessarily taking in more calories. There's something that's happening that they're not, it's not the same. How do you approach that? Do they need to lift? Is that the secret sauce? Do they need to lift more if they are lifting and it's still kind of hard, where the calories come into the picture as well? Again, like I said, even if they're already having really changed their calories, they just hit menopause and then, you know, they get the belly fat accumulating easier. So again, where X's and O's meets practicality. If you look at the mechanistic stuff of like BMR, to energy expenditure, you know, although like hard metrics, they don't really change with menopause. So your BMR doesn't change. So I said to all energy expenditure on average, but here's the thing. There's a lot of people who have sleep problems during menopause. Stress goes up. You probably don't feel as good, right, as your hormone's change. And so one of the big buckets for energy expenditure is actually subconscious or unconscious physical activity, like spontaneous physical activity. People don't realize that. So we think about total energy expenditure. So calories out, right, everything you expend in the day. People will quate that with metabolism. Well, metabolism is your BMR. That's basically the cost of keeping the lights on, right? Like that's the cost to run your organs when you're at rest. That is usually a pretty big chunk of your total energy expenditure. That's like 50 to 70 percent per day for most people. Then you have T-E-F, which is the amount of energy required to extract the energy out of food. That's usually a couple hundred calories per day. And then you have your physical activity, which people think about purely as exercise, but it's not. Physical activity can be broken up in a two buckets purposeful and non-purposeful, which exercise obviously falls into purposeful. Non-purposeful is also called meat, non-exercise activity through a genesis, which is actually really a modifiable, really a modifiable. And if you don't feel as good, you're probably not going to move as much without even realizing it. And so just looking at the research literature, not in minimalism population, but let's take dieting, for example. So we know, if you diet, lose like 10 percent of your body weight, it can decrease your BMR. We call that metabolic adaptation. Outside of what you would expect, just based on the amount of mass you lose. So it's about, when I average like 15 percent decline in BMR. But 10 percent weight loss can also induce a forward of 500 calorie decrease in meat per day. Now let's take what that looks like practically. All right, so I'm about 210 pounds. And my BMR is about 2,000 calories today. My total energy expenditure is about 3400 calories a day. If I start doing a diet that's a 700 calorie deficit for me, so 2700 calories per day on average, that's a good deficit. That's a healthy deficit. If I lose 10 percent of my body weight, in my BMR declines by 20 percent, or by 15 percent, that's 300 calories. And if my meat goes down by 400 calories, at 700 calories total, what was the deficit is actually now maintenance for me. And so I think a lot of people can flate calorie deficits don't work with. They don't understand that well, maybe you thought you run a calorie deficit or what should have been a calorie deficit. But if you didn't lose weight, you weren't in a calorie deficit, at least sustained over time. And so that can feel very attacking for people. But again, the reality is like your in-menopause, you're sleeping worse, and people also, I'm still doing the same on exercise. But if you're not spontaneously moving in the mess, and I don't know what it is about meat. People view it as like a personal attack when I say physical activity. No, this might as well be BMR because you can't control it. Like your subconscious is going, now you can try to make up for it by doing more conscious physical activity. And also I want to be very clear. It's not like you lose 10 percent body weight, and then everything falls off a cliff. This is a very progressive thing over time, right? But you knowing that you can make up for it. So for example, you can do more exercise or you can do more steps during the day. That's sort of thing. But when it comes to menopause, I think, and there is some evidence that like if you get, if you get like really low in estrogen and you replace that, that can have an effect on energy expenditure about 100 calories per day, something like that. And then there's obviously, there are hormones that do make a difference for energy expenditure, like thyroid hormone, right? I think if you're high-pothyroid, it will reduce your BMR. But I think the biggest decline I've seen, like the biggest, absolute max I've seen in the literature is like 25% which is big as BMR. But it doesn't mean you can't get an calorie deficit. You're not a perpetual emotion machine that can create energy out of nothing. Like you have to, if you didn't lose weight or you didn't gain or you gained weight, your body didn't create those carbons out of nowhere. Like they came from something, right? And I think the disconnect between energy calories, people go, calories aren't even real. You can't see them. It is referring to the potential energy contained in the chemical bonds of food that is captured throughout the course of metabolism. And so what I always say is like if you ingest carbons, your body does something with them and we can track that. And if you are gaining weight, your body is not creating carbons out of nothing. It has to get them from somewhere. So all that to say to come back to the Minopause piece of it, it is the lifestyle changes that really make the difference. Trying to double down, try to double down on stress management and also exercise. If you may not feel good, but it is going to drastically help you. And I've gotten in trouble for some of these, for some of these things because again, people will hear that and say, you know, Laine's gaslighting Minopausal women, he's saying that it's their fault. No, I think that these changes can happen without you realizing it. And again, your subconscious decrease in physical activity. That's a big lever that can happen without you even realizing it or having any control over it. And again, people, it's why I'm almost so pedantic about terms because it makes a difference as Jack reaches a details matter. And when you, so people will say, I'm going to take the stairs to say, get my knee up. That's not neat. That's exercise. Because you're making a conscious decision to do it. And so this reduction in energy from meat, it's not something you can control. So it's, it's, I'm not saying it's your fault. But there are things lifestyle interventions you can do to help correct for that. Do you think that that, um, uh, a post-menopausal woman that increases their their volume of resistance training versus, let's say, you know, getting on a peloton and doing spin or, you know, endurance, like, do you think there's a difference in, in helping compensate for some of those changes in their, their physical activity that they're not thinking about, um, because you're getting more muscle mass or does it? I mean, I'm always going to encourage people to lift weights in some form of fashion, right? But again, it kind of goes back to like practicality. If they love spin and that's, they hate lifting weights. Well, spins can be better than nothing, right? But if I can get people lift weights, definitely one of the lift weights. And I mean, the research shows relative to your starting lean mass or goaless of your age or sex, you can build the same amount of muscle. So what that means, people just to put it practically. So there's a study showing that women build the same amount of men as a percentage of the starting lean mass. So what I mean by that is if you're starting lean mass as a woman is 50 kilograms and my starting lean mass is a man, a 70 kilograms. We both resistance training. We both put on, let's say, 10 percent lean mass. The woman will gain five kilos, the man will gain seven. The man gained more absolutely mass. But they both gained the same percentage of their starting lean mass. So the potential for growth is actually similar again as a percentage. And we actually see that even with like strength too, the women kind of as a starting percentage of the one-wrap max gain similar strength is meant. In fact, it might be a little bit better to be honest. But that also could be the women have a lower baseline because they're not on a population level lifting weights as much. And so, in elderly, we see that too as a percentage. Now, if you take somebody who's 70 years old and never lifted weights before, they're going to not have very much lean mass. But if they start, they'll still gain a similar amount as a percentage of their starting lean mass. Now, they're never going to get to the same peak that somebody who started when they're 20. But again, this is why I tell people the best time to start lifting weights is right now, regardless, like if you have a spinal cord that works, start now. It is the best time. And even if you're 50, 60, 70, it's still going to do what it does. It's going to have massive benefits. It's an ever-tool-like. What about there's a lot of people that are older adults, so let's say they're 65 or older, and maybe they are just starting out and let's say they have joint issues. And I think you kind of address this with the pain and I want to just confirm this. So, you know, for these people, let's say that our older, they have joint issues. If they just start with lighter weights, to start with the low exposure, whether they're just doing something and training and their muscles are adapting, their joints are adapting, is that sort of the approach you would take with older adults? Yeah, I probably start with lighter weights and also start with movements that don't cause them pain, or cause them less pain, right? I try to find stuff that, whether it's exercises, tempo, range of motion, like just getting it started because I know over time as those tissues adapt, they're going to be able to do more and more complex movements. They're going to be able to push harder and harder, and that stuff's going to take care of them itself. But if I just dogmatic about them, like, no, you're going to squat and put a barbell on somebody's back the first time they come in and they're 60 years old, and they have a horrible experience with it and it hurts. We're not going to come back. So again, that's kind of where like meeting people where they are is really important. So yeah, I'm going to try and find exercises that are low pain, that they enjoy, enjoying being relative, and then again, even when people are starting out, like we talked about proximity to failure, I'm not taking somebody who's older, close to failure the first time they lift weights. Like, no way. That's going to be, that's going to be weeks down the road. But just lifting something is going to have such a massive difference compared to doing nothing that it really almost doesn't matter what you do when you start as long as you start, as long as it's not, like a such a low load that there's no discomfort whatsoever. And so that's kind of how I'm going to start with people is just like, let's get them in. Let's have them not hate it. And then also see themselves get stronger pretty quickly. That is a really good motivator to get them to keep coming in. Right? And so that's why I don't want to change up exercises every week because I want to be able to be able to say, oh, wow, I had a 10 pounds from last time. I had two more reps, you know, and it was easier. And so I think practically, you can, you can take all the research we have on small muscle links and and and, uh, proximity and use the oil all the window. The first time you get somebody in, it is about getting them to come back for the next one. That is where we got to start. And, um, and also like, ascending appropriate expectations with people of, hey, you're going to notice you get stronger within a few weeks. You're going to notice this, but it's going to take time before you actually see a difference in your body. But within a few months, you're going to notice a difference in your functionality for sure. And so I think just like starting there with people is really important because like you said, for whatever reason, people think either it's going to be always time for the lift weights or they're just going to blow up into this massive bodybuilder. And I'm like, you know, when you get in a car, you don't worry about turning into an ascarter, I ever do you? Like, and as somebody drug free who spent 25 years there entire adult life trying to get as big and strong as possible in a t-shirt, I look like an athletic guy. You know, I mean, I'm a big guy, but I don't look like some freak of nature, you know, and that's with me training consistently hard for 25 years. And always tell people, hey, you know, if you're worried about like getting too big, if you start to get too big, you can just back off. This isn't rocket science, like it's like it's like I said, I worry about people training not hard enough. I don't worry about I'm training too hard. Like that's that is a pretty small subsection of people. Although we end up having selection bias because we're in this industry, which has a lot more people who do train too hard. And you know, get too restrictive with their diets compared to the average person, right? So I think this is a good segue to for, you know, the other signal of increasing muscle mass that we talked a lot about the mechanical tension and and the training, which is the biggest most important, most important factor for not only just muscle, mass, and function, but like we're talking about brain, overall health, bone density just, it list goes on and on, right? I think it's interesting because I'll tell people, I'm a PhD in nutrition and I'll be the first to tell you, training is way more important. Yes, way more important. Well, that's kind of, you know, I, I wanted to get your thoughts on, so I have had, you know, two Phillips and look in Lune, Brad Chonefeld. We've talked about protein requirements, you know, talking about getting getting the biggest bang for your buck with your training, 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight. I know you've talked about that as well. I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on like, what do you think about like earning your protein? Like, so there is this sort of focus on protein intake right now. Like, there's a lot of influencers talking about it. It's in the blogosphere, social media, and, but like, does someone need to focus on their protein intake as much if they're just sitting around not exercising, not training? What do you, uh, you can make an argument that's actually probably more important if you aren't training, but I would say like, get training, right? What do you mean? So like, well, let's think. Because if you don't have the training lever to preserve lean mass and get some metabolic benefits, protein doesn't do it nearly as much, but it does help. And so, you know, but it's, it is a small, lever compared to actual resistance training. Does it help? Let's say, if you look at the end-hand studies and people on average, it will depending on their age, but like, younger adults, less, let's say people that are like, 40 and younger, they're getting on average about 1.5 grams per kilogram body weight. Right. Now older adults, more like 1.2, but that's their average consumption. So do you still think focusing on the protein knowing like what they're, I mean, I guess for older adults, but I've led up to hear what your, your, your take is. So that's kind of like the lab I came out of, Don Layman's lab. That was a big, um, big focus for us was older population. And if you look in young populations, I mean, one of the studies you sent me on protein distribution showed no difference in 30-year-old women, which doesn't really surprise me because when you're young, and even like, 30 wouldn't be considered young, but young enough, that you still have like the normal, kind of translation initiation signaling. So the indoor pathway. As you get older, above, I want to say the study, I think it was out of Riny or Wolfs lab. I can't remember which one, this is like back in 2004, but they showed, um, not only do you get a decreased sensitivity of that pathway, you actually get like less, I think less protein, uh, less of the actual like imtor and the machinery associated with protein synthesis. So your, their research basically showed you could restore a normal response of muscle protein synthesis, but you have to consume proportionally more protein. So I think really, I'm going to add a ballic resistance in all adults. Yeah. So, um, I think when you're young, it's still matters, but it matters less than when you get older. And the problem with that is it's kind of like going in both directions of older people have a lower animal-accessibility and they tend to consume less protein because it's more satiating, it's harder to chew in general, like if you're on my animal proteins. And so people just kind of end up gravitating away from that. And that's also where you kind of start to see protein distribution probably matter a little bit more when you get into older age where if you're getting, you know, three meals where you're stimulating muscle protein synthesis versus, um, you know, just one big meal, which most people eat about 65% of their protein at dinner in in America. And what's the problem with that? Well, on a mechanistic level, there's not really a storage form for a protein like we have for a carbohydrate and fat. So fat obviously you can store as much as knee, not a pose. A carbohydrate you've got liver glycogen, you've got muscle glycogen, limited, but still a storage form. I mean, protein you have the three amino acid pool, but it's very, very, very small. It's not what I would consider a storage form or protein at all. And some people say, well, you know, skeletal muscle is a storage form of protein. That's like saying you build a house and it's a storage form of wood. Yeah, I guess you can tear the house down and get wood out of it, but that's not why you build the house, you know. And so because of that, there appears to be kind of a maximal, well, new study out of and looms lab has kind of challenged this. But in terms of muscle protein synthesis, it appears that, you know, kind of caps out at a certain level on a permule basis. And so if you're older, let me back up, for younger people, 10 grams of protein, probably still not stimulate protein synthesis. But as you get older, you're probably need closer to 20, 30, maybe even 40 grams depending on your only mass and the source of protein that you're consuming. But, you know, it really protein quality distribution, that stuff matters more, the lower your protein intake is overall, the more you consume on a daily basis, the less all that other stuff matters. Your daily intake is by far the biggest lever to pull. And so what I'll tell people is like, hey, if you're, if for whatever reason, you can only get it in one meal and you can still get enough total protein, I mean, I don't think it's ideal, but it's better than not getting enough total protein, right? And I think some of the problems with this research literature as well is when you're looking at protein synthesis, you're only looking at one side of the equation. You're not looking at muscle protein degradation, which is really hard to measure. In fact, it's so hard to measure that protein researchers out there, please don't get too mad at me saying this because I was one of you. But we just kind of do this and we go, la la la la, we just kind of follow muscle protein synthesis because degradation's so hard to measure because if you're measuring synthesis, you're using an isotopic label and you're just, you're looking at incorporation into the tissue versus the precursor pool and then you have a very simple calculation that you can come up with a rate with degradation is much more difficult because you're looking at the dilution of that label from amino acids flexing out of a tissue, much more difficult to measure and to my knowledge, it's almost impossible to measure synthesis degradation and it's very hard to measure those two at the same time and it's hard to measure them when it's not in a steady state. So like if you had exercise, you add a meal, now it's in a non-steady state and it's much more difficult to measure. So all that being said, there may be effects on muscle protein degradation that make it where okay, this explains why protein distribution is less important than we previously thought. Because I was a big proponent of protein distribution and I still think if you want to become the most muscular human you can possibly be, that getting multiple protein high quality protein feeding's per day is probably superior to one or two. But do I think it makes a massive difference? No, I don't. What about have you seen Luke Van Lune study the overnight muscle proteins synthesis giving protein before bed and stimulating while you're sleeping? You're building the protein and I mean does that add something to it? I tell people okay here's, I'll tell you what I do. Okay, so it's like this is the you inject me with true serum. What do I do? Because I want to do the best I can, right? Because people ask about pre-training protein post-training protein, does it need to be right after, has a timing? Here's what I'll tell people. Probably a good idea to have some protein when you wake up because you've been fasting for eight, ten hours and so muscle proteins synthesis will be depressed. We do know that. It's also probably a good idea to have protein before you train because it helps with we've shown that protein before training helps with recovery and protein after training helps with recovery. But it's not this like okay, you know, you don't need to be like having a protein shake. Right as you finish your last set and like downing it like no. But it's probably a good idea to have a meal containing protein, couple, you know, one to two hours before you lift or exercise. And it's probably a good idea to have it after you finish within a few hours. And so yes, but your training will probably naturally fall between two meals like that anyway. You don't have to like accelerate one of the other. And the reality is, if you're eating a meal an hour before you go train and you go train for an hour, those are the new assets are still in your system for four or five hours after you originally had them maybe even longer depending on the source. So I'll eat I eat four protein containing meals a day. I eat breakfast. Then I eat lunch. Usually I'll train in the middle of the afternoon because when I feel best, then I'll eat dinner, you know, within a couple hours of finishing training. And then I'll eat a meal before bed because again, I'm going to be going eight, ten hours without consuming protein. And that's just kind of how I do it. Now, do I think, you know, again, I'm trying to be the most person I can possibly be. If you just somebody wants to build a little bit of muscle, just focus on getting enough total protein per day. And if you can divide it up a little bit better, fantastic, right? But that's probably the last like three to five percent. And what do you think that total protein per day is? Which you can do. Yeah, so this is where I'll tell you what the literature says and then I'll tell you if you inject it to be a true serum, what I really think. So, literature says, you know, 1.6 to 2 grams per kilogram, body weight, most literature tops out around that 1.6 number. What I really think is I don't necessarily know if there's a top end of protein where you stop getting benefits. But I do think it just becomes so marginal that you can't pick it out because with protein synthesis, it's actually a really insensitive measure. Like you're dealing with looking, you are looking for small differences between small numbers. It is very difficult to pick out. And another like difficult thing to look especially when we're looking at lean mass and protein intake is if you do eight weeks study, I mean, it's not like somebody builds so much more lean mass, even if it resistance training versus somebody not. I mean, yeah, you build a few kilos. But it's not like this massive, huge difference. And so I think a lot of times we just don't, it's hard to do really long randomized control trials. I always tell people when they say, why didn't they do it longer? Why weren't there more subjects? Money, money, money, and also I think people have this view that there's just just this group of random people just sitting around waiting to be chosen for research studies. And they're just like, don't have a life and they just do that for no, no, research subjects are me, you people watching their normal people. And guess what happens when you try to control aspects of their daily life? They drop out of studies. One of my favorites is when people go, why didn't they do it in body motors? You know, body motors say this and I go, because you guys suck as test subjects. Because let's say I want to do a protein study on body builders. As soon as I randomized you guys to the low, what you guys, the low protein, you're all going to drop out. If I do a high volume versus low volume study, I randomized people to low volume. They're going to drop out. Like, it's you can't, it's almost impossible to do. Or you've got to pay people to do it. So anyways, if we look at some of the meta-regretions, if we look at the research on protein synthesis and even stewed in a study years ago of egg albumin intake, like 5, 10, 20, and 40 grams of egg albumin protein. And the take home was that the 20 grams maximized the response and it was no different than 40 grams. Statistically yes, but I think 40 grams are still 11% higher in rate of muscle protein synthesis. But I think there was like six people per group, which again, when you're doing muscle protein synthesis and human you are taking chunks of flesh out of people, you are having them lay around getting infused with amino acids for 5, 6, Van Loons recent study was like 12 hours. People literally laying soupine for 12 hours getting a few who was to sign up for that. Like, I'm not doing that, you know, plus getting multiple chunks of flesh taken out. So it's really hard to get high numbers to do this. You're bringing up a really, what I think is a really important point lane because and particularly coming from you who you do really look a lot at randomized control trials and the meta-nosts and evidence. But the reality is that in many cases there are almost they can be set up to fail from the beginning because they're underpowered. Like you said, and we have this obsession with statistical significance. I mean we had to do something, right? But at the end of the day, as you said, it's like, well, there's a trend 11%, maybe if we had 40 people and set a sick, probably we'd see, you know, but then it comes down to then, okay, well, I like how you're speaking about it where it's like, okay, well, this is what the evidence shows. This is my true serum. This is what I really think. And I think that's important too because even people that are influencers that are interpreting studies, randomized control trials, we can be very harsh on the results. But at the end of the day, these randomized control trials were designed for drugs where people don't have any of this in their system before the drugs. This is very black and white. Very black and white. We see this go up 50% because they're doing this drug, whatever, which is why whenever people, when they do meta-nosts in nutrition and they're like, look, quality of evidence was graded as low to moderate. I'm like, yeah, that's going to be every nutrition randomized control trial. Because one, you can't blind it effectively, right? Like it's that you can't, you can't blind it to the person because they're going to know that they're eating less like say animal protein products, right? But that doesn't mean that these are bad, right? It's just we have to understand the limitations of them. And I think where I get really like, people know me for screaming random ones, control trials. Really when I get like that is when somebody makes a claim and the randomized control trials actually show the opposite, that's when I'm like, come on, guys, you know what I mean? Like, you can't make that claim based on this because okay, even if we don't necessarily believe these randomized control trials are perfect, they're going the opposite direction. So at minimum, it doesn't have an effect and it probably has the opposite effect of what you're saying. It's like, I saw something the other day of like, and I'm going to come back to the your protein question. But I saw something where I was like, don't take away protein because it has InUE5GC and that's going to increase your inflammation okay, does away protein have InUE5GC? Maybe, I guess, maybe, sure, possible. Is there a pathway where InUE5GC increases inflammation? Sure. But what happens when we actually give people away protein in randomized control trials? Oh wait, it's either a neutral positive effect on inflammation. So just because a pathway exists doesn't mean there's an outcome for it, right? But if there's now come a pathway absolutely exists. But when you're dealing with outcomes, you're dealing with the summation of multiple dozens, hundreds, maybe even thousands of biological pathways all summing up to that particular outcome. And so sure, I like to use this example of aspirin. We know aspirin's an anti-quagulate, but it also activates pro-quagulate pathways as well. But the overall effect is it's an anti-quagulate. So we have to be very careful and that's as you've seen, there's a lot of content out there now that well, this thing is in this food and it's going to cause this. And it's like, I mean, I saw something about cruciferous vegetables, right? Like, don't eat those because they have isocytonates and that's going to bind to iodine, that's going to lower your thyroid function, and that's going to cause your metabolic rate to drop and you're going to gain weight. I'm like, wow, we kind of skipped over BCDEFG and went from A to Z, didn't we? And that's a pathway, that's a biochemical mechanism. Does it all exist in all, at least partially true? Yeah, but what happens in studies where we just have people eat more cruciferous vegetables? It doesn't impact their thyroid function at all, doesn't impact their metabolic rate, and if anything, they lose more weight from cetyate. So obviously, we can say, okay, well, that pathway exists, but it's obviously not a dominant pathway or even something that really makes a difference based on dosage and all these other things. So bringing it back to the protein question. You're familiar with an asymptote, so I think the response to proteins probably asymptopic. So you're going to get, and if you look at stew's paper of the A-Gallaman, you're almost starting to see it. It's this curve going up where your initial zero to 20 grams is a pretty steep climb, starting to kind of top out, but continues to go up. And so I think practically there was a meta regression a few years ago that suggested up to 3.3 grams per kilogram of protein still has improved benefits, or sorry, still has benefits for muscle protein synthesis and lean mass. But again, meta-verections aren't perfect because you're kind of like extrapolating all these numbers that are in different kind of heterogeneous studies and you're trying to come up with a dose response. But I think based on what I know about protein synthesis, also what we saw with Luke Van Loone's recent study of 100 grams of protein after exercise, I think there's enough kind of smoke to suggest that, okay, you probably don't ever truly max out the benefits of protein on animalism, but when you get up to that 1.6 or 2 grams for a kilogram, you're probably 98, 99 percent of the way there, right? And so the benefits going up more are so incremental, you're never going to be able to really pick them out in a study. What about for people two things? One endurance athlete, it's like really just training hard, like marathon runners, and then two people that are in a caloric deficit trying to lose body fat, does increasing their protein, I mean, I don't know above two, above the 1.6 and maybe to the two, are there situations where increasing that protein does make a difference in great question. And Eric Helms a few years, I don't know if you're familiar with him, but he's a researcher in exercise science nutrition in New Zealand, and he did a systematic review, and I think it was a meta regression as well, showing that in a calorie deficit, possibly up to 3 grams per kilogram of lean mass, so different than body weight, right? But still higher than what we typically see, that up to like, I think 3.1 grams per kilogram of lean mass had improvements in lean mass retention during a calorie deficit. So yes, there may be evidence that more protein is better in a calorie deficit, and for endurance athletes, you know, this is where the segue of one of my favorite quotes is there are no solutions there are only trade-offs. What I mean by that is, you see better recovery from exercise with more protein endurance athletes. Up to about that 1.6 grams per kilogram, I think I saw one study, it was like up to 1.8, saw a benefit as well. But when do you get to the point of where practically now, because you're consuming more protein, you're consuming less carbohydrates and fats, which are fueling your exercise, and so just performance start to drop off because of that. And so that's where that segue has to happen of, okay, we can keep packing more protein in here, and even for resistance training people, right? Okay, I might have some bodybuilders to say, well, you know, 1% difference is a difference in winning the Olympia and finishing the last place. So I'm going to eat 1,000 grams of protein, but I'm pulling out like a fake example that doesn't exist. But what I would say is, well, yeah, maybe you're getting a little bit more muscle-protein to the system, but your training is probably on a suck, right? Because you're not getting in carbohydrates fats, you probably feel like crap. And so guess what? Training is the bigger lever, so you're better off taking some of that protein, allowing it towards carbohydrates and fats, so that you actually feel fueled and can train hard versus just continuing to try to pump more protein in. So for me, I consume, so I'm probably about, I'm 94.95 kilos. I consume like 230, 240 grams of protein per day. So I'm probably like, probably like 2 1 1,5 grams around there, 2 1 1,5 grams per kilo, a bodyweight, and then my lean mass is probably high 80s, so probably 87 something like that. So I'm right just under that kind of three grams per kilogram of bodyweight. But again, like I'm concerned about, like how do I build the most muscle possible? I think for the vast majority of people, 1.6 grams per kilogram of bodyweight, which is like 0.7 grams per pound, perfectly appropriate, and you're going to get the vast majority of protein by doing that. But for those meat heads out there, if you want to consume more protein, I'd say consume as much as you like up to the point where you still feel like you're getting enough carbohydrates and fats to be properly fueled for your resistance and training sessions. Okay, this is, I want to kind of shift gears and talk about some hot topics, I guess, in the, the fitness and health world, yeah, you know, I, it's the starting with with seed oils. And I do think that, this will be the most commented section of this podcast. Well, it's an interesting one. I avoid them, I try to mostly avoid them. I mean, at home, I, I, all of oils, what I use for cooking, for everything. But I also think they've been overly demonized in the fitness and, in health world. So, I know that many of our listeners that are listening, watching have heard a lot of conflicting information about seed oils. But maybe you could start with just summarizing what seed oils are and why are they such a controversial topic? Yeah, so seed oils are generally polyunsaturated fats, which means they have multiple double bonds and versus monolinsaturated fats like olive oil, which is a single double bond or saturated fat, like say butter, animal fats typically saturated, you know, where you have no double bonds. And let me start with this. I don't think seed oils are innocuous from the perspective that in the last few decades added oils are one of the biggest source of increased energy in the American diet. And so I just want to set the stage appropriately, as well, talking about levers. People will say, well, it can't just be the calories. Let me give you the data on calories right now. So, if we people will say, no, it's 24 calories have actually gone down in the American diet. I've heard this argument. They're looking at self-reported data from people, which puts it like 24, 2500 calories, data from Americans. The more accurate way to look at it is you look at the food production, you look at food waste, and you look at food availability, and you can calculate approximately how many calories per capita people are consuming. Okay, that is objective data. That's not, well, yesterday, I think I had, like, I don't even remember what I had for, for, to eat yesterday. Like, I mean, I can look at my app and I know, but if you ask me to call it off and like, God, I don't really know. That data is over 3,500 calories a day on average per person. And the average person gets less than 20 minutes of physical activity per day. So, yeah, I think like a big chunk of it is energy toxicity. Now, seed oils can contribute to that for sure, because even right down to like, hey, you have a salad, what does it take for a chef just to, you know, put more oil on it, or, you know, if you've ever had a dish, you know, I can approximately guesstimate like how much rice is on there, but how you didn't know how much oil somebody put in, like, I mean, I guess it tastes a little bit slimy in your mouth, but good luck qualifying that, right? And then I think also seed oils are probably a proxy for poured overall diet quality because they are in a lot of processed foods. So the question to me, there's two questions. Practically, are they contributing to the health crisis? Yes. But is it for the reason that they really anti-seed oil people claim? And what's interesting about this anti-seed oil movement is, I've noticed, it's kind of popped up out of the low-carb carnivore sphere. And I've seen this progression over the years, which at first the kind of low-carb hardcore keto folks where carbs are bad, just like it carbs are bad. And then over time, that kind of shifted to what we think it's refined sugar is what's, you know, insulin. And then, I mean, we've had so many randomized control trials now and men analysis that kind of show that like sugar isn't good for you, but if you're equating energy, I mean, I have several meta-analysis to show that it doesn't affect inflammatory markers, doesn't affect glucose metabolism, as long as you're getting in the same total calories per day compared to other diets and substituting out different carbohydrates sources. So then it shifted to, I think it coincides with, there's been a lot of low-carb people who also push for saturated fat to be healthy, because I think this is like confirmation bias, we like animal protein, we want saturated fat to be good for us, because then we can justify what I know about protein. And hey, listen, I always find it funny when people accuse me of bias on this because my research was funded by the National Dairy Council, the Agnutrition Center, and the National Accountable on the Beef Association. There is nobody with a stronger bias towards animal protein than me, right? And I can remember when I did debate with a kind of a word person one time, I said, never in a million years, I think I'd be on a podcast divining the virtues of plants, you know? So I'm not saying that there isn't some benefits to animal protein, everything's trade-offs, but if we look at the literature, if you say seedles are uniquely deleterious to health, then you have to say saturated fat as uniquely deleterious to health, because for every level of evidence for seedles, there is stronger evidence for saturated fat to be deleterious on health. So mechanistically, we know saturated fat raises LDL cholesterol. We know LDL cholesterol penetrates the endothelium. We know LDL cholesterol is a causative risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Now we can argue about particle size and all that kind of stuff, but we know regardless of particle size, LDL can penetrate the endothelium and cause damage. Okay, mechanism, right? And then people say, well, inflammation, okay, well, if we look at the studies where they just have people eat more polyentratory fats, sometimes you see an increase in inflammation, sometimes you don't. But if we look at the studies where they're substituting polyentratory fats in place of saturated fats, we see neutral or positive effects on inflammatory markers, blood glucose regulation, liver fat. In fact, one of the things I tell people is if you're worried about liver fat increase from fructose, you better be worried about saturated fat, because they compare them straight up equating calories overfeeding fructose versus saturated fat. Saturated fat increased liver fat 70% more than fructose in a randomized control trial. So, again, all right, you want to make the argument that seedles are bad for you. You have to make the argument that saturated fat is bad for you too. And usually it's kind of the opposite, whether trying to push that, you know, polyentratory fats are what's causing a lot of our health problems. When in reality at every level of evidence, whether it's animal, mechanistic, human randomized control trials or epidemiological, looking at polyentratory fatty substitute for saturated substitute for polyentratory fatty, it's either neutral, positive. I have yet to see one study where they really show the opposite. The one study that will go sight is the Minnesota coronary experiment. And there was some strengths that experiment. It was provided all the meals participants, and they did either, you know, they were controlling their intake, either high polyentratory fat diet or high saturated fat diet. And it was a randomized control trial for several years whether they're looking at outcomes like heart attacks or whatnot, which is great. Here's the downsides. When they re-analyzed that data of more modern statistics, they found that there was no difference. But originally there was a claim that, okay, the polyentratory group was actually more cardiac events than the other group. But here's the weaknesses of the study. One, this is back when hydrogenated oils and trans fats were very prevalent in the food supply. And they, those were considered polyentratory fats. And they were getting a lot of their polyentratory and fats from that. This wasn't from Canola oil. This wasn't from, you know, some of these other, this was from hydrogenated oil. Literally probably some of the worst source of fat you can get. Like, do you get no argument from me that trans fats are uniquely deleterious to health? You'll get no argument there. As about probably worse than saturated fat. So, that's one major weakness. The other one is, yes, they were controlling their calories when they're inpatient. But these people were in and out of these facilities because they were psychiatric facilities. So, what did they do beforehand? What did they do after? What did they do in between? It wasn't controlled. And you also have to consider two years is a long time for randomized control trial. Actually, the overall study I think was five years. But the average length was two years of a person being in it. And I think the average age was like late 40s. How many people have heart attacks even bad health in their late 40s? It's a pretty low number. And so, how many people are going to have heart attacks in a five-year time window? Probably pretty low. And if we think about the mechanism, LDL cholesterol that we think is why saturated fat might be more a bitter risk factor for heart disease, it is about lifetime exposure risk. And this is something I changed my mind on. When I got to grad school, I was very much of the opinion, well, it's more about the particle size, more about LDL, the HDL ratio. I don't think LDL really matters that much. It's more about the overall. And then about 10 years later, here come all these Mendelian randomization studies, which basically look at people who naturally secrete more or less LDL, looking at lifetime exposure to LDL. And that is what matters. Because a good example, I like to use this investment. So, Rod, if you and I do each invest the same amount of money in an investment, and I invest in something that gets 7% and you invest in something that gets 8%. If we look two years later, you'll have a little bit more money, but statistically, probably not. But if we look 40 years later, you're going to have a lot more money than me. And so, just looking at a sliver of time, this is where, yes, randomized control trials are the gold standard, but they also have limitations that we have to consider as well. And so, these Mendelian randomization studies, when they came out, you look at the lifetime exposure, you can draw a straight line through it. I mean, you can literally draw a straight line through amount of LDL exposure throughout the course of someone's life and the risk for heart disease. So, to me, I had to change my opinion on that. Now, I think I'm making a little bit of a leap from saturated fat to LDL, because there are some forms of saturated fat that don't raise LDL, like steric acid doesn't appear to raise LDL. But overall, if you eat more saturated fat, you raise your LDL. We see this in the carnivore community. There's people like bragging about having LDL levels of 3, 4, 500 milligrams per desolator. And it's like, this is going to get people killed. And I think where there gets to be a conflict here, I'll come back to see the whole. So, I know I'm kind of going down the rabbit hole is people might do a carnivore diet, lose 30, 40 pounds. Their blood glucose regulation gets better. Their HDL gets better. But their LDL goes through the roof and they go number. Yeah. And they go, but I'm so much healthier now. One, you don't feel heart disease until it's knocking on your door. And two, you may on balance overall, yes, be healthier than you were before. But you are not as healthy as if you'd gotten all those benefits and also not raise your LDL. You would be healthier or having all those things and also LDL lower. So that is again, we have to be very careful when we talk about independent risk factors. Can I interrupt first second? Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about the Mendelian randomization studies. And I do want to talk about carnivore diets in a minute too. But but I've heard a lot in that community, this, you know, these studies that are cited, low LDLs actually a higher predictor of my all-cosmortality in the end. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But but those studies that you were just talking about to me are the argument against that because they're showing people with like a natural ptsk9 like when they're having a lower level of it. And naturally just lower levels of LDL throughout their life, they have a lower all-cosmortality. They have a lower cardiovascular related mortality. And that, so to me, it's like, well, you know, the low LDL because they got sick or older, whatever is causing their LDL to drop, it's like, you know, it's a correlation. That's a reverse causality issue, right? Like people who have higher LDL later in life when it's like your risk of dying is much more related to wasting problems, you know, people who have high LDL during cancer, you're looking at a proxy for just they're not malnourished. And I very much doubt that if we actually looked at the raw numbers of LDL, I'm not familiar with it. But I doubt we were talking about elderly people with like 250 levels of LDL. I thought we're talking about people who are LDL of like looking at levels, you know, of 40 versus, you know, 190, where like getting so far down, it's because they're so malnourished and they're wasting, right? And you got to be careful about picking up these transient levels of LDL because we know LDL, transiently if you fast your LDL can go up, you know, because you're getting more you flux out of the liver, but like that overall over the course of time it goes down. So, yeah, I think again, I'm indolient randomization study. It basically a lifetime randomized control trial. I mean, it is for that, the highest quality of evidence that we have. And people will say, well, there's pleatropy, whatever. Okay, nothing's perfect. But again, we have mechanism, penetrates the indithelium. We have animal studies showing a dose response. We have, actually some human randomized control trials that do show an effect. And we have the cohort studies that show an effect when it's long enough and they use appropriate covariates. So, we have all those things lining up and we have the long-term randomized control trials. So, I'm just like, I don't need, I don't know what other kind of evidence you need to like convince you, like there's just not any, like I don't know what else we can give you, you know? And so, again, with the seedal thing, if you're looking at just, yes, it adds calories, but is it independently increasing inflammation? Like, if we're talking about actual polyunsaturated fats, like not trans fats, I mean, if you're overeating it, sure, but if you're replacing saturated fat with that, the evidence suggests it's neutral or positive. And so, you're, they're talking about a mechanism, well, those double bonds can oxidize and there can be XYZ. Okay, but what happens when just feeds the people? And then you're seeing now, some people will have said, and we talked about this, like, heating and reheating, it's probably not even like one time heating, it's probably like multiple times heating, depends on the smoke point, all that kind of stuff. But again, that's confounded by the fact that, okay, if you're heating and reheating your frying stuff, and fried food is a proxy for really poor die quality. So, again, is it the seed oils that they're frying it? Or is it the fact that these people just eat really poorly overall in these cohort studies, who are eating a lot of fried foods? Certainly in the cohort studies, right? Yeah. So, so, so, the seed oils so far, the randomized control trial evidence doesn't suggest it increases cardiovascular disease. Doesn't suggest it increases inflammatory biomarkers in the randomized genome. Yeah, and all CRP or diabetes in some of that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now, the heated versus the non-heated, and this is where I kind of think seed oils can be bad, and that it does have to do with what you said about cohort evidence is true, right? Because you're right, you can't know, are they just frying all this like terrible food? And there's there's too many confounders, right? There's too many confounders. But there are, very few, three or four studies that have interestingly compared heating, some seed oils, a lot of times it's South Laure oil. Yeah. The heated or even repeated heating, so I once said, the 20, and then did not, and then made muffins, the same muffins. Yeah. Either the, like, I thought it was a great study. You know, the 20 times heated oil versus just the cool, like, not heated oil, and the heated oils did increase inflammatory markers, and they increased oxidized LDL. And so, and like I said, two few studies really comparing just non-heated with heated. Yeah. Because essentially, a lot of those randomized control trials showing no effect on inflammation with the seed oils, they were giving on pills that were, they weren't cooking the seed oil, right? There's putting it in the pill. So, so I do think there's a strong possibility based on the very limited evidence so far that heated seed oils might cause more inflammation compared to consuming them certainly in whole foods, but even just like putting it on a salad. Yeah. I don't know what are your thoughts to you. So it's kind of like, if we look at the priority of what's important, that's some of the last stuff I'm worried about just because I'm like, again, most people were eating over 3500 calories a day, doing less than 20 minutes of physical activity. Okay, let's get down in a control first. And if you happen to be eating some seed oils while you're getting your calories to down to, I don't know, 2500 today, not really without worried about it, right? But, you know, do I think it's a good idea to eat a lot of highly processed foods that have had seed oils that are heated and reheat, no, I don't think it's a good idea, but I don't know, we have options too, right? What about avocado oil or olive oil? Do you think that maybe just getting, yeah, I mean, like, options? You know, there was one really big cohort men analysis that was done that kind of showed that monoline saturated didn't have as big of an effect as polyontatraded as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease that monoline saturated still positive and saturated was negative, but polyontatraded was kind of better in a dose response. But I mean, I think for the most part, if you're worried, use olive oil, you don't look kind of. What about the phenop polyphenols in olive oil? Is there some studies showing like randomist control trials showing a beneficial effect just from uncarty of ascereuse olive oil? Yeah, I think olive oil is specifically, there's some evidence that like, it may have some unique benefits for cardiovascular disease and whatnot, um, um, like metabolic health overall. So, but again, I kind of look at that and go, okay, well, it's not as one double bond that can be oxidized. That can be, you know, based on your mechanism for polyontatraded, right? Like shouldn't olive oil still be worse than saturated as well and you can't, like, they never make that argument, or at least not that I've seen, you know? Um, so yeah, I mean, I think, again, we agree, I might agree for a different reason in that I don't know if I've seen enough to really I think if you're heating and reheating, yes, like once you get the public oxidized, those double bonds, I mean, now you're, you know, who knows what's happening down stream of that? But I think it's probably, you know, people who are eating a lot of heated and reheated oils are just eating really crappy foods overall, you know? Like I'm not really worried about somebody who's, you know, they spray their pan with canola oil and cook some eggs on it. You know, like, I'm just, I'm not worried about that. It's, you know, the person eating fries that've been refried in the same oil over the course of time. But then again, it's like, all right, well, is it the oil or is it overall? They're having a really poor quality overall diet. So I, I think for me, yes, I hold very much open the possibility that there could be some delta is effects. But I think from most people, it's one of the reasons I say have guidelines, don't have rules, right? Because if you say things like, I don't eat seed oils. Well, as a guideline, that might be okay because you're probably avoiding a lot of like hyper ultra-process hyper palatable foods, fried foods. But when you're like, you know, cooking in a bunch of butter instead of like canola oil or all of will or well, I guess not all of will. But like you're kind of missing the point, you know? And so I just want people to be a little bit more sane with how they handle this. Unfortunately, I think a lot of this boils down to there's a lot of conspiracy theories around all this kind of stuff. I mean, I've been told I've been paid off by big farm, I've been big food, you know, all, name your, name your list. I think at a fundamental level, people don't like the idea of responsibility, a personal responsibility in this and it's much more palatable to kind of say, well, you know, the food industry did this to us because they put all these things in our food supply and that's what made us all sick and you know, XYZ and there's all these, you know, the various backroom deals being, I tend to think that most stuff is much more practical than that, which is food companies want you to eat more stuff because they make more money and their share holders get more profits and that's good for business. And so if tomorrow, people stood up and were like, when I eat this process, junk anymore and we want fresh fruits, vegetables and that's all they bought, guess what, food companies would do. They would stop producing all that stuff. Or they would focus on the other stuff, right? And so I think a lot of people like the idea of having this nefarious, evil, bad guy in the food world and I think it kind of takes, it feels nice for the ego because it takes that personal responsibility away, but then it's also very disempowering as well. And so what I'll tell people is I wouldn't empower you that you can make change and it doesn't have to be like these crazy diets. You can make some really small changes and have huge benefits just by, again, whatever gets you down. Whatever decreases your energy, whether it's low carb, intermittent fasting, kept tracking your calories, omitting certain food, fine, fine, whatever gets you there. But I just don't see some of these narratives being super helpful overall because it gets people focused on the wrong stuff and it's just a very confusing overall narrative, right? Because you got for every camp that says this thing is bad, there's not a camp saying it's the best thing ever, right? And so people like to think they make decisions based on logic, most people make decisions based on emotion and most people debate is actually a really poor, it doesn't really do much. There's a small sliver of people who will change their minds. And I go back to this very classic studying politics where they took a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans and they showed both information that when I had the refute or support a preexisting belief that they already held. Same thing for both groups. What they found was it didn't matter, Democrat Republican, both things that like objectively refute it. Like here is the hard evidence. It shows that what you believe is wrong. That was just of as effective as proof that they were right as reinforcing their personal beliefs. So I tell people, when I like debate the stuff online, I'm not doing it for the person I'm debating with. I have no doubt, I'm not going to change my mind. I'm doing it for the small sliver of people who are open minds and enough to think, hmm, maybe I was wrong about my opinion. So I just think so much of this stuff, these tribal wars and nutrition are so much based on emotion and kind of creating a bad guy to blame stuff on. Because we don't want to look in the mirror and see our own personal responsibility in the role of this. And I say this for, I'll give one more comparison and I'll let you ask me another question. The news. Everyone says, you know, I hate the media, the media like gets people spun up and it like it's stressful and all is cut. You have it, you watch it, you watch it. You know what, the media don't care if they put on good news or bad news. The only thing they care about is your eyeballs. That's all they care about. If every single person in the United States told them to mom and said, I'm not watching this crap. I'm not watching negative news anymore. I promise you within six months the entire news cycle would change. Because they don't care what your eyeballs, that's it. But we know negative news gets people more engaged because they got spun up, they get fired up and emotion cells. And it's the same thing with health advice. I'm sure you've seen people who talk about things that are dangerous or things that will increase risk of death. That gets more attention than talking about the stuff that helps. And when you consider also why it's hard to talk to some of these diet tribes, people who have ingrained this is part of their, well, one, their personality. But also, their beliefs. When you bring them evidence of the contrary, what you're actually doing is assaulting their belief about their own mortality. Because if you are right, then they might be actually killing themselves faster. And most humans would rather endure cognitive dissonance than believe, oh, maybe I wasn't doing something that was good for me. I mean, we got people who who will justify like chainsmoking or any other thing, the most people end up believing what they want to believe, what they wish to be true regardless of the evidence. Well, let's talk about the other thing you mentioned that is definitely a hot topic, which is the refined trigger. And I know you've dealt deeply in this topic. It's a lot of reading of, you know, that the evidence is something that you've talked about. I want to ask you if you view consuming, refined sugar, particularly in the form of sugar sweeten beverages, you know, like something that's just liquid and sugar. If calories are the same, if people aren't overconsuming calories, do you think that's something that is still in her not that harmful, or do you think perhaps there's a reason to say, I mean, maybe we shouldn't drink sugar sweeten beverage, like, you know, I know you don't like to say that because then there's the whole psychology part, but there's diet soda, that's right. I mean, so yeah, so there's certainly not good for you. I think first off, I want to be clear, we're probably talking about a subset of the population that's really small, right, in terms of, okay, they drink sugar sweeten beverages, but don't overconsume calories. That's very small. If we look at the meta-analysis of substitution studies, where they look at, okay, sugar sweeten beverages and we don't control for intake, absolutely increases fat mass, makes meta-analysis health worse. 100% no question about it. If they look at studies where they substitute isocolorically, they don't really see a difference on sugar sweeten beverages or fruit-dose containing beverages. I think it was one of the meta-analysis I looked at, which I guess, you know, could get full, like fruit juices under that as well. So again, substitute with what? So they're looking at isocoloric exchange. So in randomized control trials, whether having people either consuming, say glucose versus a fruit-dose containing beverage, that's right. But they're both sugar, so what about not consuming, just consuming water? Okay, good, good, good, water versus any sugar. Like it doesn't have to be glucose or fruit-dose. Okay, so if we look at sugars versus, okay, sugars versus other phoma carbohydrate, okay, so substitution studies by the phomes of carbohydrates. Well, I'm talking about a specific type of sugar without a food matrix. Right, it's a liquid, 40 grams in a can if you have two of those, it's 80, right. So I'm just saying, like, like, consuming a high sugar beverage with no food matrix, not like substituting a carbohydrate food because it's different. Right, I mean, again, and I believe one of the meta-analysis I said was, like, again, it's hard to get into it, but it was sugar-sweetened beverages when they control for calories. They don't see some of these deleterious effects on inflammation or body weight or whatever. But again, I think that's probably a really small percentage of the population, because most people don't go, they don't drink a coke and go, well, that was 40 grams of sugar, so that means I'm not going to have a little cereal. I mean, they're just drinking it on top of whatever their normal diet is, right? So it's a very, very small percentage of population. Now, is it possible at a higher dose of, you know, several cans of the stuff today? Could there be some uniquely deleterious effects? Sure, I mean, I hope, although open that possibility, I think the issue is more so when you're consuming so much of it, whenever negative deleterious effects are probably lost in the wash of so much energy toxicity, right, because you're getting so much negative effects from that. So yeah, I hold up with the possibility it could be uniquely deleterious, but I mean, I would tell anybody, we want the first things I look for in people when we're working with them. That's all right, do you drink serious sweeten beverages? All right, let's cut those out, right? Now, we come to, you know, I know we've talked about artificially sweeten beverages, because people will say, and here's where, again, messaging can have unintended consequences. People will say, well, you don't want to have artificial diet sodas, because they're just as bad as regular sodas, come up with a bunch of different mechanisms to try to validate that. No, objectively not, like in the human randomized control trials where they have people say either drink soda or use diet soda, very consistently people lose weight. And like actually a pretty good amount of weight, there was a year-long randomized control trial. I think what people lost, like seven and a half kilograms, just by substituting diet soda for regular soda. And I mean, what I do content on this, I'll get people all the time comment, like all I did was stop drinking regular soda and substitute in diet soda and I lost 50 pounds, right? Now, what usually the next thing that people say is, well, why don't they just drink water? Okay, again, I'm trying to meet people where they're at. Okay, some people have developed a habit, behavior, whatever it is, I'm drinking soda. Water is great. If I can drink water, fantastic. But you're going to have a hard time convincing me, they're not better off being 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 50 pounds lighter by using diet soda compared to regular soda, right? And in several randomized control trials and meta analyses now, where they compare substituting regular soda with either water or diet soda, they actually see diet soda produced more weight loss than water. Now, it's not because diet soda is a fat burner or anything like that. It's probably because people are seeking out that sweet taste somewhere else when they have water, right? They still lost weight with a water group, like it wasn't, and it wasn't a big difference between the water and diet soda group. But you can't really say, like you may go all the arguments you want about like brain signaling and whatever, but obviously it doesn't matter enough because these people are losing weight. And the other thing I've heard is, you know, well, it causes an insulin response. Okay, there's several meta analyses now to show that that doesn't happen with any of the sweeteners that we know of. There was one study where they gave sucralose alone, sucralose plus carbohydrate or carbohydrate alone and saw sucralose plus carbohydrate caused a greater insulin response. But in my opinion, that study was not an appropriate control group, because they were matching sweet taste between the sucralose plus carbohydrate group and the carbohydrate group. Because I think the primary measure was actually like sweet taste in the brain, looking at that. And then this other stuff for secondary measures. So they did the right thing by trying to match taste or sweetness level. But the problem is, I believe, I don't think they used sucrose for the carbohydrate only group and they used multidextrin for carbohydrate plus sucralose because multidextrin is not a sweet sucrose. But it has a much greater glycemic response than sucrose does. And so I don't think you can really say it's like saying it's carbohydrate plus sucralose. No, it's multidextrin plus sucralose. And so if we look at the meta-analysis, they just don't support any kind of insulin response. And what I would say is, okay, if you're getting a significant insulin response, why don't we have people just passing out left to the right who are having diet sodas from hypoglycemia? Because if you're having increased insulin with no glucose coming in, your blood sugar is going to drop. Or the other explanation is, well, maybe if there is an increase in insulin, there must also be a corresponding increase in glucose on to offset that, which means all that stuff is going to be washed out since those two counteract each other. But again, there's no real data suggesting increases in insulin. And then the other thing that gets tossed around is the gut microbiome. Which I am interested, most of the studies show no effect, but sucralose in particular does appear to have an impact on the gut microbiome. I have Susanne Defkota, came out of the same lab that I did to my PhD and then she's a microbiome expert. I've talked a few other experts and looked at the research data. And my take was pretty similar to their take, which was, hey, we know the gut microbiome changes. We don't really, we only have a rough idea of what a good, bad, or neutral changes. And like, for example, in one of the studies looking at sucralose, they actually saw an increase in the proportion of a bacteria. And I'll probably put you the name of Black, Black, how do you, uh, coquitas? I want to say it is, something like that. You know how these Latin names are. But that species of bacteria is actually associated with better insulin sensitivity, less fat mass, and better overall blood glucose regulation. And so, okay, well, I can kind of make the argument that maybe sucralose is a positive effect on overall health. Based on that, now I don't know, and I'm not ready to say anything like that. My point being is we don't really know. Now, if you're worried, you use something different than sucralose. I know you like Stivia, you know, there's, um, Asperteam is actually very safe, um, and people say, what about cancer? Okay. So here, here's the thing. Again, negative news selection bias. You're a much more likely to hear about a study where something causes cancer than has no effect. How often do you hear a study like, X showed no effect on cancer? I can't think of, like, the last time I heard a study get propagated in the news about that. Like, the null hypothesis just doesn't pop up that much. So, um, 80% of the studies on Asperteam show no effect on cancer, like, I think something like 11% are like a possibly, and 9% are a yes. Can't buy animal studies. But the ones in, and it's all, the ones that say yes, are all the ones in animals and high doses, or, you know, you have some of these cohort studies where kind of like pops up here and there. Um, but for me, to feel confident that something, for me to feel confident something with cohort data, I want to see it like really consistently like fiber, very confident that fiber is good for health, cardiovascular disease, cancer, mortality, because I am not aware of a single study looking at fiber and taking a cohort that did not show protective effects and in a dose response matter. So I'm pretty confident that data. But if you look at, like, for example, Asperteam in a study of the, you familiar with the Nutri-Santi cohort, um, it's a 100,000 person study out of France from like, probably three, four, five years ago. And I think it was, I want to say it was a 20 year cohort, and they, one of the big headlines was Asperteam increased the risk of cancer. So I went into the data and looked at it. So what the headline left out was from non-consumers of it to low moderate consumers, it increased cancer by, I think, a relative risk of like 15%, which was significant. And then the high consumers were not significantly increased risk of cancer. The high consumer, like a relative risk increase of like a non-s than statistical, like four, five percent. I'm not aware of anything that's actually christenogenic that is, christenogenic at a low level and then not at a high level. No, that doesn't make any sense. Right. And so I think again, for me to be convinced by some of this stuff, it would need to be as just not consistent. And it's kind of like, I mean, I use this example to carnivores now. You're going to be happy. I'm going to make you more happy. I'm not convinced that red meat is an independent risk factor for cancer because these studies are confounded by the fact that red meat typically is kind of a proxy for poor die quality, because most people sources of red meat in the American diet are fatty, they're processed. The studies looking at unprocessed red meat and cancer risk are all over the place. And when they control for die quality, and there was a really, in my opinion, an elegant study, a cohort out of Canada. And I think it was by researching a maximum of, I want to say, maximum of maximum of a maximum of something. And they looked at turtiles of unprocessed red meat intake and turtiles of fruit investible intake. So you had low medium and high of each. At low end takes of fruit investibles, meat, un-red meat had a negative impact on cancer. And high in takes of fruits and vegetables, and high intake of red meat, there was actually a protective effect of red meat on cancer. I think it was like a relative risk of 0.78. It's like a 22% relative risk reduction. I can't remember it was statistically different. But the point being, you're looking at overall die quality. Because if you're eating a lot of unprocessed red meat and a lot of fruits and vegetables, you don't have much room for junk, right? So again, you don't see that stuff pop up consistently in the cohorts or in like the dose response that you were expecting again. I've kind of had this debate with the people more on the plant-based side who have said, well, you know, shouldn't you, like that's just showing that high fruit investments can offset the negative effects of red meat. And I'm like, if something's an independent risk factor, it's going to raise the risk at every single level of everything else, right? So take LDL for instance. Yes, if you have high HDL and low LDL and low inflammation, you have a lower risk than somebody who has high LDL and high inflammation and low HDL, right? But at take inflammation, at low inflammation, high LDL, with low inflammation, stores a higher risk than low LDL at low inflammation. And at high inflammation, high LDL still increase risk above low LDL at both those levels. That is when we determine something as an independent risk factor. Because independent of everything else, it raises the risk and we just don't see that. So again, coming back to after-tame diet soda, wrapping this all together, I view diet soda as you have to be careful people demonizing it because what they think will happen, okay, well, people will just drink water. No, people will just keep drinking soda. And so why not give them this tool that appears to really be a pretty big lever for not much cost? What about, okay, so non-nutritive sweeters, there's definitely, you know, there's the artificial sweeteners that you're talking about, the secret, the secret loss, the aspertame, saccharine, right? And there's the the more natural ones among fruits, DBS. What I'm getting from you and I just want to make sure it's clear is that people that are consuming these sugar sweetened beverages, if they substitute them with a diet soda, which has aspertame, right? Usually, yes, they have superlose. Okay, other than that, yeah, so if I'm okay, as well, that's what I like. Then it's clearly a benefit. Studies show it, they're losing weight, I mean, you know, more than a ball of the healthy. More about metabolic healthy. Let's take about, let's talk about someone who doesn't drink soda, it's like that are sugar sweetened and they're lean and they're kind of just like, there's some people out there that like diet coke a day. Like, not because they are getting off of their their coke habit, but because they like diet coke for whatever reason, maybe it's the caffeine, maybe something about the taste, I don't know what it is, but those people exist, like, sure. So, diet coke a day, you know, what is that, do you do feel confident that we talked a lot about the aspertame data and it definitely seems a little bit all over the place. Cancer does take, of course, it's to sugar and there's a cumulative damage and dose may matter, maybe one a day, but like, is there an uncertainty there that you might say, well, maybe we don't really know at the end of the day, or are do you feel like one a day? Well, now I'm going to get met on you and say, I don't believe anything for certain. All right. But I have data, I, you know, bet my life on, bet my leg on, bet my foot on, bet my toe on, you know, we drink a diet coke today. Yeah, I drink a diet coke. Yeah, you drink a diet coke a day and I don't feel like you're, I wouldn't even feel increasing or mortality or cancer. I don't, I don't present it to my kids, my kids drink water because that's what they ask for, but I wouldn't feel worried about them having one diet soda a day. I mean, if we look at, you know, take acid for tame for example, by the way, I'm sure that comments are going to get me in trouble. Um, should we take acid for tame for nothing worse than parents shaming? We take acid for tame for example. I mean, we know what it's metabolized into. It's two amino acids and it gets metabolized in the phenololene and acid for tape and then, um, methanol, whichever. Right? Well, it's a very, very, like the amount of diet soda you'd have to drink to get up to a level of methanol that would cause problems is, you would die from electralite depletion first, right, from like basically drowning yourself. And people say, what about bio accumulation? Well, as far as I know, methanol doesn't really do that. There's a way to process it out of your body. Unless you're consuming so much consistently that your body never starts getting rid of it, you know, just like ethanol. There's a way to process it out of your body, unless you're exceeding your body's rate of capacity to eliminate it. So, yeah, for small for like those levels of diet soda, I'm just not worried about it. I mean, again, one thing my professor really hammered home into my head is, you can never be certain of my things. When people say there's proof, don't think you're speaking scientifically because you can never really prove something in science. You can support hypotheses with data. You can disprove stuff. You can have some things that there's so much overwhelming data we just accepted as true. But, you know, we have had things that we have held very closely to, we thought were true that ended up, we were slightly off. Or, you know, I will say like most of my things that I ended up changing my mind on, I never planted my flag super strong about it. Like even a protein distribution, even though it's a big protein distribution guy. I never saw all of your, like, not distributing your protein while you can't make gains. You know, like I never said something like that. And so, I think actually, that was one of the major issues with COVID and the, the, the distrusting science is science is supposed to be a very behind the curtain thing, right? Like, a scientist debate about stuff, we do studies in like 30 years after that. We come to a consensus and we go, we think this, right? And instead, everybody got to see the scientific process, play out real life, which was, well, this study says this and this study says this and, well, that control wasn't appropriate with this here and we were trying to sail the ship while we were trying to build the ship, you know? And I said, right, the start. I said, 20 years from now, be able to look back and say, we should have done this. But we couldn't. And unfortunately, it's led to like this really pervasive distrust in science. In fact, whenever I get into, you know, presenting people with evidence, what they end up defaulting to is, why is it not trust science? Because it can just be, it's just be fake. It just be bought, you know? I'm like, that's, do studies get fake? Sure. That's much less that happens than just poor design and, um, like, or designs or peaking or designs that are designed in such a way that it looks like you're testing two things, but you're not going to actually see a difference, you know? So, very rarely, and I tell people this, almost without fail. When I see a study with a headline, it's something I don't agree with or it's contrary to what I think the evidence says. When I go in and read the methods and I read the results, 99.9% of the time I go, oh, I see why they found what they found. Right? And you have to remember, conclusions from studies are just an author's opinion. And you kind of alluded to this earlier, but people ask me, account of accused me of like being in an ivory tower, like, well, do you really need a PhD to read research studies? And I'm like, no, I guess you could figure it out, but I tell you what, my, as well, we're going to PhD by the time you had enough experience to actually do it well, because it is very difficult if you don't have the experience to understand these studies and the practical limitations of them as well. And I'll give you one more example. There was a study done looking at, um, resistance training of a certain circuit, and I knew the researcher, right? And he's giving this presentation. And it was a certain, uh, like, um, order of exercises. And I said, hey, Chad, why did you guys do a manette order? Is there something special about that? And he goes, oh, no, it was a 10 by 10 room is all the way we get to people at the same time by doing that order. So you realize, like, scientific studies are so limited. They are big blunt instruments. And that's why I just don't get excited about like a couple studies anymore. I wait till there's a lot because I always hold open the idea that I could be wrong on some of this stuff. You know, but again, I, I, I, I tell people, I don't plant my flag real strong usually. And if I do, you probably should pay attention because I used to believe, again, that like, um, diet so it was for bad for you. I used to believe that L. L. cholesterol wasn't, wasn't, uh, respect of her heart disease. I used to believe that intermittent fasting was, you know, bad for muscle that like you wouldn't be able to build much muscle on your mind. I've changed my opinion on all these things, you know, because I just saw enough data. But again, I was never super strong my flag on the front end. It was more like, I don't think all the all's the risk factor because of this, but, you know, like, it wasn't the, all the all's actually good for you. You should try to pump those numbers up. But I think people just fall into such black and white thinking. Like the carnivore diet. I, I definitely want to talk to you about that. Um, you, you talked about it a little bit. I, you know, it's, it's kind of like the C to L thing, you know, where it's like, you've taken it head on. Um, and I, I like talking about, I really want to talk about it with you because I don't think people can accuse you as the anti-meat guy. Clearly. I get accused of it. I get a full size vegans and carnivores hate me. Not all vegan. Well, that's ridiculous. National vegans like me. There's clearly a lot of people that experience benefits from going on a carnivore diet and all me diet. I also hear them say things like plants are bad for you. You mentioned that fiber is bad for you. It's fun. It's interesting. I'm trying to figure out what that's coming from. But, you know, what's your take on it? Like in terms of, you know, why are they they're experiencing the benefits? You kind of talked a little bit about it. Why they're experiencing experiencing some of these benefits? Like autoimmune diseases, the big one, right? Their autoimmune issues kind of resolved. But like long term for some people. Yeah, but long term, you know, like we don't have, do we have even data on on this? No, there's no data. So there's a lot of belief in this based on how you feel. I guess, or perhaps some biomarkers. But, you know, a plants are bad for you. Fibers bad for you. Like what's what's your take? Clearly, there's something going on. People are experiencing things that are real. So I'm big on symmetrical application of logic. If you were going to use a certain line of logic, you have to apply it symmetrically. You can't just apply it asymmetrically. But asymmetrical application is usually what people do. What I mean by that is let's take the plants or toxic thing. Right? There are people out there who will say, well, broccoli has this compound in it, which is a carcinogen. I think I saw some physician doctor saying there's 76 known carcinogens in plants. And I'm like, if you extracted like the chemical composition out and like overfett him in high doses, maybe, okay, but what actually happens in the people eat plants? Like a plants are trying to kill us. They're doing a really crappy job. Like they are failing miserably because people eat more plants and live longer. And so, okay, why are we not applying that towards compounds in meat? Pedal cyclic means, he mired, polyamonic hydrocarbons in UE5GC. And when you bring that to a carnivore, I was debating, oh, that's just hormesis. I'm like, well, well, how convenient that the compounds that might be carcinogenic are hormetic for the stuff you like, but the stuff you don't like to eat is toxic. I'm like, but this is like the Olympic level mental gymnastics they have to do to convince themselves because again, they believe that they're actually doing something healthy for themselves. Now, I want to be very clear. Some people do carnivore and they get healthier. I'm not saying that can't happen. I am simply saying you would be even more healthy if you also included fiber in that. If you also included fruits and vegetables. Now, I think a lot of these people are people with undyneostide BS. People with gut issues, digestive issues, and what is carnivore? It is an elimination diet. And so, what happens when people who have gut and autoimmune disorders go on elimination diets a lot of times, they feel better. Okay, but elimination diet is meant so that you can then add back things and see what you tolerate versus not tolerate. Many people, I mean, fodmap sensitivities. Many people have fodmap sensitivities aren't even aware of it. So they cut out fruits and vegetables, which can be high in fodmaps. And they feel better. Okay, so then start adding them in one by one and see what you tolerate. And I think the other thing that can point out is there is a lot of selection bias that goes on here. Which is, if you look at these carnivore groups because I've been in them because I watch, there are only really people who are getting positive benefits of the ones that are allowed. And the people who don't, they get gas lit, bullied, they get accused of like sneaking in, carbohydrates or plants, and the responses, and we'll just add more fats, add more animal fats. If they're having problems with constipation or whatever it is. And it's funny, I was on the bait with Paul Saladino on Mark Bell's podcast years ago. And I think I came across poorly on that podcast because one, I wasn't super familiar with his entire position. And I was so flabbergasted by it. It took me like an hour to just recover and like get my wits back about me. And he pulled up this his postulation at the time was fiber is toilet paper. You might have done it just it. Why would you put that in you? Well, fiber isn't just like toilet paper like there's this thing called soluble from a mental fiber that actually is the main fuel for the gut microbiome. And of all the things we know that actually help with the gut microbiome, that's like the biggest lever is for a mental, soluble fiber and that produces things like buterate, propyleneate, which have positive metabolic health benefits in many randomized control trials. So that's one, but he pulls out this study that I never heard of before. And it was a study where people who had constipation eliminated fiber and a lot of them reported improvement in their systems. So it's self reported and there's no control group. I'm like okay, but the mental analysis show overall that fiber helps with going to the bathroom with pooping, like it helps. Okay, maybe some people feel better by eliminating it. Right? Okay, I can I can see a place for that. But again, it's not that kind of where has this magic it's that you're taking things out of your diet that were probably aggravating you. They were aggravating your digestion, producing excess gas, you're having pain, bloating. And again, this is another one where people go, I was very inflamed. I'm like yeah, what was your CRP? What was it? What's that? Well, that's what you used to measure and explain. Well, my gut hurt. I was bloated. No, no, that is localized inflammation and response to something going on there. That is not the same thing as the inflammation that raised the risk of heart disease and cancer and that sort of thing. So what I would say to people is, hey, if you want to eat like a meat-based diet, I still don't think it's a great idea, but like you don't have to have like four rib eyes a day. You can choose leaner cuts of meat. You can have fish, you know, and my not working some fruits and vegetables. And if you have digestive problems with those, Adam and one at a time and see which one doesn't give you digestive distress. And I think unfortunately, this becomes so much like a religion for people because they just, I think a lot of them don't like eating vegetables and so it becomes an excuse to not eat vegetables. You know, we believe what we want to believe. And again, the asymmetrical application of logics for interesting to me. So there's a lot of kind of where I can advocate out there that say epidemiology's garbage. In fact, Paul Saladino had a video titled Epidemiology is garbage. Like okay. And then when he was on another podcast, he was citing Epidemiology. And I'm like, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew. So epidemiology's garbage unless it's Epidemiology that you agree with. But he's not alone in that. There's a lot of people who did that. And then here comes this like internet survey that was published by Harvard about people, I think it was in Harvard. But it was like a self reported internet survey of people like reporting like certain things improving on carnival diet. I'm like, wait, so 20 year cohorts studies with appropriate covarients are garbage. But a self reported internet survey, that's high quality evidence. Okay. I mean, again, it's like if you're going to apply a certain type of logic, you have to be consistent with that. And again, what I'll say is, hey, I just laid out how I don't think red meat is an independent risk factor for cancer. I'm not convinced about that. Very unconvinced about that. But if red meat had the data that dietary fiber had about reducing the risk of cancer, heart disease, and mortality, you carnivores would lose your absolute minds if anybody dared suggest that it wasn't good for you. And so it just very clearly points out the asymmetrical application of logic and getting more to dietary fiber, it fulfills almost every single aspect of what we, what I need to be considered strong evidence, which is we know the mechanisms, you know, in terms of insoluble fiber decreases gut transit time, decreases the risk of diverticulitis, which probably is a risk factor for developing colon cancer at some point. There's some idea that by having less gut transit time that the toxins that are in are digesta, that wind up in stool, that they have less time to interact with those intestinal cells. And so by getting red of it faster, that reduces your risk of colorectal cancer. So I will fiber the effects on the gut microbiome, the production of short chain fatty acids, and also the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we have those and improvement in glucose metabolism in insulin sensitivity. We have those mechanisms. Not to mention the micronutrients, vitamins and minerals that are co-injustible in those plants and fruits. Yeah. In the food matrix. And that, and actually what's interesting is one of the first seminars I went to as a graduate student, there was a professor that I talk about, like a penance of meadows and all those kind of stuff and at the end we're asking questions and he goes, you know what? You have a really hard time beating mother nature's kitchen. And I really like what he said, which is, you know, whenever we try to extract these individual compounds out of food, we never, not never, rarely do we see the same beneficial effects as consuming the whole food itself to your point about the food matrix, right? So yeah, there's a pathway there. There's biochemical pathways there. We may not ever be able to like really pick them out in terms of priority of what it, but the, the, the thing to remember. And I tell this to people, every food you eat probably activates something positive and negative. The question is not whether things in it will activate positive and negative pathways. And even now I get the heat BGB's about because, you know, a pathway is probably only negative if it's dysregulated because your body evolved to keep you alive. But can activate good and bad things. The question is, what is the overall outcome of that? Right? Like you said, Tyler, I'm sorry, aspirin activates pro-crime-grunt and anti-crime-grunt pathways, but the overall effect is anti-crime-grunt regulation. Plants fruits and vegetables. So both any food, mac, to activate positive and negative pathways, but the question is, like, what's the overall effect? Right? Because if we try to tease apart every individual biochemical pathway, it's going to be really hard to wrap that back together. And again, with fiber, there's also a dose response. We see a dose response in these cohort studies. And again, if we do a forest plot of studies showing benefit or showing harm, literally every single study is on the side of benefit. So I just don't know how much more data you need, just because fiber might, some sources of fiber might make your tummy hurt, doesn't mean fibers bad for you. I don't know how much more else I can lay that out, you know? I 100% agree that there's just an overwhelming amount of evidence that fiber is beneficial, plants, vegetables, fruits, beneficial. There's randomized controlled trials, there's the observational data. I mean, you just, you can't ignore that. I don't even like eating vegetables either. I just do it because I know it's good for me. Okay, we're running out of time. I do. There's another topic I want to cover. I also want to ask you about personal routine, but the topic is something that you and I have probably but it had with, but it heads with a little bit, at least on social media in the past years ago. I don't know that's like been recent. And that has to do with time of shorty dating. Okay. And, you know, a form of intermittent fasting. So my question to you is, well, first of all, I want to, I want to say this. Over the years my view of certain benefits of what I think of time of shorty dating has changed as more data has come in. And specifically referring to the fact that there are studies out there that have calculated if people are just in their free-living environment and they're naturally doing time of shorty dating and they actually are doing it. They do decrease their calorie intake. Correct. Between 200 to 500 depending on how short of a time when older you're in the food. And so if you don't consider the calories that they are restricting, the weight loss benefits seem to go away when you then consider the calories. So in other words, if they don't restricting, aren't restricting calories, the time restricting that effect on weight loss seems to go away. That's correct. Now, so I didn't always believe that, but as more data came out, I now say, okay, well, this seems to be real, for sure. There are a lot of types of time restricted eating. There's like six hour window you're eating in, eight hour window. There's even 10 hours, which I don't think you're going to get a big difference if you're comparing 10 to 12. But other effects of time restricting dating. Do you think there is a circadian component to time restricting, right? There is a circadian component. You are eating human-s are dire. No creatures were eating within our time window. When our circadian rhythm is more metabolically inclined to process glucose and fatty acids and everything. Do you think there is a possibility of a benefit of time restricted eating, like independent of calories? I think there's a possibility, but I think based on the research I've seen, if it does exist, it's probably pretty small. You do, in some studies actually post about this, I think yesterday, you do in some studies, see some of the more transient markers have an effect with, like, especially like early time restricted eating versus continuous feeding. But you don't, at least to my knowledge, I haven't really seen one that shows a difference like HBA one C or Homa IR or those sorts things, which you tend to see is like fasting, bug glucose, fasting, insulin, maybe a little bit lower than the early time restricted eating. Which I think it's possible, it's possible that is a real effect, it is. I think it's also possible that, okay, well, if there are early time restricted eating and they finish eating in like one PM and they're not eating until 80 in the next day when they're going to blood draw, where's the person who is just regular eating, each right before bed, gets a blood draw the next day? I think it's possible that might explain that small difference. Now, I could be wrong and so there could be a small extra benefit to it. Blood pressure, have you seen the blood pressure one? I haven't seen the blood pressure one. That's the six hour, I think it was Verde from Chicago. Blood pressure was, it was, again, calories were equated, so there was no weight loss. There was the fasting bug glucose, but the blood pressure was, that was the thing that was most interesting to me because it was like size effects that you get with anti-hypertensive treatment drugs, which was very interesting. That's something, I mean, there's again, you're getting into the potential cardiometabolic effects, there needs to be more research, but I just wanted to see if you're, what your stance is. Again, that's where I'm like, I'd like to see how the timing of the measurement effects it, right? So I would like to see what I would like to see is somebody do a study just like that, but when they do their final blood draw and blood pressure, they do the same length fasted from the day before, right? So that you're equating that fasting period before those things, because again, I think blood pressure responds relatively acutely to a lot of different things. Stress, if you just ate, you have a higher blood pressure, do you have to solve your senior blood. So, I think it's possible and I hold open that possibility. I think what I tell people is like practically, it's probably very little difference and so I look at practically, is this something that you can implement in your life and make a lifestyle and the answer is yes, by all means it's a great tool, right? Like it's a great tool. It's one of your only levers, the levers you have are dietary restriction, like low carb, low fat, plant-based, whatever, calorie tracking restriction, right? We were tracking stuff, or timer restriction. Those are your three levers you can really pull in terms if you want to put things in the buckets, right? And you can combine them if you want to. But, whatever gets you consistent, that is the biggest thing. And so for some people, they love timer-stricted eating. You know, I've had people say like, hey, I eat in this eight hour window, six hour window, I don't feel hungry, I'm good. And so I think where people, the messaging can get confusing again, is like people say, well, there's some evidence of early-time restricted means better. Okay, but what happens if somebody is like not being adherent to that because they get hungry at night, and then they end up binging at night, because they're, well, I already screwed up my feeding window, I just want to just have whatever I want, right? And so I think the messaging has, it's important to understand why these things work, right? And so we would both agree, okay, if there's a benefit, it's probably small, and the biggest lever is making sure you're just being consistently, you know, controlling those that calorie intake. And so the benefit of timer-stricted eating is for many people, they don't have to track and they'll limit their calories that way. But I have met people who they use time-stricted eating is basically an excuse to binge eat during their feeding window. And for them, that's not going to work very well, right? And so the other thing to get to brought up a lot is kind of, you know, a top-of-a-g, and then longevity. And so what I'll say is, yes, time-restricted eating raises a top-a-g, but so does calorie restriction, and so does exercise. Yeah, I'll turn. And also with a top-of-a-g, I think, again, this is where it's like, using terms as, like, it's good bad. I mean, a top-of-a-g is elevated in some cancers. It's elevated in some ways to disease. I mean, we're talking about life as a little protein degradation, essentially. And so, you know, I just try to remind people, like, thinking about stuff in black and white is probably not the way you want to do it, right? Now, I think the issue with trying to understand something like a top-of-a-g is really, you'd have to almost do studies looking at a top-of-a-g, where you're equating like weekly calories, like if you want to get in the morning stream versions of fasting, and then looking, okay, what is the overall net effect? Because, all right, let's say you're doing alternate day fasting, right? Like a more stream version of fasting. Absolutely. I've no doubt that on your day of fasting, your, your top-of-a-g is going up. But then if we are equating calories, right, you're going to be eating much more on your feeding day than a person who's just eating the same amount of calories every single day is. If we're equating apples to apples, right? And so, when you're eating more, that tends to reduce top-of-a-g. And so what's the overall net effect? Right? I don't know. I don't know the answer, but I would suspect based on other things I've seen, that it's probably going to be really no difference. Then it is a tool to control calories, and that was what affects the top-of-a-g. On longevity, I mean, really, there's some animal studies, there's some in vitro stuff as well. I think, and even the calorie restriction stuff, I think I have a kind of a unique take on this because I've done animal research. So there's nothing, I'm aware. I mean, there's a couple rodent studies looking at a time-restricted eating where they suggested a longevity benefit. I think rodent model is probably a poor model for longevity because rodents grow throughout the course of their life. They know humans kind of peek at around 20, and then they kind of stay level. I mean, obesity not was standing, and then they started to climb later in life. Very different growth curve from rodents. Now rodents are good models for other things, like protein metabolism, decent model for glucose metabolism, but for longevity, I'm not convinced. Now, if we look at the monkey study, the primate studies, we see the calorie restriction effects on primates. Right? And so I think, but I'm not even convinced it's calorie restriction. And here's why. Because I know how these studies are done. Because when you're looking at lab animals, you just look at what they normally eat, and then you cut 20, 30 percent out and you go, that's calorie restriction. But I've pulled up these studies and looked at the chart of these animals' weights. They don't like keep dropping. There's like maybe a little drop, and then it just kind of platoes. Right? Like they don't really lose much weight if at all. Animals tend to overeat in captivity. And when you look at the odds ratios of what obesity does for longevity, what I think is happening and what I think you're seeing is these animals just don't become obese and they don't gain excess amounts of body fat. And so calorie restriction, it's probably better put as it's just preventing excess body fat. Because if you take that at face value, if you're truly in a calorie deficit, you're in tall, you'll die. Eventually you'll die. So I think a lot of this is literally can be boiled down to, just don't become obese. Don't have excess body fat. And you don't have to be super lean, either. Like actually the mortality data suggests if you're super lean, that's probably not good either. There's some aspects of that that I tend to think that people who are very lean are probably extreme in other ways. And those aspects of their life probably contribute to the mortality rate. But like 15-20 percent body fat, if you're a male, appears to be a very protective effect for mortality compared to being 30-40 percent body fat. And so again, I am very convinced that excess body fat is really bad for metabolic health, cardiovascular, cancer, and mortality. But how you get to a normal body weight or lean body weight, I think it's way less important than actually just getting there. Got it. I think a lot of people are interested in what lanes, weekly. Routine is like in terms of your, you know, the workout, your diet supplement is there like a supplement that is, you know, in the fitness industry, you think is like a no-brainer. Like you can't actually be taking. So I'd love to kind of end with your personal routine. Yeah. And full disclaimer, I own a supplement company out with nutrition. And so I have some bias here. But I feel relatively, I tell people, I don't put anything in it that I wasn't using beforehand. It wasn't pretty, felt pretty strong about. So routine-wise, it does vary because I travel a lot for things like this. And I have my kids week on week off, because I share custody, split custody. And so we've got the kids, you know, it's summer now, so it's a little bit different. But usually I'm up early, go getting them ready for school, taking them to school, get back, work day starts around 830. Usually, like, you know, I'll wake up. If I'm taking the kids to school, I'll just pound a protein check or something like that, just so I get some protein in, hold me over, take them to school, get back, have some caffeine, whether it's coffee, energy drink, whatever, which is by the way, caffeine is the original, like, new tropic cognitive enhancer, pretty consistent data on that. And then I'll start work whether it's emails, we're putting content, reading research, a lot of actual my time as I look on social media for what people are talking about, and see if it's something I want to talk about. I handle all my own social media, so that's a lot of what I do on a day-to-day basis, posting, you know, I like to read the comments to see what people are talking about, other questions I have. And then usually, like, I'll have lunch, and then I'll go train in the afternoon, and that will last three hours, depending on, like, I've got World Championships coming up in 11 weeks in South Africa, and so yeah, like my training time per week is like 12 to 15 hours, like it's a lot of time. And so I'll usually, on weeks out of the kids, I try to train Monday through Friday and then take the weekends off so that I can just spend the time with the kids on the weekend. Is there a reason you train in the afternoon? Is it? I just feel better. I just feel better. And usually if I haven't had great sleep, if I have some time to kind of wake up, I go better, but like if I go early in the morning, I just notice that my performance isn't as good. I don't like getting a few meals in before I go train. So, and then, like, once I finish training, I'll get back. I have a nanny who helps me with the kids, so she, like, I take the kids to school, but then she picks them up. My son is on the Spectrum E's ASD, and so she takes him to ABA therapy, and then she'll pick my daughter up. So, do like homework with her, and she'll do tutoring and whatnot. And then, both kids will come back to my house at like five o'clock, which is about the time where I finish training and finish all my work. And then I'm dad for the evening, right? And then once I go to bed, I might, like, any emails, I got to fire out or something like that. But mostly, I'm just unwinding, I'll watch the sunset, I'll watch TV show, whatever, right? Weak so don't have the kids. Usually, if I travel, that's when I travel. Still try to train the afternoon, but obviously, like, it can be kind of walky to putting on how things go. And pardon me. Um, I'm a week so I don't have the kids if I'm in Tampa. Usually, I'm working a little bit longer in terms of, I'll wake up a little bit later. I try to think of too much later because I don't want to get off. I just noticed that being consistent at the time I wake up actually helps a lot, even if I get less sleep. Um, but all wake up, I'll start work after breakfast. I'll get most away through my work, go train, get home, watch a sunset, have dinner, watch a sunset, then I'll go do some more work. And then usually, like, finish up with that, watch a TV show or play in a video game or just something like, de-plugged my mind. What kind of meals do you eat? I'm in a diet that protein. Honestly, I usually back cooked protein, so I'll cook a lot of chicken breast up just so I have quick, easy, accessible protein because carbs and fats are pretty easy. You know? Um, but, you know, sources that you would expect, you know, for proteins, chicken breast, Greek yogurt, lean red meat, lean pork, fish, eggs, those sorts of sources of protein for carbohydrates. Again, what you'd expect for vegetables, rice, oatmeal, one of my favorites is I love popcorn. That's like my, my treat because it actually is very high in fiber. People don't realize, especially if you air pop it or there's some brands who actually are really high in fiber and not super high in fat. I love that. So I'll have that. Um, it's a great way to get in 10 grams of fiber and it takes you a long time to eat it, so it's very satiating as well. Um, and then like, um, I actually do use quite a few frozen meals. Again, I don't let the enemy of good be perfection, because I mean, if I spend all my time cooking, it's just, or I'm hiring like a personal chef. I mean, that's a lot of expense. And so I do use some frozen meals that are hiring protein, hiring fiber. And, uh, usually, and I, I'll have like a small bowl of ice cream, or maybe a cookie or something like that. And that's like my little treat that I enjoy. Uh, sometimes before training, if I'm like kind of rushing, I might have like some gummy bears or something like that, just to give me some quick glucose. So I make sure that I've, you know, got something in circulation. Um, but for the most part, you know, my diet's about what you'd expect. Uh, supplement wise. I mean, if I had to build my Mount Rushmore of supplements, it is very clearly three supplements. It is creatinine monohydrate, caffeine, way protein. The amount of research data on all three of those is enormous, and honestly, especially for creatinine. I just can't see an argument at this point, not to take it. Because of the cognitive benefits, there appears to be benefits on memory formation, even short term. There was a study that just came out showing like 30 plus grams of creatinine at a sitting actually, acutely increased memory formation, which I was very surprised by. Um, depression, there was a study that showed that creatinine helped a little bit with the symptoms of depression. Uh, again, cognition, possibly cognitive decline. And then of course, all the lean mass strength benefits, performance benefits that we talk about. And it's very, very safe. I mean, if you take creatinine, you might see your creatinine levels go up. Your, it doesn't mean your kidneys are failing or anything like that. Again, there's so many long, randomized control trials looking directly at kidney function, showing the creatinine does not negatively impact kidney function. The one thing that I hear pop up consistently now, as well, causes a hairless. No, one study in 2009 showed that increased DHT, okay, which is a metabolite of testosterone. It didn't show any changes in the precursor or the thing that comes after DHT. And so how is this happening? Right? Like, where is this happening? I mean, it must be directly affecting the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion if we believe this, right? But again, even if it was true, an increase in DHT is not the same thing as showing leharoloss, right? You're showing a surrogate marker showing the mechanism. And it's never been replicated. And again, to me, a suspect mechanism, because you're not seeing the either the precursor or whatever, you know, came after DHT, you're not seeing a difference in those. And so how is this effect happening? And one importantly, hairless wasn't measured. They didn't measure hairless. Yeah. And so I tell people, I'm like, you know, I'm just not worried about it. Again, it was 15 years ago. I would think by now, if it was a legit thing, it would have come back. So that's like my tier one of supplements. What kind of dose for the creatine? Five grams a day, plenty for people. Three grams for small women probably enough. Do you think it causes, does it does the water is the water gain? So the water is all intracellular. It doesn't increase extracellular water. People who feel bloated on creatine, creatine can be a gut irritant for some people. So what I recommend is splitting the dose and taking it morning and night. If you find it's a gut irritant. But it doesn't increase like extracellular water. All the water that we see, it doesn't increase total body water and intracellular water, which is a good thing. That actually makes you visually look better. Like if you're full with glycogen, for example, your muscles look better. There's a reason body below this load carbohydrate before competition, because you look more volumeized, your muscles look fuller. So creatine, weight protein I just take as needed to get my total protein and take. I don't think it's anything magical about weight protein. I think it's just a very high quality tasty, relatively inexpensive way to get in high quality protein. People are worried about an insulin response from protein powder. Again, this is where it's important to have guidelines, not rules. Okay. Well, let's look at the randomized controlled trials. Okay. Yeah. It does seem to an insulin response. It does. But does insulin sensitivity get worse? No, if anything in the study is against better. So again, I'm not worried about an acute insulin rise. One of these I'll tell people is, if we're going to worry about acute changes and stuff, you don't really want to eat anything. Because fat impades flow media dilation after a meal. Carbohydrates raised blood glucose, which is blood glucose is toxic over time, and protein stimulates him to her, which is involved in formation of cancer and some cancers. Big difference between acute rises in these systems versus like long-term dysregulated signaling, big difference. Then my tier two of supplements would be things like a really like rodeolo-Rosea as a cognitive enhancer. As an adaptogen, it improves time to fatigue and improves perception of fatigue. And it appears to be pretty consistent. Mental fatigue? Yeah. So even in exercise, like their perception of fatigue. But yes, it also, I think it's task completion. It's how they measure it. I could get that wrong so if any experts are out there and want to correct me, please do. Which dose? I recently got interested in this in rodeolo-Rosea. Yeah. And I know ordered it and I have it. Yeah. And it was because of the mental potential mental effects. So it depends on the standardization of the sylidresides. There was a event in the sylidresides. I think it's like you want like 3%. But the dose that's usually used for most people is like anywhere from I think like 100 to 600 milligrams. But if you go above that, they actually show like it actually starts to fall off. So there appears to be like an optimal curve. So like in my our pre-workout, I believe we have 150 milligrams. And so maybe 150 milligrams per scoop. But I have to go back and look. But it's the amount that's kind of like right in that middle range to get the benefits. And anecdotally, I find it takes the edge off caffeine too. So like you don't have as much of a come down off caffeine. So I like like that, Ash Maglanda. Very bullish on Ash Maglanda. There's a few meta analyses now showing improvedly mass, improved strength, improved sleep, better stress management. You know, there's been some worries about like I think liver, some people said, or also like depression and mood. I haven't seen it pop up in any of the randomized control trials. And so I just don't, I don't really, it's not something I worry about. That seems to be another adaptogen that kind of like helps really with stress management. And interestingly, none of the raises testosterone too, but not an amount that would, it doesn't raise the testosterone or lower cortisol enough to where it explains the changes in lean mass. So this could be like a matrix thing again where there's like active on multiple pathways something up to an outcome. Now, I am a little bit, it's in our, it's in our recovery product, but it's tier two because I just want to see more studies over a longer period of time. Like if you look at creatin caffeine, when approaching, there are thousands of placebo control trials showing the benefits to this across multiple labs over decades in different countries, very strong evidence. I just want to see more from things like Ashwaganda, rodeolo over a longer period of time before I would move that into a tier one. Right? And the mechanism isn't really understood yet of Ashwaganda. And so I just want to see that flushed out a little bit more, right? And then there's things like B-Tain or Trimath of Lysine, which may improve power output during exercise. You have things like beta alanine, which if you're exercising like intense between 30 seconds and 10 minutes, that appears to have some benefits. Citralene may have some benefits in at least if you're at least if you're getting like six grams in terms of like fatigue resistance. So those are some like an in-fish oil melatonin, those things we kind of go into my tier two. Actually melatonin has shown an increase in lean mass as well. Yeah, there's some studies now randomized control trials showing an increase in lean mass. So some people might say it's improved sleep is improving lean mass, but there's actually some evidence that it may act outside of the improved sleep. I'm not sure the exact mechanism. So again, I want to see more of that. It's a hormone. I mean, it's changes 500 different teams. Right. So those are kind of my tier two. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff. You know, multi-vitamin probably go in there somewhere, you know, in terms of, yeah, yeah, let me just come make sure you're covering your bases. Right. If you have a real hard time in any vegetables, you know, always tell me what fruits and vegetables, whole foods are better if you need a fiber supplement. Okay, a fiber supplement, you know, you could take a better meal, so I'm going to be a fiber. So you're getting soluble and soluble, you know, again, I think it's better to get a diverse array, but let's not let perfection be the enemy of good, right? So if you need a fiber supplement, biol means. So those would kind of be like the thing that I'm having against. Now for that, you know, the supplements I sell, we sell, we sell, sleep supplement, there's other things in there. There's like a few other ingredients that have been shown to them proof sleep, but melatonin is the big is the big hammer in there. And then there's our recovery supplement, which has creatin, it has ashwaganda, it has betain, you know, so some of the stuff I'm talking about and then... What do you think of glycosamine and the, yeah, I mean, I think that's probably an attire to if you want. I think the evidence is I haven't looked into it super specifically. I think there's good evidence that it does a little bit is what I would tell people. It's a small effect, but it seems to have an effect. It's a three-throwing kitchen thing. Yeah, if you want to do that, that's fine. And you know, other things that fall into like people like what's two or three, I'm like two or three is where it's just not a lot of consistency in the data, right? You know, or you got stuff like you know, act to sterone, which there's a couple of studies out there that show, hey, and increase in lead mass and act to sterone. And I'm like, does this stimulate protein synthesis? Does it do anything to protein degradation? Where is this increasingly mass coming from? Right? So that H and B probably something in tier three, you know, where like in specific populations, there might be a benefit, but for most people does nothing. So that's kind of how I categorize myself in this. But I really like we only have four supplements in my entire line. You know, we have a pre-workout, we have a recovery, we have sleep, and we have weight protein. And our whole deal, we're probably going to come up with an electrolyte supplement as well. But our whole deal is basically like the line is not going to do the work for you. You got to do the work, but you want me to go out work. And we're just going to help you be able to train a little bit harder, recover a little bit faster, but it's your training that's going to move the needle. Totally. Well, I mean, and you're going to help them get the information. There's people can find you, give a YouTube channel, social media, book, you want to call out everything. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people already know where to find you, but for those few that don't. Sure, yeah. I mean, you've got an Instagram as biolane that's kind of a digital business card, and I want most platforms as biolane. But yeah, I do everything. So, you know, we have one of one coaching, if people are looking for that, we do coaching through team biolane, which is team of kind of like experts that I've hand picked to be one of one coaches. We've trained them in our methods. If you want to be a better coach, you want to learn how to do this stuff, what to learn methods, and don't want to go back to school. I have a academy called Physique Coaching Academy with Professor Bill Campbell where it really is like it's over 600 pages of written material. But if you want to learn how to be the best coach to help people build muscle and lose fat, body composition, we synergize resistance training, nutrition, supplementation, and cardiovascular exercise around all that. And there's not really anything else out there that does that right now. So there's that. Then, you know, for people who can't afford one of one coaching that's we developed my app carbon diet coach, which is 10 bucks a month, and basically wrote a algorithm that will essentially coach you, like do a kind of only coaching. So if you're you know what you're doing fat loss, you weigh in each day, we tell people, the more data points it has, the better. You weigh in each day and based on how you progress, the app will adjust your nutrition recommendations to make sure that you're going towards your goals. And it will even give you some feedback messages, and like when you check in and whatnot to tell you what you're doing, well, you can improve on. So that's been really successful for us. Love people like that. Because obviously, everybody can afford one of one coaching, but you know, this thing does everything that my fitness pal does, except it actually gives you feedback week to week and it adjusts your nutrition as you progress. So it's a great option for people who can't afford one of one coaching. And then my supplement line, our nutrition, got a couple of self-published books, and then I also have a research review called reps where myself and my team of writers, we pick out five studies that are in like fitness nutrition every month, and we break them down and like a really practical way. There's like there's some really good research reviews out there, but I found most of them were still like too high-brow. I really wanted to get something that was very, very practical. So reps is research explained with practical summaries. And so that's a great tool for people at 1299 a month to like, like if you're confused about some of this research, we'll break it down for you, you know. And then also, what's called a workout builder on my website, which is where people can go in and get, you know, kind of semi-customized programming for like 1299 a month as well. So I really tried to like, from top to bottom, like, build out stuff to help people with every different level of their fitness journey. A lot of options there for someone for anyone. Yeah, I got a lot of stuff going on. I tell people, like, tell you one thing, I ain't boring. Well, not for sure. I absolutely enjoyed having a conversation with you, Lane. It's too bad that it had to be cut a little bit short. We could keep going for another couple of hours. I think that means we have to do this again. I would love to because it's on. Yeah. And again, thanks again for coming on for everything you do. And I look forward to continuing following you and seeing what's up. And again, possibly around to soon. I'll be fun. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for having me on. I really appreciate it. It's a lot of fun building the stuff. Awesome.

You can actually gain muscle on point 8 grams of protein. Maybe you can gain more muscle on one point two, but you can still gain muscle on the point 8 grams protein for curing and body mass per day. The body is much smarter than we think. The question I was of being asked the most is do I need to take the protein before or after the exercise session? Which is almost the same question you are asking, should I do the exercise before the meal? Or after the meal? It's basically also the same thing. It doesn't really matter that much because exercise makes the muscle more sensitive to the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis through food intake, but it does so for up to 24 to even 48 hours. So much of the responsiveness, the antibiotic resistance can be overcome by physical activity. So my question is, do what extent is antibiotic resistance not for the greatest amount? Simply secondary to a lower physical activity level? I'm delighted to be sitting here with Luke Van Loone, who is a professor at Masteric University in Netherlands. He is well known for his significant contributions in the field of exercise and nutrition, particularly looking at how protein metabolism affects muscle adaptations, how exercise affects protein turnover. I'm very excited to have a discussion with you today, Luke. Maybe we could start at the beginning. Why protein is important? Why we need protein? So it's interesting to realize that all tissues or living tissues, so also a skeletal muscle tissue, is constantly being synthesized and broken down. And that is always hard to imagine that every tissue in your body is breaking down, building up against all the constituents are constantly being renewed, be mobilized, be furnished. And so for muscle that happens that arrayed at 1 to 2% per day. Which means that in say 50 to 100 days, you have completely renewed your muscle. And so that renewal is actually one of the factors that makes it able to adapt to to choose to become bigger if you become a bodybuilder or become smaller when you actually don't move around anymore. So that dynamic, that is why we, yeah, that's what tissue is. And that tissue requires constant renewal and therefore needs protein, or at least the building blocks of proteins being amino acids. So there's protein requirements that have been established by a variety of committees, World Health Organization, and those protein requirements are generally 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. Can you tell people what evidence that, you know, those requirements were established on or how that was based, where it came from? Yeah, that's always that, that is a lecture on itself. So in the past, people did a lot of nitrogen balance studies. So amino acids contain nitrogen, and so nitrogen goes into the body, yes, as protein, and nitrogen also leaves the body, as nitrogen, but then as urea or in, in the urine. And so measuring the balance between what goes into the body and what leaves the body gives a nice way of seeing whether you're in a positive negative balance or neutral balance. So what they've done in the past is basically give people a low protein content diet for one or two weeks, a moderate or a high amount of protein. And see what it become in the positive or negative balance. And the assumption is if you're in a neutral balance, it's good. And if you actually give a low protein diet, you go down to 0.66, then you actually can stay in most people, actually stay in a neutral balance. And then they suggest that with some leverage on top, we actually get to the point eight grams. But that is, I regard that as a minimal requirement to stay in balance on the diet that has been provided for one to two weeks. And that's a little bit an issue because first of all, that's a metallurgical issue with nitrogen balance. It's difficult to really figure out how much nitrogen goes in because people always underreport whether eating. And the second part is, there's also some nitrogen leaving the body that you don't measure. For example, in an air or if you fight a skin. So that's already an issue. But the other thing is, the body can adapt to more or less protein. So being in a certain balance doesn't guarantee that that is actually your requirement or your optimal requirements. And that's where all the discussion comes from because as I said, if you have your muscle turning over and you give it less protein, the turnover will actually go down. Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? If you have a house and you want to renew it, do you want to change a lot of things or do you want to stay and not do anything? Another, you can compare with getting money. If I give you less money, you'll probably buy less foods or cheaper foods or you go for discounted foods. If I give you more money, you're probably buying more expensive foods. But you still get the same need, you feel the same needs. That makes any sense. So turnover and requirement, we don't know how that varies. I mean, people can adapt to a higher protein intake diet, people can adapt to a low protein intake diet. So you said people in the studies that were used to determine the requirement or being in neutral, at least being in the neutral balance. Where these people older, younger, where they mostly sedentary, physically active, or as any of that, what's known and what's not known. Those studies in those years, those were most of all healthy people. As only a few studies that actually had older, really older people in there and most of them were relatively healthy and lean. So yes, there might be differences, whether you become more obese, you're more active, you're older, a younger, you're male, you're female. So those may all change the requirements. But I think one of the things that we always lose perspective off is what is requirement. What is required for optimal health? And that's of course, depends on what you're used to. I mean, there's no studies that are done that as far as I know, but if you actually have a protein intake lower than 0.8, would you disappear? I don't think so. There's people that actually survive on much less protein. And so they can regain a certain balance. But also people that overconsume protein can regain a balance, so the body adapts if we weren't able to adapt, we wouldn't be alive today. So how is that that people that are consuming really low protein diets? I personally don't subscribe to that type of diet myself. But there are many people, as you said, that do consume low protein diets, whether it's by choice or not. But you're right, they don't disappear. I mean, when you get to the extreme level, they look like they lost a lot of muscle. But is there some sort of adaptation in other organs that change the way protein is distributed or absorbed? Very, very good question. So when I start talking about something, it's almost in 99.9% it's about muscle. And also a lot of your viewers will discuss muscle. But of course, the body consists of all these different issues. And if I tell somebody that his arm, his muscle is actually reconditioned completely in two to three months, people are amazed. But then if you start looking at all the other issues, you'll get even more amazed. And so we started doing that, looking at turnover of other organs. Now you can't stick a needle in the liver and in the pancreas and in the brain, just like we do in muscle in order to measure turn over. But we actually do this prior to surgery. So over the last few years, we've actually put traces, stabilized it up, labeled amino acid traces in the body. And then measure the turnover rate of all the other tissues prior to surgery. And then during surgery, the tissue comes out and then we were happy to take some of that tissue to measure the turnover rate. Now, translating that more and popular scientific, you have a new liver in the week. You have a new intestine in two days. You have a new brain in three weeks. Brain turnover, for brain protein turnover is about three times as fast as muscle. So all of these tissues are constantly breaking down and building our breaking up. So every constituent, all the amino acids are constantly being changed. I used to tell that muscle is the most important organ and responsible for most of the protein metabolism, simply because you have about 30 kilograms of muscle in your body. But the turnover rates of all your other organs is much higher. So actually, you're in a whole body level. I think muscle isn't that important for total. So in a total body, we synthesize on a daily basis about 300 grams of protein. And how much do you eat about 70 grams? So that means that we are that we're recycling 230 grams of amino acids on a daily basis. So realize constantly, one of amino acids is being released from a protein in your brain. It gets back into your circulation. It's being actually used to synthesize your left, your right toe. And that is constantly happening everywhere. And so it's amazing that we reuse all these amino acids in the body and then we renew them. We fresh them with only 70 grams. And that's why we need protein. Now, if you refresh with less protein, probably as you suggest turnover rates of some of the other organs might go down. Which once we don't know, we know a lot about muscle, you hardly know everybody about anything about all who had the other organs respond to protein intake. So there's a lot to learn. Okay. What about people that are engaged in resistance training? So you are you are putting a stress on your muscle. And obviously there's going to probably increase the turnover as well. So how much do the demands in terms of protein requirements go up? Now, I know it probably depends a lot on what your goals are, your goals to be in a lead body builder or our your goals to stay off muscle atrophy. But it'd be nice to have, you know, what are some of the requirements for protein intake with people that are engaged in frequent resistance training, also some aerobic conditioning, not elite athletes, just regular people that are committed to health and also peer a lot in the body building community that you should just eat one gram of protein per pound, which is 2.2 grams per kilogram body weight. I'd love to know what your thoughts are on that as well. A lot of questions there. So the first thing is protein synthesis is not the same as muscle protein accretion. So the building of muscle is not the same as reconditioning when people like to fill up myself, we measure muscle protein synthesis. Now, the muscle protein synthesis goes up after exercise when you do endurance type exercise, but also when you do resistance type exercise. The long term adaptation of course is completely different. Look at the physique of a marathon runner and a body builder. There's hugely different, but they both have very high muscle protein synthesis after training session. So the protein synthesis is a measure of to what extent as the muscle recondition to become more adapted to the type of exercise that you perform. Now we do see that if you ingest more proteins above point 0.8 and towards say 1.6, 1. even some people suggest 1.8 that you get a more efficient reconditioning. Now does the muscle need all that protein? No, because for example, in the endurance athlete, the endurance athlete is not gaining weight at least I hope not because that wouldn't be good for him. But he actually is renewing that muscle much faster and that requires fresh proteins coming in. Now what I said, the optimal requirements we don't know, but we do know, is that at least for muscle mass gains, so for the resistance type guys that want to gain more muscle, that it tends to have greater gains in muscle mass and muscle strength if you consume more protein than is what being advised. So if you go towards 1.2 or even 1.41.6, now going either higher than that, I think it's not relevant. It's not necessary. It's also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because if your body adapts to more protein, it will need more protein. So that is just natural in the situation, your body adapts to its use. So you can actually maintain your body mass on the low protein intake and on a high-hybrid protein intake and that there must be a sweet spot somewhere. And I think most people are spending too much time thinking about what sweet spot is because the point eight hardly any, whatever we're talking about, younger old, is honey anybody consuming point eight. If you're a healthy older or healthy young sedentary person, you easily consume between one and 1.3 grams of protein per kilo and body mass per day. I mean, if 10 to 15 percent of your diet is protein, you easily get to 1.3. And that's also people that don't take supplements or just don't think about an iteration. If we see elderly of older people in an out test between 1 and 1.3. Now, if you're an athlete and you're exercising, you eat more simply because you need to be an energy balance. 10 to 15 energy percent comes from protein. So if you're physically active, you're automatically already consumed 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 grams of protein. Do the math. Think about two of the France cyclists. They're not big guys. They actually expand about 25 mega-jules of energy on a daily bay on a daily basis in the two of the France. If only 10 percent of that comes from protein, they already consume well above two. It's not what it needs, but people are too worried about the total amount of protein. They already getting enough protein if they stay in energy balance. It becomes more important when you actually can't eat a lot of food. Then it's then the puzzle becomes what different goes. What about people that are not in energy in the balance? Let's say there are people that are undergoing energy restriction to change body composition. Do protein requirements? Is it beneficial to change protein requirements and perhaps increase them in that specific condition? What we typically see when people try to lose weight, for example. So if they are in a hypocolary diet, is that they lose that they if they eat less and they try to maintain their absolute amount of protein, the decline in muscle mass is less. So maintenance of your absolute daily protein intake is more important. That's exactly what relates what I said before. Your body adapts to a certain amount of protein. If you suddenly reduce the protein intake, that might go at the expense of muscle. Also when people go into the hospital and they're not exercising the eating less also because of pain and stuff on that, we try to optimize or maintain at least the total amount of protein that they were consuming before they went into the hospital. That will attenuate at least attenuate a little bit, the muscle loss that they have. So maintenance of your normal protein intake is an essential thing. How does resistance training and training in general change the way the muscle responds to your inner muscles? So exercise increases muscle protein synthesis also increases muscle protein breakdown, but it increases muscle synthesis to a greater extent than it increases muscle breakdown. So net balance becomes better. That's without food intake. If you throw protein on top of that, then breakdown is inhibited to some extent and protein synthesis is further increased. Allowing you to adapt and to recondition the muscle to what you're aiming for and that could be like more mitochondrial proteins when you're in endurance at least or my fibro proteins when you're becoming a more resistance type at least. Okay, so is that kind of why you're saying when you let's say you're training and then you increase your protein intake to 1.6 to 1.8. Let's say you're going higher and you're doing that for a while and your body adapts to that amount. Then if you take that away and you're still doing the training, then does it adapt quickly as well or we start to lose muscle mass? We don't know, but I would predict and let's let's do the extreme that's anecdotal reports of people that have a very high protein intake diet and then you tell them that they don't need that amount of protein and then they do an experiment and they basically say, okay, you know what, I'm going back to 1.5 and I used to be eating so much supplements that was sitting at almost 3 grams per kilogram body mass and I'll bang it back down to 1.5. I'm losing muscles so I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not sure what would happen if they actually kept it there for a while because it's homeostasis. Your body adapts so probably if you're consuming more than 3 grams of protein per kilogram body mass per day, the turnover of other tissue and all the oxidation of the protein will probably at a higher level. So you can basically get a new home your stasis within like 2 or 3 days. That requires studies to look at changes over time. I mean like I said, I mean we now tell everybody that 0.66 or 0.8 is the minimal requirements. I assume that there's people that it's that he lot much less protein but they still stay in balance. If you go to a third world country of people that are not consuming enough food, they adapt. And so it's also on the other side. I think you can adapt to a high protein intake even if you don't need it. Is it a healthy thing? We don't know. Do you increase the turnover rates of other tissues? We don't know. And if the turnover is increased, is that a good thing? Is that bad thing? When you say the adapt like for example with with respect to the extreme like low protein diet level, I mean they adapt but you know they're not they're not building muscle. Is that correct? Not building muscle but they're maintaining in a in a in a nitrogen balance. Until they get older and then it's harder to stay in the balance if you're not getting enough protein. If they're losing muscle they're not in balance but again then we're talking about muscle. Yeah. And you with the nitrogen balance you measure on the whole body level. Okay. And that's that's one of the reasons why you can't translate the protein requirements directly to what is happening in the muscle. The muscle just enjoys when it gets more protein it can do it. It's much more modulated. I mean if you would actually increase your liver or your organs by a higher protein intake we would probably have a health issue. Well what about you've done some research on anabolic resistance and maybe you can explain to people what anabolic resistance is and and how that is relevant in terms of protein intake for older adults. Yeah. So if you give young healthy people about 20 grams of a high quality protein you see a maximal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. Giving 40 grams did not result in a greater muscle protein synthesis. We'll talk about the 100 grams later on probably. But so in the in the next four to six hours after a meal 20 grams max 20 grams of protein maximizes muscle protein now if you do that the same if you do that in all the people and you give them the same 20 grams of protein they show a lesser stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and they do not reach that same level and so do not the maximal level. So that's what they now call anabolic resistance. We see that the same amount of protein does not lead to the same increase of muscle protein synthesis that you see in young people. That is now defined. I mean micro-enis group was the first to define that as anabolic resistance. But the question is what what is causing anabolic resistance is that because of the age? But of course if you compare young and older groups it's not only about age if you compare young and older person it's the age it's the lifestyle it's the habitual food intake habitual protein intake it's the co-ed medication the co-mode co-mode biobinities that they have. So you're comparing a lot more. Now one of the strongest things that increases the sensitivity to food intake is physical activity. Now if you provide if you give an older person an exercise session before food intake, their response is almost completely normal. So much of the response of the anabolic resistance can be overcome by physical activity. So my question is to what extent is anabolic resistance not for the greatest amount? Simply secondary to a lower physical activity level. Okay so if I'm understanding correctly most of the anabolic resistance with older age is attenuated with physical activity resistance training just being physically active. Well that's pretty incredible because you're right a lot of people do as they get older they do become less physically active certainly people that aren't necessarily focused on their exercise right I mean just normal people that are kind of more active perhaps when they're in their job and then they retire then they're not as active. I mean that's probably the biggest I think for the general population the biggest problem is when they then retire and then they're just sitting at home then no longer physically active. So knowing that anabolic resistance can be overcome by physical activities mostly overcome is I think extremely important for public health. Before we kind of dive into some of that a little bit more I wanted to you you mentioned something about being overweight nobis with respect to protein requirements because in the United States there are many people are overweight nobis and people like listening to this podcast might look at that number 0.8 grams for people like per kilogram body weight and directly translate that to their weight which could be quite high. So how does a person who is overweight nobis perhaps it's not as important because they're probably like you said they're consuming enough food so they don't have to worry about it but there are anal people that want to think about calculations no matter what how does that person approach how much protein they should be taking in when they are obese or overweight. If you would actually modulate your protein requirements towards the tissues that require the protein then it will be better to basically base it on fat free mass because of course a lot of the fat mass is not that metabolic reactive it's most of it is fat deba-de-de-po so turn off of protein is relatively small compared to the organs and the muscle. So if you have the fat free mass or the organ mass and the muscle and actually say like 8.8 for an 80 year old or an 80 kilogram weighing man then also related to the point 8 based on those 80 kilograms and not on the 20 or 40 excess fat depost that you have on you. So people most people aren't going and measuring their fat free mass but that is something that can be done people can go get what you say doing a Texas scan would be something that would be more a lot. There's so many options I mean you can make a body volume scan you can there's nice abs nowadays we heard yesterday in the conference also but you can also do a Texas scan or a body circumference measurements or but most people know how much overweight they are. Come on I mean if you know if you're 180 you know that somewhere between 80 and and for for meal you should be somewhere between 80 and 90 kilograms if you're 110 it's probably you have about 20 20 kilograms excess and how taking myself as an example you know how much overweight you are most people to know that. Yeah with respect to the resistance training sort of how it's tied to protein intake and increases in muscle mass and even strength would would be something I'm interested in because there have been some meta-analysis to fill-ups did a really nice one where they looked at protein increasing protein intake and increases in this lean body mass and then also strength and it was what kind of was striking to me and stood out to me was that with increasing amounts of protein so when you start to get up to like for younger people 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight was associated with a modest increase in muscle mass but it was very minor increase in strength and these were people that were doing resistance training and and the same went for for elderly um they started to actually have increases in muscle mass at a little bit lower there were 1.2 grams per kilogram body weight and it was the same thing modest increases in muscle mass and minor increases in strength and that's where I felt like I thought muscle mass strength was easier to gain with resistance training than muscle mass so I'm wondering is this something to do with the like measuring lean body mass or maybe just the resistance training program wasn't robust enough to improve strength. I mean so I think that the nutritional benefits from gaining muscle mass and strength depends on the availability of protein and the gaining of muscle mass of course and then also the capacity to do that training because they also interact of course but if you go back like hey the fed free mass could also be a little bit organ mass of course and so maybe some of that gain in fed free masses actually in the organs and on that cell in the muscle that's also possible but muscle mass and muscle strength are not that tightly regulated or not coupled if you think I mean you know that yourself if you go to the gym and you have never been there the first four five weeks you see that your strength goes up tremendously I mean you take that that pin and you put it on 20 kilograms in a week lady put it on 30 and four weeks lady put it on 40 and think this is awesome in ingin how much strength and I'm like am I gaining and then you're looking at mirror and I think like hmm nothing and my much as best been you've been changing I still look the same and then you don't get back to the gym anymore you just quit 90% of the people listening including myself that happens so the gain in strength is the first step the body tries to generate more strength with the stuff that it has and most of that is neuromuscular and then when the body constantly is being driven to do more than it once then it starts thinking like okay now it maybe becomes more efficient to build some extra muscle I mean it will be strange if the muscle starts building extra muscle simply because you over exert yourself once it's a very energy costly process to build more muscle so it takes a while so first you gain strength and then you actually follow up with more muscle so there's also a time relationship between the two also the other way around I mean when we become older we lose more strength then can be explained by the amount of muscle that we have lost so there's also a neuromuscular component and of course if you then start training these people first few weeks even months you don't see that much but the strength goes way up so those two things are not one-on-one it's not a proportional linear relationship can you give a little bit of a range in terms of maybe not exact because you might probably don't know but with respect to that time course so like when you start to do resistance training and your strength is going up like you said like how much longer of a lag before you start to perhaps visually see or even if you're measuring it can see increases in actual muscle mass yeah that depends on the type of training where you're coming from what your what your body mass is I mean you can hide the six-pack pretty well if you have a lot of excess fat of course so that really depends on the type of program that you do and then the body morph that you have okay when we can talk we can get into that a little bit more than I wanted to kind of continue on the nutrition part with with protein distributions you've done a lot of research in this area as well and I had done some some reading preparing for this podcast on like some of the nutritional surveys that are done in the United States called N-Hanes in terms of like how are people typically distributing their protein amongst their males and I think probably is very similar to what's found in Europe where people are eating the majority of their protein is skewed towards their evening meal they're last meal of the day and in most cases at least with respect to this N-Hane's data it's about three times the amount of protein in their and their evening meal versus their morning meal or even their afternoon meal does it matter with respect to how the muscle responds to amino acids throughout the day like it's a better to evenly have your protein evenly distributed or can you skew it in the evening and still have the same I don't want to just say increases in muscle protein synthesis because as you mentioned that doesn't always translate to gains in muscle mass people are more interested in gains in muscle mass so let's let's leave it with that endpoint so we try to make it more simple but it is actually much more complex but if you consider that a single meal containing 20 grams of our high quality protein maximizes muscle protein synthesis for up to four to six hours then it makes the most sense that every main meal throughout today is an antibiotic stimulus so that you would have 20 to 25 grams of protein in your breakfast 20 to 25 grams of protein in your lunch and 20 to 20 to 25 to 25 grams of protein in your dinner and then theoretically you have three antibiotic stimuli throughout today helping you to optimize muscle building and seeing muscle reconditioning I actually make that mistake all the time by saying that it's not about muscle building it's optimized muscle conditioning and I could be for the endurance athlete that would be better muscle to do a endurance type exercise for the body builder that might be a bigger muscle that's what now everybody is being advised for athletes that consume more than those 75 grams of protein then you can also add another meal moment and that's for example the pre-sleep evening snack for example if you exercise in the evening you take a protein rich snack after that exercise session in the evening and when you had dinner for example at four five or six and you have a training session between seven and nine you have a protein rich snack at nine before you go to bed at say 11 and so that's what a lot of athletes do just have a nice distribution to throughout today the long-term studies long-term semi long-term on nitrogen balance or on muscle protein synthesis are not that clear there's some studies saying you have better retention of your protein and all your nitrogen when you actually have a nice distribution but we've also have a recent study that we showed it if you have a huge meal you have a greater antibiotic response when you assess it over more prolonged period of time now a lot of people are now asking us like should I have one meal? No it's a study to show that the six hour or the four hour response to a single meal can be longer if you give more protein because all the protein still needs to be digested and absorbed but that doesn't change what I think now from all the evidence that we have it's being advised to have a nice even distribution of your protein in your main meals. So let's talk a little bit about that that studies and you brought it up because it was surprising to to many people maybe you can talk a little bit about the difference in terms of the quantity it was like a hundred grams of protein versus what has previously been shown maybe 30 I think grams of protein was something that's been shown in terms of maximizing now this was muscle protein synthesis that you were looking at. So the older studies does that's two basic two dose response studies that show in healthy young people at rest or after exercise 20 grams maximizes muscle protein synthesis for somewhere between four to six hours after the meal so in that time period for the six hour post-brandial period to be cold out. Some of that protein might not have been digested and absorbed if you give more than those 20 grams. So the 40 grams that they showed in those studies didn't show a great response but the only measured for four or six hours were depending. Now we wanted to do a study to show that if you gave a hundred grams which is absolutely not something that I'm suggesting if people should be consuming that it takes longer to digest everything and that you have a longer stimulation of muscle protein synthesis over a more prolonged period of time. So we also measured not over six hours but over 12 and even 20 for hours and then we see that you get a great response. Now the interesting part of this study is it's we also assessed digestion and absorption. Now that is difficult because how do you do this? Now instead of infusing traces only measuring the incorporation and muscle that's how you measure muscle protein synthesis, we actually did an experiment before that. We infused the cow with labeled amino acids. So you have amino acids with a chemical flag, stable isotope labeled, we infuse it in a cow the cow actually incorporated in the milk. So we have milk protein and we extract the milk, we extract the milk protein so we have milk protein where those labeled amino acids are incorporated. And then we provide that protein so we can see the digestion. We see those labeled amino acids coming out of the protein meaning released to the circulation. Then we take a blood sample, we can actually see those amino acids so we see how much of the protein that you ingest is released in the circulation and then we can even see how much is converted to muscle. And then you see that it takes much longer to get all those amino acids in the circulation and also to get a longest stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. So simply regard also the fact that time is a factor in all of this. But of course we most of us eat one meal and then for the six hours later the second meal and that's why all the previous studies always looked at for the six hour post-pandled periods. Unless it's your last meal of the evening. Good point. So the question then is if it's your last meal in the evening and you know let's say you've already distributed your protein intake fairly decently in your first two meals. Some people will talk about a minute, time or start eating in calico restriction but um and let's say you want to go a little higher for your maybe not all the way to 100 grams but you know 60 whatever. Then would you if you speculate on this and this kind of this there's two parts of this question. Would you think that the increase in muscle protein synthesis would be higher if you had ingested 60 grams of protein in that last meal versus 25 throughout the evening like we're talking like 12 to 20 hours and also what if you then wake up in the morning and then you have again your first meal is that going to change the muscle protein synthesis or are you better off having that meal higher? Are you going to get just are you really maximizing it? I love those questions because the the three questions that you know asked is probably seven years of my life. So what we so one of the things how I should start answering this is that we see a lot of people in the hospital losing muscle and so there admitted to hospital losing a lot of muscle let me know the loss of muscle or muscle mass is an important predictor of clinical complications, readmission, health etc. So we wanted to do something for patients to reduce muscle muscle loss. So we thought like if we give these just in line as with athletes if we give these elderly people another meal in the evening can we minimize muscle loss of stimulant muscle protein synthesis. Now when your an hospital is probably here the same thing you get your last meal about five to six o'clock in the evening and then the next meal is breakfast the next day at nine o'clock. So you spend more than 15, 16, 17 hours in an overnight fast at state which is maybe nice for for people trying to lose weight or anything like that but for people at risk of muscle muscle loss it's not a good thing. So we started thinking about if you give protein in the evening is it digested while you sleep does this all work while you sleep. Now that's difficult because you can't take muscle biopsies when somebody sleeps and not wake the person up and you also can't ingest protein while you're sleeping. So what we did is and that's when we started doing studies with the older people the great volunteers much better than most of the athletes that they call us and then they actually say, look I wasn't your lab last year can I come back have you have a new study running and then I would say something like, oh yeah you can come over what we'll do. We'll put a nasogastic tube down your nose in your guts. We'll take a muscle biopsy then we put you to bed in the hospital then a two o'clock at night while you're sleeping we'll tiptoe into your next to your bed put 40 grams of protein in your guts and I'm wake you up in the morning at seven o'clock with muscle biopsies and then they respond like, where can I sign a sign up or when can I come over. So these are cool studies but they showed that if you give 40 grams of protein in the evening that protein is digested and absorbed while you sleep because we use that intrinsic level protein so we could follow it and it's actually converted to muscle. Now that study was weird because when we published that that was a nice proof of principal study I got a lot of coaches and people calling me asking me where could they could buy those nasogastic tubes and I said like like, no this is a proof of principal study just have a protein rich snack in the evening so just to make that clear we actually followed that up with an at lead study where we show that having a protein rich snack in the evening is digested and absorbed and stimulates muscle-produced senses overnight and so that amount of protein will help you reconditioning more efficiently. That's the first answer to your question to your first first question. Now the second was, is it of benefit on top of knowing that you'll have breakfast and lunch the next day so we also did that study we provided protein in the evening or we didn't provide protein in the evening and looked at the response to breakfast. Now response to breakfast in both conditions was exactly the same to my surprise because I expected if you gave a large protein the evening before then the response to breakfast would be minimized but it wasn't. It was exactly the same so it does give me some insight that at least in the first twenty-four hours you have a greater benefits when you provide sufficient protein to maximize the reconditioning. What about people so time restricted eating you mentioned a lot of people are do practice time restricted eating and they're eating in an eight-hour window and they're fasting for 16 hours and you've done some research in this area as well. So can you eating that that large evening that large protein bolus with your last meal, you know, what if it's earlier and it's not like right before sleep because you have your your feeding window you're eating window and then you have your fasting window. Do you think based on your you're studying with a 100 grams of protein really extreme case that that protein will be digested longer and incorporated into muscle from muscle proteins synthesis. So based on the theory that you need an metabolic stimulus every every main meal in order to get the optimal twenty-five hour response then you would actually have to conclude that intermittent fasting of time restricted feeding is not a good thing. But we've done a study a more longer term study and we've recorded that with labeled water and she did that when in Melbourne where I had a visiting professorship position there and we didn't see a difference in muscle protein synthesis with the time restricted eating versus the non-time restricted feeding. So it's possible the explanation is that if you have a period where it is less or there's no food intake but you had a greater meal as the last one that actually also had a greater response over a more prolonged period of time just like the 100 grams study. So it's possibly that that evens it out. The other big question is of course why would you do time restricted eating or intermittent fasting? The other thing on that study was we didn't see difference over that project I should say is we didn't see a difference in fat loss. So and I have a lot of people calling me and saying like but the time restricted eating intermittent fasting. Meedy works for me. Now I did it myself as well and it works really well. Why? Because in the morning I go to work. I don't think about food because on too busy and everybody's just walking into my office by around four o'clock I get a little bit back as show I start eating something and then I get home around six and on around seven I open up to computer to see what crap emails I got and then I start having my main meal and snanking. If I decide to not eat after six I will eat much less than I actually require so I'll lose weight. So basically because more than 70% of my energy intake is after seven o'clock at night time restricted eating would be great for me but if I would eat all the food that I would eat after seven throughout the day I would lose or I would not lose that fat loss and I would not lose weight. So it's a good way for people to cope with the lower energy intake. Right I think there's now been many, many studies that have done that have found that people naturally doing time restricted eating you know when they're free living conditions on average reduce their calorie intake by about 200 calories per day and and that's just you know natural because people don't snack or they don't eat that dessert or they skip you know because they are trying to restrict their their meals into a shorter time period. But and I think you've even shown this and other studies many studies are shown while if you do keep calories the same you will not lose fat free mass and weight. Right. Then glucose the glucose homeostasis is still improved by not eating in a huge you know like by restricting your time eating window shorter to let's say eight hours you know in some cases 10 but mostly eight even shorter than that six hours. There are there are people also that are very interested in their glucose homeostasis that you know want to eat within a shorter time window as well. But the question then goes is well if they're skipping meals or skipping snacks then there potentially skipping protein intake. Right. If someone is doing in the time restricted eating schedule whether eating within an eight hour window then they really do need to make sure they're they're not losing their they're protein correct. Yes and so if they maintain their normal protein intake then they should be fine because it's possible that more protein per meal has a greater effect like the hundred grams. But the other part is also I mean let's not I mean it's it's funny but we always end up talking about nutrition and then we don't talk about the physical activity because I mean the same thing when people ask me like what should I eat to lose weight and I always say less because there is no magic bullet but the physical activity we know from all hyperclawic diets that if you actually are on a hyperclawic diet that two sessions of resistance exercise try to weak prevents the lean mass loss. So maybe instead of focusing on the protein focus on physical activity in order to maintain your fat free mass by doing two resistance exercise sessions a week much more important than the protein. So let me refer as a my question for someone who is doing time restricted eating in an eight hour window fasting for 16 hours and they're engaged in resistance training at least three times a week minimum and they're taking in their protein they're not they're not missing their protein. And they gain and they're doing the resistance training. And yes can they gain muscle mass can they gain it? Yes. Yes okay. That's so absolutely yes I mean there's even studies that so again point eight grams of protein you can actually gain muscle on point eight grams of protein maybe you can gain more muscle on one point two but you can still gain muscle on the point eight grams protein, pecure, and body mass per day the body is much smarter than we think. If you actually do exercise and we ingest the same protein that we can track throughout the body we see that the same amount of proteins of course that gested and absorbed but more goes to the lack that it exercise. So it is also an efficiency effect. Physical activity makes you more of what you just ate so more of the protein is actually converted when you perform physical activity so the body gets smarter how it handles protein. I have a question so if we were talking about protein distribution and perhaps you know it being beneficial to more evenly distribute protein but how does physical activity because you said physical activity sensitizes I mean you're you said it sensitizes muscle two amino acids. How does that does that change whether I mean you would think that in the background of someone who's physically active does all these other little differences matter? I think so I mean all of those little things that matter I mean to get a look at the cyclist it's the bike it's the helmet it's the it's the it's the nutrition it's the it's the training it's the mental coaching and all of this together make the better edlet so it's all these small things but so what is interesting to see is that you have an antibiotic response defeating you have an antibiotic response to exercise you have an antibiotic response a greater antibiotic response when you compare it to. Now the nice thing is that I think number question number one the most good the question I was of being asked the most is do I need to take the protein before or after the exercise session which is almost the same question you are asking should I do the exercise before the meal or after the meal is basically also the same thing it doesn't really matter that much because exercise makes the muscle more sensitive to the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis through food intake but it does so for up to 24 to even 48 hours so if you do an exercise session today your response to breakfast tomorrow morning will be greater but also lunch tomorrow afternoon and also dinner tomorrow night and so after that you have your second exercise session so it's not about what should go first but it's a consistency of training and meals in between and the training will make your meals more efficient in how they optimize muscle reconditioning. Well the thing that's so interesting about this recent study that you published on the higher dose of protein and that being appropriate in the muscle is so if you have that 24 hour animal look window as you're saying and you're going to be more sensitive to amino acids throughout that 24 hours of course then every meal so if you have you know 10 meals on the extreme end okay every 10 you know 10 times of protein you're going to be sensitive to that protein because it's still within that 24 hour window however if you don't have time because you're working as you said to eat three or four or five meals throughout the day it's also nice to know that you can go a little further than 30 grams in those let's say three meals and perhaps still get a similar amount of muscle protein synthesis in fact let me ask you to speculate let's say a person with did two people or the same person and you did across over study what they do both conditions they're they're doing their resistance training their anabolic windows 24 hours they're sensitive to the amino acids the first time they're eating you know let's say 80 grams of protein they're doing that within five meals or they're going to do it within three do you think they'll have the same amount of gains and muscle mass um this is I mean this is cool study but I think if those differences there will be too small to pick up that's one if you would have each of those meals would have 20 grams so it depending on total protein intake if you do for example five times 20 or two times 50 that makes sense I don't think you'll find any difference there if you would do I would be more less sure about my case if you would do 20 times five grams versus three times 233.3 okay that may be maybe there's a difference that you don't reach that so so called loose-intreshold but to be honest if there's the day before there's physical activity a good training session if the lags involved I'm not so sure whether we would be able to pick up a difference there okay so it is it is yeah speculation is essentially it you know sounds like certainly in the context of training in the background that you can skew your protein somewhat with yes your meals and and and still not be missing out on what you otherwise would gain in muscle mass. I'm not but I'm worried about that but don't miss that training session. Absolutely that's the essential thing that's the that's the baseline. Right. You have to get the more people talk about nutrition the less they're actually doing the training that's really cool. I know it's true it's absolutely true and I do we're going to I would I'd like to continue on the nutrition because you've done so much research research in this area but I want to get to the training but we've been talking about protein like this general thing like protein and so there's food sources of protein there's supplemental sources of protein there's plants sources of protein meats versus the protein so I was kind of wanting to start maybe with just let's talk about animal sources because most people are eating meat and fish and poultry and dairy yes like how in terms of you know skeletal muscle protein synthesis in terms of gaining muscle mass if you're having the same amount of protein on a gram basis from food versus a protein shake and it probably will depend on the type of protein shake but is there going to be differences in gains and muscle mass? Not measurable but of course I mean if you assess muscle protein synthesis if you get whole foods in from from a animal based you might get a little bit more sluggish response saying the increase in circulating essential amino acids and loosening in particular will be less rapid than when you actually ingest say 300 mills of a protein shake with the protein isolate or the protein concentrate but we will never be able to to actually pick up those differences because they will be very very very minimal but now we're talking about meat that is cooked eggs that are cooked because then we see that actually digestion and absorption is very rapid and we see almost the same increase in essential amino acid loosening them when you get the isolatory concentrate okay so of course there's differences because if you're eating food you're getting vitamins and minerals and fatty acids and all the other important micronutrients and macronutrients that are required for and if you have these these products are coming in a combined meal because that's typically something that as much less the research being done was starting to do that now but it's often complicated because then you have all these different products coming together you have antinutriitional factors I don't like to term antinutriitional factors but that's what they call them but you have fibers you have more energy so your gastric emptiness reduced so everything gets more sluggish and then it gets more difficult to compare stuff so so it always depends whether you have your protein isolate or concentrate whether you have your whole food product or you have that whole food product in a meal that will change the dynamics of digestion and absorption and therefore also direct impact on muscle protein synthesis but when you say sluggish I mean you do just mean to lead it's essentially those amino acids will get to the muscle but it'll take longer okay well in that sense I mean we're talking the absolute sense gains and muscle mass then it doesn't really make a difference if you're doing the animal source we're talking about animals for a day yeah yes because if I mean if it's sufficient if it's 20 grams you'll get above a certain threshold and you'll definitely have the full antibiotics signaling that you expect and okay but of course people are also interested in not getting there if they're doing caloric restriction and and basically trying to change their body composition protein shakes can help with that if they're lower in calories lower in fat and then you're getting your protein without the other so it's worth it so so I always advise people to get most of the nutrients from their diet and not from supplements as well discuss this funny but what is interesting sometimes sports nutrition or supplements can be used to make it more practically feasible to and I always use for students and I use the example is for example a sports drink the sports drink gets you the carbohydrates during exercise you can also do that with a plate of spaghetti but it's not that easy to cycle on the bike when you have a plate spaghetti in front of your front of your nose so it's an easier way to get the nutrients you need in a setting that is sports specific now if you're in a gym and you want to take a certain amount of protein and you don't want to make a short short meal and you want to restrict calories yeah then sometimes the protein shake is easy easier is there a difference with respect to the source of protein supplements so for example if it's sourced from casing versus wave versus egg white protein with respect to we're talking about skeletal muscle proteins synthesis and presumably increases the muscle mass so this is stuff that we see the whole intrinsic labeled cows to the cow infusion getting intrinsic labeled milk and we extracted the way and casing in order to show the diet the digestion and absorption kinetics and also the capacity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis now we've done these studies years ago and that shows that my cell like acin is a slow-need adjustable protein so the increase in circulating essential amino acids in the blood is more sluggish than when you ingest wave protein which is more rapidly digestible protein and so the wave protein gets or is more rapidly digested greater increase the muscle protein synthesis and also has a greater antibiotic response greater increase the muscle protein synthesis now we thought that's maybe only because of the more rapid digestion and absorption so we hydrolyzed the casing make it more rapidly digestible so it was just as easily digested and absorbed as the way but it still had the lesser response so that might be due to the lesser amount of loose-seem in casing than in way way has a higher loose-seem content I mean now the loose-seem is a is a is a is a is a is a is a is an amino acid that has very strong signaling properties so it stimulates the enthalpy and therefore it sets off the whole antibiotic cascade and we also double check that by adding free loose-seem on the casing and we got a greater response so in short we know that the antibiotic potential of a protein is related to the rate of digestion and absorption and the amount of at least the amount of loose-seem in combination with other amino acids and that's the whole basis of why way is more popular with athletes than a casing but the difference is of every small and so for practice in combination with diets and throughout the whole day all the food that you eat it's very minimal but of course I mean I ride a bike that is only 9 kilos but I might have actually 15 kilograms of overweight so I could actually do with a much heavier bike but I still want the fastest bike and the lightest bike and so people want the best supplement doesn't make that much of a difference I don't think so that much sitting upright while you eat or actually chewing well has also a huge effect on the rate of digestion and absorption so but these differences exist but these the difference are very small if you compare milk, a way or egg protein oh egg white as well egg is also a great great from a from a amino acid composition and also digestion and absorption it's great so if you're talking about in the real world here you think maybe to most people those differences aren't so important to some they are like the ones that are really optimizing every just little thing but what about in the context of research and and you know data that's not like you compare studies and some of these casing and then you got way and then you know then they're time when they do it maybe the casing had an all of you know been absorbed so conflicting data I mean methodological differences seems like it might so so all of these things so we're scientists we're trying to figure out what are all the aspects that define digestion and absorption and the capacity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis what we call post-presential protein handling and so we want to know with which factor's play a role but all of of course in a normal situation you have all these factors together you have protein quality in what matrix that protein is being ingested from a food or a meal how that protein is processed how you eat it and even the body position in which you eat and so these are all these different things and now one of the studies that we've done for example is eat eggs or eat eggs in a boiled form or in a raw form now this is also a little bit of a joke not a joke but I everybody knows those knows the rocky movies and of course there's some guys in our lab that love these these movies and I was actually growing up with those movies so you see rocky getting up at five o'clock in the morning and he gulping down like five raw eggs and then he does a straining session now I thought it would be fun to actually see whether instead of having a nature paper whether we could have a paper with sliced alone as a co-author so basically what we did we did a study to see whether digested and absorption and muscle protein synthesis after ingesting raw eggs versus cooked eggs now what is really nice to see have exactly the same protein but cooking actually denaturest the protein and results in much more rapid release of these amino acids in the circulation and theoretically that should also lead to a greater muscle protein synthesis but we provide sufficient eggs so probably the total amount of protein was sufficient to maximize the response so on muscle protein synthesis it was exactly the same so of course I send it off to to severe stulones hold my dress but never got a response unfortunately so we couldn't make me go over but the title is still was rocky right or wrong should you boil your eggs and yes boiling is one of the one of the one of the issues same thing as consuming how you consume your food we did study sitting a brighter lying down which is of course very relevant for people in the hospital because a lot of people are being fed lying down but sitting upright actually stimulates gastric emptying so the protein actually gets faster you know digest that just the system you get a faster release and circulating amino acids and therefore a greater stimulation of muscle protein synthesis chewing same thing we infused the cow with label the amino acids for a Dutch person it's hard to accept that only 25% of your expensive trace are going to the milk so we butcher the cow so suddenly we had intrinsic label meat we provided subjects we if that meat provided as minced meat or as a steak huge difference in the rate of digestion and absorption so also chewing and cutting up your food's important fact now are these important so you're when you say that it's a greater stimulation in the skeletal muscle protein synthesis at the time you measure it but will they normalize eventually over time so that it's less of a difference in the real world more of a difference in the lab in terms of when you're saying I think in the long run it increases the efficiency by which the protein is being used for muscle and tissue protein synthesis but of course it becomes less relevant when you consume enough protein it becomes more relevant when you total food intake is very low so for example people that do not resist in sex size because they're lying in bed and they are hurting and they actually anabolic resistance because they also have inflammation and subsys and they can't eat food and they can't chew and they can't sit upright then all these factors come together and they have a very dangerous situation and then having all these little specs will greatly improve probably their health for the healthy person that already consumes a huge load of protein then those difference quality doesn't become so I always liked to put it this way you can compensate for quality by greater quantity and that's what every Adley already does because he or she needs to consume more food because he's more active as a high energy expenditure comes more important on the other scale. That's it's good to differentiate that. I want to kind of shift back and talk about the protein sourced because we've talked about the animal sourced we've talked about supplemental sources of protein from animal products but there's also a large percentage of people that are vegetarian vegan don't consume any animal products. So maybe you can tell people a little bit about the differences between food sources plant sources of protein versus animal sources of protein. So first and then again I have to make the difference between whole foods protein isolates and protein concentrate so if you want to consume protein through plant-based foods so beans let us not whatever is it's more difficult to get a certain amount of protein in if you want to just 20 grams of protein through eating meat 70 grams of of meat if you want to get 20 grams of protein in by eating potatoes you have to eat more than a kilogram of potatoes. So first of all it's just more difficult to get the same amount of protein in if you actually consume it as whole foods and then when you consume it at whole foods most plant-based foods have anti-nutritional factors so the capacity for you to extract that protein through your body is less so the digestibility is lower. Those are the two issues when you when you have plant-based foods. Now nowadays I'm much of the research has looked at the proteins that are actually in-planned-based foods extracted those proteins and then a assessed the capacity to stimulate most protein synthesis. Has been done for some proteins like weed protein, soy protein, a large pea protein, about five different proteins that that we and others have actually assessed and then some of them actually some of these studies show a lesser capacity to stimulate most protein synthesis when compared to an equivalent amount of mostly dairy protein. That might be attributed to the fact that there's less losing, less essential amino acids and sometimes most of the plant-based proteins are deficient in one of more specific amino acids that's often methyene and elicine. The last five years we have been trying the protein extracts from pea and gluten and corn and actually if we give in healthy subjects we give 30 grams which is quite a lot of protein we don't see a difference with with dairy protein. So if you give sufficient of the protein of the protein extract where digestibility is high that's not much that much difference in muscle protein synthesis. However if you would take it from a plant-based foods then on a certain equivalent amount of protein less of that protein becomes available and that is of course then you have to compensate for that a little bit. So vegans that are interested in gaining muscle mass obviously preserving muscle mass but also gaining muscle mass with their resistance training programs they can supplement with protein plant-based protein powder sources that will allow them to on a gram program basis especially if it's a high enough dose gain the same muscle mass as someone doing let's say animal-based protein supplements. I think so so not necessarily after the supplements supplements is probably easier they can also compensate for less equality by greater quantity but then you have to consume a huge amount of foods and of course you improve the quality of your protein sources by having a very diverse palette of plant-based foods. So if you really know what you're doing from an nutrition perspective diet that is perspective then I think it's quite capable doing that on a vegan diet but it's more difficult and of course if you start using plant-based protein isolates or plant the rice protein such as you'd say it gets easier. And what about so you mentioned P protein is which you looked at in your studying compared to the dairy when 30 grams and 30 grams are really different since you have this relative muscle protein synthesis. What about so is P protein different from rice protein in terms of its amino acid composition is there a protein powder that's better perhaps for vegans that are interested in increasing their their muscle mass. So so we we we we basically years ago we looked at all the commercially available protein extracts so protein plant-based plant derived proteins and then you see that some of them are actually low and loose in but some just as corn is actually higher and loose in the most animal derived proteins. So not all plant-based proteins are the same but the deficiencies in lysine and methionine is also one protein can be very deficient in methionine the other one is actually deficient in lysine but not in methionine. So there's not one specific protein that I would say that one is the best but you can you can mix up and blend different plant-based proteins that actually together have a very nine nice protein balanced amino acid profile. So combinations are great what we expected from our studies with the individual proteins that they would actually show a lesser response and that by adding some milk protein we would actually compensate for that but in all those proteins like to be protein we actually did not find a lesser muscle protein synthetic response but I do need to note that we did that with 30 grams of a protein extract so you don't have to digestibility. What would be so you mentioned lysine and methionine maybe you can explain to people why those are also important you mentioned the looseine and how that stimulates M2R and that's important for muscle protein synthesis but why is the lysine and methionine important and then maybe also why would what would be a good combination of plant source protein powders perhaps to get all those like you said P protein is there's something else in combination with P that would cover all the bases. Yeah so one of the things I mean some amino acids may have strong assignaling properties but of course if you're trying to build a protein you need all the building blocks all the different building blocks and that includes methionine and lysine of course so you need sufficient of all the amino acids. Now you can actually take blends with and we use the blend with three different blend-based proteins and that worked fine but you also see that some combinations for example ones low and methionine and other one low and lysine they actually make nice blends and funny enough if you start looking at those proteins then you're suddenly realized that all over the world people are consuming meals that actually have proteins that are very nicely composite or matching and so when I saw those data the first times I've suddenly realized why if the heater actually has beans in it so the wheat and the beans is actually a nice complement the core complementary amino acid the amino acid mix so it's really funny if you see that and somewhere people have actually noticed that or speed and stuff and then sprouting I think also some of that you can get sprouted keen-woss or supporting where it's getting way some of the as you mentioned like some of these antinutritional components the fiber matrix that are you know in some cases other lektons and they're sort of inhibiting some of the absorption of protein what about is protein isolate versus concentrate which one is is the better to consume protein isolate for higher protein I would prefer the product where the protein actually is in so not even the isolate or the concentrate but then if you're using a supplement and you want to take the pure protein then you can take the isolate that are concentrated the isolate does only depriting the concentrate is basically yeah the concentrated protein so it still has other stuff like for milk protein concentrate it still has lektos in it and still has some some other stuff some fat in there so yeah is one better than the other depends on what you're aiming for what you're nutrient targets are basically yeah if someone's interested in lower fat content and more protein content yeah then you would go for an isolate of course protein isolate okay so you we've talked about loosing and you know how it's it's very important for activating m2er can you talk a little bit about the loosing threshold and how resistance training physical activity changes that loosing threshold yeah so the if you ingest 20 grams of protein you see a strong robust increase in muscle protein synthesis that beaks around three hours after meal and then it wears off in about five or five or five six hours now one of the factors in that response is loosing the postbandial increase in circulating loosing sets of nanabolic pathway in the muscle and is responsible for that stimulation of muscle protein synthesis 20 grams for wave protein that will be about two grams of two to three grams two to and a half grams of loosing so you can also give that as free loosing or as the branch enemy know us and we've done that as well we also also see that very strong increase in muscle protein synthesis first to hours but then it wears off much more rapid so you need the loosing to stimulate the process but then you also need a sufficient supply of all the amino acids to allow muscle protein synthesis to continue to continue for a while so it's a double ram you it's both the signaling and supplying enough of the building blocks and that's that's the loosing threshold now exercise reduce it makes that like we said before exercise makes the muscle more sensitive to the anabolic properties of protein feeding so it reduces your loosing thresholds so with a lesser increase in loosing you would actually get a greater muscle protein synthesis and of course how I translated is when you perform physical activity the muscle is more interested in having enough building blocks than the signaling process because the signaling process has already been activated by the exercise so here's another question for you I know that exercise causes branch chan amino acids like loosing to be taken up into skeletal muscle like from circulation so in elucing these amino acids are doing lots of things in multiple tissues you know it's going into the brain it's going to transports into the brain for example but the exercise is causing causes loosing more loosing to be taken up into skeletal muscle so does that I don't know if it's proper to even call it the loosing threshold but like can you then take in more loosing and get it more into the muscle where it's like we're used to be like oh after three grams or whatever then you're not going to really do much more do you think exercise would in a way almost make it where you could consume even more loosing how you if I if I actually understand what you're saying you're suggesting that the exercise induced lowering of the loosing threshold is potentially at least partly explained by greater loosing influx in the muscle yeah that's possible well it kind of it leads me to this next question that has to do with cardiovascular disease and I'm sure you saw this this headline that claimed high protein diets it was an animal study that claimed getting 22% of your calories from protein was going to cause atherosclerosis there was some some human data in that study looking specifically and identifying they identified loosing as a major driver of this because loosing in circulation activates macrophages which are one part of a store of the bigger larger story antherosclerosis I was wondering what your thoughts are on I know it's not your study but on high protein diets high I mean first of all can you even translate that sort of study to humans when you're you know consuming 22% of your calories from protein and that's causing atherosclerosis probably wouldn't would not have seen the study and but it was actually an outpapers and I did get already some some some questions about it from from the from the general media if I remember correctly is I think the title of that paper was not that suggestive but all the follow-up reports on that paper were extremely suggestive and absolutely not in line with the the outcome of the results in that study so what they did is they provided they fire a member correctly they provided two meals or two drinks or something with a high protein content and a low protein content in humans and then they took blood samples for I don't know a few hours after that meal and then they actually took the the monocides I think so the macrophages in the blood and they saw that they actually were activated and then they they did an in fetro study to see which factor was actually stimulating M2 the M2 pathway in those macrophages and I was losing the could have imagined that and it's a very very tissue and then they gave a high protein diet and a low protein diet to rodents and they saw also activation of the macrophages and that was suggestive of them developing after years chlorosis yes and I think they had some other markers about arthritis process as well but yes but so first of all we're not rodents and then the few hours of circulating amino acids is not reflective of what happens over days over twenty four hours over weeks over months in the development of hot airs close in the human so I think that the translation is a little bit over the top and that's an end statement um it's with all these things high protein is not causing any issues high fat is not causing any issues high glucose or high carbohydrates not causing issues when it's only high and not excess and that's a different difference the most the greatest problems with chronic metabolic disease is excess excess energy in the form of glucose excess energy in the form of fat excess energy in the form of of protein it's all bad and we have we have all the mechanisms have been shown for glucose fatty acids and amino acids in for example inducing insulin resistance if you oversupply anutrients at some point you become resistant to it and that and then the body doesn't know what to do with it and you get issues if your milkman comes by with every day with two bottles of milk and your only drink one it's not going to cost a lot more days before you start calling him to bring you less milk that's what your muscle also does at some point it says like hey it can't store more because this storage is hurting me so it's not about high glucose or high fat or high protein it's excess is the problem right and and that's where exercise and physical activity is key because you are not only you know I mean most the time your you are of course you know burning energy so you can consume more but you are your muscles taking up glucose it's taking up the protein it's taking up loosening so it's not in circulation activating macrophages right so the exercise and and there's even been studies that have looked at for example you know people that are consuming meat versus you know vegan source of protein and and how you know cancer mortality's higher in these meat eaters it's all cause mortality's higher in meat eaters but when you then do a subgroup analysis and you say okay I only want the meat eaters that have no unhealthy lifestyle factors so they're not sedentary they're not overweight obese they're not smoking and they're not consuming excess alcohol I was alcohol guess what their cancer mortality and all cause mortality was the same as people consuming the plant protein so if you are going to be unhealthy and obese and sedentary and smoke perhaps you shouldn't eat a lot of protein 22% of your your calories shouldn't be coming from from protein but but certainly when you're physically active and your healthy you're not overweight and obese you're not smoking it's probably it's probably shouldn't be worried about getting athlete's grossest by eating protein. No and sometimes people miss it miss it into interpret data of course I mean you can say something like hey having a very high heart rate is not good but body you then exercise because that makes your heart rate go up but then your resting heart rate goes down so it's if you have to get the full picture to understand I mean you challenge the body I mean exercises I mean I can I can make a statement I mean I can make a marketing statement that the worst thing to do for the body is actually doing exercise you cause inflammation you cause oxidative stress it's really bad for you it increases heart rate but actually it sets off the whole process that makes you healthier so just looking at what happens with one meal is not giving you the full picture what it does for health. I agree context matters and 100% and that's really important to keep in mind and it's often the observational data and animal data that loses that kind of. I like the the the the discussions of course of hypicoloring diets and overeating and under eating in the light of animal experiments. I mean we know that a lot of times when you have rodents in a cage and you give them at libertine foods they actually over consume I mean we would do the same thing if you actually sitting in a room and they're bringing you constant just warm cross-hons and everything you're going to overeat so the animals do that as well and then they give them a hypicoloring diet or they eat they give them less food and then they're healthier that's not necessarily that the hypicoloring diet was actually making them healthy it is that the control trial is actually unhealthy and we are that only control trial. Yeah I completely agree I mean it's yeah that it's it's so different when you're talking about a mouse and a cage that's sedentary and not act physically active it's so hard to compare that sort of study to a physically active person you know as well. But that brings us back to requirements I mean what are your real requirements because you pure on definition if they tell me like look what will happen if I eat 20% 25% less energy than I need. They're you die but people become healthier when they eat 25% less but that's something else that is they they it's not that they and eating 25% less than they need they eating 25% less than what they are actually used of consuming and that's a huge difference between those two and that's what we often of course we don't want to see because that makes our life more difficult. Right they're baselines are different. Talking about resistance training adaptations you know this is another area that you've done a lot of research and can you tell people a little bit about muscle memory and how the muscle adapts to repeated about resistance training. Yeah so the so the idea is that every exercise training in juices stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown so your reconditioned muscle to become a better athlete and a next session and next session next session. Of course the additional value of each session becomes less because we we can't keep improving so that is a leveling off of that adaptation. Now that's in short what training is that every individual bout sets off this this remodeling and the remodeling becomes more efficient over time and you become a better athlete. Now the muscle memory is an interesting one because then now people suggest like okay you haven't done anything for 10 years and then you start exercising and then somebody that actually was a very good athlete builds up and becomes a much more rapidly increases this is is is condition again while the other one doesn't get the same gains. Now is that muscle memory and if there is such a thing as muscle memory where is it residing? Now that's difficult because then you actually there's a lot of explanations one it could be genetics that that person was already more active in the past because he was more prone to being a better athlete that's a possibility. Secondly that there's also something you're a muscular that's somebody picks up the exercise much easier and then gets a bit bigger gains. It could be genetics but then then yeah genetics on methylation of different proteins and it could also be and that's what they're now discussing and Tim snowsing our labs actually doing a lot on that topic is seeing whether the number of nuclei in the muscle are maintained to be increased so it's easier for the muscle to adapt to exercise. Now there's some rodent data to suggest that we don't find evidence for that in human muscle so that you basically have more managers in your muscle fibers that when you put a greater stress on it's more easily managed so it's so far we haven't seen that so so generally we've seen that the myocard content and myocard domain actually nicely follows exercise training and it's not like it's completely different from somebody that actually did a lot of exercise in 20 years ago. Now you've also done some been involved in some research looking at exercise frequency and I mean I get presumably recovery is part of that that equation in terms of if you're frequently working out and doing resistance training is there a diminishing returns in terms of gaining muscle mass is there a frequency that can be done to maximize muscle growth and also recovery. Yes likely of course you will like to get the full recovery and then the next training session so you optimize the reconditioning process and what you do notice I mean depends on how young you are what training stage you are in if I mean I haven't seen a gym in last week but before that in a year or two or something like that and then you go to a gym and then you really notice that you need actually three days before you can actually get your next session and when you're really in it you actually train every day so depends on your training state your age your genetics what is your ideal version the only way to figure that one out is just try it there's no there's no one one rule to actually suggest that this is it. In terms of recovery like hot like if you're working you know certain muscle groups is it good to like wait 24 hours 48 hours is that still like a more of a personalized sort of sliding scale or it is personal. This personalized but of course you can increase your your session intensity by focusing on a specific group or upper body lower body or antagonist and agonist or something like that so you can exercise more frequently and have enough sufficient recovery time for each specific body part that's a way that that that at least use it to optimize recovery and maintain a high training load. There are you've you've published a study looking at in aging populations you did elderly but also I've seen it older adults and then also elderly so these are people like 85 years old and and you show they could have improvements in muscle mass and strength after engaging in a resistance training program. If there are some people out there who were you know older adults and elderly who perhaps want to start a resistance training program are there any sort of exercises that you think might be just you know beneficial to start with for improvements in muscle mass and strength. The first thing to say is that the turnover of muscle so the breakdown in the senses of muscle is something that occurs. I want to present the test we started off this this this podcast with and that is independent of age so also when you're 85 you still have on a daily basis you're making muscle and you're breaking down muscle and the only way to maintain it or increase it is to do exercise. Now the level of exercise depends on where you are at so if you're actually quite sedentary you have a lot of issues and you have difficulty getting up from the toilet then it might be more sense make more sense to basically have two or three sessions a day where you try to get up from the toilet three times simply on your own toilet in your own environment preferably with somebody to see that you're not falling whereas there's also very very fit elderly that will actually pick up resistance exercise and go to a gym three times a week. So nowadays with healthy aging it's very difficult to give advice because the variation that we see in the elderly I can we now are supposed to call the older population is huge. If we I mean in the post we got hip and knee surgery for people that were so in pain that it just wanted to have the pain to stop. Now we have older people coming in from new hips and you need to go to go skiing with the grandchildren. So the target set by the older population can be from staying in their own home being able to go to the toilet and support it and therefore not being institutionalized to 85 year olds that still want to do an eye in man. So of course the training has to fit with the targets being set and where they start off from. Yeah that makes sense. I have a question regarding women and their response to adaptations from resistance training either premenopausal versus postmenopausal or postmenopausal with or without hormone replacement therapy. So in other words how the adaptations change with you know estrogen and progesterone and testosterone more hormone to round. Yeah so as we get older and we get hormone distances balances then people feel differences but the efficacy by which training increases muscle mass and muscle strength and muscle conditioning doesn't seem to have a huge impact there so far I mean this is not my topic with but most of the studies if pre and postmenopausal women I believe and even with and without supplementation we see hardly any studies that I've seen don't show any differences. Now we have a lot of experience with prostate cancer patients so we've actually had a lot of prostate cancer patients on 80T so the first thing that happens when they are being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer is that they get energy and deficiency therapy so basically they get chemically castrated so that testosterone will be gone down just completely numb. These people generally gain fat mass, lose muscle mass and are at an heightened risk for cardiovascular disease and often develop also in some resistance and diabetes. Now we thought like hey how easy is it to increase or prevent the muscle loss to some extent we were we were modest in this with only like two resistance exercise sessions a week. We increased muscle mass, we increased strength. Contra group went down there was no loss there was actually an increase in muscle mass there was an increase in muscle strength so the hormones do not I'm not saying that the hormones don't play a role because hypergonatal men of course in general have less muscle but exercise can fully overcome the effects of hormonal changes. Exercise is much stronger than that. Yeah it's it's just it's so powerful. It is I mean we we had a lot of so we worked this of course with with with the department and we worked with the Alice's patients and we worked with prostate cancer patients and we see it every time and everybody just says like why don't don't we just put this in our adjuven therapy like you can go on ADT but ADT always goes together with resistance training. You have I mean the ADT is life saving but then all the negative effects of the ADT can be completely fully overcome with resistance exercise that's ridiculous. Why do we still have those effects if they're not necessary? So testosterone does play a role in the context of these people that are not physically active and and then they start to lose more muscle but you can you can basically attenuate that if you are you can't even attenuate so you can actually increase muscle mass is staying right. So it's it's greatly overexetrated that the hormonal changes can be overcome with resist sex science that's the most important. There's a saying that our mutual friends do Phillips says and I really like this saying is that exercise forgives a lot of sins and I'm seeing that recurring theme in you know not just exercise physiology but in other fields as well. I mean it's just sleep sleep deprivation being one. I mean insulin resistance goes up glucose dysregulation homestasis you know at a control but you know doing exercise mostly can rescue a lot of that even all cause mortality increases again physical activity really can forgive some of those some of those sins so it's really you know it's the best even if it's not sins I mean even if it's disease it can have so many benefits. I also think looking at it like I just called it a medicine but you know yes exercise is a treatment and that's like a a general saying you hear people say exercise is a good medicine but honestly I think sedentaryism is a disease. It's it's always just about to say this is this comes exactly back to the nutrition that we said like it's not excess carbohydrates not eggs of it's not the high carbohydrate it's not a high protein diet it's not a high fed diet it's excess and so and we talked about the animals overfeeding and that the control group is actually an unhealthy group we are unhealthy because we're not exercising enough we are actually to be developed where we actually need a physical activity in order to stay alive to forge your virus foods and to hunt and stuff like that and so it's not that maybe it's not the exercise is actually the benefit it's actually reducing our exactly what you're saying reducing our inactivity it's a disease I think you know obesity's disease that's an occupational hazard sedentaryism is a disease it's a disease right I mean so I do want to kind of shift gears because cold water immersion is an area that you have done research and and I'm personally interested in the neuroendocrine effects of cold water immersion a lot of physically active people are interested in using cold water immersion for recovery for enhancing sorry for a blunting inflammation of the muscle but you've shown and maybe you can talk about your study about you know doing cold water immersion immediately after resistant training can blunt some gains do you think the timing of cold water immersion can affect you know whether or not you're going to blunt those gains because you want you want to keep doing those cold showers yes I'm doing this as well so so yeah I mean I think I mean if looking at hard rate variability and stuff like that I mean I've been experimenting with that myself as well with the cold showers and the ice baths and but of course from a muscle perspective nothing makes sense on recovery after exercise that cold would actually be helpful so we did a study where we used the intrinsic level protein so we could track where the protein goes and acutely but also more long term and after exercise we put one leg in cold water and one in term in neutral water and we saw that the leg in the cold water did not get the same stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and basically less of the protein would actually go to the leg less profusion less stimulation of muscle protein synthesis so from at least for the first six hours it seems evident that acute recovery recovery in the light of muscle protein synthesis glycogen restoration is actually compromised by the by the lower temperature part of that is that because you enable profusion but also of course all the enzyme and all the process activity in the muscle is also reduced by a lower temperature because that's just what happens I was surprised that I thought like hey maybe then you compromised that acute recovery phase but then you maybe catch up later on when you warm up so that if you do this over two weeks it doesn't make any difference so we continue doing that for if I'm not not incorrect over two weeks with six training sessions and so it's six training sessions we've only up to about 15 minutes of cooling I thought that could never have an effect over those full two weeks and if there's an effect we wouldn't be able to pick it up but we did and over those two weeks total protein synthesis in that leg that received cooling compared to the other was actually less and actually measurable less so that six times 15 minutes cooling over two weeks 14 days, 24 hours had a negative impact on the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis my only conclusion is that the reconditioning is therefore not optimal now if you still want to do the cooling now the showers are only short but wouldn't be good to do it at different times I think so why is everybody then still doing the cold water immersion after exercise I think it came from from sports where you basically hurt the muscle that has massive inflammation where there's blunt force drama on the muscle that actually you you you basically support the muscle in recovery not recovering in the reconditioning but basically minimized the damage and then people started using it for other sports as well but I think for resistance training or for and human straining it's you shouldn't be using it at least not acutely after the exercise and you said something that I picked up on you said for six hours do you think that if you do cold water immersion and you wait six hours after resistance training that you would still affect muscle protein synthesis I mean pure speculation I think it would be less so but the other question is then for your your other benefits whatever they are of course there's also a lot of discussions on that do you need to do that 15 15 minutes is it better to do with the other day at least the first few hours I think are essential for the muscle I would stay away from the cold there is it okay to do it in the evening or the next day I would favor that as opposed to the other one so waiting for recovery days now you mentioned endurance training but you know there are studies showing that cold water immersion can enhance performance and endurance trainers and also enhance neuromuscular function you're talking about that probably not as these people aren't you know the resistance training is really stimulating muscle so I'm wondering if you could do it perhaps on an endurance training day maybe wait a few hours again I think we would have found exactly the same thing if we had done endurance training so this was resistance training I think if we had done endurance training you would also have less of your amino acids that you ingest go to the muscle I mean a lot less of all this kind of work has been done after endurance training but it seems to follow all the same principles it's just a different sets of proteins that are being expressed to a greater or less extent after endurance versus resistance exercise but it also response to nutrition and so they should also be responsive to blood flow to the muscle so I think it doesn't make a difference for endurance or resistance type exercise the studies that I've seen is they either show no effect and if they show effect it studies where it's not endurance exercise it's actually high intensity intermittent type exercise where there's also a huge damage effect and inflammation and I think there it can have a benefits to dampen that down and then it keeps performance afterwards is less compromised but that's something else then optimizing your training reconditioning right yeah so you're talking more at the elite level whether really like the roars or the you know these these runners that are that are you know they're incurring more damage on their muscle so if the the cold water immersion is causing basic constriction it's it's preventing the muscle profusion right the question is how long does that last so the nor up enough for is the hormone that is regulating that as you know and that does go up even after just you know two minutes in cold so the question then goes well how long does that last so like you know is it an eight hour response that you think it would be eight hours that it's going to be affecting I have no idea in this case I mean temperature at least skin temperature was already quite normal quite fast but the response of of a six hours was still visible so I mean these studies are hard to do because then if you actually would do it this way I would like to take a biopsy at 24, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22 and 24 hours and of course nobody wants to this not even the older subjects in our studies are going to sign up for that or at the very least it would be interesting to do a cold water immersion where it's not immediately after resistance training it's you know oh yeah I mean that's that would be great eight hours maybe the next day if we would do it at two week in the fensions study where you actually have the three sessions and the and the notice six training sessions and you have the six cooling sessions and you have the six cooling sessions on the days that you don't have the training so you have three treatments six training sessions with cooling six sessions with cooling on the other day and only the six six training without cooling at at a huge study but I mean I'll be interested to see what comes out after two weeks yeah I guess I guess the question is is that you know if you if you're doing resistance training and you wait six to eight hours after that training will that cold water immersion blunt your gains you said maybe a little bit maybe not it will likely be less if you do it on the opposite day so waiting just on a recovery day is it's the same as best okay but I mean you I mean that's the the whole thing we always focus on muscle but everything has to be optimal I mean it's the same as oh you can take rating and you get stronger legs and you have a higher workload but then if you're a high jumper and you gain 1.2 kilos and simply also by most of it actually what a retention it's not going to improve your high jumping so it's more than only muscle of course of course yeah I want to shift gears and talk about collagen last because you've also been getting involved in some of this research and I'm I'm very you know interested in in hydrolyzed collagen powder for skin for example in skin aging and so I wanted to ask you if you think there are effects on supplemental hydrolyzed collagen powder that are independent of the muscle connective protein which I think if I'm correct does not have a huge amount of collagen but do you think there are effects and maybe other tissues like the joints skin for example bone so collagen is nowadays is much seen as a potential supplement to support muscle conditioning and of course we were interested from that perspective we often look at my fibro protein which is the contract contractile proteins in the muscle of course because that's what generates the force but you have to understand that the force that is generated by the contractile proteins has to be transferred towards your tendon and your bone in order to make movement possible and so the muscle has an all intricate network of connective proteins that allow the contractile apparatus to be transferred to throughout the whole muscle in both longitudinal as well as transversal way towards the tendon in the bone and there's now suggestions that strength is very much dependent on the quality of that connective protein network and in muscle that is a lot of it is collagen but if we get a fraction of the muscle is the connective proteins and of those connected proteins about 5% is collagen and so we were interested to see where the collagen ingestion will actually stimulate that specific fraction in muscle now so far studies have not shown increase in muscle protein synthesis when you ingest collagen now why could that be the case because it responds to high quality protein but not to collagen. Collagen is from a amino acid composition not a very high quality protein because almost 50% is composed of of protein and glycine and so it has a lot less essential amino acids and so if you give collagen protein you generally don't see it increase in mixed muscle proteins we've done a study to see where the increases connective protein in muscle we don't see it at least not with the 20 grams or the 30 grams of amounts why would it work or why would it have an effect because the suggestion is and that's the story behind it does actually two stories one is that collagen has a lot of glycine and probably and of course collagen is composed in your body also a lot of glycine and maybe it does not allow of those amino acids in our food in our nutrition but of course it doesn't matter that it actually increases muscle protein synthesis so now we've tried it now like three studies and so far we have not shown evidence that collagen increases connective tissue protein synthesis in muscle but yeah I have to admit that the muscle fraction is only very small amount of collagen so what about other tissues gotlich bone tendons ligaments which is more than 80% collagen maybe there it's more relevant and maybe even more relevant when you had surgery and you basically yourself you have to reattach everything you have to renew all those collagen structures maybe there it is a benefit not there's also people suggesting that in collagen and especially hydrolyzed collagen there's functional or peptides that are bioactive, bioactive peptides so far we haven't seen anything of that as always discussions like what are those peptides then haven't seen any any data to convince me yet and of course it is not that the amino acids in collagen are not being used we used in trinseculebral protein for example to also just show it at the glycine or that the amino acids actually show up in collagen so yes collagen can be used and is a good source of glycine and protein but does it further increase connective protein synthesis when compared to a high quality dairy protein or a different protein so far we haven't seen any evidence for that but of course again it's just a matter of the amount if you give twice the amount of collagen which has the same essential amino acids then have the amount of for example echo dairy protein you might actually see exactly the same response but as a lot of studies that still need to be done to figure this one out it's interesting there's been a lot of people that think that hydrolyzed collagen powder doesn't actually go to cartilage but there's been some animal studies that have radiolabled hydrolyzed collagen powder and it does go to cartilage do you think that's applicable like that's translatable to humans so the amino acids I mean so like I said collagen contains like any other protein a lot of a lot of amino acids and particularly the amino acids glycine and of course those amino acids are going to be used to synthesize proteins whether that's connected protein or whether that's that's that's my fibro protein so yes I mean this is just a protein source which has a lot of glycine and protein so yeah why not why not but from a complete constitution it doesn't have as much as a balanced amino acid profile as most animal or higher quality animal derived proteins but that doesn't mean that I mean I think I mean this is something that I think we should be we so in muscle I think that the availability of the amino acids is not restricting the increase after physical activity because after physical activity we see the connective tissue protein since its rates go up but it doesn't seem to be the depend on the amount of protein or collagen that you provide so I think there it's not limiting at least not in the first few hours after exercise maybe in a longer time frame I don't know that's possibility I think the great benefits are to be expected if they are there on the tissues that have a higher collagen content and so I think they're still a window of opportunity there as a good source of glycine and protein for recuff restoration or repair of collagen-vitch tissues which could be skin which could be tendon cartilage bone etc. whether it is of greater benefit than the same amount of amino acids provided by other protein sources I don't know but that's all stuff that we start we should start doing in the future and we are actually doing a few of those studies and we finished a few studies also where we actually looked at skin because skin is still easy to take samples from the other ones we can only do that pre-surgery so we actually take people that get a new knee and then we actually do the intervention prior to surgery but with course with skin we can take a skin biopsy and we can take a muscle biopsy repeatedly over a few hours and that's also stuff that we've done but we still need to analyze everything so what about the role this signal we've been talking you've been talking a lot about proline hydroxyprole in glycine I mean these are amino acids that are certainly in greater quantity in something like hydrolyzed collagen powder versus protein source of food from food or even a protein powder but there's there's been a lot of at least a lot of pre-clinical evidence looking at these small peptides being signaling molecules in you know their tissues and there's been a lot of sort of I would say speculation that perhaps the signaling role of these collagen peptides may be as important if not more important than the incorporation of proline and hydroxyprole in glycine into tendons and skin so that's that's of interest and of course it's really difficult to figure out in infever when humans whether this is really happening because first of all what dietri or oligo peptides are looking for and then with having 20 different amino acids you can almost have an enormous amount of different dietri and oligo peptides and even if you measure them in the circulation do they actually come from the protein that you ingest it already newly synthesized in the liver so it's so difficult figuring that one out but it's really funny that I was in a podcast where somebody said like how do you get along with a professor bar from UC Davis who actually does a lot of this in vitro work and and so he must be your your your greatest enemy and I said do you want me to pick him to get him and then the guy was completely just just surprised and he said like like what do you mean said he's in my office next door he's on the sabbatical here and so actually during the podcast I actually got Keith out and we said together and then he thought that we had completely opposites perspectives and we don't I mean I'm a human physiologist and and he's also a physiologist but he looks at a lot of also ligaments and genitaligaments and looks at what happens there but then the translation is to what extent can you actually translate this to supplement use or stimulation in vivo that was still far from far from that but yes the individual amino acid so important whether there's bioactive peptides I don't really see any evidence yet so yeah the thing that really peaked my interest in that was there've been there's been a few studies looking at like very small amounts of hydrolychologen powder I mean amounts that you would get in a pill and people with giving them either the hydrolychologen powder or a placebo and people with arthritis and the very very small amount of hydrolychologen powder was having an effect on reducing you know some of their is a lot of it's subjective but there was also some inflammation that was reduced and I was thinking absolutely not an expert in the topic but I've seen a lot of those papers and a few media analysis and there seems to be going some going on something on pain perception but of course pain perception is also something very subjective so is it is it working through the guts is it working through maybe gut brain access or is it really something between gut and muscle or gut and muscular skeletal tissues I don't know but yeah I mean my outcome parameters are generally not the thing that's why I brought up the signaling molecule as well because it's like when I saw the doses and you know these are placebo control it was very surprising to me and like well that's like it's got to be something else going on yeah I mean we're going to we're giving like like 20 or 30 grams of protein and then it's half of it is glycine of protein does it use your hands? The last thing about the hydrolychologen powder I wanted to talk about was getting your thoughts on you know so typically you can hydrolychologen powder is you know available in a wide variety of sizes so anywhere between two kilodons to 10 and there's some evidence that suggests perhaps that smaller like two to five kilodons those peptides are better absorbed better used as signaling molecules getting to the tissues better like for example skin getting you know smaller ones like two to three kilodons I mean again there's not an overwhelming amount of evidence on this it's it's really up and coming and I think it's infancy but I just wanted to get your thoughts and any speculation is to why smaller perhaps not the 10 kilodons but you maybe you know the two to five range might be. So quantitatively most of the of the protein will be completely digested and absorbed as amino acids over the intestinal wall then released in the portal vein then actually released via the liver into the circulation. Now there are transporters for small peptides in the gut and so they have been yeah recognized and and shown the question is do they then on the other side do they stay in the intestinal cells? Do they are they released on the other side towards the portal vein we don't really know that and what happens in the liver with them. So there are some some some some evaluations of of oligopeptides in the circulation are they directly coming from the ingested protein or the hydrolyce protein is there a difference in their amount but you have a further hydrolyce collagen collagen protein with small compounds and I don't know. I mean in vivo I wouldn't have the guts to say it. And what are your thoughts on the skin studies? That's that's one area where again like you you mentioned tissues with a lot of collagen might be more important. So sometimes people don't realize how little we know because we know that if you provide protein and you see an increase in circulating amino acids you see muscle protein synthesis increase and I still think that's magical I mean I'm a complete nerd of course then I'm saying that but do realize that you constantly have amino acids being released from the turnover. I told you that all those other tissues have a huge turnover much higher than muscle so this constantly free amino acids being thrown in your circulation very rapidly and then you only give like 20 grams of protein of which 10 grams is released in circulation of the next four hours and that is only only a spark like maybe 15% on the total turnover the release of amino acid in circulation and that sets of a process that makes the muscle start synthesizing muscle protein that's remarkable because it's not a huge increase it's on the top of everything it's only a little stimulus. Now we notice from muscle we know how it works we know what it does and now we have the signaling molecules the signaling pathways we know the M-tor you know Lucy in et cetera et cetera we know no anything about all these other tissues so do the other tissues respond to nutrition or not and that includes skin but it also includes the liver and the heart whatever so the big question is do these tissues respond to protein ingestion by greater muscle protein synthesis or are they just having the same turnover but they use of course the amino acids that are being released by the protein in our diet so that's the big question now for skin it's interesting because we can figure that one out because I can't take three samples of the liver or the lung or the brain in in six hours that's impossible I can maybe obtain one sample after like a two hour surgery for the skin of course we could actually do the same thing as muscle and now I'm not that much interested in skin but if skin is actually an easier way of finding this investigating the same process as muscle that's interesting because then we only have to take skin biopsies which is much easier and think of muscle biopsies so I'm really interested to see what comes out of that study well the other interesting thing too would go back to that signaling role because again I've seen and this is as you mentioned largely in vitro when scientists are looking at mechanistic potential explanations that these collagen peptides that are small they they're decreasing matrix metallic proteaneuses that are breaking down collagen they're increasing enzymes that are synthesized in collagen in the skin like these are in you know yeah against else but but the big question is I mean so we've seen people I mean there's people doing a vitro work with all kinds of compounds throwing them in the dish and so it's seeing something happening but does the muscle see those compounds that's one and in what concentration and that's where it's limited so a lot of that research has not been done and to be honest a lot of the collagen research is still in highly said at children's shoes or baby shoes it's basically it still has to happen I mean it took many years to convince people to co-support in public private partnerships these kind of studies to see what are the benefits of collagen because I mean the story can be good but I mean we need to verify it but of course it's always scary because what if it doesn't do anything what if and that's that's always what restricts science of course because I mean science is costly but I think the study is just need to be done. Do you think there might be beneficial aspects to consuming a type of which you in some ways called low protein source because it doesn't have all the great yeah low quality protein it doesn't have all the great amino acids for you know scottal muscle protein synthesis but you know proling hydroxyproping glycine it's high in originine, plays a role in you know our bascular system like do you think there could be a role just for consuming hydrolyzed collagen powder just for those amino acids that are a little more abundant in that type of protein source. If there's an unbalanced need for specific amino acids then of course a source that is richer and those amino acids might be of benefit but those amino acids can also be provided by other protein source of course but then again it's a matter of you compensate with if greater quantity in order to get the same amino acids in and so what I think and what I would like to study but we have not doing that yet after large orthopedic surgery where the collagen is actually a benefit to recent the size of those collagen rich tissues because then knowing that 50% is glycine and protein of these tissues that's a lot of glycine and protein so maybe in those conditions you need sources of extra glycine and protein and then I mean then you might actually have a benefit of taking collagen supplements but of course you could also get that by your normal nutrition but there are some interesting calculations and assumptions that nowadays our diet is low in for example glycine and protein because we're not consuming bone broth anymore and stuff and a lot of our of food is processed I mean so the story is still there but the science is not there to back it up yet yeah I don't like I don't know that most people are consuming high high amounts of protein and glycine and hydroxyprolein from food sources unless they are eating the cartilage of their chicken and you know making the bone boiling the bone broth I mean yes some people are doing that but the general population is not and so it is easier to take a hydrolase collagen powder which has a much higher concentration of those specific amino acids than eating a sake yeah what I often also here I mean the hydroxyprolein that might have a I mean that actually is increased in a circulation after ingesting collagen but the hydroxyprolein is not a precursor for your incorporation your own collagen but it might have a stimulatory effect or signaling effect but we don't know I mean again what is the muscle C what those there are the tissue C what does this in the OVMC you know anything that I mean to be honest I mean about I think four or five years ago I think that we were the first to assess the synthesis rate of all the proteins in and around to knee so what we did is being fused people before they they underwent full knee surgery and we measured the synthesis rate of muscle cartilage sovits and novium menisky the the ACL the PCR so everything there was really funny because normally we take a muscle biopsy and then we have 150 milligrams of muscle and then we're completely happy and then we have to measure all these different things in that small amount of muscle now you're standing in the surgery room and you're getting a whole mixed grill I mean I'm getting a menisky's getting an ACL and PCR I'm getting all this tissue and I can all can measure this and this and this and now we have a whole spectrum of all the tissues in and around to knee and the synthesis rates were almost all in the same ballpark muscle and I thought that was already for me the first step towards nutrition and these tissues because the regenerative capacity of these tissues is higher than anticipated. Do you know of a role that growth hormone plays in collagen synthesis? Yeah so we know that that's especially from a abuse of course that that the growth hormone has a incommination for example and about steroids can help you with the connective tissue and protein synthesis and stuff like that so not sure whether to suggest that you have to combine that with collagen and peptides or anything by that. Yeah but I mean you increased growth hormone with exercise. Yeah and you also increased testosterone but like I said I mean the exercise is much more potent than the hormonal changes that you see. Well thank you so much Luke for this very enlightening conversation for all your research that you've done before we you know before we leave I'd like to ask one last question about your personal routine. I mean how you apply maybe some of the principles you've learned through your research and others for your nutrition your exercise workout like frequency I mean what you aim to do perhaps what you do and what you aim to do. In general people ask me I always say I try to not to mix work with with private life but that's just a cop out. Now I write my bike a lot hot so I'm sitting on a road bike a lot especially in the summer. I don't have a specific I don't have specific targets I exercise basically to keep everything as healthy as possible and that I can do and dilge myself it more food and I don't get too fat. So I cycle maybe like four or five times a week and longer writes in the summer when it's when the sun is out I used to write in a rain but now I don't do it anymore I'm getting lazy and of course some resistance training but that's that's not the amount that I did in the past I mean now it's maybe one or two sessions a week and as I heard from you say early you mostly don't eat a lot during the day and then eat it most of your. Yes but that's not a good thing I have to change that to be honest so. Well thank you so much Luke for coming on the show and talking about your research and the important of protein and resistance training in muscle physiology.

more vigorous intensity exercise, higher intensity exercise can potentiator lead to greater improvements in in V02 max or eliminate what's known as non-response. So some people engage in training and it's very frustrating because their V02 max doesn't change at all. And there's various reasons for that when you talk about, but for example some evidence has shown that moderate intensity continuous exercise even for six months or so doing guideline-based evidence roughly 40% of people don't see a measurable improvement in their V02 max. Now some of that non-response was eliminated in a group that was doing the same total amount of exercise but engaging in a more vigorous manner. So that would seem to argue against zone two somewhat, but I think you know there's all all-road's lead to Rome. You know there's many different strategies that you can engage in successfully and I think a big thing is what do you like? Do you like an enjoy vigorous intermittent type exercise then maybe it's for you. If you prefer continuous lower intensity moderate exercise training and that's just what you like and you absolutely hate intervals, that's okay too. Hi everyone, I'm sitting here with Dr. Martin Gabala who is an exercise physiologist and professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm pretty excited to be sitting here with Marty. Perhaps he's most well known for his research on pioneering research on high intensity interval training. He wrote a very popular book called The One Minute Workout. As you know Marty I'm very excited to have you here because I feel like there's a lot of health benefits that can be achieved in a short amount of time if the right intention is there. If you are pushing hard you are doing a intense workout and for me it's very appealing as a full-time mother, full-time you know I work full-time. Time is the limiting factor for me. So maybe we could just jump right in this high intensity interval training and start with defining some of these terms or differentiating between high intensity training, HIT and high intensity interval training, HIT both short hit, right? So yeah so thanks for the opportunity. Lots of different ways to define things. I think there can be general agreement then when we say high intensity we're talking a relative heart rate of about 80% of your maximum. But there's no universal definition for high intensity training or high intensity interval training. But that would be a typical or average threshold. So about 80% of max, you're working pretty hard but it's not an all-out sprint. Again the other eye in there is just intermittent so this idea of going relatively hard backing off and repeating that pattern a couple of times. An interval training it's this thing that we seem to rediscover every decade or so. You know athletes have used it since the turn of the century but it's certainly become popular last decade or so or renewed popularity because many people cite time as a major barrier some more legitimate than others of course if it's a real-time press issue or not. Is interval training like when you say interval training because you said high intensity you're going like 80% of your max heart rate. If you're doing is interval training also that as well as just kind of interchange or is it like do you go a little bit less than that? Yeah I increasingly I like the term interval training as a more general catch-all term and again that's just relatively harder effort and backing off but it provides I think more a broader way of doing that. So if you're just starting out getting into exercise maybe just want to start out by walking fast for a few light posts and then backing it off. That's a form of interval training. Don't worry at all about whether you're at 80%. So I think of hit high intensity interval training as one type or one facet of interval training as opposed to being the be all in end all. Got it. So with high intensity interval training hit there's I've heard you talk about and you've published research you've written about it in a popular book the health benefits of high intensity interval training on VO2 max which I'm sure you're going to talk all about but recently there's been a very another form that's become very popular of training for improving VO2 max which is zone two training as defined by a lower intensity sort of lactate threshold training. However that type of training does require a pretty big time commitment I mean anywhere between three to six hours a week. So can someone achieve similar improvements or really good improvements in VO2 max? From doing let's say 20 to 25 minutes of high intensity interval training three to four times a week and if so you know what are we leaving anything on the table if you know we're not doing that long duration sort of zone two type of training. Yeah so in short I think you can do more vigorous or high intensity exercise for shorter periods of time and at least see similar improvements in VO2 max. So for the individual who is time pressed I don't think there's a need to do three to four hours of what I understand to be zone two training weekly in order to maximize improvements in VO2 max. In fact there's evidence that would suggest that more vigorous intensity exercise higher intensity exercise can a potentiator lead to greater improvements in in VO2 max or eliminate what's known as non-response. So some people engage in training and it's very frustrating because their VO2 max doesn't change at all and there's various reasons for that when you talk about but for example some evidence has shown that moderate intensity continuous exercise even for six months or so doing guideline-based evidence roughly 40% of people don't see a measurable improvement in their VO2 max. Now some of non-response was eliminated in a group that was doing the same total amount of exercise but engaging in a more vigorous manner. So that would seem to argue against zone two somewhat but I think there's all all roadside to roam you know there's many different strategies that you can engage in successfully and I think a big thing is what do you like right do you like and enjoy vigorous intermittent type exercise then maybe it's for you. If you prefer continuous lower intensity moderate exercise training and that's just what you like and you absolutely hate intervals that's okay too. Can you talk about what VO2 max is we hear a lot about it and why it's important for health longevity and maybe why athletes would be interested in it as well. Sure so VO2 max is the maximum rate of oxygen uptake by the body it's typically measured during an incremental exercise test so you get up to very high work rates and that's where you'll see your highest rate of oxygen uptake. It's determined by many physiological factors and processes but it reflects the peak integrated capacity of the cardiovascular the respiratory the blood the skeletal muscle system to take up and utilize oxygen. It's clearly important for athletes it sort of sets the ceiling you know in a challenge for athletes and many events is how close to the ceiling can you work for a fine period of time and so you know the higher the oxygen uptake the better it's also the the clinical correlate of VO2 max is cardiovascular spyratory fitness so VO2 max is the best objective measure of cardiovascular spyratory fitness and why fitness is so important epidemiological studies show having a higher cardiovascular spyratory fitness is associated with a reduction in all cause mortality dying from all causes as well as developing many different chronic diseases cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes so bottom line is having a higher fitness is better it protects you it reduces your risk of dying in developed diseases and the best way to measure that is through VO2 max test so you mentioned these these epidemiological studies these observational studies that are looking at the correlation between higher VO2 max and let's say all cause mortality there's a really I think important paper that was published in jama in 2018 that show there was an inverse relationship between VO2 max and all cause mortality with no apparent upper limit and the elite performing athletes or the elite performers had a 80% reduction in all cause mortality compared to the lowest performers with VO2 max so my question for you is do you think someone who is doing let's say you know again doing the high intensity animal training mostly and 20 25 minutes 3 or 4 times a week do you think they can be one of those elite is that like what you would think would be an elite performer in terms of their VO2 max or do you have to be an athlete how can someone do we need to do extra you know types of training on top of the the hit to really get to that level at 80% yeah and so there's there's lots of things there and I think to be clear the way that an individual may choose to engage in physical activity or exercise for their general health is completely different from a way that an elite endurance athlete might might train and that has to do with lots of things including what's the total volume of training so if you're a serious or an elite or very high level endurance athlete you're engaged in 15 20 sessions of training per week you're training 25 30 hours a week of training and the best evidence you know gleaned that's there's some scientific evidence largely you know opinion from high level coaches and athletes is about an 80 20 split there is sort of the ideal mix or ratio to optimize endurance performance so about 80% load a moderate intensity type training and 20% high intensity training much of an including interval training again that's the way the elite athlete might train who's putting in 25 30 hours a week I think that ratio can change if we're talking about someone who's engaging in one to two or three to four hours a week of physical activity and they're looking to optimize how to structure that type of training fit within the regular lives and I think there that ratio can change fairly substantially and you can incorporate I would submit that engaging in more vigorous intensity type exercise if you're only doing one two three hours a week may potentiate or give you a further boost in fit this so even even potentially one one hour one half hour hours a week because that's that's also something I mean you mentioned the 80 20 split and that's I mean I've heard about a lot and I think about it because I am not an athlete I am you know far from an athlete I am a committed you know exerciseer I guess you would call it I mean and I you know I have also very interested in longevity and improving my video two max and I want to talk about measuring that at me you know in a minute but so it's you know it's not like finding if you know is there a minimum effective dose where we can get 80% of the you know improvements in B2 max that an athlete would get I mean that you know because if I if I can get like 80 80% you know I'm I'm like that that's a good amount because there's just there's no way I will be in athlete like that's not my life I can't do that you know but I want to get those improvements in B2 max correct no and you know I would consider myself very similar I'm I'm a committed exercise you know it's in my calendar up to you're much like yours as I'm trying it but you know you're busy trying to think what's the best way to structure that but you know so a couple things I think whatever reason you're active or exercising for what what's the goal is it performance is it general health is it trying to optimize that time and I think for a lot of people it does seem to be this is how much time I have you know maybe it's one hour or week maybe it's two hours a week what's the best way that I can utilize that time to promote my my overall health and for those individuals again I would submit that there is good evidence that engaging in more vigorous intensity exercise may potentiate the gains that's not to say it's the prescription for everyone and the other thing I think we need to remember about B2 max is the greatest gains are with the smaller changes in fitness right so we totally we look at you know people who are have low moderate and high physical activity levels or low moderate and high view to max levels the greatest bang for your buck is just getting out of that low range right and then there you continue to gain benefits but you get diminishing returns and the extreme would be the elite athlete who's pretty much doing everything right to maximize their physiology and now they're really just plan on that up or margin you know what what can I possibly do to eco a little bit more gain that the way that way of thinking and training is not necessarily the way that average every day people even serious committed exercises who are primary interested in health need to think right like Stu L.E. Stu's analogy of like squeezing the wet towel on like getting the last drops out you know you know that that's something that you know maybe if I was more of an elite athlete that I would be interested in doing but right now I'm like how can I get to that you know you know where I'm at least 80 80% I'm getting that B2 max you know maybe maybe getting all of it that could like I do going going hard and getting it but you do get going hard you mentioned intensity high intensity and infiltrating 80% max heart rate there's you know calculators for maximum heart rate you know I guess it's I would say there's an equation that must be put used to 20 minus your age but that's doesn't consider fitness levels I mean there's is that would you say that's still kind of the the best way for someone who is not going to go out or should they like go doing all that sprang or something and measure their max heart rate so I and there you know 220 minus your age is still probably the most common there's a number of other formulas that have been proposed and looked at scientifically I think the key thing to remember is there's variability around that and so if we had a thousand of your listeners and they were all 40 years old we could be reasonably confident that the average maximum heart rate of those thousand listeners is 180 220 minus 40 but there's going to be tremendous inter individual variability there and what we call it the standard deviation it's around 10 beats per minute but what that means is about two thirds of your listeners would fall somewhere between 170 and 190 95% of listeners would fall somewhere between 160 and 200 and there'd be 5% on either tail to an average average average where their maximum heart rate is actually below 160 or above 200 so there's a huge range there and so when you just pick so for an individual listener now they're going to work at 220 minus their age it might be dramatically underestimating intensity or dramatically overestimating intensity so 220 minus your age it's fine I think a better way to do it is just trying measure it on yourself and there's different ways to do that the classic would be to go out to a local high school or running track and run a 400 meter or 400 yard loop one one time around as hard as you can you're going to pretty much get to your maximum heart rate by the end or if you're on a bike you know a stationary thermometer just ride at higher and higher intensity so you're increasing the watt every one minute you're putting it up 10 or 20 watts until you can't go anymore you're going to be able to measure your individual maximum heart rate whether you palpate that whether you're using the hand or whether you have a chest strap or or your monoron so bottom line is measuring it directly on yourself is always going to be better well that's those are some good suggestions that I'm going to do myself for sure because I have not done the actual test that some is a call the stress test too that some people do you stress your body to the limit exactly you know it's and so definitely you know we have people come into our lab and get tested all the time on a view to max test and we'll be able to give them their maximum heart rate measured very very accurately but it's also something you do on your own very cheaply right as as long as you're measuring it with a reasonably accurate device so it's sort of the the simple way of of getting it yeah for the VO2 max like measuring the maximum amount of oxygen you're taking in during I guess maximum exercise um there's you mentioned to me most people are very interested in that and they're not going to get that measured directly they're not going to allow like yours or to their you know physician doing it but they want to know should I do it or is there a estimator I can do that's good enough or how do I decide if I should or shouldn't like what you know like athletes probably maybe they should but you know so this count on my calculator the world fitness level you mentioned maybe you could talk just briefly about the science behind that and sure so so you know I'm not associated with this at all but world world fitness calculator is it's a valid calculator for estimating VO2 max and so what I mean by that is it's based largely on a lot of research that's been conducted in Norway in particular Norwegian technological university that they've been real pioneers in a lot of interval training research and so the bottom line is they have a lot of data on measuring things and seeing how they correlate or are related to or can predict VO2 max and so of all of the calculators that are out there I think this is the one that people could trust the most in terms of answering a few questions about their age, their sex, their typical activity levels and it will give them a reasonable estimate of their VO2 max but it's still just an estimate because it's saying you're that typical 40 year old it's not going to be able to dial in any better individually but at least it's going to give you a marker in the sand or reasonable marker and even if it's not precisely accurate you can rest assured that it's going to allow you to track changes over time so you plug your answers into the online calculator it spits out of value and says your VO2 max is 38 or 45 and then you engage in some sort of training program for three or six months and then you do it again and that if you see a directional change up or down hopefully up you can be reasonably confident that you know your training program has been effective at increasing your VO2 max even if the precise number is not 100% accurate. Yeah that makes sense you know I there's a few few factors in there that were a little more on the personalized level like your resting heart rate and your max heart rate and the MI and waste waste a hypershow and our waste a come friends I think it was so it's you know there are definitely some some features aside from your age and everything like that but also the estimation of how intense are you going with your exercise you know that's that's a net that there's a subjective component to it where I was like like a hard you know like so you know again I it's kind of good to know that you can use that that online calculator people are interested in probably doing that but for the average person do you think measuring it directly is really the other way is an in between if you will is there's submaximal exercise test and there's a number of validated tests that are out there we could drop those in the show notes but where you basically are performing a couple of levels of submaximal exercise measuring your heart rate and then essentially plugging in to an equation that's going to extrapolate and said okay with this is your rate of increase in heart rate when she get up to your maximum this is what your view to max value would be or there's you know I don't know if you have these here but the shuttle run test or a beep test where basically you're running back and forth between a set measure distance and after a point you're not able to keep up but it's called a shuttle run test or a beep test and it basically the more power you're able to exert or the more that you can keep up with as you have to get faster and faster to run between these two markers that also correlates with your view to max so bottom line is all of these are submaximal exercise tests they're better than just an online questionnaire even that validated one that I mentioned because at least it's providing some data about you you know so you can't just say um engaging in vigorous activity it's going to actually measure your heart rate a little bit so that would sort of be an in between but yeah the gold standard is having a a view to max done in an accredited laboratory and that's going to give you your view to max value directly and it's also going to give you a lot of data on your power outputs your heart rate to even your lactate in order to try and look at training zones for example with respect to other cardiovascular adaptations I mean the a two max being you know the the big one here right there's stroke volume increases cardiac output how does high intensity interval training affect this what are those how does high intensity interval training affect them maybe compared to you know moderate intensity continuous exercise yeah sure so you know what determines view to max and and as I alluded to earlier it's it's you know many physiological things but the primary there'd be general consensus scientific consensus that the primary factor that separates individuals in terms of their view to max is their cardiac output so that's what is the maximum amount of blood and in turn oxygen or the maximum rate of blood and oxygen it's being pumped out of your heart every minute and so a typical untrained individual would have a resting cardiac output of about five liters per minute so if you would measure how much blood comes out of your heart in a minute it's about five liters and maximum cardiac outputs are somewhere around 15 to 20 in you know an untrained and moderately trained individual elite athletes have maximum cardiac outputs of 40 liters per minute tremendous and so again if you could pick one variable that's going to best predict differences between individuals it would be maximum cardiac output and that's determined by how often is your heart beating every minute what's your maximum heart rate times what you alluded to your stroke volume and so that's just how much blood with each beat is squeezed out of the heart the other primary determinant would be how well your muscles mainly extract or utilize that oxygen so your your heart's pumping it out your circulation is distributing it through the body and then your muscles and your mitochondria ultimately have to use that oxygen and so for a long time there is tensioner debate around is it really the delivery side or the utilization side in terms of oxygen that limits view to max and certainly you can put people in situations where one or the other is more important but generally speaking it's the delivery side and that's primarily determined by your heart and probably why view too much view to max is such a good measure of things like or predictor of things like alcohol cause mortality cardiovascular disease mortality because probably you know a failing heart or problems with your heart is a major contributor in a lot of those diseases yeah and high intensity interval training I know it affects cardiac output right and so that another way of improving cardiac output and it is and so so you know now we're talking scientifically view to max is easy to measure you know basically any exercise physiology laboratory at any university or private clinics or medical centers they get all measure view to max well because it's a relatively non-invasive measure right you put it to when you're mouth and you measure the amount of oxygen and gas that gets expired so it's it's easy to measure all these other things that we're talking about certainly cardiac output even just think about what you would have to do to measure the maximum amount of blood that's being pumped out of your heart every minute and there are ways to do that but they're they're highly specialized they're very invasive you know requiring significant catheterization of your blood vessels so the point is there's not a lot of direct measures of of cardiac output or or stroke volume but there have been and there's also ways to reasonable ways we've used in our laboratory to non-invasively assess cardiac output and so some of those studies have looked at the effective interval versus continuous training on on cardiac output and and they've shown that more vigorous or more high intensity exercise maybe associated with greater improvements in stroke volume and cardiac output as opposed to the same dose or same total amount of continuous moderate intensity training so maybe if the dose was higher of the continuous moderate training again this sort of trade-off between duration versus intensity no absolutely and you know the other so many points to consider and you know I'm sure your audience is getting the sense you know there's a lot of nuance to all of this which is very frustrating for people because they just want to hear tell me what to do what does science say and science is always really great right it's it's not as clear as as as we would like often but you know when it comes even to exercise training studies most of my relatively short term right a three-month training study is is it a long time to measure some of these variables and so we don't necessarily know what the maximum potentially is for view two max in most individuals right and so if they engaged in longer periods of continuous moderate training would what they all get to the same level you know and maybe hit in these short-term studies just get you there the rate of improvement is a little faster than with continuous you know or are you leaving something off the table by not engaging in the more vigorous effort you know we don't conclude or we could get into a reasonable debate put it that way of of the answer saw those questions yeah you mentioned the mitochondrial component you know the the blood getting the oxygen you being delivered at the muscle and you know mitochondria using that oxygen to produce energy so maybe we can talk a little bit about some of the skeletal muscle adaptations from high intensity and little training maybe comparing contrast when we can to continuous exercise but mitochondria are very I mean it's probably one of the most important organelles inside all of most of ourselves particularly in muscle skeletal muscle and I recall quite a few studies from your lab and others showing that high intensity interval training was a very potent stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis or the generation of new mitochondria so can you talk a little bit about I mean how hit effects mitochondrial biogenesis maybe the the difference between more continuous exercise why that's important mitochondrial biogenesis sure so you're absolutely right you know and I think even if people took high scope allergy you tend to think of mitochondria these sort of bean shaped things in your in your body but we now know mitochondria are this amazing particular network so it's a bit like if you can imagine all of your capillaries that go through your your skeletal muscle fibers the best evidence now would suggest that mitochondria sort of work the same way it's this network of organelles that that goes through muscle and and they can change right the the size of the organelle but you can have increases or decreases in in mitochondrial capacity surprisingly quickly so you can increase mitochondrial content very very rapidly certainly within a few days or or weeks of training and it seems to go the other direction pretty quick as well so when you detrain you can lose mitochondrial capacity quite quickly as as well you know so what is exercise do any type of exercise if you can imagine exercise as a stress and so all of these stress compounds are indices of stress change inside your muscles so you immediately have this large increase in demand for ATP calcium levels go up reactive oxygen species lactate hydrinians change and many of those you can think of those as fuel gauges so the sort of or fuel monitors right they're saying oh my goodness we have an energy crisis our ATP is going down this is going to signal that we need more energy and so many of those compounds those acute changes have been linked to cellular molecular signaling pathways that are associated with the growth of new mitochondria so this is the idea of mitochondrial biogenesis genesis or growth of new mitochondria and those pathways are really really well mapped out now a lot of it based on on animal research and you know very sophisticated work but largely what scene in humans is it sort of seems to work the same way so in acute boat of exercise causes increase in those signaling compounds and as I mentioned within a few days or weeks you can see measurable increases in mitochondria measured with microscopy or Western blotting there's lots of methods to to assess that now how does hit and continuous compare again we we definitely have studies on this but all of these require muscle biopsies so needle biopsie a small sample of muscle needs to be taken often by a physician or at least a highly trained individual under the supervision of a physician so they're invasive procedures and what we get a snapshot in time we don't have real time changes of how you might a country a change over days and weeks we have these little snapshots but certainly you know my laboratory a lot of other laboratories that have compared continuous and interval training there is some evidence that higher intensity more vigorous exercise when the total dose is matched can lead to at least a more rapid or larger increase in mitochondrial content again at least over the short term so is it just getting you somewhere faster and if you do enough of it over time it starts to plateau we don't really have a great answer for that right now if you are generating more mitochondria then you know this kind of goes into the fat oxidation mitochondria are the primary place where you're oxidizing fat you're using fat to to produce energy what do you think of this this concept of you know you have to be the substrate you're burning during exercise is so you have to be burning more fat while you're exercising to have adaptations for better fat oxidation after you're done with exercise just you know it's steady state at rest so in other words like you know you have to be more neurobic type of state to have those adaptations so you know mitochondria consume lots of fuels right you know the primary ones of course carbohydrate and fat so whatever you feed it feed the mitochondria as long as the capacity has a sufficient capacity for that it will burn either of those fuels but but you're right you know mitochondrial content largely limits or determines fat oxidation uh buying individual muscle or or fat oxidation during exercise is largely determined by mitochondrial content and in particular very specific enzyme your mitochondria called carnitine palmitial transferase or CPT that's sort of the gatekeeper that gets fatty acids into the mitochondria once they're inside the mitochondria they can be oxidized but there's good data to show that that's the critical enzyme and so with training you want to increase CPT levels you know people there's various supplements that are supported to increase CPT activity you know one of the reasons reasons what carnitine is a popular supplement and is it's supported to increase your your oxidation of fatty acids the date on that's you know not great but we could talk about we could talk about that as well um but yeah you know lots of debate around what's the best way to increase mitochondrial content because that in turn is going to set the upper limit for fat oxidation capacity and athletes in particular want to have a very high rate of fatty oxidization because even in very lean individuals there's lots there's ample fat on board and carbohydrate tends to be a very precious and limited fuel so ideally we'd like to preserve carbohydrate you know until we really need it like when we're we're racing and we need a very high rate of carbohydrate oxidation as well so if you're going if you're doing a high intensity you know in a well training session and you're going above 80% max heart rate you're now you know going to this lactate threshold where you're you're basically producing more lactate quicker than you can consume it potentially your anaerobic maybe I mean so you know this this idea is like that you're not going to be burning fat during that part of the exercise but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not going to be able to burn more fat after because it does as you just mentioned increase mitochondrial biogenesis so you're actually increasing you know the capacity to oxidize fat later on I mean no absolutely so to me it's it's what's important is the increase in mitochondrial content the the overall increase in mitochondria and you know I think generally mitochondria have hundreds more than a thousand different proteins that are all necessary to build the mitochondria and they probably generally all sort of increase in decrease in in parallel right so there's not necessarily a specific way to really only boost that CPT enzyme that I talked about so I think that the most important adaptation or a critical adaptation in muscle is increasing mitochondrial content which then will allow a greater fat oxidation capacity as well as a greater carbohydrate oxidation capacity and you don't have to only work at a high rate of fatty acid oxidation in order to get that boost in mitochondria so there's there's many different ways to stimulate that including short intensive types what do you just as this sort of side note I was reading about the effect of like epinephrine nor epinephrine which are increased when you're doing more of a higher intensity type of exercise correct and that also sort of has some that I mean I was at lipoluses maybe it does so the catacolymes nor epinephrine epinephrine they're they're involved and so nor epinephrine is an important hormone that will signal at a post tissue to start to break down triglyceride and release those fatty acids into the bloodstream so you know much like we were talking about we use the analogy of oxygen or we're talking about oxygen it's delivery of oxygen and it's uptake of oxygen when it comes to fatty acid use it's delivery of the fatty acids and it's the uptake in oxidation of those fatty acids and you can definitely give people supplements that are going to increase lipoluses it's going to make more fatty acids available it's going to increase the breakdown of triglycerides but it's not necessarily going to increase oxidation so there I think there's quite good evidence that that has established that the limit for fat oxidation resides inside the muscle and it's at that level of the CPT which is that gatekeeper to get the fatty acids into the mitochondria where they can then be burned or oxidized yeah that's great and then mitochondrial biogenesis is increasing that CPT I mean if you're looking at least at a per cell you know level right you're more more mitochondria within that skeletal muscle cell sort of we were talking about this a little bit earlier off camera about you know the so talking about mitochondrial biogenesis the other sort of important factor with mitochondrial health would be my topology or mytofei g which would be the clearance of actual like sort of old damage mitochondria as you know there's definitely not a lot of evidence there's animal evidence but how much that can translate to humans is sort of unclear with respect to exercise and particularly high intensity exercise doing that but what I did when I touch on was atophygie which I think we have a little bit it's easily a little bit we've got more markers to measure it and it has been measured at least in human skeletal muscle with with respect to response to exercise and I'm just curious what your thoughts are because it has been shown that high intensity exercise is more potent for stimulating autophagy and skeletal muscle than just an overnight fast fast itself and you don't even have to be in a fasted state when you're doing the high intensity exercise which to me was like you know so what is the significance do you think for skeletal muscle health and are you guys looking at that? We don't study that in our laboratory I think the bottom line there is exercise is good for the routine maintenance or turnover of many of these cellular processes including mitochondria so it supports mitochondrial health it sort of promotes the sort of breakdown and the the building of new mitochondria so it's it's important to maintain mitochondrial health if you will the overall health or capacity of these mitochondria you know clearly I'm a proponent of vigorous intensity exercise there's some other studies out there that have shown that really vigorous exercise can temporarily impair mitochondrial capacity so if you measured a immediately post exercise or in the short term after you can engage in two vigorous in effort you basically really hammer yourselves and they sort of have a decline in function before they start to come back and so there's some criticism of interval training out there based on those studies especially very intensive wingate style all out type exercise that can transiently reduce mitochondrial capacity we're talking about different things there you know autophagy in the various processes but you know I think this is the idea that exercises a stress it temporarily disrupts or damages things and then it's all about the recovery that makes the cellular process better and we continually do that in over time things get better but certainly can we acutely over train or acutely over cause some disruption or it takes a prolonged period of time before it recovers sure it's but like you know concentric in eccentric weightlifting exercise we know that eccentric weightlifting exercise is more damaging to tissues yet more sore and so you tend to take a little bit more time to recover so not as simple as just high intensity good continuous nod or less good there's a lot of nuance there depending on the process yeah I'd love to to type dive into that a little bit more when I kind of recover some some like protocols cause that's really interesting in the windgate you know also just kind of like that's is that like an all outspread it is you can it's it's so if you've never windgate done a windgate test it's the longest 30 seconds of your life the the way to so the windgate tests are done on a specialized um rometer specialized bike that allows for very invariable intensity efforts but the the best way to think of it is if you have a stationary bike is basically getting on it setting it the highest workload possible so it's even hard to get it going and after five seconds you feel yourself starting to slow down because it's so challenging the workload is so high and so you just hang on as long as as you can what these specialized bikes do they sort of push back with just the right amount of a resistance and so it's will optimize that curve over the 30 seconds but it's an extremely demanding test and so some of our work early work was using that as a stimulus as sort of the one of the most intensive types of short hard exercise that you can do and having people do repeated uh windgate uh test very very challenging especially late in exercise you have lots of pH disturbance lots of lack to gas a production it hurts it's uncomfortable it's it's not a fun way to train yeah um I've never done one of those when we have to drive on uh the the other scale of tumultal adaptations that I think I you know there's some interest um particularly like there's so this capillary density you mentioned in my to conjugal network being sort of like that hit effect capillary density what is that yeah it does you know as a muscle physiology I think you know the two primary uh responses in muscle that are critical especially from an aerobic conditioning standpoint is the increase in mitochondria and and the increase in capillaryization so you need more the blood vessels in order to supply uh the the increase in in mitochondria within skeletal uh muscle and then of course there's other adaptations we see an increase in muscle glycogen content so you store more fuel on board that you can then uh break down you increase the transport for for many things including glucose transporters and so one of the reasons why exercise is therapeutic in the treatment of high blood blood blood sugar or diabetes you know there's lots of reasons but one of the reasons is you increase glucose transport capacity on the cell membrane and so what that means is it allows more glucose to be moved into the muscle maybe then stored as muscle glycogen and that helps to lower the blood sugar levels especially if they're chronically high and so individuals who start and engage in an exercise program one of the things that they'll find if they are diabetic because they have to reduce their diabetic medication because what's happening is the muscles more fit and rather needing the drug to try and clear the glucose your muscles doing it more naturally if you will or it's grown these new glucose transporters that helps to clear the glucose the elevated glucose from the bloodstream what how does the difference in increasing the glucose transporters or quit for transporters and muscle differ when you're doing that high intensity exercise versus more moderate yeah so for again I think for a lot of these responses that we might talk about in in muscle that there is evidence to so show that certainly high intensity exercise can cause changes in these group for transporters we've shown that including in people with type two diabetes but there's just not the body of evidence that we would like to see to definitively say one is better than the other you know we've done a number of studies showing that at least over the short term more vigorous exercise can elicit superior improvements in some of these markers but again the valid criticism is these are relatively short term studies they're not always appropriately powered many of these especially our early studies where what we like to think of is proof of concept or pilot studies you know do these things work and you know writ large we really need these randomized clinical trials to properly investigate all of these these questions what about insulin sensitivity is that also I mean so there's like you you get this glucose transport I mean that's another I mean that's one way of glucose regulation and certainly repeated I mean acute balance of exercise or probably I mean you're talking even throughout the day that would be so beneficial but also like people are you know insulin resistant to how does how does hit effect yes so there's there's various ways to measure insulin sensitivity but you know generally exercise increases insulin sensitivity there are some systematic reviews and meta analyses that have suggested that maybe more high intensity vigorous effort can lead to some greater improvements in markers of insulin sensitivity but again even though you know we think of oh systematic reviews meta analyses those are really definitive evidence but many of the underlying studies tend to be relatively small tend to be relatively low numbers of participants all of the potential bias you know not the researchers are purposely trying to bias their results but they don't always include all of the proper controls from a research design standpoint that you might like to see so sometimes the underlying evidence is is limited as well which limits the the the veracity of of the systematic reviews and meta analyses but certainly there is some evidence to suggest that bigger intensity more intense exercise may lead to some some superior benefits there you know just I assure we might hit on it later but this idea of multiple about through the day one of the things that we and some others are looking at right now or what we termed exercise snacks so these brief bouts of vigorous intensity exercise that are spread throughout the day and we're running right now to randomized controlled studies that you know our lab and the University of British Columbia my colleague professor John Littell and one of the main outcomes is measures of insulin sensitivity or like glucose control in groups that are doing these very short one minute bursts of vigorous effort spread throughout the day to try and get it exactly this question how many times a day so we're encouraging people to do at least four or five times a day of those snacks so you know we define an exercise snack as lesson or equal to one minute of vigorous intensity exercise that could be jumping on a stationary bike it could be a series of air squats or bodyweight style exercise and we're delivering in the intervention we've partnered with a company that's delivering prompts on people's cellphones and so they basically get a prompt that says hey it's time for your exercise snack that links to a little youtube video that shows the individual what they should do and we're encouraging them to do that four or five times a day more is better and we're following them for for three months 12 week intervention and we're comparing it to a movement snacks control group so a group that's getting a very similar intervention but they're not engaging in vigorous intensity exercise so it's more stretching mobility exercise and so the key variable that's changing there is the intensity of the movements and we're seeing you know how to people adhere to that like will people even do that and if they do it is it enough to move the needle in terms of things like cardiovascular spirit toy fitness blood markers of fat immune function glucose and measures of insulin sensitivity as well one of the studies that we're doing is going to be using a continuous glucose individuals with type 2 diabetes fantastic so they're going to be wearing they're wearing accelerometers as well yes yes so we're trying to track movement throughout the day and they're going to be wearing continuous glucose monitors before and after the intervention as well so this this kind of reminds me of some of the vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity studies Vylpa as you have called it that you've been a part of so this is this is though are those studies also considered exercise snacks or no so you're right Vylpa is vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity and very much led by my colleague professor Emmanuel Stamotakis out of the University of Sydney so I've been fortunate to be part of a really an international group that is looking at Vylpa in various ways but to be clear we're talking not structured exercise so you could think of Vylpa in in some ways is the non exercise equivalent of an exercise snack and so we're talking activities of daily living that you would be doing anyway and so I'll very give you a very specific example so to get to recording studio today I left my hotel I had to get here right somehow I had to get here I took a ride sharing service for for most of it but leaving my hotel room I had a choice of taking the stairs or taking the elevator I could have taken the stairs there or to get to my ride share service to walk a block I could have walked a leisurely pace or I could have picked up the pace right and said I'm I'm going to engage in a vigorous manner here arrive at the location again it's another minute to get from the ride share service to the front door I could do that in a vigorous pace or to pedestrian pace or I could carry my backpack right and engage in that and so the question there with Vylpa is in these activities of daily living that are already part of our lives if you embed vigorous effort in those you know another class could example would be you take a five hour flight get off the plane you have the choice the escalators there or you have the stairs you know many people are taking the escalator but you got some heavy backpacks you could vigorously climb up the stairs or 30 seconds to a minute that would be a dose of Vylpa right there and so again you got to move from one level to the other that's not planned and structured exercise that's just activities of daily living and the question that's being asked in that research is if people choose to do that in a vigorous manner is that meaningful and there's there's some evidence for that including a large study that was published in in December that was it mined the UK biobank data and and so what that allowed the investigators to do was look at over 25,000 individuals who engaged in Vylpa like efforts they were accelerometers to try and capture this and they were followed over almost seven years and the outcomes included all cosmortality cardiovascular disease mortality cancer mortality and that work showed revealed that people who engaged in even three to four minutes total a day of Vylpa like activity had substantial reductions in all cosmortality risks were talking 25, 30 percent so that would suggest that even brief non-exercise vigorous intermittent physical activity can move the needle in terms of health outcomes and of course we would suspect that maybe it has to do with some of these cardiovascular metabolic changes that we know are associated with health so that's not cause and effect evidence it's you know observational evidence over time but it was very robustly done the way the work was was conducted and it's quite compelling I think I agree because after you share those studies with me I read them and I think even on the higher end so you mentioned kind of the conservative you know three to four minutes a day when they were getting up to like more like nine I mean you're talking it was like 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular rate mortality 40 percent reduction in cancer related mortality I mean that's really incredible at these people are just doing this you know choosing to do these short bursts of you know vigorous intensity exercise and then having substantial benefits on you know on one you know longevity and health band basically the other if I can add the other key thing from that study I think is that all of these people were self-identified non-exerciseers and so the point is there are even people who self-identify non-exerciseers seemingly are still engaging in vigorous activity through the day and now part of that might be their their physical capacity is quite low and so what it takes to get them into a vigorous intensity ranges is not very much and actually as part of that study it was repeated in individuals who also identified as exercises and the same phenomenon were were apparent so even in exercises engaging in a VILPA like activity was still protective so again lots of work to follow up on you know what actually counts as a VILPA about you know will people do this you know but you can imagine again getting back to this idea of prompts you know building in VILPA like activities in a smartwatch or an app on a phone and encouraging you to accumulate three or four or five or ten minutes of VILPA day but you know three or four minutes of VILPA is you know about 30 minutes of vigorous activity a week and larger doxious in risk and that is very doable that is very I mean to say you can do 30 minutes a week is I mean you're really just saying I don't want to be healthy and you know the other it's interesting I don't want to go on too much of a tangent here but like you know how you wonder how much also of this of these VILPA studies and these even exercise snacks has to do it's just not being sedentary also because that's like an independent risk factor for I mean independent of exercise right so like I said I I don't consider myself a sedentary person because I engage in physical activity almost every day pretty much so I'm doing something I'm either doing my palaton and to hit workout I'm doing resistance training but I also sit at my desk for a good five hours sitting there sitting and that is when I am sedentary so I'm actually trying now to incorporate VILPA stuff I guess you know in I guess it's more structured so when it would be more of an extra snack in that case but I'm doing you know the the the burpees or the high knees or something where I mean I believe me like one minute of that I'm like this is the longest minute of my life you know I mean it's like hard so I can empathize and that I'm very similar I'm a committed exercise or pretty much I do something every day but you know as a university professor you sit at a computer a lot and so trying to build them into my day as as well but yeah I think the key there is you're right there may be a double benefit if you will you know all of us should be meeting physical activity guidelines of course you know add these in sprinkle them in but there may be a double benefit to a VILPA like approach or an exercise snack approach in that it simultaneously breaks up prolonged periods of sedentary behavior because I you know I'm sure like you I don't like to see that evidence and read those studies it suggests even if you're a committed exercise or prolonged sedentary is increasing your risk right you know we like to think of exercises this panacea and it's not it's not a vaccine against ill health outcomes in reducing sedentary behavior is really important as well as is proper sleep um so I kind of wanted to circle back just for a moment to the muscle biology aspect because um well one you're you're in expert in that arena and um we didn't touch on the how high intensity interval training affects the recruitment of muscle fiber so type one fibers type two fibers what does that mean how much does individual variation play in that equation so so you know big picture generally speaking there's two main types of muscle fibers they can be quantified different ways histically different there's different ways to measure them but uh there's slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers those definitions are based on basically how quickly the muscle fibers can shorten or contract and so the fast twitch or sort of fast explosive very uh very quick so we think of those associated with very fast explosive powerful movements where the the slow twitch they don't generate as much force but they don't fatigue very quickly as as well um sometimes all zero also known as type one two uh and those are generally looking at there's there's ways to measure basically the oxidative capacity how aerobic each of the muscle fibers are so there's different ways to categorize them but generally speaking two types and they differ in their characteristics the there's definitely something to the idea that we first recruit and this is known as the size principle in part based on the diameter of the muscle fibers so these slower twitch fibers these type one fibers tend to have narrower uh diameters and they tend to be recruited first so if I was to get up from the chair right here we were going to go for a walk around outside the studio um very low intensity those muscle fibers that we were to recruit to do that work are generally these slow twitch or type one muscle fibers they're good for low to moderate levels of force and they last for a long time without fatiguing then uh we need to uh get back quickly the studio or we need to run away from a a scare that's outside we suddenly have to engage in very fast movement we're going to now recruit or call in these fast twitch muscle fibers because we need more powerful muscle contractions in order to go faster we would be able to sprint away from the danger for very long because we'd eventually fatigue because these muscle these fast twitch or type two muscle fibers are uh that's one of the limitations uh of them and so that idea of progressive uh recruitment of of muscle fibers is well established what's not it's not is clean to just be able to say when we do low to moderate exercise we only recruit slow twitch or type one when we do high intensity uh we certainly don't only recruit type two we've already called on our slow twitch and then we start to recruit the fast twitch uh as well and the other point is like a lot of things it's really hard to study so you know you take a muscle biopsy sample that's hard enough right it's invasive people have to volunteer sometimes it's a little painful uh but you get your biopsy out now you have to separate these muscle fibers so you literally have to individually identify whether muscle fibers are fast or slow and then you separate them into pools and you analyze the type ones and the type two's very intricate uh time consuming work and so there's not a lot of data out there there you know a lot of animal studies that were done previously uh in rodents for example they have much more clearly defined muscles so they will have fibers muscles that are almost entirely fast twitch or muscles that are almost entirely slow twitch and so in those you can just take samples of specific muscles from a rat-hine limb for example and know that you're pretty much looking at fiber type differences human muscle is much more variable heterogeneous and so elite endurance athletes tend to have a much higher proponderance of slow twitch muscle fibers 70 80 percent uh elite strength athletes power lifters tend to have much higher proponderance of fast twitch muscle fibers but the vast majority of us are walking around somewhere around 50 50 40 60 and again that that complicates interpretation when we talk about fiber type differences to different types of exercise are we are are people more prone to losing one type over the other with age? Yes so and and so definitely there's evidence to suggest that there's progressive loss of these fast twitch muscle fibers maybe mainly or sorry maybe mainly due to the inherent aging process but again you know we could have a long discussion around whether aging is more a physical inactivity per se problem or aging per se but bottom line is we tend to lose fast twitch muscle fibers which is probably why especially as we age strength training is important in order to maintain the viability of these fast twitch muscle fibers. Does that correlate also with an increased risk in like falls and you know I think all of this aligns or certainly the theories would be that yes right and so you know we need to maintain flexibility balance all of that but certainly maintaining fast twitch muscle fibers through strength training is going to be important in order to help prevent falls and other others. With respect to the metabolism aspect of high intense interval training you know we talk we talked about the insulin sensitivity that glucose transport increasing I mean all these things are good for both people that are in the disease state like maybe type 2 diabetes or you know high glucose you know dysregulation metabolics and whatever also for people wanting to prevent also getting type 2 diabetes right I mean so there's two populations here right yeah absolutely again if you know back to the elite athlete they want to optimize all of those processes as much as they can right and the the individual who's very sedentary they really just need to do something to try and raise the bar so you know we're just talking about a massive spectrum there from very inactive very sedentary very high risk behavior to the elite athlete who as maximized almost all of these processes and is just looking for ways to further optimize that or just to get back to student allergy ring out the sponge a little bit more and of course most of us fall somewhere in this this broad range in between what about body composition weight loss obviously diet is an important component in those equations but can people use high intensity level training to help you know lose fat also even help you know there's there increase the muscle also you know is there is there is there is there role for high intensity interval training in so you're right in that you know when I tell my students that this is hardly novel that you know we control body mass mainly through nutrition but we control fitness through exercise and physical activity and so clearly exercise generally and high intensity exercise can play a role a support of role in terms of weight management body composition changes we've shown in some of our 6 and 12 week studies you can change you can have measurable changes in body composition such that there's a a slight loss of fat mass fat percentage or a slight increase in lean mass with high intensity interval training but it tends to be relatively subtle and how it compares with continuous exercise again I think the biggest thing is there's probably a time saving aspect there and so you can do less total exercise or certainly have a lower time commitment with more vigorous intensity exercise and burn the same number of calories there is something to the idea of personal trainers talk about the afterburn effect this idea of a heightened rate of metabolism in recovery we've measured it you know you look on the internet you'll see these massive differences in afterburn right where hit is way up here and moderate it's way down here it it's certainly nothing to that magnitude and but there is a difference but it tends to be relatively small and it dissipates relatively quickly but those small differences can add up over time and so you know people will say well how can high intensity be effective or how can certainly sprint type training be effective at this because you don't burn more many calories during the efforts will you do burn a greater rate of calories in in recovery and those two things can can play off but again I I think right now the best data is like a lot of things we've talked about you might get away with some time savings or a smaller total dose of exercise and still get to the same place with more vigorous activity well and contrast to that getting to the same place in my mind in my opinion one of the reasons I am so drawn in addition to the time efficiency aspect of high intensity double training is the brain effects and there's no doubt that exercise in general has global effects on the brain I mean there are improvements you do any type of exercise you look at any observational study exerciseers non exerciseers definitely you know brain benefits lower risk of you know age related diseases neurodegenerative diseases excuse me so you know not that there's not you know a role for any type of just getting your blood flow higher however I'm increasingly convinced when it comes to intensity of exercise there may be very unique benefits on the brain and that is where I think you know high intensity interval training or any type of high intensity training has a special role some of that has to do with actually wanting to increase your lactate levels so instead of this lactate threshold training that we were talking about the zone two sort of going you know right below the lactate threshold which I guess is defined various you know ways depending on who you're what you're reading or who is doing it but the lactate shuttle theory George Brooks proposed this you know it's not a theory anymore so it kind of the name kind of it's a lot of date but um can you talk just kind of briefly about the lactate shuttle theory and maybe like where the brain comes in sure so you know the lactate shuttle theory or lactate you know many of us if you look back at your textbooks you're learned that lactate was this metabolic waste product end product and it's just a metabolite like like anything else and it can be an extremely valuable fuel and we know that and there's elegant studies including from Dr. Brooks and others to show that you know first of all uh skeletal muscle can produce lactate under fully aerobic conditions so there's always some lactate production happening and certainly during more intensive exercise where we produce lactate inside the muscles it can be released from active skeletal muscle it can circulate to other places like the heart like the liver like the brain but certainly in heart can be a big consumer of lactate so it takes up that lactate can convert it back to glucose and then utilize it during exercise and so this is the idea of cell to cell or interorgan lactate exchange and I think that's very well established now I like you and you would be far ahead of me but I'm I'm following this area with with immense interest I have some colleagues at McMaster who are you know both from a cognitive psychology standpoint and also more a hardcore uh you know neurophysiology standpoint we're engaged in some collaborative research with them but generally looking at this question of physical activity and brain and probing the role of intensity there so you know my uh my understanding is mainly based on talking to my colleagues trying to read reviews of some of this research and my my sense is uh you know very well established potential mechanisms now from some of the animal studies and and the human data is certainly intriguing but you know that link between lactate, beat in F absolutely there appears to be a role for intensity there in terms of higher intensities the better in terms of you know potential beat in F bathing the brain some of these outcomes associated with neurogenesis yeah I it's the lactate and we can talk about measuring it but it's interesting because I do measure mine I do the finger prick and my workouts I'm like trying to go higher from my lactate you know and I've read a lot of study for me I'm very interested in neurogenesis um there's but on both sides of my family Alzheimer's and Parkinson's so to me I'm like I need to really focus on brain health and um so looking at the studies on lactate and um you know even if using lactate into humans it increases be the enough just confusing it and I'm like oh I get these levels from my really all out hard workouts like this is this is great um but also I feel really good so I start my day with and go into today um most most days you know at least five days a week I'm doing a and well I want to talk about protocols but I'm doing like a 10 minute you know to bodda so so I'm doing two-backed to back to bodda's actually it's two-backed to bodda's and then I have there's some you know minute minute warm up and a minute cool down I actually don't I use them more for I'm actually still going hard like half the time and then I like cool down after that minute so I like at the end I go and all out man it after my two-backed to bodda's and then I'm like I've done I cool down but um you know I do this for my brain I feel amazing and there's actually science showing that executive function is improved and it's totally correlates and this is in humans with lactate after high intensity exercise and it doesn't correlate with anything else you know glucose like nothing it's it's specific to the lactate and like you said it's a growing area of of research I am particularly interested in it like I for sure notice a difference in in terms of like if I go hard like I feel better I feel smarter I'm like more on task you know so for me it's a very important part of my protocol and I do think there's a lot of benefits for the brain so I'll have to be in touch with some of your your colleagues at McMaster because I love sharing studies and stuff that I find and learning what you know what other people are doing as well so the and maybe there's data out there on this but you know the the scientist to me is an atleast curious around things like I you know maybe now there's really really good dose response stuff in terms of exercise dose and beating F increase and some of these other measures but you know so for example is short sharp large changes in lactate better than prolonged moderate levels of lactate right and I'll I'll tell you something it's not lactate that I that I've looked into but I've looked into blood flow and sheer force and I think this is a very I think it's an emerging field looking at the effects of sheer force and and that is where I mean we're talking about a flash flood coming through if you're talking about high intensity versus just you know a little trickling and the sheer force itself at least at the blood brain barrier and this kind of when you're talking about muscle capillary I was thinking about the sheer force it in and of itself in a dose dependent manner is responsible for increasing veg F and BDNF at the blood brain barrier again dose dependent all on the sheer force effects. Mechano you know these mechanical receptors that are on cell surfaces and stuff like these are all sensing things and it's also very important so I think it's another so there's the lactate part of it where you're increasing the lactate and it's a quick sort of and it is like I've measured my my lactate spikes up you know I I don't get up to the levels that my husband I'm I'm more like a seven eight millimolar and he gets up to like 14 but it's it after 20 minutes I mean I'm back down one millimolar to my baseline basically so you know is it is there something with that you know lactate you know going intensely up it also the sheer force I think there's another interesting component to that that I think needs to be calculated into this equation because I'm seeing increasing data on that not just with respect to brain health but also people that have cancer so there's a lot of work from Justin Brown he's at I think it's too lame in New Orleans but the the sheer force and how it's affecting the circulating tumor cells so basically people that have been diagnosed with cancer you'll have a tumor cell that escapes the primary tumor site goes in circulation and that's how that's the potential to metastasize right so then ghost you know is able to travel to another organ and take up camp there or whatever so there's there's evidence that exercise in general exercise is involved in basically anything that gets your blood flow up basically those cancer cells die because they're so like disrupted and sensitive to the mechanical forces whereas normal cells are fine but it seems to also again be a dose dependent effect or the more intense the exercise the more blood flow that's going quicker the more intense the effect and also blood flow to the brain too right I mean just getting that that sheer force as well so I think there is a lot of interest there with the brain it to me is a differentiating factor from more continuous moderate exercise even longer duration obviously there's a lot of compensation probably that can happen metabolically when you're going for a longer duration you know period of time but I do see I do see something unique and I'm you know looking I'm reading the literature I'm trying to follow it as much and you know I mean it's emerging right I mean we don't really know the you know just on the topic of interval training there's now 700 papers a year coming out it makes it very challenging to stand top the literature you know and that's just in my main area so absolutely you know on the point about uh vascular stress we collaborate with some cardiovascular colleagues who are looking at this more endothelial function, flow-medated dilation not in the brain more in terms of muscle or large arteries leading to to muscle so parallels there I think in terms of some of the things you're talking about and sheer stress is in factors that are released you know to promote capillary growth there the other I want to mention around lactate levels though it's a bit like heart rate in that you know some people just have low maximal heart rates some people just have low maximal lactate values we know it's definitely related to fiber composition more fast which muscle fibers have greater potential to drive up lactate it's related to your enzymatic capacity to produce lactate so the point I just want to make maybe you're working as hard as your husband but you just don't have some of the biological traits that are going to allow you to get the very very high lactate levels you know what is your peak lactate level maybe you're already added or very close to it so don't be yourself up too much there do you think wearing a continuous lactate monitor when those exist will help me maybe right and and so I you know I'm sure we're going to get into zone two more and lactate and how we measure things in that but you know I think a challenge with lactate monitoring right now is it relies on occasional finger prick sampling there's variability in the monitors and that when we look at something like continuous glucose monitors and the evolution of that you know now we have continuous glucose monitors are combined with insulin pumps amazing right so eventually you have real time monitoring of blood glucose levels and as they change up or down the insulin can be potentiated or adjusted to get to and I I'm sure and I know people are working on this you know technically getting to the point where an athlete would use a continuous lactate monitor for training and racing I could see where that could have tremendous value whether everyone needs that I don't know you know whether you can use heart rate and some other metrics to at least get you reasonably into some zones but I can see why there would be tremendous interest in among athletes to to monitor that and really dial it in to get an idea of their metabolic stress no for sure I'm not an athlete but I'll tell you my interest would also be because before I was doing continuous glucose monitoring I wore one for around three years or so I was doing finger prick and you know I noticed before my workout you know my blood glucose levels were a certain number and then you know usually sometimes I would do it like three times because of the variation as you mentioned but after I would go higher up and I'm supposed to be like transporting more glucose into my muscles like this is ridiculous and it wasn't until I had a continuous glucose monitor on that I saw the change going way down during the exercise and then gluconeogenesis whatever's kicking in you know that it spike back up but I wouldn't have known that without that continuous you know data and I wonder with the lactate because during exercise the brain consumes it more than glucose so it actually you know you have both of them there it'll go for the lactate over the glucose and I wonder it's like oh well what's happening while I'm is it going really high is my brain consuming more of it or is it it might do not produce anymore but like you were saying like what what a continuous lactate monitor would give me some sort of peek into that because at least maybe it is going higher and I just don't see that because I'm not it's a snapshot that I'm getting after my workout right no it's a it's a it's a great point right even you know just monitoring venous levels it's not telling you anything about rates of production and utilization and so you know if some it's a really good test question in my senior class I will ask my students is a high blood lactate a good or bad thing from an exercise capacity standpoint and we tend to think well high blood lactates are bad because you know it's a so it's it's a signal that your pH is out of whack and everything like that but you could also make the case well actually transporting for a given amount of lactate production getting more out of the muscle into the blood might be a good thing because the disturbance to your muscle pH is not going to be as pronounced now you've moved the lactate to where you want it into the blood is sort of protect the muscle again it's just that it's a good thinking question I asked it to them to challenge or thought process around all of the things that control lactate but it maybe it's not all about just measuring it in the blood either is it yeah let's let's dive into that for a minute you brought up some really good points I think a couple one being you know this misconception of you know lactate or lactate acid and you know how what's actually responsible for you know the changes in osmolarity and you know that that fatiguing feeling I guess in muscle versus basically scientists in the animal training whether or not it can help I guess improve muscle fatigue through changes you know regulating the osmolarity better yeah so certainly there you can certainly you can change lactate transporters with exercise and and high intensity training and probably you know go back to athletes that were engaged in high intensity exercise to engage in high intensity type events a major adaptation there is an increase in monitor a couple of oxlate transporters MCT transporters to help get the lactate out of the muscle and you're right you know lactate acid is produced at physiological pH it rapidly dissociates into the lactate ion and the the proton the hydrogen ion and it's the changes in pH associated with the changes in protons that we know can interfere with contractile processes and enzymes and things like that so yeah complicated physiology but I think the bottom line is lactate is still a valuable measure and certainly why whether zone two training or others the notion about it's you know whether it directly can cause this fatigue probably not but it's still a really good surrogate marker or index of a lot of other things that are going on so whether it relates to osmolarity or potassium fluxes or calcium fluxes you know I think the people that really study muscle fatigue would say it it's not about lactate and pH all the time but lactate is still something that can be relatively easily monitored and it's a good proxy for you know a global look at what might be going on medibolically and I think that's where my understanding is where it's role in zone two training comes into play that makes sense so we talked about some other performance enhancements you know that that high intensity animal training complain release muscle glycogen like the storage capacity tracking about the muscle fatigue but and then we talked about the ot max which would be aerobic capacity there's also the anaerobic is it the anaerobic output is that anaerobic capacity correct and this gets back to this idea of you know if if you're event is multiple short sprints so you you play a team sport and your role on the team is to you know receive a pass or receive a ball sprint as hard as you can and then you have at least a few minutes in between plays to recover or you can then recover on on the field those individuals require very high power outputs that they can achieve repeatedly but with some affair bit of time in between and so those when we talk about anaerobic capacity the best measure or the most commonly accepted measure of anaerobic capacity is a win-gate test and that's because when we do and all out 30 second effort a large majority not all of it but a large majority of the energy is derived from anaerobic or non-oxidative metabolism and so we can quantify power output in terms of wattage on the bike and a large proportion of that power is derived from anaerobic and so for example you can measure let's say your view to max test at the end of that test you had 300 watts so your peak power output on a view to max test was 300 watts well you can do a 30 second win-gate and achieve 900, 1000 watts elite athletes elite power athletes 1500 watts on the bike so when we talk about someone who is exercising at 300% of view to max pace that's could people will max his max how can we exercise above view to max normally you're talking about it's power outputs above the view to max power output and when you're engaging these short-hard efforts they can be multiples of view to max power so this kind of reminds me of I've heard you talk about this the sprint from danger sort of pace or intensity and how I mean you know that that's that could be basically the cornerstone of a highly efficient work at now what is that can you talk about that and then maybe compare it to the windgate or maybe even this sprint interval training differences no for sure so again you know people think view to max will and max is max how can you be above max but when we talk about view to max that's max i'm a aerobic capacity and then we could have metrics to that so peak power work peak at view to max but sprint from danger pace is just that so if you had to flee a burning building the pace you might run at to save your child from an oncoming car it's well above view to max but you might only have to do it for five seconds so it would equate to top running speed and all out sprint over five or ten seconds you know even a windgate test is not true max power output the highest power output string a windgate usually occur within the first few seconds so we're talking five to 10 second efforts what's the highest work rate that you could put out what's the highest amount of ATP that you could generate much of it non-oxidatively over a five a 10 second effort at most that sprint from danger pace and you know if you're an athlete you know we hear these five zone training six zone training for many of us three zones are enough but when we talk about five and six zone what that often is referring to is discriminating work rates or power outputs above view to max and if you're the athlete looking to optimize performance you know whether you're working at 150% of view to max which you might be able to do for a minute or two or you're working at 250 300% of view to max for five or ten seconds those might be important in terms of discriminating fine changes that could further support your performance or it's for most of us it doesn't really matter we don't need to get that level of sensitivity in terms of how we structure our training at these very very high intensities or work rates so do you think there would that mean like could there be a benefit for sort of changing around our training protocol to incorporate some of that sprint I mean the O2 max benefit or you know so I do and and again this is not scientific but it makes sense to me at least and it's the old investing analogy right and so you can hit a home run with a hot stock tip but for most people they're better off to you know spread it around put your eggs in different baskets and so I think when it comes to exercise training for many individuals there's there's an analogy and and that's it maybe do different types of training and and that's so whether you're someone who really responds to sprint training or really responds to moderate we can't necessarily predict that and so varying up your training just like we spread out our risk when we invest might be the the best approach you know so should individuals engage in some short sharp hard efforts I think you know ideally speaking yes they should there's even some recent evidence I think there's renewed interest in the potential for elite endurance athletes to incorporate sprinting in their training and there's a series of studies that's that's come out Ronnastad Karsten Loonbees work showing that when truly world-class level cyclists we throw these terms around highly trained elite these are cyclists with starting view to max values 72 73 mills per kilogram per minute and they randomize them to do either traditional hit four five minute repeats or effort matched 30 seconds sprints and they sort of effort matched so whichever group you were assigned to you were working at the highest effort you could and they were worked matched and what they found was the group that incorporated the sprints had a further boost to their performance 20 minute time trial performance and they actually had a small but significant improvement in view to max and so it would suggest that maybe there might be a place for athletes to incorporate what you know some call RSTs repeated sprint training as a as a ways to further augment their performance now you know still relatively small three-week interventions but to go back to your question I think there is a place for incorporating very vigorous effort sometimes if you know it again there's some people who shouldn't do sprinting right especially if you're starting out but all things being equal yeah I think varying it up your approach is is going to be the best for general fitness I want to talk I let's let's dive in it's in protocols and this is this is very like I'm sitting here getting very very intrigued because of my training which mostly like I mentioned it's mostly on a Palaton stationary bike and it's you know again I do a lot of the 20 second on 10 second off you know back to back and I'm thinking like maybe I should also incorporate some you know I could go outside and do a hill sprint hate them hate them hate them but I mean you know if I can get if I if I can do it quick it's still convenient I just go outside and you know do this isn't like going around a track or anything which is something that I can conveniently do but also maybe potentially get even greater improvements in VO2 Max that's of interest to me I'm not an athlete but so are you so do you think that I'm so so I'm you know far would be it for me to tell you how to train but you know from what I've listened to in my awareness of the type of training that that you're doing actually think you know maybe you should do some longer intervals at a little bit lower intensity you know maybe you should be incorporating some three four five minute intervals as hard as you can go during those rather than almost exclusively doing Tabata style type training because arguably you're already doing a ton of sprint training Tabata is basically sprint training so I want to be careful here you know we could talk let's at least for now keep it modality specific so how you would train on a bike before we start talking about different modes in that because that introduces some other wrinkles but again from what I understand and what you just said earlier in our interview most of your training are these for you all out 20 seconds sprints 10 second recovery efforts I'd suggest you know and and I think Dr. Attila recently suggested you might want to do the same thing in those 10 second recovery periods almost completely stop or at least go down to very low intensity cycling because part of thing with Tabata is you go really hard but those 10 second breaks you've earned the break take it so don't maintain the intensity too high in the 10 second valleys before you go hard again but again it sounds like much of your interval training right now is already sprint type training given your Tabata's we know there's data suggests that all things being equal three to five minute repeats at the highest sustainable intensity are probably the best way to maximize gains in view to max it's pretty loaded statement but I think you probably want to incorporate some of these longer intervals two three four five minutes again highest workload you can and do for those right now that's probably going to take you at 20 minute commitment some warnings but I would say all right would encourage you to at least think about incorporating some of that style of interval training yeah absolutely how many times a week do you think yeah so again my understanding is you're doing something almost every day and I think you sort of you know you go back and forth between some resistant stuff and well the resistance is on the I and we'll talk about it as well but it's on the same days it's just later in the evening but like so that so we mentioned Tabata and then you're saying this this like like longer duration interval and it's funny because I had a question about that was like what if you let's say you know time let's say the interval where you're going all out is or at least high intensity so 80 percent is matched but instead of doing the you know shorter interval repeated repeated you do longer ones and it sounds to be like the longer one there is a difference in doing a longer interval even if you're like you know let's say six minutes total going all out for Tabata style versus what you're talking about which would be there is you know metabolically the challenge is different you know so this is where all interval training is not created equal right and and again there's lots of variables there total volume in particular is important but I think challenging your metabolic system in different ways is a good strategy now again for you that if you're only doing 10 minutes in the morning some of these days are going to be 20 minutes but maybe some days are you know three five minute intervals with a little bit of warm-up cooldown recovery in between that could still be a 20 minute workout but you've gotten in there 15 minutes of relatively intense training again pushes hard as you can go so they power up puts it you're working out are going to be different than when you're doing Tabata's and maybe some days do a minute on minute off repeated 10 times even five times right there's because that was a protocol that we've used a lot in our studies minute on minute off repeated 10 times took about 25 minutes for individuals but now there's studies that have looked at five by one showing that much of the improvement certainly in view to max is almost as good so again when we're doing 10 by one we're ringing out to sponge a little bit more but you get a lot of water out of five by one so I would say very up your intervals and recovery periods ideally in order to change up the physiological stress on the body now again your someone who says I only have 10 minutes in the morning and I absolutely love Tabata's okay like you're so far ahead of the game compared to many but I think if you're looking to optimize or maybe that's going to give a different lactate profile to your brain that maybe at least different I can't guarantee you it's better but I suspect for improvements in your cardiovascular fitness and that the different challenge may maybe a little better. This is great Marty because I think I am look if I have 10 minutes I have 20 and there's certainly some days I definitely have 20 others maybe 10 you know like today it was like 10 minutes I got Marty's coming I got I mean I got to do something but you know I think a lot of people are interested in that because there are different goals as you mentioned you know what are your goals? Are you an athlete okay then 80 20 like there's lots I mean you're you're putting in the time no matter what but but there's also people time like anything so there's those people it's like I can't think about you know doing you know maximizing what I can out of the V02 max and squeezing the cloth and getting every last drop I just got to like I got 10 minutes or you know and I can only do that X many times like you know four or five times a week or maybe some people like 20 minutes I can do three times a week but then you know I am interested in I am optimizing for V02 max as much as I can while still being time efficient you know and and and that I do think there's a there's a large audience it's very that's in that camp where it's like I want to be time efficient I want to still really optimize for V02 max and there are really I would say pretty strong data Coralian and V02 max also with brain health of course Cardi vascus systems are very related related to the brain vascus are health right so um that is really good we talked about to about we talked about 10 by one or five by one and you even talked about some of these longer ones which were like three to five minutes and then you're one minute so you're was your one minute workout based on the so we're the we're the title of the book came from was so our initial studies you know fast forward 15 20 years of research our initial studies in this area we were using the windgate test there's a long reasons for that but we were doing these 30 second windgates again these are uncomfortable people hate them you need four or five minutes recovery at least before we can coach you to do another one but the point is four or five windgates still takes 25 or 30 minutes and so it's still a significant time commitment and so people were saying well you know some of the critics rightly pointing out if it's taking 30 minutes and you're doing three times a week you're already getting up there so really how time efficient is it and so we wanted to devise protocol where no one would argue that it was time efficient and so that's and the other is it's the last 10 seconds arguably the last 15 seconds of the windgate that hurt the most so you know basically after about 15 seconds of the windgate you shut off glycogen utilization you've just produced so much lactate and your pH changes so much so if a lot of these responses are impart related to the reduction in glycogen maybe only need 15 or 20 seconds to trigger some of these responses so all that to say we came up with a protocol that was three 20 second intervals five minute total warm up and cool down and some recovery in between the intervals so start to finish the protocol took 10 minutes and within that there was one minute of very vigorous exercise that was the one minute workout I think we we've at least talked about it before the notion of re-hit at the same time as we were sort of coming up with the one minute workout UK researchers met calf, volard they've done a lot of this work they termed what they called reduced exertion high intensity training on a very similar theme where they were using a 10 minute start to finish workout but their protocol involves 10 to 20 only one to two 10 to 20 seconds efforts so all of this variations on a theme where we're talking no more than one minute of very intense exercise in a 10 minute time course and you know that we've we've done a number of studies now looking at that that workout and and showing that certainly it can prove you too many of the things we've talked about it can improve it to at least very similar extent as more traditional modern intensity continuous training that takes five times longer five times the total exercise while you that's that's a really big interest I mean I think into a lot of people so I mean that's for me and I mean people that I know I'm a lot of busy people that I know I mean it's like you know so I guess the the the the moral of the story here is I think I've the work to rest ratios in a way do matter to some respect because and that was kind of a big question for me was the what I'm doing every day was a very specific work to rest ratio but going going a little bit harder and that really does make sense and I knew it like I threw something in me that was like I just need to hear Marty tell me so thank you you mentioned some of the other protocols like the re hit what how does that you know how would you say that really differs from high intensity normal training I mean with respect to you maybe some of these endpoints we're talking about like VO to that so again like you know first of all it's all interval training whether it's hit depends on your definition a little bit and so that's why again you know I really like this idea this this notion or this terminology of interval training because it covers all the basis it's just alternating more intense less intense periods of of work high intensity for many is 80% or higher heart rate as a metric and you know and we've done this but to try and because our first work we called everything hit right which is much of the field at the time everything was hit but you know five minutes at 80% of VO to max is a very different stress as we just talked about from a 20 second to battle workout so at least to try and distinguish the interval training a little bit more there is this move to try and distinguish hit which is intense but sub maximal efforts from sit or sprint type training which is much closer to the sprint from danger pace type efforts so you know I would say re hit is absolutely interval training it's probably closer to sprint type training than traditional hit which just because of the power outputs you know you're working 10 20 seconds but these are very very high power outputs that you're generating and much higher than VO to max pace oh so I was completely confused about that because reduced exertion to me I was going oh this is less than 80% so the reduced exertion it was 10 or 20 seconds it feels a lot easier than a 30 second wind gate and it was because you know these investigators know 30 second wind gates hurt and all of the lack the gas it in the pain and the discomfort and even the nausea and dizziness sometimes it can go along with 30 seconds if you're doing 15 or 10 seconds much of that is is attenuated so the exertion comes down from the metabolic feelings and it's not the exertion level in terms of the power outputs on on the bike you know just to take that one step further Dr. Ed Coil at the University of Texas at Austin big name in the field of exercise physiology Dr Coil's recent work is looking at four second all-out efforts but doing a fair number of them and it's really just a variation on a theme and Dr Coil's point would be you can work very very hard even fairly deconditioned people can put out extremely high power outputs for four seconds then you give my think it's 12 seconds recovery and they do it again and so the point there is these very short very hard efforts aren't associated with the feeling the perceptions of discomfort when we initially think of wingate tests sprint from danger pace and you know I there's a lot of critics certainly on the behavioral side of things who are saying interval training is doomed to failures of public health priority because we know that anything above lactate threshold it hurts it makes people uncomfortable they're less likely to do it but there's a whole another group in the exercise behavior field they're going like wait a minute continuous high intensity efforts even continuous sprint efforts are very different from intermittent high intensity efforts and so there's a lot of certain a lot of arguing right now and a lot of Twitter pull-mix but I think still a lot of good work to be done looking at these perceptual responses to different types of interval training it's it's too simplistic to just go well sprint type training no one's going to do that because it hurts because now there's evidence to show that well actually it doesn't when people rate this they don't find it as unpleasant as uncomfortable as some make it out to claim that it is so the reduced exertion interval training the re-hit reduce exertion high intensity of training is you still it's they're messing around with more the work to rest ratios and you are still going you're still going very hard but your perceived exertion isn't as high as it would be if you were doing a wing gate or sprint for an interval training and so at the end of the day it really goes to say that perceived exertion isn't necessarily the best way to gauge how hard you're going because if you're still going hard on your four or five seconds you're you're you're you're doing good and then you know it's just I this is great I think this is very clear to me because you know the the the the that must be why I'm so drawn to debot to debot as well because I'm going hard for 20 seconds versus three minutes I mean one minute is hard like it's definitely going to be different and it is it is is you know these behavioral psychologists or whatever Twitter polimics that you're talking about they don't they might not know about David Goggins and the whole movement of you have to suffer to get to get the gains and you know so there are people that are willing to put in that effort there are people that do want to suffer and they will there's some days where you just don't right there's just some days where you're not going to do that but there are days where some people are very motivated and um no and you know to be clear these are these are these are very good scientists on both sides we're very careful uh methodological people you know they so I I respect the the the scientists on both sides of the issue but yeah to your point I my sense is when it comes to higher intensity especially short duration work the traditional way of thinking when we think of perceived effort it's just it doesn't fit as well right like classic board RPE scales are you know based on six to 20 because that generally correlated with uh you know young fit individuals who had arresting heart rate of 60 and a maximum heart rate of 200 that's where that rating scale comes in and so you know the more intense especially if it's continuous exercise the higher the heart rate the higher the perceived effort but we just see such a disconnect between ratings of perceived effort and heart rate I'll give you a very specific example we've done a study looking at that 10 by one protocol so these are 10 one minute efforts at objectively measured maximum heart rates of 85 to 90 percent of maximum in older individuals 63 years on average obese with type 2 diabetes on a 10 point rating scale they started out as a 5 they eventually got to about an 8 and so the average RPE was about a 7 out of 10 even though these people were doing very high power outputs at very high percentages of their maximum heart rate so it's just a striking example in our initial sprint studies the one minute sprint studies three 20 second efforts our first ones we were saying goal is hard as you can sprint from danger pace and we and in those we were using a 20 point scale they'd come back 14 15 out of 20 because now if we ask them to continue that sprint pace for a minute I'm sure we got to 20 but since they're so short so yeah to your point it's exactly right perceived effort I don't want to say it goes out the window but it maybe needs a rethink when we're referring to these very short very hard intermittent type efforts so what do you think let's say someone new to hit where like what a good place to start be more of these like shorter like and it's a really good question and this is where you know we haven't really talked health risk and all that I'm sure we'll get into it but like a standard thing that will just help people is get out of your comfort zone so wherever your starting point is your own perceived starting point make yourself a little bit more uncomfortable than usual for a short period and then back off and so I use this analogy all the time if you're only exercise is walking around the block and you want to get into intervals it's literally for the next two light posts I'm going to pick up the pace a little bit and then I'm going to back off so I I feel a little bit more out of breath I can feel I'm breathing a little bit more I can't talk to my partner like I generally can on our moderate walks it can be as simple as that just get it out of your comfort zone if you're someone who's already dialed in on the bike and you got a smart watch and all of that it's like hey get your heart rate longer or go longer and try and keep your heart rate there you know or rather than 20 seconds you're going to go for three minutes as hard as you can you're not going to be like me I know and the next time you're going to do that but it's going to be a very different challenge for you right and this is where I think that the more empowering term interval training it's okay because it doesn't matter if you're magically getting to some 80% lavalor whatever the experts tell you you should be at it's just start with the alternating pattern and then build from there start to dial it in maybe a little bit more and get more discerning but as a starting point just get out of your comfort zone and back off and repeat that a few times this kind of reminds me of the was it the interval walkers versus the walkers allutely yes you know excellent data and these are you know relatively small but well controlled randomized controlled trials looking at interval walking versus continuous steady state walking including an individuals with type 2 diabetes three four month interventions were individuals were randomly assigned to an interval walking group continuous walking or a control group the interval and continuous walkers matched for total exercise volume total exercise intensity so you can imagine the the continuous walkers I think their average heart rate was around 65% of maximum the interval walkers got that up to 70 and then down to 60 so we're just talking gentle hills and valleys after four months the interval walkers greater improvement and cardiovascular tri-fitness greater reduction in for greater change in body composition greater loss of fat and most importantly individuals type 2 diabetes greater reduction in 24 hour blood sugar measured using continuous glucose monitor so it's not to say that continuous walking is bad I think it's just a little bit of evidence that adding some intervals or varying the pace even slightly we're not talking sprint training may provide some greater benefit and this kind of relates to something I was going to ask you about which is you know interval training for maybe elderly and maybe informed so people that are more sick you know like how they can incorporate interval training into their lifestyle and also then like contraindicated on contraindication like so you mentioned like maybe some people you know is there some people that high intensity interval training is not good for and how would you know sort of all of those yeah so in this you know this I always make the point here I'm a PhD scientist I read the literature I'm not a medical doctor I'm not a cardiologist I I I I read work like that I try and stay informed on it and certainly for my book I interviewed people like Dr Paul Thompson right noted cardiologist who writes many of the guidelines around this very very issue but first point I was make is that interval training as we've talked about a lot comes in many different flavors so second point is that many more people than we initially think can perform and benefit from interval training and there's just now there's hundreds and hundreds of studies that have looked at interval training in individuals with cardiometabolic disease cardiovascular disease heart disease type 2 diabetes older individuals people with metabolic syndrome and and a lot of this is not new you can you can find studies going back to the 70s and 80s some of the pioneering work looking at interval training and individuals with heart disease so the notion that people could you know individuals with cardiometabolic diseases could engage in benefit from interval training is is certainly not new but there remains immense debate and I think it's we're all reading the same science and some people again I'm talking about the field broadly someone to see the science get to a certain level before they recommend changes and where that level is is different so for example high intensity interval training my read is is much more ingrained in Europe and certainly in Scandinavian countries it's you know much of the pioneering work around high intensity interval training and cardiovascular disease was was done in Norway and the work of Ulrich Whistloff and that goes back to the calculator that we talked about earlier but there I think it's much more generally accepted and integrated into cardiac rehab training right I think in North America it's it's not right and and so that's not necessarily good or bad I think it's the experts the cardiologist the people who write the guidelines looking at the evidence and saying you know some are more like I say with there's different viewpoints on that in terms of risk and again I'm not an MD or a cardiologist but in there's no doubt that more vigorous intensity exercise can transely increase risk of an event during the exercise about itself I think there's there's fairly strong evidence for that and you know in preparing for our interview I was reading some of the latest guidelines expert guidelines around that making that point you know and especially in more deconditioned individuals people might already have some silent underlying risk factors and so we can't ignore that or downplay it or say that everyone can do interval training is fine but the absolute risk still remains low when you look at events per hours engage in actual exercise you know both moderate and vigorous type effort whether it's continuous or intermittent the absolute rates remain relatively low but statistically there's definitely an increase in in risk that's higher with vigorous exercise during the event itself now of course after the event relative risk is much lower than individuals who would remain sedentary so you know I I think the old adage of the greatest risk to your health is just remain sedentary is absolutely true right and so when I was striking phrase that Dr Thompson used when we interviewed him for the book was you know if your choice is between doing hit and doing nothing do hit if the choice is between hit and moderate and you're 60 and you're been pretty inactive you might have some underlying factors and time is not a worry do moderate or at least engage in some moderate at some preconditioning before you start with the the more intense stuff and then on the you know who is absolutely concentrated atrial fibrillation there are some very clearly defined no-goes that if you have certain conditions that you shouldn't be engaging vigorous intensity exercise unstable and gyna would be another example yeah sounds like a lot of the I mean things that you would talk to your cardiologist about you would already have a cardiologist if you would know that you had that sort of disorder so the last point I was making is you know in talking to many physicians and cardiologists you know we think in exercise stress tests sort of gives you that green light or red light to engage in exercise and in certainly in our studies we're individuals head elevated risk people with type to diabetes and that everyone does the 12 lead ECG stress test before they recruited into the study but you know I naively thought okay the person doing the stress test the cardiologist reading it it's going to come back and it's say green light good to go in your study red light unable what we found was a lot of yellow lights maybe you know this person might be contraindicated or there's a change here that might elevate risk and so of course we defer to safety and so even those yellow lights generally those individuals were not then recruited into the study which is no doubt influencing outcomes but I always wonder I'm like sort of these people just going to sit around then and continue doing nothing and is that in itself raising their their risk so it's you know it even you know the standard you know recommendation see your doctor get clearance before you change your engage in in exercise it's not always 100% guarantee one where the other in terms of you may deal with a sudden adverse event we might see it in a 20 year old in my lab tomorrow you can't absolutely look these things I think also mentioning the the walkers the interval walkers versus continuous walkers was really good because you know it also kind of highlights the fact that you don't have to go to your 80% max heart rate for interval training and perhaps people that are older people that might have some underlying conditions people that are untrained and are starting later in life great you know it's never too late to start they can they can start by you know by doing you know intervals that are not necessarily all out or even sub-maximal right I mean just just going a little bit above what your you know steady state being able to talk normally sort of conversation is and you know I don't think that you know my sense is that many of your listeners are already aware of this but I think still for a lot of people or certainly the general public they hear the word hit for interval training and they think oh my goodness it's this as hard you can go all out breakneck pace and that's not for me and I think that's a disservice and again hopefully this more encompassing term of interval training it's just this idea of hills and valleys right and and the other point to that is um you know I talk to I'm not name dropping here but just you know many people have thought about this for a long time I also interviewed for the book Carl Foster who has done a lot of work around this and when he first heard you know as a scientist in the 80s that there was a group in Germany that was doing interval training in cardiac patients he saw one of the scientists at a conference and he said oh how many people you killed this week with that crazy stuff and he was relaying that story to a cardiac nurse when he got back to his institution and the he said sort of tapped him on the cheek and said oh Carl you're so silly and she said look at this patient in the parking lot who's coming for his cardiac rehab setting or session they already engage in interval training because they can't they have such low exercise capacity they can't get to a continuous moderate pace so what they do is they innate the interval train they get out of their car they take a few steps they take a break they take a few more steps they take a break it's bit like climbers on Everest right and so again that's a more empowering message I think you're just starting out that's okay you can you can train like elite athletes have trained we just have to set if they work out at a proximate level that's suitable for you rather than you know oh my goodness people are destined to be a failure because very few can engage in continuous moderate exercise for a period of even 20 or 30 minutes because their capacities are so low so it's a bit of you know behavioral colleagues talk about message framing I think there's a lot of that we can do with interval training so for those individuals who just think it's this all out crazy stuff I'd never do it it's it's it's a reframing of it for them yeah and also again the modifying the work to restoration is too is another sort of way I think but it's like oh I have to go all out for a minute or two minutes or three minutes but oh what about 10 seconds you know what about 10 seconds so it is a lot of there's a lot of ways to sort of modify the you know the hit program in general what about this the the is it high the high intensity resistance training or resistance intensity training which way it goes different ways you know some people call functional training but certainly there's high intensity resistance training you know I think can still count you know for a lot of resistance training just because the intensities are so high you know we're talking about now very high four suffered that last less than a second sometimes by a definition it's interval training we just never really think about that but so I think certainly bodyweight style type interval training or what used to be traditional calisthenics and that that can play a role here so I think again using this generic term interval training I think we can have more aerobic style interval training or resistance style interval training and again bodyweight style interval training would sort of be the classic one to me that is interval resistance training and I think it can have tremendous benefit you know it's often a sort of a middle ground you're you're not going to see the gains in strength that you would see with traditional heavy weight lifting exercise and you're not necessarily going to see the gains in fitness that you would have with a traditional well structured aerobic training program but you can get a lot of both right in the middle you know especially if you know we're talking air squats burpees at push-ups where you also keep recovery periods relatively short you know you engage in that for 10 to 20 minutes you can keep your max your heart rate up to about 80% of maximum but you've done a lot of resistance style training that's increasing functional strength as well I think it's a tremendous way to for people to train it sounds like a lot of crossfit kind of um I think it's yeah absolutely you know now maybe not necessarily as intense as some of these programs that you see but absolutely that style of functional training whatever you want to call it or label it can be extremely beneficial I think and in a time efficient way you get strength gains and some aerobic conditioning as well can you get any muscle muscle mass mass gains even strength veins from high intensity interval training let's let's say if you're want a my positionary bike and you're cranking the resistance out yeah so it it that one really depends where you're starting level is right and and so if you're already relatively fit and healthy then the the general belief is that you're not going to see massive changes in muscle protein synthesis or changes in fiber size or anything like that even with fairly intensive sprinting now if you're someone just starting out you think of a very deconditioned elderly individual who is going to get on the bike and do some moderate pushes there you know we're so we're not tucking all out sprint training they could see some improvements in protein synthesis you know and again are we talking mitochondrial mild fervilir but I think traditional muscle protein synthesis we're seeing an increase in fiber size in that if your baseline is very very low then I think even aerobic style interval training can be beneficial there but otherwise you know once you get to a certain level it's not a high-perch or vistimulus generally speaking yeah okay because I crank my resistance up really high I'm like a ton and I'm standing and doing it you know like I'm like this test be something on my my pods and well you know you you look at you know look at two-referon cyclists right like I mean they're amazingly muscle now they're very very lean as well right how much of that is that was covered in layer of fat how much muscle would there be there but you know I I think there it's not nothing but you know you can get much greater gain in protein synthesis was some more traditional squad exercise and things like that with a lot lot less volume of work can you just lift I mean like can you you know like let's say you're doing a more of a resistance training like higher intensity resistance training circuit or like you're talking about um I mean there's can you just get by what's doing that I mean yeah again right compared to what but you know so like like I don't like only doing heavy resistance training as traditionally practiced I think you're you're definitely leaving something on the table in terms of cardiovascular spirit or fitness and health benefits and all of that I think it's a really good question of you know again if it's that person like we talked about the classic individual you know type a limited time still engaged in real life with rust responsibilities family job things like that and they have an hour a week to train if they only did high intensity functional training calisthenic style bodyweight style exercise I could see a lot of value in that right in terms of aerobic conditioning and gains in in strength you know coming back to what we talked about earlier you know if it's if it's four sessions a week they can do maybe two of those are high intensity functional training or bodyweight style training and two or more interval training for aerobic conditioning on a bike on elliptical things like that you know you only have three woo I'm not sure how it did be those up but still getting some variation in ideally but yeah I have a lot of time for high intensity functional training yeah what about the combination of aerobic training with resistance training this chronic interference effect like you've heard about where if I do my aerobic exercise right you know in conjunction with my my lifting I'm gonna blunt my gains I mean at least that's what I interpreted some of that yeah so you know the I think where the evidence is and if you look at the latest systematic reviews and meta analyses what they're gonna say is maybe there's a slight interference effect maybe it's there to a greater extent with high intensity interval training and certainly if you do it within the same session maybe there's some blending but if you look at the work right now it there's some evidence to say cycling is okay but running is not there's some evidence to say actually running is okay but cycling's not so there's no clear answer I think the bottom line is there might be a slight interference effect in some people especially when they do it very very close together or in as part of the same session but it's probably relatively small it's probably relatively negligible in the big picture but if you're someone who's really looking to eat out maximal gains you're probably want to leave a few hours in between your training sessions yeah I was the the interest had kind of sparked because well one because you hear about it but also from I think it was stew's recent study where they're combining aerobic exercise with resistance training and it was like actually it was there a little bit of a beneficial effect in summer regard to blood flow or something like that so it was you know certainly I think you know it's like a lot of things with interval training you can pick your study to argue one side of the other but you know I I think that and of course meta analyses are based on all these studies some good some less good but I think that's the sort of the state of the field is it's probably not a big deal for most people including if look I got half an hour today I can do both I can't split this up because I can't train tomorrow one and do both right but again if you want to eat out every bit of the drop then ideally separate it by a little bit of time a couple hours at least okay all right um the the if the guidelines that are set you kind of we touched on it a little bit and this is a this is a big question that people ask all the time you know there's these guidelines that are set by a variety of committees it seems like there's a lot of consensus in terms of the guidelines for moderate intensity aerobic exercise anywhere between 150 to 300 minutes a week or vigorous intensity exercise and that's 75 to 150 minutes a week I think something like that um where where do you think in your opinion does high intensity interval training fit into that equation is there a new time frame and let's say for people that are optimizing for general health or also for people wanting to also get that you know back to the drama study you know I do want to be closer to that elite sort of performer level using hit um so for for those kind of people there a guideline in your opinion or what what's your opinion on so so there's a ton there so so first thing you know let's remember these are physical activity guidelines or not exercise guidelines so we're talking about physical activity guidelines you're right there is general international consensus that hasn't changed that much if anything it's just increased the number a little bit in the latest guidelines US guidelines for Americans the the WHO World Health Organization guidelines are consistent and they're exactly what you just said 150 to 300 minutes of moderate or half if you're doing it vigorous and how is that defined well moderate is defined in an absolute sense of about of not about its three to five point nine mats three to five point nine metabolic equivalents or five to six on a 10 point rating scale and what that means subjectively is you can talk but you can't sing so you're exercising with a partner you could carry on a conversation at a moderate effort but you couldn't sing vigorous effort is above six mats seven or eight on a 10 point scale and you could only say a couple of words so you couldn't carry on a conversation say a couple of words short phrases so that's sort of the subjective and objective measurements of moderate and vigorous and those are fairly consistent now you know American College of Sports Medicine would have some different numbers there at least in terms of percentages of heart rate and things like that but that's generally where we are moderate to to vigorous and those are for what are deemed substantial health benefits not saying that's the best way to increase your view to max it's saying there's really good data from a wide variety of sources that if you engage in this level of weekly physical activity you can expect substantial health benefits brain muscle you know lots of lots of things um it's not saying it's ideal either that's not necessarily optimal because there's always a caveat that more is better so you can ring a little bit more out of sponge if you're going to engage in more and there's not um you know there's the only other recent change was really that there used to be this guideline that said you have to accumulate these in boats lasting at least 10 minutes and that was removed because it was never really supported scientifically and so at least that change I think has opened up a little window on this notion of all activity counts and it was partly I think some recognition of there's some studies out there showing that very short efforts can be associated with some improvements in some of these um health markers so the guidelines are just that there you know suggestions or recommended amounts to derive health benefits when we're talking physical activity they're not saying this is the way that elite athletes should train in order to optimize their performance so I think we really need to recognize what the guidelines are and the last point of this my understanding based on talking of these experts is they tend to be conservative because ideally they would like metrics like doing this amount we know is associated with a lower risk for all cause mortality or is a lower risk for developing cardiovascular disease and many these other chronic ailments and so we just don't have anywhere close to that body of evidence when it comes to interval training you know we may eventually so where does hit fit in the big picture I think and again I spoke to people for my book people like I'm in Lee at Harvard Dr. I'm in Lee who's engaged with some of these committees and the point was well hit already fits within the guidelines and I said well is it only the hit efforts or the recovery intervals as well so if you do a 20 minute hit session but half of that is resting and half of that is the exercise her point would be no you count both right or another example of interval training is so many team sports right I like to play ice hockey my wife is a soccer player and so in those for parts of the game you're active and exercising very vigorously and for the parts you're not moderate or low intensity effort so with those if you engage in a one hour of pickup ice hockey but you're only playing every other shift you can probably count the hour within that so I think interval training and hit already falls within the guidelines and certainly it would fall within the guidelines of vigorous activity will we ever see the guidelines say 150 minute 150 to 300 of moderate 75 to 150 of vigorous or 30 to 60 of very vigorous exercise and you know a new breakpoint maybe but I think the people that write the guidelines will want to see a lot more evidence until we're going to get to that point or you know will there be some acknowledgement of these types of VILPA you know or at least engage in VILPA like efforts for five minutes a day you know 30 minutes of VILPA like efforts have also been shown to be associated with this you know the UK guidelines explicitly refer to hit the WHO and and the US guidelines really do not at least in terms of incorporating it so it's going to continue to evolve but I know that's probably a long wind in the answer but that's probably the best perspective that I could offer on that right now. Yeah I think that's good and I do think that the alluding to the VILPA studies I mean again like you said I mean you're talking about you know to some I mean it's a pretty minimum of effective dose to get 30 to 40% reduction in all cause mortality and cancer mortality right I mean it's not the 80% of the you know at least the elite performing people that had the highest VILPA to max but and and for that you know you may you may you need to do need probably need to do more but for for some people that are just generally wanting to get you know 50% reduction or something like maybe you know doing doing 60-75 minutes a week would and that you know because you're I get this question a lot and you alluded to it earlier whether we like it or not a lot of people still want that answer is how little can I get away with and the guidelines don't really address that right or they at least there's no grudging acknowledgement for saying look we know most of you probably aren't going to do this so at the very least do this right they there's been no movement on on that if anything we're just encouraging people to do more so it is it is maybe a gap or at least we should confront that reality that there's a big disconnect there for a lot of people. Another sort of I think research gap is the sex differences and it's it's definitely of interest to many many women of all stages of life so acknowledging the research gaps I'm still going to ask you some opinions to see if there are any I know there's also I think some misconceptions in the general audience with the general population also so it'd be nice to kind of even touch on some of those one being you know postmenopausal women like is hit good or bad for postmenopausal women like on the bad side some women are worried about raising cortisol to high do many thoughts on doing hit for a postmenopausal women so specifically on the cortisol level and again I think the latest systematic reviews meta and allysies you know the studies vary a little bit but by and large I don't think individuals need to worry about chronic increases in cortisol levels systemically that are going to cause them damage clearly cortisol levels can go up just like catacolymes go up acutely during exercise but I think there's some evidence now that was suggested actually in individuals that practice interval training basal cortisol levels actually stay lower than prior to to baseline so I don't think it needs to be a major concern especially given a lot of the other benefits that we can see with this type of approach so that's that's on the the the cortisol issue specifically yeah and that I mean given all the benefits we've talked about the cardiovascular respiratory muscle you know skeletal muscle you know the brain I mean there's just it's it's it's it's pretty clear to me that I mean it'd be hard it'd be a hard cell to say oh no it's not beneficial for both menopause I know you know very different is you know individuals with PCOS poly system or you can it is there's ongoing work as some really good work out of Norway looking specifically at hit in individuals with back conditions so showing some some real benefits there on the sex-based differences you know writ large are there sex-based differences in some outcomes yes I I think they're subtle at least the evidence to this point would suggest there are some differences there probably subtle differences but we knew we do need to know a lot more you know are there massive differences between for example phases of the menstrual cycle or or a contraceptive users versus naturally cycling females again maybe some but probably pretty subtle so that doesn't mean they're not important but I think the differences are are likely small and in most outcomes but absolutely we just you know need more research we need more research on diversity of responsiveness writ large not necessarily even just biological males and females you know and you've talked about this on other episodes you know it's an active area of research and it's a frustrating area of research sometimes so I'll give you a very specific example some of our research right now is looking at the mechanisms for the increase in VO2 max with very short sprint type interval training right and so we know that that increases VO2 max but we're not sure why and actually some of the work would suggest maybe it's more the muscle adaptations than we thought about or at least the cardiac output changes take a while so I have a PhD student immersed in this area and his first study we show that VO2 max goes up stroke volume was up cardiac output was up after 12 weeks of training and it looked like there were some differences between the males and female participants in the study so we did a secondary analysis wasn't appropriately powered and we thought yeah actually it doesn't look like the women are responding very much or the females and the males are so then we repeat the whole study using more best practice procedures properly controlling for menstrual cycle phase and properly expressing fitness per fat free mass and we were basically unable to replicate original findings and we certainly didn't see any evidence of a sex-based difference which tells me something we've handwave around a little bit around our conversation at this point there's tremendous inter-individual variation in responsiveness and so at least right now to my mind in terms of potential differences in responsiveness to specifically sprint type training it might be less about a male or female biology issue and it might just be there's tremendous variability between individuals and in the almost 40 participants in the combined two studies it happened to be men people identified as males that responded to a greater extent but it might not have anything to do with biological sex and I think that's where a lot many areas are right now not all of them some there's very clear differences but I think that's where the exercise field is writ large and the vast majority of studies have not incorporated these best practices for making systematic comparisons between sexes right yeah and also I think differences in like at least for me it's like there's environmental like how much sleep I got like things that will also affect you know my ability to perform and you know things like that so yeah I mean there's a lot of gaps in the field and you know with respect to women and menstrual cycle it's also a question I get a lot and I you know the I think the reality of it is that you know 20 to 30% of menstruating women are you know during their menstruation are iron deficient and they just don't even know about it they don't even know about it they're not thinking about it they're not increasing their dietary and take a fire and they're not supplementing with iron during that period and maybe that alone also would affect some I mean iron's important for him right and that's no the others and if you talk to these female athletes are like even if there is I don't get to pick one my race date is I know I have to peak for this day in four months time you know in this location maybe you can structure your training around the menstrual cycle a little bit but I think the reality that that's just the reality obviously for women who compete in in sport and so yes we need to know if there's some differences there but in the big picture it doesn't really matter it's just one more thing that potentially contributes to variability in responsiveness on the day and you try and control all the other things as well as you can you know to to peak as best you can on the day or your event or your key event does high-end entity interval training effect bone nasser bone density you know this is where you know go like to this point you know I've encouraged us to think about mode specific when we're making some of these comparisons I think that's where it depends right and so we know that more higher impact events or activities certainly when we're young tend to you know lay down more more bone and so you know for talking high intensity cycling versus high intensity running those things are very different right are you running on concrete are you running outside in beautiful trails all of those things matter you know the flip side to that is if we talk about injury risk people say like I can't do high intensity train I'm the increase my risk for injury well you know I'm someone with classic left knee osteoarthritis I just tore my niscissin my right knee playing hockey so I'm gonna have a osteoarthritis and that knee soon I can engage in very vigorous interval training on the bike I can't and I don't run anymore so you know hit training on the bike no problem any sort of running outside is excruciating for me so joint problems in general um people people can do think people can engage in in cycling I do yes and you know we know certainly and again like I'm not an expert in this area but you know talking to experts and just trying to read and stay abreast of the literature you know we know that people who have joint injuries certainly meniscal injuries are osteoarthritis one of the best things that you can do is remain active and it's obviously frustrating advice for many people because they're like I want to be active but it hurts when I'm active and so moving towards less weight bearing activities that allow you to be active around the joint and maybe you know help with the the tissues around the joint but aren't impactful forces so cycling is a fantastic exercise for individuals with osteoarthritis because you can still engage in fairly vigorous activity without hurting or damaging you know specifically your knees in this case yeah that's great I know there's there's quite a few people that are under the misconception that they cannot do any type of high intensity interval training because they have joint issues so yeah they don't want to do box jumps right but yeah I mean jumping rope which may actually be good great for the bones I mean it's impactful and you can do certainly do high intensity intervals with jumping rope as well what about so there's we talk about like some of this you know we're talking about some of these like misconceptions I guess and you kind of touched on this a little bit when we're talking about maybe you know people that are shouldn't engage in high intensity interval training like the people with a fib or in giant a peck that heart problem the the the fact that doing high intensity interval training could cause a fib or coronary calcification or just even like elite athletes in general like you at the high level you can see they have a higher tendency for a fib and coronary calcification but on the same in the same breath they also have a lower risk of you know cardiovascular related mortality is there a way to reconcile those things so again not expert but my read of this including you know there's some really good reviews that have come out recently and again we could drop those in the show notes to direct people to reading on this but the you know the old Latin phrase the the poison is in the dose right there there's definitely evidence that individuals who over a lifetime engage in very high intensity very high volume exercise may be a greater risk for some of these issues that you just referred to heart heart issues um the to my read in my understanding while there's theories out there the definitive cause and effect or mechanistic basis hasn't been definitively established and the other is it's been pointed out that those date like while clearly that risk is there and you see examples of this it doesn't fit or doesn't line up with the longevity data which is still that you know lifetime runners will still have you know a few more years of life compared to others so I think it's a it's an issue that still really needs to be resolved and probably the safest advice would be you know extreme exercise may carry some some consequences right whether it's a U shape or the the J shape curve there is something to that and if you're on you know this is for the vast majority of people this isn't an issue but you know if you are that extreme uh exercise or you just need to be mindful of fact that that may carry some increased cardiovascular risk yeah um so I one more odd ball question before my last one which is um what are your thoughts on this like hypoxic training like have you heard like the mouth taping during like a hit or so my sense would I yes yes I've definitely heard of it you know clearly when you move to more intensive exercise the vast majority of revendulation is through your mouth so it's it's really hard to engage in vigorous exercise when you're restricting either nasal breathing or mouth breathing you're you're gonna compromise your performance it may feel really hard you know uh because you're inducing this added stress whether it's beneficial I'm not convinced uh of that you know I think the data around blood flow restricted training is much more interesting and there's some really uh really interesting work coming out of out of that you know you can make the case that maybe you're gonna see some changes in respiratory or diaphragm muscular or that but getting back to the idea of what limits view to max it's generally not a pulmonary limitation it's a heart limitation and so strategies that are really trying to additionally stress the pulmonary system so you know if you if people want to try it find I don't think there's tremendous evidence that that's gonna um potentially a training uh responses what's the uh interesting thing about blood flow restrictions? Well just you know like I think death you know as as a therapist so I um I'm aware of some ongoing work I guess that's about and you know this is an artwork but I'm aware of some work looking at blood flow restriction exercise and training in very very high level uh endurance athletes uh showing some interesting changes in performance related metrics or or some measures um and yeah so I like I say that work is ongoing um the hard thing with these is it's you can't truly blind someone to blood flow restricted training right like many of these interventions that we've talked about it's tough to have a true control who's completely blinded to the intervention that can influence some some things but you know the the idea of blood flow restricted training allowing individuals getting back to joint issues maybe working at a lower absolute force or workload but still seeing the metabolic stresses induce with blood flow restricted training. You know there's some there's some interesting work there I think so and well patience where do you see this is this is my last question for you where do you see the future of well specifically high intensity interval training research and um you know like the training methodologies where's where's it going like how we can find really you know how we can define good studies to optimize for VO2 max to optimize for like mitochondrial biogenesis and these these these important measures of longevity and health and performance for the athletes too but um where do you see the field going yeah so a whole bunch of levels there and I think it you know what's the most it's like how do we spend our tax dollars right what's the most important education health all of that but I think given the pervasiveness of physically inactivity writ large there's a lot of behavioral work that needs to be done there around is it a viable public health strategy what are the best strategies to encourage people to engage in any physical activity behavior but could brief vigorous physical activity intermittent physical activity non exercise physical activity could we have interventions that behavioral interventions that will finally encourage people to to do that so that I think that's a massive area that that needs to get looked at number two is you know clear them up proponent for interval training but I fully recognize that we haven't done or just they're not out there these large scale randomized clinical trials making very good comparisons between traditional endurance exercise and interval type training with proper what we call non-inferiori to designs which is like what's the margin of if there is a difference it doesn't matter right so maybe that's half a met or point two of a met whatever your metric is and design your studies so it's like if we show that margin of non-inferiori then it's good enough we can basically call these things the same because a lot of the comparison studies to date are relatively small and so there might be real biological or health related differences there but the sample size is just aren't large enough to be able to detect that and so certainly in my own work you know as I progress into what's the probably the final phase of my career is I think we've we've asked a lot of interesting questions in our work we've mainly done relatively small scale proof of concept studies but in our own work we're thinking a lot more about rigorous research design and I think the field of exercise science generally is wrestling with this issue of moving towards proper sample size estimates proper power calculations registering trials so we don't have systemic bias creeping into results p hacking things like that so I think that's a very big area of maybe we need fewer smaller studies that generally look the same and a lot more groups collaborating larger multi-center trials you know being engaged in some of this work right now easier said than done but I think that's where we need to to go to to get to the level of evidence that the people that write the physical activity guidelines might say okay now this issue is more informed right to to make some decisions there you know probably less important for the general public but the whole area of elite training for athletes right which is you know invariably almost all of these athletes are experiments of one so you know if kipchogi trained slightly differently with the marathon record be slightly lower you know probably not you know whom I had a question kipchogi's training but I think we continue to wrestle with this like we don't really know all these experiments event of one and elite coaching is that blend of art and science but we don't have these large you know interventional studies and athletes saying exactly what's the best way to train we have some of them we touched on them but they're really really hard to do but if you're interested in elite performance and then maybe the I'm sure I'm missing lots but probably the final one would be technological advancements right there's just been huge advancements obviously around sleep research activity tracking things like that you know continuous lactate monitoring and athletes will that really move the needle or you know revolutionize training using some of these markers maybe you and also data and activity tracking for every day people as well you know the ubiquity of smart phones and watches and things like that getting back to the behavior you know can we encourage people with activity prompts and things like that like is that a viable strategy is that it's never really going to work in the real world so these sort of translational studies that continue to move research out of the laboratory into real world settings so that we can truly move towards effectiveness studies as opposed to efficacy studies I think is where the field needs to go awesome well Marty thank you so much for taking quite a bit of time to have this discussion with me today I mean I learned quite a bit and I know people are going to really enjoy learning this you know everything that we talked about today I know so we talked about your book the one minute workout people can find that Amazon I mean anywhere right do you ebook form hard copy yeah it's available everywhere and then you also have a website Martin Martin Martin Martin good ballad calm Martin kabala dot calm and then a twitter twittle handle is at give ballum good ball m so g i b a l m some of certain in first-in-nish okay awesome so people can go to those places to learn more about kind to see interval training your website your book and also follow one twitter if they want to yeah absolutely you know really I started the website just so is a one stop shop in terms of you can learn about our research you can learn I put up podcast interviews like this links to the book links to Dr. Philips and I have a free online course that people can take called hacking exercise for for health you know let me just add one last thing is opportunities like this to engage in knowledge translation science communication it it's huge right and in writing the book one of the things that had to get comfortable with you know in science we want to control everything and if you move you know when you're writing research papers you get a little controversial or you move outside a little bit and you just get whacked right whereas I think when you're boiling down or trying to boil down information for the general public or other knowledge users and we don't have all the answers we just have to sort of give our best guesses not move outside the lanes too much but say this is the best evidence right now it's it's not perfect and so the way you do a podcast interview or write a book for the general public it's very different from you write how you write a scientific article and that's okay right there's some people who will only write scientific articles never move outside their area let's find well do what you're comfortable with but you know that also has limitations right because that many of these things are still behind pay walls people can't get to them and so science communication knowledge translation is is really really important so thanks for this opportunity and and the work that you do on on on this podcast I think it's tremendously important thank you so much and it's it's nice to to know that other scientists will be listening and there are collaborations that can also happen out of podcasts as well so it's it's it's been a pleasure Marty and thank you for everything you do and for coming on podcast today thank you very much

a little less than 50% of people's first brush with a symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death. That's worth repeating because I remember being asked this question in medical school. You're sitting there as a first year medical student in cardiovascular pathology class and the pathologist said, what's the single most common presenting feature for someone having a cardiovascular disease the first time and everyone was like chest pain, shortness and breath, you know, rattling off all the usual. So if he goes no sudden death today, it's not quite 50%. But that's a very sobering statistic. Right now, I'm mostly optimized around energy balance, which you know, stay in energy balance and protein intake. And so most of my conscious effort around my diet goes into making sure I'm getting 40 to 50 grams of protein four times a day. Hi everyone. I'm sitting here with the amazing doctor Peter at the many of you don't need an intro to him. He has changed our understanding of the scientific literature, preventative medicine with respect to longevity, improving health span. He's a number one New York time best-selling author of the book Outlive, amazing book. Also, he has a very popular podcast on health and medicine. One of the few podcasts that I listen to called the Drive. And he's also a renowned speaker. So public speaking, he does a lot of that as well and you can find a lot of lectures he's given on YouTube. So I'm very excited to be sitting here with you today Peter. And having this conversation, you were on the podcast many years ago about eight years ago. Yeah, I was going to say like probably 2016, right? I think it. Maybe I'll hear. You might have been like 2015. You might have been one of the, like the first, I don't know, six or seven guests. I mean, you were like one of the first guests that I had on the podcast. So it was a long time. You were still at Newseek. Yeah. Yeah. So it was a while ago. Well, thank you for having me back. So let's dive into to like maybe a general question that I kind of have for you, which is what ignited your interest in the field of longevity. I mean, I think it's a, it was kind of an intersection of two things, but but I think the critical spark was the birth of my daughter. And I'm right about this a little bit in the book, but you know, I think, you know, in my mid-30s, she's born and all of a sudden that became a manner in which I contemplated my own mortality. And I, it's not like I hadn't been aware or had been blind to my family history, but I have a very bad family history for cardiovascular disease. And so now the idea that I had this daughter and boy, she was like, I mean, I, I just adored her more than I could have imagined during my wife's pregnancy. It was so real. And I also kind of realized, like, you know, if I don't figure out what's going on here, I'm going to potentially leave this planet sooner than I would like. And therefore leave her and potentially other kids to come along. So so it was really those two things that really catapulted me into, at the time, just trying to understand everything I could with respect to cardiovascular disease. That became my initial obsession. So it was really less about longevity and more about that. But of course, once you dive into that, you realize, well, you know, what, what does it benefit you if you figure out how to not dive of heart disease, but you dive of some other thing? Or what is it, you know, eventually, what does it benefit you to delay your death, but have allows you quality of life? So then, you know, all of these things just came as an evolution out of that. It's funny because I actually have a very similar story about the birth of my son. And my, I mean, I remember times, like, you know, within the first couple of years of my son being born going from my long runs and stopping in the middle of my run and literally balling my eyes out. Because I knew there was a time that I was going to be gone and he was going to be without me. And it was so hard to think about that. And so, you know, like, everything that you just said completely resonates with me, where it's like, I want to be around when my grandkids are, you know, getting older. I want to be not only around, but I want to be jumping rope with them. I want to teach them to jump rope. And so, like, all of those things have sort of crossed my mind at the same time, with respect to the cardiovascular disease that you mentioned and you talk about this in the book as well, there's a statistic that I've read from the National Health Statistics website, which is that every 33 seconds someone dies from cardiovascular disease in the United States. So when people here with cardiovascular disease, I mean, at least even me, when I, well, the cardiovascular disease, what is that? What does it mean? Where is atherosclerosis coming to play? Where does coronary heart disease? What is cardiovascular disease? I mean, you could define it very broadly and include valvular disease and cardiomyopathy's and all of those things. But when we talk about a, cvd, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States and globally, it's leading cause of death for men and women. What we're referring to is the disease of coronary arteries that leads to ischemia. And, you know, just to take us back for a moment when you think about all of these chronic diseases, which I'm sure we'll get into today cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, et cetera. Things that you and I have spoken about a lot, including when you run my podcast. It's important to understand that this is the disease for which we have the clearest understanding. So, you know, our understanding of what initiates and propagates cancer is very small compared to our understanding on the cardiovascular front. Our understanding of this on the neurodegenerative genocide is also quite small. There are still many things we don't understand. So, you know, everything we're about to talk about on the cardiovascular side should be at least thought of in the context of how wonderful is it that we understand these things because we have the most tools for prevention here. So, with that said, what we're really talking about that does the lion's share of killing. And again, I'll bracket for a moment that there are other things that are people that are dying from, you know, cardiomyopathy, is there are people that are dying from valbular cardiovascular disease and things of that nature. But the majority of what's happening is a disease that leads to plaque formation inside of coronary arteries and we can go as deeper as shallows you want into that and why that happens and how that's a function of endothelial injury like a protein burden and inflammation. But this leads to a reduction in blood flow to key parts of the heart muscle. And when that happens, the heart undergoes anischemic event. Now, sometimes I can be chronic and sometimes that can be acute. And if an acute event occurs in a region where enough muscle of the heart is compromised, that's going to result in sudden death. That's a heart attack. And it's important to understand that a little, when I was in medical school, it was more than 50%, it's now a little less than 50%, but it's still a very high number. A little less than 50% of people's first brush with a symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death. That's worth repeating because it's, we couldn't, I remember, I still remember being asked this question in medical school, you know, you're sitting there as a first year medical student in cardiovascular pathology class and the pathology said, what's the single most common presenting feature for someone having cardiovascular disease the first time? And everyone was like chest pain, shortness and breath, you know, rattling off all the usual. So if he goes, no, sudden death. Again, today it's not quite 50%, but that's a very sobering statistic. Absolutely. I do want to dive into some of the, you know, major causes of the atherosclerosis and the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that you're talking about. So life of proteins, you mentioned. And, you know, the most people, they hear about life of protein, they hear about LDL or HTL. But apobie, why should people know about apobie? Well, again, I think it's worth maybe just getting everybody on the same page with cholesterol. Let's start with that, right? So everybody's heard of cholesterol and I think most people would probably even have kind of a negative valence when they think about it's like cholesterol is a bad thing. So it's worth explaining that that's not really true, right? cholesterol is an essential thing, right? So without cholesterol, we wouldn't be alive. And, you know, there are really rare, fortunately, genetic conditions in which cholesterol synthesis is compromised and those tend to be fatal in utero. So if, if an organism can't make enough cholesterol, it ceases to exist. Because cholesterol is the thing that gives every cell fluidity, the membrane of every cell fluidity. And it's the precursor to some of the most important hormones we make. So in the case of us as humans, right, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone cortisol, these essential hormones are all made from cholesterol. So every cell in the body with the exception of red blood cells makes plenty of cholesterol. The lion's share of it is probably done by the liver and the strutal tissues. And we have to figure out a way to move this stuff around the body. And the the highway system of the body is the blood and the blood of course is water. So if we want to move things that are water soluble throughout the body like proteins and ions, it's easy because they dissolve freely in water and they move around. But when you want to move something around water that is not water soluble, such as cholesterol as a lipid, you have to wrap it in something that is water soluble. And that's something is the lipoprotein. And the big protein on the surface of that sphere is called an apolipoprotein. And they're broadly speaking two classes of apolipoproteins. There are the A class and the B class. So some of the lipoproteins are wrapped in an apolipoprotein called apob 100. And we just abbreviate that to apob, but I'll just say at this one time and we'll never talk about it again. There's also an apob 48 that wraps another type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. We won't talk about that again because it doesn't really factor into cardiovascular disease. So apob is short for apolipoprotein B100, which is the structural apoprotein that sits on low density lipoproteins abbreviated LDL's. I intermediate density lipoproteins abbreviated ideals very low density lipoproteins abbreviated VL deals. The apo A's, and this is big A, never to be confused with apolittle A, which we may talk about. Those wrap the family of high density lipoproteins. There are much more complicated than apob's, believe it or not, and there are many of them. But nevertheless, broadly speaking, that's what's going on. So why do we care about all this stuff? Well, in the 1950s, when it became clear that cholesterol was playing a role in cardiovascular disease, the first observation was people with very, very, very high total cholesterol, because at the time that was all that could be measured was total cholesterol. By the way, what that meant was the total amount of cholesterol in all of your lipoproteins, in your HDL's, in your LDL's, and in your VL deals. Those three lipoproteins constitute the amount of total cholesterol you have in the lipoproteins. We can come back to this idea because it's important. That represents about 10% of the total cholesterol on your body. The total cholesterol concentration was loosely correlated with cardiovascular outcomes. But only at extremes, meaning if you took people whose total cholesterol was in the top 5% and compared them to people whose total cholesterol was in the bottom 5%, there was a clear association with cardiovascular disease. March forward many, many decades, we came to realize that actually this low density lipoprotein, which is a subset of your total cholesterol, that's the cholesterol contained within the low density lipoproteins, that's much more strongly associated. And what we now know is the case, is there's an even better way to predict risk than just saying how much cholesterol is contained within the low density lipoproteins. A better way to predict risk is to add up the concentration of all the apob particles. So that number, apob, measured in milligrams per desolier, is the concentration of the entire burden of particles that are capable of undergoing something that I'm sure we'll talk about, which is the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. So how the apob number, can you talk about how that, so you mentioned LDL, total, total LDL cholesterol? That number is like some a quake, it's like determined by some equation, right? And it can be, but it can also be measured directly. Yes, so there's what that be particle number if it's called, you know? Yeah. So there's there's two ways to go about doing this. So in the olden days and unfortunately many labs still do this, they rely on an equation called the Freeter Walde equation. So total cholesterol is relatively easy to measure. So you draw the plasma, you spin it down, and you basically lice all of the lipoproteins, and you can measure total cholesterol. So if you, if you just basically apply something to lice all of the proteins, you'll say, all the lipoproteins, you'll say total cholesterol is 200 milligrams per desolier. Then they directly also measure two other things. They can directly measure total triglyceride concentration, and using a separate assay, they can measure the total concentration of cholesterol within the HDL particles. So now you've measured total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride. The Freeter Walde equation stems from an observation that kind of sort of on average sometimes, VLDL cholesterol is approximately one-fifth the triglyceride concentration. So the Freeter Walde equation is quite literally used to estimate LDL as follows. LDL cholesterol is estimated as total cholesterol, less HDL cholesterol, less triglyceride concentration divided by five if you're doing everything in milligrams per desolier. And unfortunately, most labs still do that. So when you look at your cholesterol report, it'll say LDL C, it'll give a number, and unless it says direct, you can assume they've done the Freeter Walde equation, which is, I've seen that wrong more often than I've seen it right. A good lab will do a direct assay. They will actually measure LDL concentration, and they will give you in milligrams per desolier the total concentration of LDL C. That is still an inferior predictor of risk relative to APOB. Yes, okay, so let's, the reason I wanted to mention that LDL C is because, as you mentioned, many labs do measure it indirectly, and there are many types of LDL, right? So there are different densities and sizes. So I'm curious about what your thoughts are on the different sizes of like more atherogenic sizes of LDL, such as the smaller dense particles. And like how you view that, like, the different particle sizes and the particle number, and then of course APOB. So like the whole. I mean, there's been a big evolution in the way we've practiced medicine in our practice with respect to this. So 10 years ago, we were looking at LDL particle number, which the both the Mesa population, so the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, and the framing him, offspring population, have both demonstrated unequivocally, that when you compared LDL particle number to LDL cholesterol, LDL particle number, always predicted risk better than LDL cholesterol. So how would you do this? You would follow people longitudinally for cardiovascular events, and you would do this in sort of a, like a cumulative insulin incidence graph, so on the x-axis, you have time on the y-axis, you have incidence of cardiovascular disease, and you plot out everybody as a function of whether LDL C was higher or lower than, as a percentile, than LDL P. So LDL P stands for the part number of particles LDL C is the concentration of cholesterol. And this was, again, unequivocally the case, particle number always predicted better. So how do you count the number of particles? Well, it turns out there are different ways to do this. You can do this using NMR. So nuclear magnetic resonance is like how an MRI work, so it's applying a magnetic field. It's basically doing, I mean, this is being a little cheeky, but it's sort of like doing an MRI on the blood, and you can count the number of particles that way. That's not actually the gold standard, but that's the way it's most commonly done in clinical practice. It can also be done with ion motility. We switched from NMR to ion motility for LDL P because it was more accurate, but ultimately, this is now about five years ago, we actually switched to APOB, which was superior on all fronts. And here's the reason why. First of all, there are different ways in labs to do this. So lab core, for example, embossed in heart, have different magnets and different algorithms for how they run the LDL P. So if you run an LDL P on each of those labs, you'll get a different number. That's a bit disturbing to me. I want to know that the APOB that I get at one lab is the same as the APOB I get at another lab, and it's standardized across all fronts. But there's a more important reason why I favor APOB over LDL P, and that is, it encompasses the total atherogenic burden. And you can get burned and fooled by patients who have very high VL DL, meaning they have a high burden of very low density lipoproteins, even if their LDL burden is low. So I won't go into it because it's so nerdy, it's not worth getting this deep in the weeds, but there are certain genetic conditions where people have completely normal LDL, but very elevated VL DL. And they have a very high-athogenic risk. And you will miss that if you're looking at LDL P or LDL C, you will not miss that if you're looking at APOB. What about the fact that if small dense LDL, which has been shown to be more atherogenic, so APOB does become, so you mentioned the structural role of APOB in the lipoproteins, it's very important. It also plays a role, as you mentioned, in allowing the lipids to be soluble in the plasma. But it becomes, it plays a role also in recycling, so it gets, you know, an interacts with the LDL receptor and can be taken back up in the filler. The small dense LDL particles, it APOB somewhat obscured as the LDL particle gets smaller in size and more dense. Therefore, it's not too hard or too clear. Hard of a clear exactly. So what about in the case, and the reason I'm asking is because, as you mentioned, APOB is on VL DL, ideal LDL, right? But there's different sizes of these LDL. And the larger and more buoyant LDL is better than having a higher proportion of the smaller dense LDL. Right. That's why APOB captures that risk. So in other words, this is another reason why I think that APOB is the great equalizer because once you have the APOB concentration, you're accounting for the fact that clearance is going down. I mean, the one way to think about this is any time you see an elevated APOB, it always comes back to something on the clearance side is not working. Now, there are really broadly speaking when I talk about this with patients. I go through the four sort of pillars of what elevates APOB. So it can be driven by cholesterol synthesis. And you can talk about that because it's going to factor into dietary choices, for example. So certain dietary patterns will lead to higher LDL than others. It's impacted by cholesterol reabsorption. So we can talk about what the life cycle of cholesterol is. But again, we make it and we reabsorb it and it gets circulated. It can have to do with triglyceride burden. So this is where insulin resistance really factors in to how APOB can go up. And ultimately, it comes down to clearance. And clearance has everything to do with the presentation of the LDL receptor on the liver, the confirmation of it, the number of them and how long they survive on the liver. And all of these things have an enormous effect, some of which we can manipulate with drugs. So, for example, all drugs that are used to LDL in some way or another indirectly or directly impact the LDL receptor. Some do it really directly like a PCS can. And it might directly does that by targeting a protein that breaks down LDL receptors. So anyway, a long-winded way of saying, this is another advantage of APOB is it allows you to in one measurement capture all of that risk. Because if you have small, if you two individuals, if you're just using LDLP as your risk, you might miss some of the elevated BLDLs. If you're looking at LDLC, you'll clearly miss some of the size issues. That should be captured in LDLP. But again, I guess maybe what you're asking is, if you have a low APOB, but they're all small, is that worse than having a low APOB where they're all big. And the answer is probably, but you'll also see that in the, like, there are other metrics that are kind of coming on board now, which are looking at LDL triglyceride levels. So you can look at the degree to which the LDLs are cholesterol depleted. And that can also give you a sense of risk. The question is, is that a first or second order term, and I think the first order term is still going to be the number of particles. That's the biggest driver of risk. And everything else factors into it. In other words, that's not an independent risk because it's driven by the residents' time of the LDL, which is driven by the clearance rate. So let's talk about the number, so the LDL, I started the APOB number because, like, if most people go to a standard lab and they measure their APOB, there's a reference range. And it says, you know, okay, if you're less than 80 milligrams per decelerate or more. And you're excellent. Then you're, okay. Yeah. Where does that number come from? And, you know, what, like, has anyone measured APOB levels across the lifespan? Do we know, like, is there a correlation with APOB levels and the beginnings of authors? Grosses, has someone done those studies, you know, that sort of thing? Yeah. So the reference ranges are purely population-based distribution questions. So every lab will have a different way of doing this. But a general, you know, sort of philosophy for labs is, you know, so for the lab we use. And by the way, we completely ignore these reference ranges. But they're there. We can't avoid them. They're there. And we explained to our patients that we're going to editorialize on top of them. But, you know, the reference lab we use will say, APOB below 80 is wonderful. Well, 80 just happens to be the 20th percentile of the population. It will say, 82 100 is intermediate or 80 to 120, it says is intermediate risk and above 120 is very high risk. So for the lab we use, we know that 80 is the 20th percentile. 120 is the 80th percentile or the 60th percentile I can't remember. So it's, it's literally just putting you up against a population distribution. And that's it. Now, our philosophy on APOB is completely different. And as you may recall, I, I devote actually quite a bit of real estate to this in the book because I think it is such an important concept. And it is, in my opinion, certainly top three failures of medicine 2.0 is in failing to appreciate the point I'm about to make. Which is that once you understand the causality of APOB, meaning once you understand that APOB is not just associated with cardiovascular disease, but it's causally linked to it, meaning it causes a, c, b, d. To get into this discussion about managing tenure risk, thinking about being in this percent versus this percent, makes no sense. When you have causal things that cause disease, you will limit it to them. And the analogy I use is cigarettes with lung cancer. So nobody disputes that cigarettes are causally linked to lung cancer. They are. It's as clear as, you know, Tuesday follows Monday. But people forget that, you know, causality doesn't mean everybody who smokes will get lung cancer. And it doesn't mean that every person with lung cancer, smoke. So you, you don't need to necessary and sufficient, necessary or sufficient to still be causal. But our approach to patients who smoke is very clear, which is never smoke. And if you do smoke, stop immediately. Do we look at people who smoke and say, well, once your tenure risk of lung cancer reaches this threshold, we're going to tell you to stop smoking. Or once your pack year smoking is above the 50th percentile or the 80th percentile, we're going to tell you to stop. I'm absolutely not. You immediately eliminate smoking. And so similarly, it makes no sense that we would look at a causal driver of a, c, b, d in the case of a, b, and kind of take an approach of, well, being at the 20th percentile of the 30th percentile of the 40th percentile is acceptable. None of those things really makes sense. You have something that is causing the disease, you should eliminate it as soon as possible. Because it is an area under the curve problem. So after sclerosis begins at birth. When you do autopsies on people, they're very young. In fact, in the book include a photo of a guy who, you know, a man, I forget I think maybe 26 years old who was a victim of a homicide or something. So it completely unrelated death. But you look at the autopsie sections of his coronary arteries. I mean, he already had very advanced atherosclerosis. Now, it wasn't clinically relevant. It wasn't going to kill him anytime soon. But the point is this is a disease that takes decades to progress. And one of the biggest drivers of it, in addition to things like high blood pressure and smoking and insulin resistance is a, b. So to be able to take that off the table sooner, rather than later, is going to, has certainly has the potential to take atherosclerosis off its pedestal at the top of the list of killing. And so what do you, I mean, taking you, obviously can't take it off the table completely right when you need it for being. But what? Well, so, so, so, so, so let's think about it. Yeah, so, so let's start with what we know. ApoB rises with age. Right. We don't really know. There are probably a lot of little reasons. So there are, you know, endocrine changes, insulin resistance, synescence that, you know, might involve the decreased life of LDL receptors. There's no clear reason, actually. What about, so you were talking about clearance versus synthesis. And I remember our mutual friend, Ron Krauss, like I've had, you know, many conversations with him. I did my postdoc down the hall from the lab. Right. And I remember telling me that, you know, ApoB, your, your basically your liver is constantly producing it. You're making VLDL. Just just churning it out, right? And why is just going going? And we also make LDL denova, by the way. Right. Yeah, there's a denova pathway plus the VLDL tell the opact. But that, you know, the, the thing is, is that, you know, he was saying, well, from an evolutionary perspective, you're, you're making this VLDL because, as you mentioned, you know, it's transporting things throughout the body to other organs, right? Cluster all, trade, triglycerides, radiocids. It's also transporting, and this is where I was so intrigued, inflammatory protein. So cytokines, Cerec to protein also are being transported through VLDL. Now, that was important. Pre antibiotics, pre everything that we do now to combat, you know, infectious disease and viruses and bacteria, parasites, whatever. But before that time, the VLDL did serve that purpose, too. And that's why he thinks, you know, it's kind of a relic left over where the reason why we're constantly making is because it's a very large protein in size. It's like tens of millions of like, the unit versus like 50,000 or something. It's very big. And so it takes time to make it. And so I was thinking, well, like inflammation also does make it go up even further at the level of synthesis. I don't know exactly the clearance, you know, how it's regulating clearance. But do you think the aging process is mostly affecting the clearance of it? Or... My intuition is yes. My intuition is that it's primarily impacted on the clearance level, which is going to be again, some facet of LDLR, LDLR, beating LDLR receptors. So is it? We are making less of them. They are surviving less. The proteins that, you know, and that can basically done. There are many ways to regulate that process. But that's my intuition is it's less a conformational change in the LDLR and more a number of them and or a reduced amount of time that they stay present. One thing I'll add on the evolutionary front, you know, I had a guy named John Casteland on my podcast a few months ago. And he proposed a really interesting idea, which it completely makes sense evolutionarily, which you could argue sort of like we don't really need a poB. Like this is the other thing. Like most species don't have a poB. They don't require LDLR. But how I mean... They have cholesterol, but they don't, they don't, they don't require... Supporting all these, you know... You can do it with HDL. You can transport everything with HDL. Yeah. Yeah. They don't need the LDL. I think HDL was always going in reverse. Like it was bringing everything back to... No, it's actually much more complicated. I mean, and in us, LDL is doing the majority of what's called reverse cholesterol transport. So our CT, which is kind of like the good movement of cholesterol, you sort of think of the bad movement as taking cholesterol into the arteries, the good movement is taking it back to the liver, and us LDL is doing the majority of that. So HDLs are typically transferring their cholesterol to LDLs, and LDLs are bringing them back to the liver. But John made an interesting point, right, which is that, you know, in sort of following up on what you said, the evolutionary cost of making cholesterol is enormous. I mean, it's a very labor intensive step, right? I can't remember the number of ATPs that are required to make a molecule of cholesterol, but it's in the tens. Right? Like it could be 40 or something to that effect. And so we evolved to have a system that prioritized having a lot of cholesterol, being able to keep a lot of it around. Because again, this was an energy-conserving system. Now this serves us no benefit today, because today we can make plenty of it. And we are in an energy-abundant environment, which we were not in, that, you know, hundreds of thousands of years ago. And so this is a bit of an unfortunate vestige of our past. It much in the way that a lot of the things that lead to insulin resistance are a vestige to things that were once very valuable. I mean, the things that allowed us to leap up out of the swan with our swan with big brains was our primarily our capacity to store excess energy in a way that even primates can't get served us really well until 150 years ago. And I think the same is probably true of cholesterol in APOB. So going back to your question, how much APOB is enough? Well, it turns out you don't really need any of it to be perfectly fine. So if you look at a child, they're born with an LDL-Clystroller APOB level, typically below 20 milligrams per desolier. So a kid, if you think about it, has the greatest need for growth. Right? Like so, you think about the cholesterol demand of myelinating the entire central nervous system, all of the enormous explosion of straddle tissue, all of these things are done with lipoprotein levels that are incredibly low. Again, what we call physiologic levels of LDL cholesterol in APOB are in the order of 10 to 30 milligrams per desolier. And yet there are no negative consequences to such low levels of that lipoprotein burden. And it's only when we get, you know, would become teenagers and in our 20s, then we start to see those numbers go up. And again, that's really just reflected by a reduction in clearance, then some need for additional LDL. We don't have it. The majority of what we need is actually, you know, before the age of 20. Do you think so, like if you were to then estimate or speculate a level of APOB that you could say safely, well, I guess there's two things. One, you're not going to die about those sclerosis. If you maintain a level of blood. Yeah, so Peter Libby, from the Bregam, who's one of the authorities on this topic, has argued, and I reference him in my book that if you had an APOB level below about 30 milligrams per desolier, 20 to 30 milligrams per desolier, it wouldn't be possible to develop atherosclerosis. What about not dying from althoes? Like what about, like if it's the major cause of death globally? Yeah. And let's say like what it takes to get down to 30, probably is pretty aggressive. Yeah, most people cannot get down to 30 without a pharmacologic intervention. Yeah. Do you think that you would die of althoes growth as if you had, you know? If you're at 60. 60. Well, it comes down to a couple of other things. So the first thing is how long are you at 60? So if you say I've never exceeded 60, that's very different from saying, hey, I showed up and I was at 100 and 20 and you now lowered me to 60. So again, I think of, you know, I imagine like everybody walks around and you've got a graph that on the x-axis is time and on the y-axis is APOB and you have a curve and you want to figure out what the area under that curve is and that we want to minimize the area under that curve. So if you took, exactly. So if you took, so again, very similar to smoking, right? We talk about risk in pack years of smoking. So if a person smokes a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for, you know, 10 years, you know, you have a way of kind of comparing apples to apples on those things. So to have a lifetime ceiling of 60 would also be a very, very low risk individual, 60, no Lagrangian's predestilator is about the fifth percentile at the adult population level. So then that comes back to my question. Sorry, one of the measures right at across the lifespan when like, yeah, when do you start measuring this? Like, people aren't measuring their APOB and they're, you know, teenage at one. Yeah, I mean, I would argue we should be, but I want to go back and say one other thing about your question, which I should have mentioned earlier, which is, it also depends on other risk factors. So there are really four big things that are driving risk causally. APOB is one. Insulin resistance is one. Hypertension is one and smoking is one. Those are the big four. So you have to take everything you're saying on the APOB front and acknowledge that those other things are also causally linked to a, cbd. So again, it's, it's a difficult situation to imagine, but it's certainly at least theoretically plausible. You have somebody who's APOB is at 60, but they have uncontrolled hypertension type two diabetes and they smoke. I mean, you could certainly arrive at that situation pharmacologically. You're probably not going to arrive at that situation naturally. Would I say that that person is free and clear? No, I wouldn't. So we, you know, at the outside, I mentioned how the, you know, the downside of talking about a, cbd is this the number one killer. I mean, it's, you know, in fact, when you talk about it globally, the gap between a, cbd and cancer is even bigger. It's like 19 million people annually to 12 or 13 million for cancer. I mean, it's an enormous difference. But the good news is our understanding mechanistically of what drives this is so clear and our tools for prevention are some of the best and most benign. Okay. So let's say that a person is relatively healthy, you know, they're a community exerciseer, they're not in slow, I do want to talk about hypertension in slow resist, but okay, a healthy generalized, quote unquote healthy person, right? Want to lower their APOB, they want to try everything through diet, through lifestyle. And you mentioned there are some major, lifestyle dietary factors that can increase APOB. So let's talk about those. What are the major? So the big two are anything that contributes to insulin resistance. So we'll start with that. And that does so mostly through the VLDL triglyceride pathway. So we talked earlier about it how there are really two ways we make LDL, we make LDL directly. We've been most of the LDL is made through VLDL. So if you're exporting a lot of VLDL, what you're doing is both making a lot of that light-prepareting, but you also have a lot of triglyceride in it. Now something I didn't mention a moment ago that's worth restating or stating in the first place. The LDL is can't carrying around both cholesterol and triglyceride. And the more cholesterol there is, all things equal, the more LDL you need. But the same is true with triglyceride. So the first mechanism in which we see a very clear relationship between diet and APOB is the higher the burden of triglycerides, the higher the burden of APOB. To state this another way, if you take two people who have the exact same level of LDL cholesterol. And the same total cholesterol, but one has very high triglycerides in one has very low triglycerides. The former is going to have a much higher APOB. And therefore be at a much higher risk of atherosclerosis because they have more cargo and therefore require more ships in the analogy of cargo being cholesterol and triglycerides and the ships being the lipoproteins. So step number one is lower the triglyceride as much as possible. And the triglyceride being low is an enormous proxy for insulin sensitivity. So this is one of the important ways in which managing insulin resistance is a key to keeping APOB in check. And of course there are other issues as well. So insulin and glucose by themselves when elevated also create problems at the endothelial level, which becomes another mechanism by which this is problematic. It's pretty clearly observed from a dietary pattern perspective that carbohydrate restriction is the most effective tool a triglyceride reduction. All carbohydrates, I mean like vegetables foods, yeah refined and start to carbohydrates. Yeah. So, but that actually feeds really nicely into the next observation, which is what's the next dietary pattern that impacts APOB and that saturated fat consumption. And the reasons for that are too full. So the first is that saturated fat directly impacts cholesterol synthesis. Now this is not true equally of all saturated fats, but we don't really have great data on if certain saturated fats have a greater impact on cholesterol synthesis relative to others. For example, a C-16 might be potentially more so than a C-18 or a C-19. But again, what foods would you find a C-16? Oh, like a C-16 would be more in, I believe, like a coconut oil or a palm oil or something like that. Also, by the way, that would you would also see that more a C-16 like a palmate would be more of a synthesis would be more of a saturated fat you see in response to insulin resistance. So it actually be a denovo saturated fats synthesis. So perhaps so I think that's a big part of it. I think cholesterol synthesis is a big part of it. I think a bigger part of it might be that excess saturated fat inhibits the sterile binding, the sterile regulatory binding protein in the liver that results in fewer LDL receptors being made. So saturated fat therefore has two things that it's doing that are driving up a pob and the susceptibility of this varies from different individuals. So I was on a ketogenic diet for three years I was not one of the people who seemed to suffer from this. So even on a ketogenic diet where I was getting 80% of my calories from fat and probably half of that was saturated fat, I did not have any sort of obnoxious increase in my apob or LDL C or any of these metrics. Similarly, we have some patients who are on very low carb, very high-fat diets. Some of them have completely normal levels of and some of them have lipids that go absolutely haywire. So it's not entirely clear what the difference is but clearly there are different genes that will allow certain people to metabolize that saturated fat safely while others do not. So I'm not in the camp that believes that and there is an entire camp of people who believe this that if you're on a low carb high-fat diet and your apob and LDL C go through the roof it's it's not problematic. I don't believe that at all. I think that that's a very bold claim and I would not be willing to play that game. I think if your apob goes haywire, even if you're very insulin sensitive and even if you're in energy balance and all the wonderful things that might come with your ketogenic diet, I think you have to pay very close attention to if your lipids get out of whack. So those are basically your big manipulations dietary wise. It's the quantity and composition of fat and the dietary choices that address insulin sensitivity. So in the people that let's say they're eating a higher saturated fat diet if they swap that out with mono and saturated fat or even poly and saturated fat which some camps also like to demise the kind of poly and saturated fat. But if you swap that out the apob levels in our experience about half of the people who have this hyper response to saturated fat if you ISO colorically shift them to high mono and saturated fat you fix the problem. Yeah, okay. It starts to get into a little bit of an issue right which is and this is where you have to remember what problem you're solving. So for some people that's an easy switch, you know because they were kind of some people tend to go out of their way to try to eat as much saturated fat as possible. I'm not sure why like they sort of you know they're like okay while I'm doing this you know ketogenic diet and I'm just going to basically eat coconut oil and palm oil like it's my job. Yeah and so for those people you just got to say dude like stop doing it just like use all of oil on your salad and like let's be reasonable and then it fixes everything. But for other people you know it's it just can't be addressed and and I've heard other people say oh you know this is crazy like we know that you know excessive fat restriction in the diet will lower cholesterol and that's true. I mean if you go on a really draconian fat lowering diet you will lower your cholesterol. My view clinically is that makes very little sense because that usually comes with a whole bunch of other issues. So a lot of times when I see people on these excessively restrictive fat lowering diets actually become insulin resistant a lot of them because they're really over-consuming a lot of poor carbs and they're suffering other consequences of really low fat intake. Now again this doesn't mean that a low fat diet is necessarily problematic. The devil's in the details here just like you know the devil's in the details on what constitutes a reasonable versus an unreasonable low carb diet. But the point I try to make to people is I believe that using nutrition to solve the lipid problem is not a good solution. I think use nutrition to solve the nutrition problem. Use nutrition to address energy balance, protein needs, antabolic structure, energy all of these other things and let your lipids fall where they may because this is one of the few areas in medicine where we have amazing pharmacologic tools. Most of medicine doesn't really have great pharmacology if you stop to think about it like you know I'm great there's nothing pharmacologically that's adding brilliance to our Alzheimer's prevention strategy or our cancer prevention strategy. I mean we have some stuff but it's nothing compared to what we can do with blood pressure and lipid management. So I always say it's hard enough to find the right diet that's going to work for you in terms of your ability to be compliant with it your ability to be within energy balance which is the single most important thing your ability to be insulin sensitive your ability to get adequate amounts of protein. If you solve that with a low fat diet that also happens to keep your lipids low great but if you solve that with a higher fat diet that does everything perfect for you except your lipids go haywire don't put your head in the sand and act like having lipids that have gone haywire is a good thing no just acknowledge it's not a good thing but we can fix it with again myriad tools that didn't exist 20 years ago. Are there are there people that are genetically have genetically low ApoB and if so what's their cardiovascular mortality they're all cause mortality? Yeah so there are people so it turns out ApoB and LDLC are highly genetic which is what has allowed us to do the Mendelian randomization studies that act as one of the you know there are basically three cornerstones of data that make it unambiguously clear of the relationship between LDL or ApoB and ASCVD so you have all of the epidemiologic data which again epidemiology is rife with problems but you know when the data is pretty much all in the same direction and you have the dose effect and all these other things it becomes quite helpful you have all the clinical trial data which I would divide into primary and secondary prevention data and then you have the Mendelian randomization data which again for listeners is basically anytime there is a biologic variable of interest that is under a high degree of genetic control and produces a high degree of variability in the population you can look at how nature has basically randomized that across people and you can look at outcomes of interest so in the case of LDLC because we know it is highly genetic right this is clear in that and I don't just mean in extreme cases but just across a population you can see that lower life lung exposure to ApoB or LDL produces lower ASCVD risk over a lifetime so using this we can say there are people that really low and high extreme so with a high extreme you have the people who have what's called familial hypercluster lemia which is a genetically heterogeneous disease meaning there are literally thousands of mutations that result in a similar phenotype the phenotype is defined as having an LDL cholesterol off medication of more than 190 milligrams per desoliter and there's a couple of other criteria but just to give you a sense of how high the LDL needs to be to meet that criteria um at the other end of this spectrum we have these people with very very low LDLC or ApoB and the most interesting group of these are the people who are folks that have a hypo functioning gene for PCSK9 so Helen Hobbs made this discovery in probably the early 2000s my vague recollection I remember reading this paper when it came out it was a really mind boggling paper call it like somewhere 2004 2005 2006 somewhere in that neighborhood which is hey there these people walking around with LDLC of like 10 to 20 milligrams per desoliter and and these are adults right so you normally we just never see that in adults and they weren't doing anything different right they just like they weren't on some crazy diet or clearly weren't taking any and these people worked found to have a mutation in their PCSK9 gene that rendered a hypo functioning protein and PCSK9 is a protein that degrades LDL receptors now another subset of these people their mirror opposites were discovered several years earlier which had a hyper functioning PCSK9 gene or a hyper a gene that produced a hyper functioning protein and these people had sky high LDL cholesterol they were a subset of the familiar hyper cholesterolemia syndromes and these people weren't and what was interesting to note and uh is that they just didn't develop cardiovascular disease so um I can't tell you what their life expectancy is because I haven't I haven't looked at those data but what I did confirm is they have no increase in the incidence of any other disease so in other words they're absent a cvd but they don't make up for it with more cancer and more neurodegenerative disease or more diabetes that's that's interesting for a couple of reasons one uh you see on Twitter a lot you know the very you know and just the hyper focused very low carb community that's like you know they they share studies about oh low cholesterol people with low cholesterol have a higher all cause mortality they're more likely to die from you know all these different causes of death. Yeah the problem with those studies is um I mean they're I'll only address this once because I've done so much addressing this that I realize you you you can only waste so much time preaching to an audience that actually has no interest in understanding the truth um but just to give you an example of the type of biases that creep into those studies when you look at people who have very low LDL cholesterol you're sampling a subset of people who are at very high risk for a disease typically two diseases right when you have very high LDL you are at risk of a cvd cerebral vascul disease and Alzheimer's disease and all causes of dementia so therefore the people who are at high risk for those are typically the people at a population level who have the lowest level because they're being treated the most aggressively so this is kind of the problem with that stuff. I'll give you an example there's a clear association in the epidemiology it doesn't come up often but it's come up from time to time that the lower the LDL cholesterol the higher the risk of cancer. This is a great example of when Mendelian randomization becomes very valuable because you can actually go back and look at the genes that are controlling LDL you can look at how those are spread out and you can ask the question once you just look at the random assignment of those genes that control LDL cholesterol does that have any bearing on cancer outcome and the answer is unequivocally know it does not so when you do the MR you get the answer that the EP is clearly confounding with something else which is in other words low LDL at the population level is a proxy for other illness this is the issue here. Yes thank you the other interesting point was with the actual gene that you were mentioning the PCS canine right so when you were talking about we have pharmacological interventions that do very nicely lower APB one of them is PCS canine inhibitors exactly came right out of Pelham Hobbes observation so I wanted let's you know let's touch on the the pharmacological treatments but also the PCS kind of canine inhibitors they're not necessarily available to everyone at the start right out the gate and then I want to get your thoughts on some of the the base editing trials that have started looking at literally like you're doing a gene at it you know and you're changing you know a nucleotide to essentially make a PCS canine you get. Or the people that you're talking about walking around right with no ASCB. So okay so let's maybe just talk broadly about what the different pharmacologic strategies are right so the very first drug that was ever used to lower lipids was a was a drug called got I almost blanked on the name of this like tribe tribe Paranol so this was done in the 1950s yeah well there's a reason you never heard of it right so it turned out to be a really bad drug so there was there was there was there used to be a day when again in the 1950s in 1996 we just didn't know what the hell was going on so the idea was if you came up with any drug that lowered cholesterol it must be a good thing well it turned out this drug lowered cholesterol by inhibiting an enzyme that was the final enzyme in the step that we used to make cholesterol so we make cholesterol using two pathways but one of the pathways results in a molecule called desamastoral which gets converted into cholesterol so there's an enzyme that facilitates that and this drug blocked that enzyme and as the result cholesterol levels went down and although no one was really paying attention to time desamastoral levels went sky high and it lowered cholesterol so on the basis of that this drug was approved and back at the time that was the only thing you were monitoring was total cholesterol but it was found that the patients on this drug even they had lower cholesterol had a higher incidence of heart attacks so the drug was ultimately pulled in the 1960s we now know today that it was almost assuredly the case that the desamastoral was even more athrogenic than the cholesterol or at least as athrogenic so fast forward to the 1980s the next class of drugs is developed called biol acid sequesterence we didn't really get into the life cycle of cholesterol so it might be worth doing that now because it'll make sense in the context of the drug so every cell in the body is making cholesterol so just think path one synthesis of cholesterol if you synthesize less cholesterol that's one way to lower it as you noted all that cholesterol is making its way back to the liver when the liver gets the whole of all that cholesterol it's putting a lot of it into bile and we're using bile acids to digest food so as bile via the bile duct is entering the small intestine it is full of cholesterol the body reabsorbs much of that cholesterol so each of the enteric sites which are the gut cells that line your intestine they have a couple of transporters on them so one of the transporters on them it's called a nemen pixie one like one transporter it absorbs all of the sterols and this is I use the word sterile very carefully to distinguish it here from just cholesterol this is zoo sterile and plant sterile which is or an animal sterile which is called cholesterol it absorbs that all there are basically regulatory steps inside the cell the determine how much of that should be kept and how much should be excreted and a fraction of that then gets excreted through an ATP binding cassette so point being that's a second point of regulation at the absorption site but again this is not the cholesterol we eat this is unesteroified cholesterol that's easy to get in and out of the body a sterified cholesterol can't be absorbed and most of the cholesterol we eat is a sterified that's why we just poop it out um so bile acids sequesterence which were the first version of drugs the second version I guess of drugs to the cholesterol which are not used today blocked that process in a very crude mechanical way they sequestered the bile acids and dragged all the cholesterol out the GI tract they were not a very successful class of drugs and not the least of which because the side effects were pretty bad so it really wasn't until the mid to late 80s probably I think 1987 if my memory serves me correctly that the first statin came to be developed and that was the real turning point in um basically the you know pharmacologic tool that became valuable against ASVD now the first second and third generation statins of that era are no longer in use today because their side effect profile was very harsh relative to what we can do today so there are currently seven statins in in existence uh and each of them you know offers some strengths and advantages over others and they're not a benign class of drugs so to be clear they're an effective class of drug they're very effective at lowering uh LDL cholesterol they work by inhibiting the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis they do that everywhere but primarily in the liver and their response of the liver when cholesterol synthesis is being shut down the liver says I got to get more cholesterol in here and what does it do it puts a whole bunch more LDL receptors all over the liver and that's what's primarily driving down LDL in the presence of a statin but the side effects are what well about seven percent of people develop muscle aches on statin so that's a if you think about how many people are on those drugs or how many people are prescribed those drugs that's a huge number the good news is that's a completely reversible side effect so you put a person on a statin they experience muscle soreness you take them off it's gone within a week or two um the other big side effect the one that I probably think about the most is insulin resistance so um a very small set of subset of people about the point four percent of people put on a statin might go on to develop type two diabetes as a result of it now I I think any doctor who lets a patient get to the point where they get type two diabetes because of their statin isn't been paying attention we want to know the minute you're becoming insulin resistant in response to the statin and those data are less clear you don't know exactly how many people are getting insulin resistant but this isn't a reason to be paying attention to bigger markers and more important markers than just hemoglobin A1C trips over the threshold of 6.5 percent you have type two diabetes here you want to be able to say is the hemoglobin A1C moving what's happening to the fasting insulin and glucose in these other markers does a patient where a CGM one of the reasons we like CGMs on patients when we put them on statins is we we have a historical level of what their glucose control looks like and if all of a sudden their baseline average glucose goes up by 10 milligrams per desoliter which I've seen in patients on a statin I know it's you know that's not just a quick dietary trigger especially when you take them off the statin it comes right back down to normal so even though they haven't become you know they haven't gone to level of being diabetic they're clearly becoming insulin resistant and the third thing we see with statins is change in or increase in the transaminases or the liver function tests liver function test is a bit of a misnomer because the transaminases really tell us more about inflammation than function so all that said statins are still kind of you know they're doing the lions share of the work in this area but by no means should we say that that's the only thing that we have at our disposal about 20 years ago another drug called is that a mind for a second ask you about statins yeah yeah of course because I have a lot I have some questions about them so and and I'll never forget this conversation that again I had with our mutual friend one cross because he worked down the hall I worked down the hall from him and I collaborated with some of his postdocs and you know they would come over and show me data and we would talk because you know I had a lot of experience in asking mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biology during graduate school and I remember saying this to Ron I'm like you know so statins are affecting the HMG co-a-pap that you mentioned the cholesterol synthesis with which also is important for the synthesis of ubiquinol right this is an important or you co-cute tennis probably call it this is important for mitochondrial function I mean it's necessary for mitochondrial function for transferring electron electrons across the electron transport chain which is essentially coupling the oxygen we breathe with the food that we need to make energy and I remember saying oh so statins have a side effect of targeting mitochondria and he said to me no it's a direct effect so what are your thoughts on how statins are affecting mitochondria and through this pathway and obviously you might mention supplementation with a you know you're basically really good. We're big when all right measuring mitochondrial function in terms of B2 max something yep so it's a great question actually and something I have thought a lot about so the the literature has nothing to offer here unfortunately so so I wish I could say you know Rhonda the answer is this because here's what the literature says here's what I can tell you and this is not going to be a satisfying answer if there is an impact on mitochondrial function with statin use it's very small based on what I consider to be the single best measurement we have to measure mitochondrial function which is zone two testing with lactate production so I know you know what this is because we talk about this stuff all day long but just for folks listening this requires a little bit of explanation but it's very important and I think it's I'm glad you brought this up so everybody understands what the mitochondria do if they're you know listeners of your podcast we don't need to explain the mitochondria but it's important to understand that a functional test is a very important test in medicine we don't have many functional tests right most of the things we talk about are biomarkers and by themselves they don't tell you a huge amount of information they tend to be quite static and not dynamic but we understand that the healthier and individual is the more they can rely on their mitochondria for ATP generation under increasing demands of the cell this is one of the hallmarks of health and by extension one of the hallmarks of aging and one of the hallmarks of disease is an inability to do that meaning as the ATP demand on a cell goes up there is an earlier and earlier shift to glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation so how do we how can we measure that clinically well we can put a person in because we can't you know rather than test a cell let's test the whole organism right so we put a person in sort of an ergonometer right so in a treadmill or on a bike or under some sort of demand where we can control the work that they have to do and we can drive up the amount of work they do while sampling lactate and why does that tell us well just remind everybody you know glucose enters a cell and it basically has two fates right so glucose will be converted into pyruvate regardless it has the fate at which oxygen is plentiful and the body has the time to make a lot of ATP where it goes into the mitochondria and it has the less efficient but quicker way to get ATP which is converting lactate apart from me pervivate into lactate so this is the glycolytic pathway versus the oxidative phosphorylidic pathway the longer a cell can stay in that mitochondrial space the better it is it makes way more ATP and it accumulates less lactate and hydrogen ion and the more lactate and hydrogen ion you accumulate eventually the cell becomes effectively poison by that hydrogen ion and it becomes very difficult for a muscular cell to contract so we use this test with patients this is one of the most important metrics we care about literally it would be in the top 10 things we care about for our patients which is how many watts can you produce on a bike or how many mets can you exercise at on a treadmill or whatever vehicle you're using while keeping lactate below about two millimole two millimole is about the threshold beyond which you are now shifting away from the maximum capacity of the mitochondria to undergo this process okay all of this is to say I have clearly seen the effect of a drug like metformin at impacting that metformin which is a mitochondrial toxin right metformin impairs complex one of the mitochondria we immediately see a change in the lactate performance curve of an individual on metformin we see a complete reduction in their zone to output they hit that lactate of too much sooner we also see an increase not big but significant meaning clinically significant in their fasting resting lactate level so all things equal their lactate is just getting higher to me by the way I don't know if that's necessarily harmful I don't think it's a good idea which is why I don't believe in metformin as a geroprotective agent I think metformin is a good drug for someone who's diabetic if they can't exercise enough and they can't get into energy balance but I don't think metformin is a great drug for someone like you or someone like me we don't see this with statins so if it's happening it does dependent or not just don't see it yeah just don't just don't see it so it could be happening but we don't have the resolution to measure it so that's why I'm saying like I think one always has to have the humility which I hope I have to say look I don't know but what I do know is if there's an effect there it's it's really small now you mentioned ubiquinol or coq10 and there are two states of it ubiquinol and ubiquinol but ubiquinol would be the state we would want to consider here there have been a number of clinical trials looking at using or supplementing ubiquinol with patients taking statins they have mostly done this to assess the muscle soreness issue so they've mostly done this as a way to ask the question can you reduce the incidence the incidence rather of muscle soreness with statins I haven't looked at those literature in a couple of years the last I looked at them there was still no difference that said we have patients that really feel strongly about taking ubiquinol when they're on a statin and I don't have any issue with that I don't think there's any harm in taking it I really don't think there is and if there's a chance of benefit then I would say let's take it but again I unless something has happened in the last couple of years that I'm unaware of I don't think we have great data that ubiquinol offsets that and more importantly to your point it's not clear to me that that effect translates to a functional deficit in the mitochondria when you're measuring so using the zone to lactate threshold training to kind of measure mitochondrial function so buying the lactate meter nova, nova biometicular something like that yeah it's like a yellow purple one I got it per year like recommendation but for people listening if they want to to get one but also knowing like how you know because there's when you when you go to like any sort of if you were to go talk to an exercise physiologist and you say lactate threshold like they kind of know and they're going to push you up they're going to lactate threshold is a different number right so this is like lower level this is below your lactate threshold yeah this is lower so how do people know like like let's say they have a Peloton at home okay and they get on their Peloton and they want to do a zone to test okay can you somehow use a you know percent max rate a heart rate sorry max heart rate like proxy to kind of know like yeah there are lots of different ways to estimate this and to be clear like I'm one of the very few people that is checking his lactate every you know every day that he's on his bike which is four days a week for me and by the way I'm also doing it while using all the other metrics that I'll explain in a moment mostly just in an ever never ending quest to just have as much data as possible to understand when is lactate the best predictor when was RPE the best predictor when was heart rate the best predictor when was absolute wattage the best predictor like there there's a lot of stuff going on here so first thing I always say to people namely my patience when they say I don't want to get that lactate meter I don't want to be poking myself in the finger I'm like great don't you don't have to there are like other ways that you can pretty much approximate your zone to output and the only reason I brought up the whole lactate testing is it is the gold standard and it is the most objective way to do this and therefore if I'm trying to really understand the impact of saying that form and are a statin that's what I want to do but let's put that aside from moment and answer the the relevant question which is hey how does someone exercise in this zone I think the most important you know tool for for virtually anybody is rate of perceived exertion I think that will almost never let you down in fact I would argue that for a really really out of shape and individual rate of perceived exertion is even better than lactate and the reason for that is you take somebody who's got for example type two diabetes they're resting lactate may already be at two so in those patients we actually never use lactate until you get somebody to a certain level of fitness we only use rate of perceived exertion and we will provide heart rate guidance so here's two ways to think about it RPE rate perceived exertion we give people the test which is the talk test so when you are in zone two you should be able to speak to somebody but it should be uncomfortable and not something you want to do if you can't speak you're out of zone two if it's real if you can't speak in a full sentence you're not in zone two anymore you're your your north of zone two if you can speak the way you and I are speaking now you're you're not working hard enough you're too far below it so there is that sweet spot where if you're on that Peloton and the phone rings and you answer it the person knows your exercising and you're going to let them do most of the talking but if I ask you a question and you have to answer it you'll you'll answer it and you can speak in a full sentence but you're not that comfortable that's the single most important thing people need to understand about it as far as what heart rate guidance comes with it film affetone uses a test that I think is a pretty good starting place which is 180 minus your age now the fitter you are the less relevant that becomes so I'm 50 so that would put me at 130 but I can tell you my zone two is above 130 so if your fitter you may add five to 10 to that I my I use another app that checks my HRV every single morning and it predicts my zone two as a result of my HRV and so every day what I'm doing is I'm looking at the heart rate predicted by the app which can vary by as much as 10 beats per minute based on how much I slept the quality of my sleep house so I am a subjective measurement of how much I want to train that day and my HRV so it's what happens it's called Morpheus yeah so I have no affiliation with anything like that so so basically so this morning I got up my HRV was I don't remember 708 milliseconds slept seven hours 15 minutes good quality sleep not so are felt good so I actually had a pretty high target today my target today was 141 was the heart rate on a day that's about as high as it will predict me to be on a on a day when everything sucks it might tell me as low as 129 usually it's about 136 137 138 is where it's predicting and that's generally aligning with where my lactate is where what that'll generally put me at a lactate about 1.9 and then on top of that I'm paying attention to the water so I kind of know where to be but again for somebody just starting out RPE is all you need to know 180 minus your age is good and then the if a person is fit enough that they truly know their maximum heart rate we tell them to start at somewhere between 75 and 80% of that number great recommendations if so if a person is specifically trying to do this functional mitochondrial test how long should they be in that zone two before they can measure their lactate we'd we'd like to see people there for 30 to 45 minutes okay we do it yeah so a true steady state awesome so I kind of want to the the other going back circling back to the statins and here's here's my question to you okay what questions do you think I should be asking and looking in the literature to convince myself that let's say a leipophilic statin that could you know cross the blood brain barrier get into the brain inhibit you know HM Koy in the brain particularly at higher doses but generally speaking what what question should I be asking myself to convince myself that it's not going to put me at a higher risk for both of the neurodegenerative disease that I'm terrified about one Alzheimer's disease I have a genetic it's family history genetic risk factor and Parkinson's disease family history both of those diseases have been associated with statin use they've also been the literature as you know is you know you can find what you want right so do you have any you know if I did I did a recent AMA on this although it might not be out yet I lose track of when I record them and when they come out so I apologize if it hasn't come out yet but I did an entire AMA on this topic because it is so important and I think it's as you said it's so confusing so I was actually surprised to learn this I'm surprised to learn that there has never oh I shouldn't have been surprised but forget this here's what it is there is never been a study done that has looked at the use of statins and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia as a primary outcome why is that important it's important because in clinical research the primary outcome is the only thing you can really take to the bank because that's what the study is powered to detect there are more than a dozen probably less than 25 so a big number of studies call it 15 16 that have used statins have had a primary outcome of ASCVD but a secondary outcome of dementia or Alzheimer's disease and I looked at every single one of those and I can tell you that every single one of those found neutral to benefit of statin use on the incidence of dementia and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease so that includes vascular dementia and clinical yeah I mean that sort of makes more sense Parkinson's disease have you seen have you looked at the literature on that so Parkinson's is a little bit more confusing because the literature is way more sparse but I do want to go back and talk about Alzheimer's disease because I think there's an important caveat to everything I just said what I basically oh the other point I want to make around it this actually surprised me there was no difference between hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins with respect to the to these outcomes okay no difference whatsoever so counter intuitive but no difference whatsoever so even though again you might think well gosh you know a statin that gets in the brain should have more of an impact but it didn't it didn't seem to have there are difference in those two types of statins with respect to the diabetes increased diabetes risk that you're talking about or it's not really good question I I didn't look at that and that wasn't looked at in this yeah yeah here's what I can tell you the highest incidence of diabetes is probably with a torvist statin but that might also be because a torvist statin is the most widely used like I don't we we basically first well there's only four statins that I think are even worth prescribing these days maybe only three and I treat them all equally in terms of risk in other words I would assume anytime you put somebody on a statin you should be looking for any of the side effects and I don't particularly I because again at the you might say the population level it's different but at the individual level who cares you it's it's either one or zero you're going to get it or you're not what's what's statins or those what the ones that we would prescribe would be Resuvis statin or Crestor or Torvist statin or Lipitore, Petavis statin, Livolo and sometimes we use Previst statin or Prevical but pretty rarely but so usually those those would be big for now here's what I would say and this is something that we spend an awful lot of time looking at in our practice and and actually just last week Tom Day Spring gave us an internal presentation that was so incredible it was months in the making looking at the relationship between statin use and Desmosterall levels and dementia risk so you may recall a moment ago I mentioned Desmosterall so Desmosterall is well let's back up remember I said there were two cholesterol synthesis pathways well in the CNS really only you have one pathway and it's the pathway that goes through Desmosterall to cholesterol so Desmosterall levels are actually a decent proxy for sit-brain cholesterol synthesis. Lathastorall which is the penultimate molecule in the other pathway is more of a proxy for peripheral cholesterol synthesis. At these measured you can measure these on a very difficult to measure in most labs we use a lab that measures them so we measure Desmosterall and col-end with austral and every patient with every blood draw. Unfortunately this is not standard of care most labs can't measure this. Boston heart does this so we that's why we use Boston heart. There are enough data suggesting that if Desmosterall levels are very low the risk of AD does indeed go up and the risk of dementia beyond AD goes up. So this is kind of what I would describe as personalized medicine slash medicine 3.0 at its finest which is you have to treat every patient individually and we're doubly careful in patients with an APOE4 gene and or a family history and in those patients based on the literature and I'd be happy to send you Tom's presentation he would not have a hard time with me sharing that even those kind of an internal presentation. I could share with you the recording Tom made because we recorded the internal meeting because it was so valuable but basically the cutoff we use is 0.8. So if Desmosterall falls below 0.8 milligrams per desoliter we think the risk of dementia is high enough that we would abort the use of the statin. Very good information and you think there is a correlation with APOE status on that. No one has done that study yet. In your in your clinical but in our clinical practice we just decided like why would we take the risk but yes no one has done the study to show our Desmosterall levels lower in APOE4 individuals that's actually a very testable hypothesis and it makes a lot of sense because we know APOE is heavily involved in cholesterol activity in the brain and so it wouldn't be surprising to me if you put people into three buckets zero alleles one allele or two allele e4 alleles and then just looked at Desmosterall levels like that would be a very easy mindless study to do just a survey like just a quick is the recorrelation yes or no. So that's one thing I'd love to know the answer to. But even absent that knowledge our view is there's there's simply no reason to take the risk. In earlier I said it makes no sense to go on some crazy obscure diet that has a whole bunch of unintensive consequences just to control your lipids. Well I would make the exact same statement here it makes no sense to get all to take unnecessary risks with statins in a higher risk individual when we have these other tools we have as I we talked about or we will talk about is that a my PCS can nine inhibitors Bampadouac acid these are unbelievable tools that have no bearing on brain cholesterol synthesis. But Peter aren't people that have an APOE4 little more likely to be prescribed statins based on their their allele particle number by their physician because of physician doesn't look at their none of this this isn't personalized it's not medicine three points right so yeah no it's very frustrating and it's also frustrating that of those three drugs that all the that are an alternative to statins two of them are still very expensive. Okay so the three drugs I know the PCS canine inhibitor and highly effective insanely safe zero side effects cheaper than when they came out so they were approved in 2015 and we have long term data with the match people walking around with the natural mutation right just amazing yeah exactly we have the natural experiment we have all of the data from these drugs and these these drugs have been tested in really good trials and they've gone head to head with every drug and they always win and there's no side effects but they're expensive right there it's a $500 a month drug in the in the United States it's cheaper outside of this country so everything's better out of the US when it comes to drug pricing but in the US you're talking about $500 a month for that drug if it's not covered by your insurance company right and if you can get a doctor to say I'm going to prescribe it to you I mean like I mean at this point a doctor who doesn't who's not willing to prescribe a PCS canine inhibitor it just is a fool so it's just a question of the the cost because unfortunately most insurance companies will not cover it unless you meet certain criteria such as having familiar hypercustrialemia or having already had a cardiac event like a heart attack and not being able to tolerate a statin what about my opathy like if you have muscle yes significant my opathy on multiple statins but you'd also have to be at high enough risk to justify it so insurance companies are going to go out of their way to not pay for this okay then you have is that a vibe now is that my is relatively inexpensive it's just not as potent so is that a my also effectively serves to increase the LDL receptors on the liver but it does so by empowering cholesterol reabsorption so it blocks one of those two transporters I was talking about in the gut the first one and by blocking that the body is absorbing way less of its own cholesterol and the liver senses that and the liver says hey I got to get more cholesterol puts more LDL receptors on pulls it out of circulation um it's not as potent and as a monotherapy the only times we see really head over heels responses are in patients who have defective ATP binding cassettes in their gut and we measure that by looking at phytosterol levels so we measure two things one is called cytostral one is called compestral those are phytosterols so these are cholesterol we don't make it's zusterol uh or put me it's it's phytosterol not zusterol and so when we measure those levels we know that it speaks to how much plant sterol is being absorbed and not being excreted and so when patients have really really high levels of phytosterols you know they have a defective ATP binding cassette and those patients respond really well to is that amybic it it's it's like a blockbuster in those people wow is that a common single nucleotide polymorphism? um you know it depends how how extreme it is so it's not uncommon to see people who are above the 90th percentile but I've only seen like probably three people that have a level that is so high you'd actually be concerned with it just in and of itself meaning like the actual level because phytosterols are actually more atherogenic than cholesterol and that's also like Boston Heart would measure all these phytosterols okay um they're more atherogenic than cholesterol yeah more prone to oxidation more inflammatory are they being carried in lipopropoid teens there yeah so so oxidized they're more oxidized they're more oxidizable and this is by the way is a reason that we don't favor the practice of using phytosterols to lower cholesterol so there are a lot of sort of over-the-counter treatments where people use phytosterols to lower their cholesterol and they it does so if you ingest a ton of phytosterols you will outcompete cholesterol at that enterocyte and your body will regulate and you'll end up net reabsorbing less total cholesterol um the problem with that is if you have a defective ATP binding cassette which again it's not that uncommon that you do you will end up really absorbing a lot of those phytosterols and again they can so this is a sort of an example of that disemostral point earlier where you can lower cholesterol but if you're really raising disemostral too much it can be more atherogenic than cholesterol in the first place so disemostral has shown up twice today it showed up in a good sense and in a bad sense so too much of it if you're using a drug that blocks the enzyme that comes after it that was the thing it was producing too much atherosclerosis in the 60s to little of it could be a marker of two little cholesterol synthesis in the brain and that can be a whole problem on it and it's all the final drugs we can just wrap this up because I'm sure the listeners are tired of hearing about this stuff is a drug called bambadoc acid it is a pro drug it's a very elegant drug it's taken as a pill but it's ineffective until it's metabolized by the liver and in the liver it then inhibits cholesterol synthesis what makes this drug special is unlike statins this drug only works in the liver so statins work throughout the body they do most of their work in the liver but technically every cell is impacted by a statin only hepatocytes are impacted by bambadoc acid and it lowers a same way lowers cholesterol synthesis liver says I need more cholesterol put more LDL receptors up pulls more LDL in LDL and cholesterol go down but no side effects no tetradibities nothing nothing it's just it's only acting in the liver well that sounds the same problem as PCS can9 inhibitor it's a $500 a month drug okay yeah so again we we we'd we'd have every look honestly at this point like if money were on a we're not issue you'd probably just be on PCS can9 inhibitors is that am I and bambadoc acid I mean eventually look at there right yeah you just have to come down and price for people that want to like more clear picture of the plaque accumulation in their in their arteries in their in their basket or system um the best way to do it I think of her it about ct and gggm ct and gggm okay and is that something you know like you think people should start a certain age or certainly if they have measured their you know I abo b and yeah I mean you know I think there's there's different ways to think about this you know I I think there's a principle in medicine that most doctors try to adhere to which is don't order a test unless there's a chance the test will change your management um then it's it's easy to deviate from that I certainly know I do at times but but as a general rule I try to ask myself the question before I order this test how will the outcome change what I do with this patient so through that lens you could make a case that the only time you should be ordering a ct angiogram is with if you go through the following experiment which is if it comes back normal how will it change what I do if it comes back abnormal how will it change what I do so if if if you were sitting in my office and I said well look Rhonda your 35 years old your apob is really high your family history is such that people get cardiovascular disease and your family meaning you know it's not like you've got a bunch of relatives who are in their 90s who have never had a cardiac event so you don't have some genetic protection of cardiovascular disease um do I need a ct angiogram in you to convince me to do anything because the truth of it is at 35 your ct angiograms gonna be normal I mean it might not be mine wasn't at 35 but it probably will be for most people and if it's normal will I then say we don't need to do anything about this no because that sort of like saying you're a smoker who has a normal ct scan you don't yet have lung cancer therefore we should let you keep smoking no we should stop you from smoking so in other words I just wouldn't have a huge appetite for doing that test in you there are other patients at the other end of the spectrum where you know they come to me there's 75 years old their apob is through their roof but I noticed like all the relatives live to be 100 and they never had heart disease and I look at them and I think do I really want to put this person on lipid lowering medicine at the ages 75 why don't we do a ct a if the ct a is normal which by some miracle it could be I don't think we need to do something there's clearly something this person has going on that is beyond our understanding of the science so far so in that sense I wouldn't do anything about the way I think about it is there's a two by two which is age versus finding positive or negative I think ct angiograms are mostly helpful when they have a positive finding any young person or a negative finding an old person that's where it can really cause you to act differently outside of those findings I eat positive findings in old people are to be expected negative findings in young people are to be expected I think you should just track the biomarkers of interest and go off that risk okay I mean like is a 45 year old considered I would still put that in a young category yeah especially for a woman you think that ct angiogram would still kind of look maybe good it should and again I would only think about it through the lens of if the patient is hesitant like so so we we we had a new patient you know that started a couple of weeks ago he'd never had one of these tests before but he had a lot of risk factors right elevated apob elevated LP little A I mean two big risk factors and but but insanely healthy individual but very very healthy individual so so on the surface like nobody thought anything of this this person we decided we were going to treat him regardless and he was completely unbored with that but the question was how aggressively would we treat and we said let's let the cta decide that if the cta comes back clean as a whistle we're going to treat you to like an apob of 60 which is still aggressive by most people standards by our standards it's sort of middle of the road aggression if the cta comes back and there's a problem meaning you have calcification and soft plaque we're going to treat you to 30 or 40 so they are the cta helped us make a difference at a real treatment difference and this is a person who's you know middle age so not too old not to you that makes a lot of sense um before we you know kind of shift gears and let's test some other things I want to ask you about um have you looked like I know I know you've mentioned it's been a mini years since I've heard you talk about burbering but I you know every once in a while I'll get a question and I decide I want to dive into literature and see if there's anything right so that happened recently which even I did a deep dive into burbering and it's effect on you know clearing away existing plaque on lowering you know LDL particle number possibly total LDL cholesterol level but um I was surprised why did you find so there was a systematic review and it was 2022 I believe and these are all like we need this is the sparse data right it's a systematic review of what the existing literature was which isn't a huge body of evidence but there was a bunch of studies that looked at burbering and you know varying doses and then looking at it in conjunction with statins or comparing it to statins or comparing it to a placebo and in it pretty much to me was convincing that it was beneficial in every in every single scenario so burbering a lot burbering alone was um lowering the LDL cholesterol and I can't remember if it was particle number but it was an interesting burbering is also a mitochondrial toxin really yeah burbering is an analog of metformin so it's a complex one inhibitor is it? yeah wow I didn't know that it was like it was to me it looking really beneficial where it was like I'm not saying that wouldn't be I'm just saying sort of pointing out because it's interesting is there literature showing that there's like a in vitro kind of thing where it's like a nightmare it's been so long since I've looked at burbering but but burbering is kind of a poor man's metformin okay well it was and that's the way I thought about it I think I had heard you talk about it years ago maybe on tins podcast I don't remember it was a long time ago yeah and that's kind of where I even first heard a burbering was you and I remember because I was like going for a run it was when I lived in Oakland and then I was like burbering what's that and I remember you talking about it in the context of I think metabolic health yeah yeah and it's something yeah but um this data on the lipids was very interesting and I linked it up and yeah what's the magnitude of a fact I don't like you you the document it's in that document it's linked I have the studies the meta analysis you can look at it because I don't remember everything and but what I do know is it also lowered the side effects of statin my opathy also was one in particular it lowered the dose effective dose of statins that was needed to you know lower the LDL interest cholesterol very interesting right and so I was like you know I actually ordered some burbering like maybe I should test this and see you know and it's there there companies like thorn that I ordered thorn yeah yeah which I have no affiliation with I just trust there yeah yeah so anyways I wanted to bring that up because you know I know that again I'd heard a burbering from you like years ago it's speaking of metabolic health and we you kind of talked about this you know earlier with with continuous glucose monitoring you know measuring you know measuring your you're fasting glucose and also you know your response to foods and so like what you know glucose disposal is something that you've talked about people always hear about you know fasting glucose HP1C like what what should those numbers be but also what is glucose disposal and why should people be paying attention to that and cancetyms can the UCGN to cut it sort of measure that yeah yeah yeah you know glucose disposal is is is take us back glucose regulation is just it's such a miracle of our physiology I mean there's every time I think about biology I'm really grateful that I've you know came to this field and one way or another because it's it leaves you endlessly at awe of what's happening so the the interplay between our endocrine system our liver our muscles in terms of how glucose is regulated is so complicated and exists on such a fine fine line that it is it is humbling so let's just put some of these numbers in perspective so most people who have had a blood test would recognize that a fasting blood glucose of 100 milligrams per desoliter is sort of right on the cusp of being just just starting to get to be too high so what does that mean right what is 100 milligrams per desoliter well it means that in you know someone my size in all of my plasma floating around all of my body all of my blood I have five grams of glucose so do I have more than five grams of glucose in my body of course I do I have way more than that but the majority of the glucose in my body is either in my liver or in my muscles there's only five poultry grams 20 calories worth of glucose in my entire circulation at this moment in time now if you assume for a moment that I'm just sitting here at rest and nothing in my body is demanding glucose meaning my muscles aren't requiring it the only organ that should be really demanding it at the moment is my brain now of course my blood blood cells demand it because they don't have mitochondria so they're going to have to use glucose and of course the kidney uses it in all sorts of other things but basically the majority of the glucose in my blood stream at this moment in time is being is there for the purpose of my brain and you know you can do the math on this anybody can do the math on this within a number of minutes I will go through that five grams so where does the next drop of glucose come from comes from my liver so my liver is constantly titrating just a little bit of glucose into my circulation to make sure that number never goes from say a hundred where it is now down to 50 because that would be way too low but it's never putting so much in that that number would be 150 or 200 at that point I would be full-fledged type two diabetes so the difference between you and me if I have type two diabetes is literally a teaspoon of glucose in our circulation at any point in time think about how tiny a difference that is and that speaks to this enormous capacitor and buffer subsystem of our liver and our muscles so if the liver is the thing that is responsible for the the dulling out of glucose into circulation the muscle is primarily responsible for where we put glucose when it gets flooded into our system and that happens every time you eat so you eat and again let's just do some easy math on this like you eat a bowl of pasta like not a Peter bowl which is like the size of my head but just a normal size bowl you're easily getting 60 grams of glucose so you eat 60 70 80 grams of glucose well remember when I just said a moment ago like if your blood level goes from five to 10 grams you're host like that's a really big problem now acutely it's not the end of the world right but a healthy person would probably never go from five to eight more than eight grams so how do you get that other 60 grams of glucose away you have to put that into the muscles and so the muscle is the sink for glucose disposal and there are two ways that that happens but the majority of it is an insulin dependent way so insulin is released by the pancreas when glucose levels are sense so the pancreas sits very high in the GI tract so very early in the absorption of glucose as it exits the stomach into the the doodinum does the endocrine system these are the beta cells sense this increase in in glucose the beta cells release insulin the insulin results in a signal it goes to the muscle so the insulin hits an insulin receptor the insulin receptor triggers a kinase and a cell and that brings a glucose transporter to the surface of a muscle cell so that passively right without a gradient glucose can flow from outside the cell to inside the cell so that's called insulin dependent glucose disposal in a person who's particularly fit there's also an insulin independent system where just the contractile aspect of the muscle itself is enough to get glucose transporters up to the surface of the muscle so people who do a lot of cardio training have this capacity to you know and I've seen this in patients with type one diabetes who do a lot of training because that's a pure experiment where you have no insulin you can actually see them lower their glucose without insulin just by exercising so the active exercising itself can produce glucose transport across across the muscle without insulin so how does all this figure into health well as we alluded to glucose is toxic when you have too much of it now I'm not going to talk about acute toxicity so if you ever walked around with like 40 teaspoons of blood a 40 teaspoons of glucose in your bloodstream you would go into a coma so there's an acute toxicity but luckily that's very very rare and only really would occur in somebody with keto acidosis but the chronic toxicity of elevated levels of glucose is significant and that's where the difference between having four five six seven eight grams of glucose as the benchmark concentration is a difference in 10 years of life expectancy and again like it seems hard to fathom that that makes such a difference but it does and it does for several reasons but one of them is that glucose is involved in the the process by which proteins become sticky and so as the proteins in our blood get glycosylated and get stickier one their function is lower but two they also tend to obscure the narrowest part of our vascular system so our the tiniest tiniest tiniest capillaries become more occluded and therefore it's harder to deliver oxygen to those tissues so the the canary in the coal mine believe it or not of micro vascular damage is within the eyes so a good ophthalmologist is generally the first doctor to tell when a person is on the road to type two diabetes because by looking at the retina and by looking at the capillaries in the back of the eye they're actually able to do something that no one else gets to do in the body right like we don't look directly at the vascular system elsewhere in the body and they get to do that they get the shine on light directly onto capillary beds so as a general rule glucose elevated levels of glucose are damaging to small vessels elevated levels of insulin are damaging to large blood vessels so the eyes the kidneys the micro vascular sugar the heart and the brain are very susceptible to high levels of glucose the larger blood vessels of the heart the aorta the iliac vessels cardiac carotid arteries more susceptible to the elevated levels of insulin and both of these things go hand in hand because of course as is obvious I guess to people now when those glucose levels are chronically elevated the body wants to fix it they it wants to crank up more insulin as the solution to the resistance so the resistance is at the cell where the insulin signal isn't being heard so the pancreas just yells louder and it makes more and more insulin and so before you see that elevated level of glucose you will actually see an elevated level of insulin so post-prandial hyperinslanemia is the metabolic harbinger of all this stuff and so the major obviously it seems like a lifestyle factor that is regulating you know glucose disposal insulin sensitivity I mean it seems like both of these things are affected by the contractions of muscle and increasing those glucose transporters right so that exercise is probably the single most important thing we have at our disposal to increase insulin sensitivity and and then there are other things that are very important right so energy balance really matters sleep really matters so both acute and chronic disruptions of sleep will impair that system it's not entirely clear why by the way the experimental evidence is undeniable and these are experiments that are so easy to do well that they're unambiguous right where you disrupt people sleep you know you take if you just took a normal group of people and you did like what's called a you glycemic insulin clamp which is an experiment where you you run IV glucose and IV insulin to people and you basically run a fixed amount of insulin into somebody and then determine how much glucose you need to put in to keep their glucose level fixed that's called a u glycemic keep glucose flex that's the gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity so you do that test on somebody and then for a week sleep deprived them for you know down to five or six four hours a night call it for would be very dramatic within days you'll see like a 50% reduction in their ability to dispose of glucose with no other difference no dietary difference no exercise difference so we don't know exactly why that's happening but it's a very repeatable observation so sleep disruptions impair this energy imbalance impairs this hormonal changes impair this right so as we age both the reduction in estrogen and testosterone impair this hypercortice selemia impairs this and then of course in activity is the is the greatest thing that drives this I definitely didn't do the exact experiment you're describing but I've mentioned it to you before I had my my CGM and when I was a new mother it was you know clearly am I sleep was being disrupted I was getting up and breastfeeding and you know I mean it was it was like night and day difference in my my my fasting blood glucose my glucose disposal my post-prandial levels I mean it was like clear we would have asked you to take that CGM off not that was a awful time to her CGM but I did find that my going to my hit class yeah even though I was like just dog and tired like the last thing I wanted to do yeah really did normalize it so um is there a post-prandial level that like you know let's say someone's not trying to do a low carb diet like they're not trying to like because that's a whole other right but like they just you know they're they're eating maybe a more um omnivore diet and more paleo is or Mediterranean is there a level that you think post-prandial you know glucose level like a threshold they that would signal like oh you shouldn't really be going or it's hard to say I mean here's what we here's what I think we know more clearly we we certainly know with more conviction that the average blood glucose the lower it is the better you are and I say that even outside of diabetic range now I don't have level one data to tell you that because the studies never been done but I can tell you that by proxy based on hemoglobin A1C data so the hemoglobin A1C data make it very clear that lower is better even outside of the range of diabetes so diabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1C above 6.5% that translates 6.5% is an estimate of an average blood glucose of 140 milligrams per deciliter so assume for a moment that if you have a CGM that says 6.5% meaning you just trigger the threshold for type 2 diabetes your hemoglobin your CGM would say your average blood glucose is 140 milligrams per deciliter nobody disputes that that's harmful the question is is it better to be at 130 110 100 like at what point does is it too low and what the hemoglobin A1C data would suggest is being at 5% which is about an average of 100 is better than being at 5.5% which is an average in the one teens both of those are normal by our current definitions neither of those would be pre-diabetic even so 5 and 5.5 are both considered completely normal levels but the all cause mortality data or the data on all cause mortality suggests a better outcome if you're at 5 rather than 5.5 that suggests to me by proxy at least that an average blood glucose of 100 on a CGM would be better than that of an average blood glucose of 115 so that's the single most important metric we care about we use other metrics to think about that so that since we can't measure insulin in real time looking at post-prandial spikes and variability so looking at the standard deviation which you can get off the CGM and just the number of times you exceed a threshold and that threshold you could say maybe make at 150 or 140 milligrams per deciliter and you can just say how many times in a week do you exceed that threshold that might give you some indirect proxy of how much insulin are you secreting and response to that because for if you took two people who had an average blood glucose of 110 milligrams per deciliter by CGM but one arrived at it with levels like that and one arrived at it with levels like that the former would be a better way to achieve that than the latter but you know there are lots of things that raise glucose that are not harmful for example that hit class that you were doing probably in the short term really spikes your glucose because your liver is really trying to meet the demands of all that exercise so it's putting a ton of glucose into your circulation and it's going to do the right thing which is always air on the side of too much because in the short term it's better to have too much than too little so if I'm wearing a CGM doing a really hard workout I mean I'll see that glucose get to 160 which is higher than it will get with a meal that goes right back down I'll be good to hear so what do you think about by the way this is all great info what do you think about so metabolic flexibility being beat the capability to shift between using glucose as a substrate and using fatty acids I mean this is something this is the zone two thing right this is exactly why we train that zone two system and that's why you know we have our patients spend 80% of their cardio training time in zone two that's really pushing that metabolic flexibility you this is a this is the training system for making sure you expand the capacity of your mitochondria to under ever increasing demands have the ability to utilize fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation and glucose for that matter but if you were to let's say you're doing more high intensity interval training which I do a lot of that increases the capacity because it's such a potent stimulator mitochondrial biogenesis so maybe and I and I hesitate to say like I think a lot of times when I'm doing my hit I am I'm still really using my mitochondria like you know I'm not like doing it all out spramp but like you know I do shift into using glucose force but we just think that only 20% of the cardio training volume should be there and the reason for that is actually kind of an empirical observation if you ask the question who are the most metabolically flexible healthiest specimens we have on this planet they are high level endurance athletes namely cross country skiers distance runners and cyclists so what do we know about this group we know that they have the highest VO2 maxes of any humans on the planet and we know that they are the most metabolically flexible of any humans on this planet now my experience is far more with cyclists and so I usually just talk about this through the lens of a cyclist and the other thing I like about cycling compared to skiing or running is we can use wattage because we can put people on power meters and we can get the numbers a world-class cyclist is able to put out four watts per kilogram of power while keeping lactate below two millimole in fact the best cyclist in the world are probably at about 4.2 4.3 watts per kilo so let's just do the math on that if someone's listening to this and they've ever been near a power meter so if you're 80 kilos you're 175 pounds that means you're able to put out 330 to 340 watts which by the way most people who weigh 80 kilos can't do that for one minute literally they can't do that for one minute these people can do it for hours and keep their lactate below two millimole it's the single greatest demonstration of metabolic flexibility that you will ever see how do these people train is this is you know this is one of the questions my patients ask me is Peter where is this 80 20 coming from where is the study that demonstrated this and I said well the studies are all based on what do you have to do to achieve that level of performance so these athletes and their coaches have all figured out that to produce the highest VO2 max and to produce the greatest degree of metabolic flexibility you think of it as a pyramid or the base of the pyramid is your zone to efficiency and the peak of the pyramid is your VO2 max and the area total area of the pyramid is your cardiovascular respiratory engine so you want not a narrow base with a high peak not a wide base with a short peak you want a big base big peak and the way to get that is about 80 20 if you try to do too much high intensity you simply don't have the aerobic base on which to build it so yeah you might have more mitochondria but they're not as efficient if you only do the low intensity stuff they're efficient but you might not have enough this is a bit of an oversimplification but you want the best of both worlds right you want you want both the the breadth and the the peak effectively so what what we basically do with our patients is we we start from a standpoint of time how much time are you willing to exercise a week am I going to tell you what you need to do let's start with you telling me what you're willing to do and then the simplest approaches will put half of that into strength and stability half of that into cardio of the cardio it's 80 20 80 percent of that will be zone two 20 percent of that will be VO2 max and VO2 max by the way training is pretty hard because it's slightly longer intervals than what people think of as traditional hit so traditional hit works I'm just saying you know it's it's not the best way to get there it's a it's a good way to get there and and we know like even just looking at the tabata studies right tabata's neither one or the other right like a 20 on 10 off times 8 rounds is neither a pure zone two no it's it's it's way too hard even for VO2 max actually because VO2 max sweet spot is 3 to 8 minutes with one to one rest to recovery so 3 on 3 off 3 on 3 off that's a lower intensity than most people are doing in a hit class most people in a hit class are doing shorter intervals in pushing much harder I just had a talk with them with Marty Cabala and I asked him that question you know and he was like Ron and you had to do more 3 because I wanted to I was like I want to do VO2 max training like this is what I do I do a lot of the you know do 16 rounds and I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off but my 10 seconds off or I mean my heart's still pretty hot like I don't so he's like you got to do like three minutes at least one you know and so I've shifted my my training now to doing and it's absolutely true I'm not going as hard you can't yeah it's you just can't go as hard and so and it's an art form you'll you'll figure it out because you'll realize and you'll you'll have to you you'll be like I went too hard and I was dead at a minute and a half and I was like loafing the last minute and a half or I held back too much and by the end of the three minutes it was like I actually could have gone harder and that's okay like you'll you'll you'll sort of figure out what that sweet spot is but that that three to eight minutes is the is the optimal zone for for generating VO2 max power right yeah let's so um so metabolic flexibility obviously hugely important via two max hugely important but uh with respect to I would say like eating diet wise like you hear a lot of people like low carb community ketogenic you know metabolic flexibility if they're doing does that like effect metabolic flexibility like if you're doing yeah it's tough to say there I think there may be a bit of a confounder there so I I used to think so I'm not sure any more truthfully so so the obvious confounder there is if you're on a completely carbohydrate restricted diet your respiratory quotient so on a from a functional standpoint one of the ways we how do we measure what you're oxidizing so when a person does a CPAT test a functional test like a VO2 max test we're we're measuring O2 consumed and CO2 produced so if any have you done a VO2 max test yet I haven't okay so you can you just go to any doctor or doctor doctors don't do it no you typically go to well when I did when I live in San Diego I used to do them with my coach so he would do them in in Austin we send people to UT like we just send people to the university and get him done so very inexpensive test like like a hundred bucks or something like that right so they're going to have you do it in one of two ways which is a biker a treadmill and I always tell patients do it in the way you train because there's a you know there's a you don't want to take a cyclist and make them do the running test device versus so it sounds like you're doing most of your work on a palatant so you would do it on a bike because you're going to sit on a bike and they're going to put a mask on you and it's super uncomfortable the mask has to be incredibly tight it can't have any interference from the outside world in terms of air that your breathing can't escape and no air from the outside can get to you there are two gas sensors on the outside of the mask one for O2 one for CO2 this is the bread and butter this whole device if those sensors aren't calibrated correctly or they don't work the test is meaningless and like one out of ten times they fail so you got to make sure whenever you're doing this test the part the tech who does it has calibrated this thing and knows what to look for if the calibration fails during the test which is how patient do one recently the test failed so you're going to be put on a bike and it's going to be an herb which means unlike the peloton where you set the resistance and how like let's say you have the resistance at 50 well that doesn't determine the wattage by itself how fast you pedal also determines the wattage that's different here here the computer is telling the bike how many watts to put out so the heart the faster you pedal the less the resistance will be okay but it's fixed wattage so they might say like Ron we're going to start to add at 50 watts nice little warm up we're going to have you spend you know five minutes here and then like three every three minutes we're going to go up you know 25 watts or something like that and there you know within about 15 minutes you're going to be in crunch time and at that point they're probably going to increase the wattage every minute and you're going to you're in the the pain train has left the station like this is unpleasant and you have to keep your RPMs high the test is usually aborted if you can't keep your RPM above about 50 or 60 so as you're training keep that in mind these are all the things you don't want to fail the test because you didn't know the test you know what I mean let the physiology be the place you fail so make sure when you're riding that peloton you're in that you're really comfortable in that 80 to 100 zone of RPM and and so what is the tech tech looking for so the tech is looking at a bunch of data so what they're looking for is VO2 and VO2 those are the things that are being measured so they know you're heart rate at every moment in time they know how many watts you're pet you're generating because they're you're you're you're generating by definition everything they're sending you and then they're measuring VO2 so ventilation rate of oxygen and VO2 ventilation rate of CO2 they also at every moment in time see the ratio of VO2 to VO2 that's called respiratory quotient or our Q it's also known as RER that ratio in any moment in time tells you how much fat you're oxidizing versus how much glucose when that ratio is 0.7 you are 100% fat oxidizing when that ratio is 0.85 it's about 50 50 when that ratio is 1 and above your all carbohydrate so what you'll want to see when you do the test is you won't want the report the summary you will also want the raw data which is pages of a spreadsheet and you'll kind of go through and you can see how these things change so when I used to do my test I used to plot my own data I would just get the spreadsheet and I would make the fuel partition incurred so what I would draw would be what I would have Excel plot for me is on the x-axis I would have wattage because I cared more by wattage than by heart rate so you have either wattage or heart rate on the x-axis and on the y-axis I'd have a double y-axis and the y-axis would be either calories or preferably grams per minute and I would have carbohydrate oxidation and fat oxidation so fat oxidation goes down from as the test starts so it usually has an early peak and then comes down as intensity goes up and carbohydrate oxidation just rises monotonically and there's where those two cross some people call that your anaerobic threshold but that's where your respiratory quotient is equal if you've done this in calories if you don't in grams per minute it won't be because obviously there's way more calories in fat than oxygen so one of the other metrics we care very deeply about in our patients is what is your peak fat oxidation and where does it occur and we plot that so we we plot their VO2 max we plot their zone to and we plot fat oxidation and not surprisingly there's there's a family of curves that we put the patients on so we say this is what someone with type 2 diabetes looks like this is their fat oxidation curve this is what a world class tour difference cyclist looks like they couldn't be further apart and this is everything in between and where do you stack up so what you want is the highest amount of fat oxidation and you want to be able to sustain that for as long as possible now if you do this on somebody who is heavily carbohydrate restricted you will get an artifact of the test because their resting RQ is very very low and so it's not clear what the implications of that R other than we typically will feed people carbohydrates before they do the test like in the days they do that but their VO2 max won't be doesn't affect their VO2 max no because the VO2 max is literally taking the peak VO2 that they achieve and dividing it by their weight in kilos what VO2 max to you aim for and if you can recall I know that JAMA 2018 paper which was probably the most convincing studies that VO2 max is like one of the best metrics of health and longevity and there wasn't even bigger paper that came out that that JAMA paper had 120,000 subjects in it there was a JACC paper that came out a year ago that had almost a million subjects in it and it killed the exact same findings do you so the findings if I recall both of them are in the book I think I have I have figures from both of them in the in the X-rays you had the numbers in there okay and and that so that was like the top I just remember was like the top percentile I mean they had like 80% lower the top yeah if you compare the top the difference in risk between someone in the bottom 25% of VO2 max to the top 2 and a half percent had a hazard ratio of five meaning it's four time 400 times greater all cause mortality if you're in the bottom 25% versus the top 2 percent okay so if I want that number do you know it or I mean what's what the top yeah are you are you 30 to 40 I'm for I'll be 45 okay so you're right in the middle of the 40 to 50 I would guess but the table is in my book so I could have that right I would guess that it's about it's in the high 40's okay yeah so roughly probably like 46 47 48 milligrams sorry milliliters per minute probably have to agree to do but this is such great information I have other like I there's I want to get into some cancer home-owned especially because I'm gonna be 45 five I'm a very personal personal interest in this but you know we're talking about metabolic health obviously you've talked endlessly about the importance of metabolic cal for cancer certainly you cancer prevention but um looking at like so the biggest risk factor for cancer is age right yes if you yeah unless you include yeah if you don't include our onifiable risk so yeah we generally talk about modified or risk okay yes age age is the greatest risk for all disease including cardiovascular disease the biggest modifiable risk factor so let's talk about modified or risk factors like obesity smoking is number one smoking okay don't look at I've got of course smoking I always it's easy to forget yeah you should not be smoking but it is easy to forget it's like oh yeah people do still smoke it's hard to fathom that but addiction is addiction so smoking is the number smoking is still the number one modifiable risk factor for that obesity so why do you think obesity what if you were to speculate why do you think it is yeah I and I feel pretty strongly about this I mean I'm I'm happy to speculate on things and I'm happy to acknowledge when I have no idea here I think we have a pretty good idea first of all I don't think it's the excess out of positive right like I don't I don't think it's the extra two pounds I have on my waist that I wish I didn't have for vanity purposes um it is the environment of growth factors that comes with obesity namely the hyper insulinemia but also the chronically elevated IGF and things of that nature and it is the inflammatory environment that comes right with obesity and again that's not due to the excess energy that's stored within the confines of the subcutaneous storage depot it's due to the excess fat that spills over from that into these other areas where fat accumulation is very harmful so fat accumulation is not problematic believe it or not despite our aesthetic preferences when it occurs in areas that we are designed to store excess energy it becomes problematic when it escapes those areas and gets around the viscera gets around our organs enters the muscle itself by the way that's how it directly contributes to insulin resistance uh when it accumulates in the liver accumulates around the heart within the pancreas itself where it serves the double roll of not just creating an inflammatory environment but also reduces the amount of insulin that the beta cell can release um and also around the kidneys so those are the main places where even a small amount of fat i.e. if just 10% of your total body fat were in those places you would be at enormous risk for cardiometabolic disease yeah I remember like I've seen a few studies where it's like visceral fat so you're talking about the fat that's you know covering surrounding your organs you know that was the highly correlated with an increased cancer risk and there was like there was also another correlation with like there was some specific inflammatory cytokines that were being generated or you know associated with i.g. i would say with the visceral fat and the cancer incidents which again it's like uh the inflammatory environment like you're talking about so so the metabolic health being important we talked about you know the best like exercise being at the top right I mean that's one of the best ways to exercise energy balance sleep and then of course you know management of of of of distress right hypercordicilemia will also contribute to this significantly right which of course even doing things like exercising getting enough sleep help balance that right exactly when it comes to cancer prevention you know you you talk a lot and outlive about cancer screening aggressive cancer screening yeah so can you talk a little bit about weighing the benefits versus the risk of that type you know doing more of an aggressive type of cancer screening yeah I mean the reason I think we have to pay attention to cancer screening in such an aggressive way is that unlike cardiovascular disease and even though we didn't really go into the pathogenesis of it today I mean I've covered this another podcast and sure you have as well it's very well understood doesn't mean we know everything I'll happily spend 20 minutes telling you all the things I don't understand or that we don't understand is as a community but we have a pretty good sense of what's going on that's not the case in cancer it is still a really really big black box to try to understand all the different ways in which people get cancer and if you just want proof positive on this I bet you there's not a single person listening to this not one who can't tell you of at least one person they know who's been afflicted with cancer who otherwise had did everything right they didn't smoke they weren't obese they didn't have you know huge chemical carcinogen exposures they lived a perfectly healthy life and they still got breast cancer or they still got leukemia or they still got some got offo cancer so the truth of it is in cardiovascular disease when we sit here and talk about modifiable risk factors like lipids smoking blood pressure all these things that virtually accounts for the entirety of the disease in cancer when we talk about the modifiable risk factors it doesn't even account for half of it so it's free money don't leave it on the table don't make unforesterers don't smoke and be metabolically healthy but you don't want to leave it at that there's still way too great a chance that you're going to end up getting cancer relative to you know if you just take the approach of while I've taken care of those things therefore I've done everything I can so the missing link how we bridge that gap has to be through aggressive screening because about the only thing you can say about cancer that is capital T true is when you treat a cancer in an early stage you will have a better outcome than if you treat that cancer at a later stage and in the book I talk about a couple of very specific examples of this where we have just overwhelming data I use breast and colon cancer as an example so when a person has a stage three colon cancer that's still a big cancer right and it's by definition because it's stage three it has spread to the lymph nodes but it has not spread visibly beyond the lymph nodes so when you do a CT or an MRI on that patient you'll see that there's no other evidence of cancer outside of the region of the resection which is the colon and lymph nodes now you know that there's microscopicly cancer elsewhere so there are still millions to billions of cancer cells throughout that patient's body almost assuredly in their liver but they're not you know you can't see them if you give that patient the full fox regimen which is the standard chemotherapy regimen that's three drugs 65% of those patients will be alive in five years so a third of them will still die but two thirds of them will live if that exact same patient when you go and you take their colon out and you take their lymph nodes out also has visible metabolic disease in the liver they're now stage four after surgery they will go on to get the same chemotherapy none of those people will be alive in five years there is a fundamental why why that difference same as true with breast cancer same as true with every cancer the reason is the more cancer cells you have the more heterogeneity you have around the burden of mutations in that cancer the more capable that cancer is to mutate its way out of treatment evade the immune system a whole bunch of other things so if step number one is don't get cancer which it should be and we want to do everything we can to not get cancer step number two is if you do get cancer you want to be able to catch it as soon as possible so that you have the smallest possible burden of this disease to treat and by the way you know there's an entire argument that says well screening is too expensive it's a lot cheaper than treating late stage cancer with very expensive drugs that do very little so you brought up a lot of good points Peter I mean I really like the way like you can do everything you can and you know like one of my favorite peloton instructors on Lianne Hainesby you know she's out she's like doing physical activity every day I mean she looks amazing I'm sure she's you know not eating a terrible diet and she came down with breast cancer was being treated and was still doing peloton class as well she was being treated I'm an amazing but the reality is is that they're like over a lifetime you know you do like there's random amount of like things that can happen let's say you're a metabolic health and everything like your cells are dividing you can get a mutation you mean cells will take care of it most of the time as you know we're progressing through life until we start to get you know into our what 56 seven decade maybe they mean systems not working as well I mean there's things that you just can't control like there's that like you mentioned so with cancer screening what let's say you don't have any known genetic risk factors and there's no like family history right what age would you say or would decade a life around where would you think that or how do you treat it in your clinical practice with respect to cancer screenings what are the major ones you know to do you said Coleman and breast are there any others yeah so you know a discussion like this always begins with our patients by saying you know you have to understand your risk appetite as an individual and you have to understand the price you're going to pay for screening because there's a couple of prices you pay the first is economic everything we're about to talk about is going to be outside of the standard of care not everything I mean if you're at a certain age you're breast you know your mammography and your colonoscopy will be covered but your colonoscopy won't be covered at the frequency that we're going to recommend you do it and even if your mammography is covered they probably won't cover the MRI or the ultrasound that we're going to recommend because we never recommend mammography and isolation ever if we're doing a PSA on you and any of our metrics show more care is warranted they're not going to cover the follow-up study like a 4K test or a you know multi-parametric MRI unless your PSA is very high so so understand there's a cost that has to go into but I think there's an even bigger cost that you have to be willing to tolerate if you go down this rabbit hole which is the cost of the false positive the emotional cost of the false positive so we always kind of start by explaining how sensitivity and specificity work and I know a lot of people's eyes kind of glaze over and they're like oh my god like I don't want to hear the stats on this but if you don't understand what sensitivity means and you don't understand what's specificity means you can never understand the things that really do matter to anybody who gets a test which is positive and negative predictive value positive predictive value means if this test comes out positive how likely is it that I actually have the thing it says. Conversely if this test comes out negative how likely is it that I'm truly negative you want very high positive predictive value and very high negative predictive value and that's a function of three things the specificity of a test which is the ability of a test to detect a condition being present if it is indeed present the specificity of a test the ability of a test to conclude that something is absent if it is indeed absent and the prevalence of the condition being tested meaning how likely is it that you have this before I test you so you can call that prevalence if you're screening you can call it pre-test probability but the point is this is all a Bayesian process so I really spend a lot of time going through this with people and let's just you know start with something as simple as mammography right so you know so Peter why why are you saying you're not satisfied just doing the mammography well here's why mammography has a sensitivity of about 90 percent and a specificity of about 85 percent which is fine except if I'm going to do a mammography on you at this moment in time your pre-test probability for having breast cancers pretty low like a couple percent that means the positive and negative predictive value of this test in isolation are very poor like less than 20 percent um furthermore there are features about you personally that might make you a bad candidate for MRI in isolation one is you're very young you're not in menopause yet your breast tissue is very glandular now in 40 years on a mammogram your breasts are going to look totally different the mammogram will actually have an easier time seeing what's going on in your breast because there's going to be less dense glandular tissue the mammogram because it's an x-ray is really good at seeing calcified lesions it's really bad at seeing non-calcified lesions conversely an MRI is really has no issue with glandular tissue but can't see calcified lesions very well so we go through this analysis and you realize there's actually no perfect test for screening you have to stack tests on top of each other if you want to increase positive and negative predictive value and if you rely on any one test by itself you're always going to have a blind spot the one exception to that by the way is a colonoscopy a colonoscopy is a test that has 100% cests sensitivity and very high specificity but with colonoscopy you have a whole different risk which is a physical risk there's actually a risk of harm from a colonoscopy basically three big risks there's the risk of dehydration electrolyte imbalance high potential that comes from the bowel prep there's the risk of the sedation and then there's the risk of a perforation or bleeding actual procedural risks now if you look at the largest study that came out on this which was last summer and then went on journal medicine this was actually a study that was meant to show that colonoscopy wasn't worth it actually showed something totally different in my mind which showed how safe it was so it was a study of I think over 20,000 people and had not a single incident so it showed that in good hands a colonoscopy is a very safe procedure but I always want to make sure people understand like we don't take this stuff lightly and there's a reason you don't do a colonoscopy three times a year which if you did colonoscopy three times a year you'd never get colon cancer because you know colon cancer always has to come from a polyp so if you were checking somebody three times a year like you never they would never be able to develop a polyp that you wouldn't catch but at that point their risk would be just too high that something else would go wrong so you know standard recommendations used to be every 10 years starting at 50 current recommendations are starting at 45 and there's some controversy about whether you would do it every five to 10 years we typically say with no family history or risk factors meaning you don't have inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease or things like that we would typically say 40 and then about every three years depending on the findings so sometimes the findings on a given colonoscopy will make you want to actually do a more frequent surveillance if you find a Cecil Pollab for example or if a patient has an incomplete bowel prep you might decide you know actually we need to do this a little more urgently and do it in a year again as opposed to wait three great information and with respect to the combined you know especially for younger individuals like younger like myself the mammogram starting so so I might say like you know at 40 I would start doing a mammoth and an ultrasound every other year sorry every six months so you would do a mammoth every year you would an ultrasound every six months every year but staggered them by six months so if there was if there was a high enough risk that's probably an approach I would take now is that because there's a lifetime risk of one and eight just for I'm like on average forget about all the month okay and again breast cancer is one of those cancers where if you treat it early like it's it's it's absolutely a disease that that can be treated early if you catch this in a stage one it's a non-fatal disease a stage four disease is a uniformly fatal disease what's the positive predictive value of catching it in stage one with the combination well so okay so so the the way to think about it is you think about it as what's the positive predictive value of the combined modalities and and and here it's a little more complicated because it depends on the hormone status so I'll give you an example another thing that we use that we haven't talked about are liquid biopsies yeah so we incorporate liquid biopsies into our testing yeah yeah so so have you talked about them in podcast you listen to what they are there question I was going to ask you about with you know the the grail by the gallery by grail yeah yeah okay so what does this test do so the there are basically three things that you can figure out by looking at strands of DNA in the blood that can give you a clue as to whether or not a patient has cancer so let's say you collect a bunch of you you connect you know the grail test uses 10 CC of blood relatively poultry some of blood and they look at all of the cell free DNA so again they separate the DNA that's in cells they don't want that right from the cell free DNA and determine so so basically there could be known mutations that we know are cancer genes like a K-Rass mutation or P53 mutation where you might say oh if you see that K-Rass mutation like there's cancer somewhere in the body the second thing that gives you a clue that there could be cancer in the body is the length of the DNA fragments that you see so there's been you know this is not what grail does by the way but there are other technologies that are looking at fragment length and using fragment length to impute probability of cancer what grail does is they look at a third thing which is methylation so they say okay well all of this DNA is yours we're not going to worry about what the mutations are what the fragment lengths are but what we do know is certain methylation patterns are indicative of cancer and tissue of origin that's a very big deal so now you are doing a screen for not just does this patient likely have cancer or not but if they do can you tell me where that's coming from so we can now go and look more closely there now there's something really interesting about how this works because it's different from any other type of screening test see that MRI that we talked about or the ultrasound or the mammogram or the colonoscopy for that matter are basically morphology tests you're looking visually either directly in the case of colonoscopy or indirectly in the form of a mammogram where you have to look through the tissue you're looking at the morphology of a cancer the grail test says nothing about that it's simply telling you is this a cancer that is leaving it's site of origin or shedding its DNA in sufficient enough quantities outside of origin so something very interesting emerges when you take a closer look at the grail data and this is why we use the test again I have no affiliation with grail so this is you know just my clinical experience and observation at first glance the sensitivity of the grail test for breast cancer is quite low the specificity is very high for grail by the way meaning if you don't have cancer it is very likely to tell you you don't have cancer the sensitivity is quite low meaning if you have cancer it could miss it and it's been tuned that way so the algorithm has been tuned for a very high specificity a low sensitivity but if you look at breast cancer overall sensitivity it's about 20% for stage one stage two which seems kind of abysmal meaning if you have a breast cancer that's early stage stage one stage two there's only like a 20% chance it'll show up on the grail test and many people myself included at one point thought that doesn't justify doing the test I don't need a liquid biopsy to tell me I've got a stage three breast cancer like I'm going to figure that out falling off a log right so I need something to tell me when there's a stage one breast cancer but a closer look at the data showed that if you looked at ERPR negative breast cancers stage one stage two sensitivity was 75 to 80% it was only in the triple positive ERPR positive hertonu positive that the sensitivity specificity or so low and since that's the majority of breast cancers it brings it down what does this mean it means that the more indolent a breast cancer is the less likely the grail test picks it up at an early stage but the more aggressive it is the more likely it is to pick it up at an early stage the implication might be here that it's catching the cancers that matter and I think that's a very interesting way to combine liquid biopsies with morphologic studies do you ever not can but like do you think doing just a liquid biopsy by itself would be a useful thing or do you think really it's better with you know in combination with other morphology types of screen yeah that's a great question I mean we don't do them in isolation because I still think we're in really early days and I just think a little bit of a belt and suspenders approach make sense but it'll be wonderful if the day comes when all you need to do is the liquid biopsy and only if it comes up positive do you need to go and do a morphologic survey a couple of questions so you know talking about some of the major screenings the colonoscopy of the mammogram you mentioned PSA are so so with like some of these you know types of morphology screenings like the mammogram for example people are considered like there's a whole group of people that are very concerned about the potential the mutagenic potential of you know these types of screening methods you know potentially causing cancer right so CT scans the x-rays well CT scans would be a very lousy way to screen for that reason right the CT scan has a lot of radiation with the exception the only time we justify the use of a CT scan is in a former smoker or a current smoker we don't have any current smokers in our products but we do have former smokers we do still use a low dose CT for lung screening remember lung cancer risk is lung cancers the leading cause of cancer death globally and in the US for both men and women and 85% of lung cancers occur in former smokers or current smokers so in those people you have to ask the question what kind of cancers do they get and you basically have small cell large cell and squamous cell are the dominant cancers that occur in smokers and those are best detected on a low-dose CT scan add no carcinoma of the lung is the dominant cause of lung cancer in a non-smoker and we can detect that equally well with an MRI so we don't expose a never smoker to at risk whereas to a smoker we you know a past smoker or current smoker the risk reward trade-off is worth it and that's been documented really clearly in clinical trials mammography has incredibly low radiation not as low as like a dexis scan or something like that but it's still really really low so there's a lot of women that avoid that I'm sure there are I don't know maybe their the radiation has lessened over the years and it always has I mean radiation is constantly going down I mean just going back to something we spoke about earlier 20 years ago a seat so just let's explain what the numbers mean so radiation is measured in units called milly cverts and it's generally established that exposure to more than 50 milly cverts a year will increase your risk of muted genesis so now let's put that in the context of certain things so living at sea level here in San Diego the just the exposure you get to the environment is about one to two milly cverts a year so that's two to four percent of your annual allotment if you live in Denver you're doubling that so being one mile in the sky doubles your exposure but you're still you know you're you know four to eight percent of your annual allotment um a CT angiogram 20 years ago was 20 milly cverts 40 percent of your annual radiation allotment on one test the last patient I sent for a CTA last week because when we get the report it also shows the radiation less than one milly cvert so mammograms are even point less than that so it really is it makes zero sense for a woman who has a lifetime risk one and eight and perhaps even higher if she's obese and right friends I'll call it my two of four way to to avoid doing mammograms correct okay yeah but again I would never rely on a mammogram exclusively I would combine it with an ultrasound or the MRI yeah but they're not concerned about people aren't really scared of the ultrasound so they're scared they're scared yeah and MRI of course has a radiation so but but again everyone has you know you just have to unfortunately there's a lot of fear mongering that goes on but you just have to look at the numbers I mean it's crystal clear that a mammogram has a very very there might be confusing it with there there was another test I'm blanking on what it's called now because it's never done anymore um it's called I think it was called a molecular breast imaging it was another high high intensity mammogram it's again I've never seen one done I don't think they've been done in years but pre MRI like pre utility for other tests it was done it was also about a 20 to 30 millilies of Earth where this is all stand I'm sure it's I'm sure there's a complete misinformation and misunderstanding where people are confusing mammogram from from what's called an MBI is what the test was called well this is good to clear up um I because I mean I'm not just I'm not kidding like I know people I know women that have this fear so um you know I think stepping sort of stepping back just one more thing I want to ask you about is like blood cancers is there any like what is that? Biopsies are very good on blood cancers actually because you have the highest proportion of those cells like you're going to get a much higher concentration of uh self-re DNA so yeah we actually that's one of the areas where I'm most excited about the liquid biopsies is on leukemias and um you know other other sort of hematologic issues uh such as my Loma and things like that and for people listening wondering about the cost of it's to it's like 900 like yeah about it's about $2,000 yeah and I don't think it's D to C so I'm meaning I think you have to go through your doctor to do it I don't think you can just do the test willy nilly I don't think you can yeah but I don't know for sure yeah I'd be surprised if you could so on the breast cancer topic you know kind of going um into another area I've just I know we got we got we're we're doing okay um but I really want to get your thoughts on this this topic which is you know what broader sense hormones um but also just like if you look at the way a woman ages before menopause I mean she's aging slower than a man right like by yeah yeah yeah when she hits menopause I mean it's like you hear this quote unquote cliff they fall like a woman in terms of their aging they fall off this cliff like it's no longer I mean it's just they go rapidly you know down so what are what are let's just talk about some of the risk factors that women face you know after menopause and why yeah so so obviously what happens in menopause is three hormones that are really important to a woman during her reproductive years go away and they go away in very short order so it's it can be quite dramatic um and obviously those hormones are estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone I always mentioned testosterone because it's it's easily forgotten but it's important to not forget it because a woman's concentration of testosterone in her uh and by the way testosterone declines slower than estrogen and progesterone and estrogen progesterone really go down testosterone kind of gradually goes down but like right now we're sitting here and you're you know you're 45 presumably you know you're you're still in the throes of your reproductive you're at the tail end of your reproductive capacity but you have an atmenopause yet um your testosterone right now is at least 10 times higher than your estrogen level uh in absolute quantities and by the way that's the highest that's if you're ovulating so your peak estrogen is at around ovulation um if I take you in the early follicular cycle or in the luteal cycle your testosterone could be a hundred times higher than your testosterone so it's very important to understand don't get confused by the units on the lab test because they're reporting them in nanograms predestilator versus peakograms per milliliter and so the estrogen number looks bigger but in terms of absolute amounts of it testosterone is still the uh by far the dominant hormone for both men and women so um these things go away and a whole bunch of things happen now in the short run and the things that generally get the most attention of the medical community are these vasemotor symptoms so the hot flashes and the night sweats and these are kind of the first things that women tend to notice I mean they might notice that their period is becoming a regular their cycle is lengthening and things of that nature but in terms of actual symptoms that are disruptive to their quality of life it are these vasemotor symptoms so hot flashes and night it's not clear why some women get these horribly and some women actually don't get them at all most women do get them to varying degrees and again there's a there's a spectrum there other women will talk about things like brain fog sleep disturbances and again the sleep disturbances could be related to what we just said because I got to think if you're having hot flashes and night sweats that can't be good for your sleep so you know is that sufficiently driving the sleep disturbances or is there something else that's driving them um as time progresses into menopause other things will occur there will be sexual changes so vaginal atrophy, dryness and reduction in libido and again those can be related but they can be independent we know testosterone plays an important role in libido and we know that estradiol plays an important role in vaginal in the absence of estrogen is driving the vaginal symptoms so um and of course if and then of course you have pain within of course that's a result of all of those things as well which then feeds forward on the decreased libido as you go a little bit further you start to see another major consequence of this which is the destruction of bone and I use that word I'm being a little aggressive in my language there but the truth of it is both men and women hit peak bone density in their early 20s and for men the if you look at their reduction in bone mineral density from their 20s on it's a gradual decline for women it's a gradual decline until menopause then a very straight harsh line decline and when you consider the risk of um falling and the impact of uh broken hip or femur later in life both in terms of mortality and morbidity you realize that that may be the single biggest risk of menopause on women though not appreciated in their 50s and not only show him another 60s so taken together all of these symptoms in my mind completely justified the use of HRT in any woman who is willing to undergo it and unfortunately and I've talked about this a lot on my podcast I think there has been no greater disservice brought by the medical community onto anyone but in particular in this case women then the abject failure of the interpretation of the women's health initiative in 2001 2002 whenever it was first published that's a study that was completely misinterpreted the press um were I mean out to lunch in the way they interpreted the study and the investigators were in my mind equally at fault for not clarifying it now at least one member of the team who was a part of that study Joanne Manson has been more vocal lately I had her on my podcast she's been more vocal in acknowledging the the way in which that study was misinterpreted but unfortunately the damage has largely been done both in terms of the fact that there is an entire generation of women by my estimate and by the estimate of my analysis my analysts analysis over 20 million women have been deprived hormones that who would have otherwise received them and we've even come up with some calculations for how many lives have been unnecessarily lost as a result of that and then there's the ongoing damage which is you know as uh uh Mark Mark Twain is attributed for saying this right like a lie will travel halfway around the world before the truth is tied up with shoes so um just as you said there are women out there who say I can't get a mammography because oh my god of the radiation they may in fact be thinking of an MBI there's just a misunderstanding well some of the are still women walking around today that it thinking HRT increases the risk of dying a breast cancer when it never did and it certainly doesn't today so let's let's talk a little bit about um about that like I know like I've looked into the women's health initiative I've heard you speak about it and you know it's uh some of the major major flaws of that study were one being well so I want it let's let's talk about what the study did right so the study took um two groups of women women who had a uterus and women who didn't have a uterus and randomized each of those groups into two separate groups treatment versus placebo why was that done well it was well understood by then as it still remains that in women with a uterus failure to give progesterone with estrogen increases endometrial hyperplasia so if you take a woman with a uterus and you just give her estrogen but there's no progesterone her endometrial lining will thicken will thicken and as the endometrial lining gets thicker so too goes the risk of hyperplasia and ultimately what's called dysplasia which can lead to cancer in other words unaposed estrogen will increase the risk of endometrial cancer so to this day we know this and we do this um so if you had a uterus you were put into a group where the treatment group was given conjugated equine estrogen and mpa so that's uh that's estrogen taken from horse urine and a synthetic pregestin and the treatment and the placebo group was just given a placebo and in the other group the no uterus group they were just given conjugated equine estrogen versus placebo they didn't have to be given the mpa the synthetic estrogen um these women were on average considerably older they were I want to say seven to ten years out of menopause at this point um and the study was looking at a number of outcomes but it was terminated early at about five and a half years when it was noted that the women in the CEE plus MPA group versus the placebo had um a 0.1% higher risk of developing breast cancer um interestingly the women in the CEE alone group had a lower risk of developing breast cancer so the study was halted and the headline read estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer by 25 well this wasn't correct um it is true that in the CEE plus MPA group the group that that group had five cases of breast cancer per thousand women compared to four cases of breast cancer per thousand women in the placebo group and it is true that that's a 25% increase in the relative risk but of course the absolute risk is 0.1%. There was no difference in breast cancer mortality in other words there was an extra one case of breast cancer but there was no difference in breast cancer mortality those data by the way have been updated every decade or so and we now have like 19 year follow up on that group and that fact still remains true to this day there is still no difference in the mortality of breast cancer in the CEE plus MPA group but you see it would be impossible to make the case that estrogen is the cause there when in the other group you saw the exact opposite effect you saw that the CEE group alone had a lower incidence of breast cancer and eventually even a lower mortality due to breast cancer so I feel like I don't know maybe a 10th grade science student might come up with a different hypothesis then estrogen is the culprit in this group you have A plus B in this group you have A what could be the difference might it be the B so I think most people who think about this problem today acknowledge that it's probably the MPA that was driving the very very small clinically insignificant but statistically significant increase in breast cancer incidents that had no translation to a mortality difference and you want to ask the question well is MPA in use today and the answer is pretty much by nobody there's I don't I've never once prescribed MPA I've never seen a patient come to me who's taking MPA they're probably are some patients on it but I doubt it and what is MPA again it's a synthetic pregestive okay nowadays women take bio identical micronized oral progesterone or they use a progesterone coded iUD if they don't if they don't benefit symptomatic from progesterone progesterone is a funny hormone some women really don't respond well to it it doesn't help their symptoms in any way shape or form and in those women we don't even use it we just use a progesterone coded iUD and that provides the local protection that prevents and and to me trial hyperplasia so in that sense you know you you know I could dive deeper and deeper and go through the weeds on the whole study but the punchline is very clear here right which is estrogen absolutely did not drive either the incidence of breast cancer or mortality associated with breast cancer and again that was not true in 2002 it was not true in 2006 it is not true today that is one piece of the study that I didn't catch because you know I when trying to sort of deconstruct it it was like okay well the synthetic of course versus bio identical versus the age of initiation so like you said these women were like 10 years I mean like on average like after menopause had hit was another factor and then you know some of them were very very unhealthy again like yeah it was a very it was a very unhealthy population to begin with um the other thing about it by the way is we don't use oral estrogen anymore yeah so that's another question what so um can you talk about the little bit of the differences just you know sort of not so much deep into the deepness of it but like the difference between in oral estrogen bio identical estrogen topical like you know what so the only estrogen that are used today are bio identical which means um their extra dial and or estriol but there is no FDA approved estriol products so there are three estrogens E1 E2 E3 there's some important nuance here that maybe justifies explaining so estriol can be turned into estron which is E1 and it can be turned into E3 estriol but E3 cannot be turned into E2 or E1 so that's a one way arrow E3 can be turned into this complicated let me say E1 can be turned into a two four and 16 hydroxy estron so you got E3 that can go into an E sorry E1 can be turned into a two hydroxy four hydroxy or 16 hydroxy E3 can actually be turned into the two hydroxy but not the four hydroxy or the 16 hydroxy virtually all the breast cancer risk probably comes from the four hydroxy estron so you can get that from estriol put it me from estriol but you can't get it from estriol there is no FDA approved product for estriol so if woman is taking estriol which she's probably taking in a topical fashion in combination with um estriol that they usually refer to that as a buy est you'll hear that abbreviated buy est which just means buy estriol so they'll combine in some fraction anywhere from 50 50 to 80 20 estriol with estriol and a woman will apply that topically but again that's not FDA approved that is something that compounding pharmacies would have to make for a physician in terms of FDA approved products you have oral estriol identical we don't use it because frankly there is a small but non-zero increase in the risk of hypercoagulability it just doesn't seem like it's a risk worth taking like the only indication in my mind for oral estriol is for women whose skin will not permit the absorption of any topical estriol product our preferred product is an estriol patch we use the branded version I actually when it comes to hormones I really prefer using branded versions of an FDA approved compound we prefer to use something called the Vival dot so it's an FDA approved estriol patch a woman applies the patch you apply the you know the patch comes in different doses and you can trim it if you want more or less estriol and she changes it like every three or four days so you know you'll put it on your lower back or your hip but something like that on your shoulder like you just put it somewhere where it's not sort of intrusive by the way we do notice variable absorption with sauna use so if the time ever comes for you to use it we should discuss paying attention to different absorption rates but nevertheless we don't have any issues with that there are austral estrogen pellets that can be inserted in the subcue space or into the fat really and they're also not FDA approved but you know there's still used pretty liberally by physicians who know how to put them in I used to do this for my female patients I don't anymore I just tend to prefer the patch truthfully because it gives a more steady state level dose of the estriol and you can you can make adjustments easily with the pellets you put it in there you got to wait five or six months before you figured out again and decide what to do so those are basically the ways in which you would take estriol in and as I said progesterone you would do either oral micronized bioidentical or you would use a progesterone code at iUD they also do make progesterone repositories but for most women the compliance with that is low it's just messy and you know kind of inconvenient there's also topical estrogen products so you do have some women who say look I just do not want to take estriol in under any shape or form I don't want any since you know I don't want any um estrogen in my body but these vasimotor pardon me these vaginal symptoms are problematic then you can use vaginal estrogen cream or vaginal suppositories of estrogen again that won't give you any of the bone protection that won't stop the night sweats or anything like that but using vaginal estrogen products alone will at least emulate the sexual side effects what about the difference between like multi-phase egg versus whatever the mono like when you so like giving women estrogen in like more like their cycle versus like the same dose like all the time we would we would kind of use we sometimes do multi-phase egg on progesterone in the transition of parry menopause we don't do it once women are fully in menopause when women are fully in menopause we just sort of stay at the dose again the dose that a woman is on is a very low dose relative to her pre-menopausal levels as indicated by the FSH. Do you go so that was another question do you like let's in your time. How do we tell you? Great yeah well like deter let's say a woman is either pre-menopausal or parry menopausal hat like I guess post-menopausal too but determining like measuring your estrogen measuring your progesterone measuring your testosterone what when in this cycle to do it and what are the love like what to you would say okay this woman's transitioning to parry menopause you know look is there a like a threshold levels yeah we look at day five so if day one is the day the period starts regardless right even if it's just a bit of spotting whatever it is like that's that's the starting point on day five somewhere between day five and day seven we just like to do it on day five you look at extra dial levels and FSH levels that is your canary in the coal mine as that FSH level on day five starts to climb and that extra dial will start to come down but it's mostly the rise in FSH that's how you know you're getting closer and closer to the cliff now there's actually some interesting data that's looking at AMH levels and anti-malarian hormone so this is basically telling you how many eggs you have left how many follicles you have left so this is something that fertility docks are constantly looking at in women who are struggling with fertility or you know deciding if they can still do you know have kids or go through IVF so there may be some also some insight that comes from AMH but typically watching the rising FSH on day five is what's telling you this is coming and then of course you marry that to symptom so I I typically do not treat women until they're symptomatic in parry menopause so I'll you know we'll look at their labs and I'll say you know Rhonda look you're getting closer to something let's just be on guard for it and then you know maybe six months later you'll say all right I'm having some hot flashes and night sweats well okay good you're and you by the way you still may be ovulating you know this can this is what parry menopause looks like right so to me that's when you start treating and you can get away with much lower doses but point I want to make is once you're in full fledged menopause like we're only giving you enough estrogen to get your FSH down to about 25 you now never have an FSH above 25 so remember FSH and estrogen work in opposition to each other so the lower your FSH the higher your ester dial you right now with your regular cycle you've probably never seen an FSH above 12 just to give you a sense at your lowest estrogen right now your highest FSH is 12 when you're in menopause you're going to be managed to an FSH of about 25 to 35 which means your ester dial is going to be lower than it is at any point in your cycle today but that's sufficient to take care of all of your symptoms and preserve your bone density so preserving bone to preserving bone density obviously symptoms but preserving bone density also lowering cardiovascular risk yes lowering Alzheimer's risk Alzheimer's is less clear ronda the data right now suggest the following late initiation of HRT may be counterproductive for AD risk may actually increase AD risk early initiation appears to potentially only be beneficial in e4 women but not e3 women okay so for you I would say doubly beneficial to initiate at the time of menopause because of your e4 got it that's really good to know and also defining what is early in late like you know so that you know there was a study there's a couple of studies one was the elite study and one was the dops so like I don't know it was like early intervention for ester dial or something and then there was another one that was the the Danish osteoporosis prevention study and both of those studies and the in the dops one the the initiation of the they did a ester dial I think they did like triphasic or something but also they did the pregesterone so I had to just learn as well it was like the the cardiovascular disease risk or mortality went down the bbness thrombi thrombi embilism like the things that happened that can increase with menopause went down over the follow-up which was 16 years or something but these women only took it for 11 years and they started at age either between the age of 45 and 58 so parry menopause is in there and also just you know you yeah this is to me the biggest unknown question Rhonda and I don't we don't know the answer and what's what I find very frustrating is we're not going to know the answer because nobody's going to do this study I am as comfortable with anything in medicine as I am that initiating HRT at the time of menopause does not increase a women's risk of heart disease breast cancer anything else in fact it reduces her risk it clearly reduces her risk of heart disease dementia and bmd and it's either protective or neutral uncancer it's like it's neutral yeah it's it's protective or neutral on cancer I am very confident of all of those things here's the thing we don't know what do you do 10 years later what do you do when she's 60 right and again if you look at the HRT data from the women's health initiative with all of its flaws the answer would be you should probably stop but again that study is so flawed on so many levels that I'm not sure and here's where I would argue there's one area where you absolutely know things will get worse when you stop the estrogen and that's bone density so the other things are a little less clear to me there's there's some you know opacity around what will happen to cardiovascular disease risk dementia disease risk and cancer disease risk if you start appropriately initiated HRT after 10 or 15 years but what is unambiguously clear is her bones are going to get brittle again because the moment you take the estrogen away bone density goes down estrogen is the most important hormone in men and women for the regulation of bmd it is the chemical transduction system that turns force into bone building so so we have you know basically strain gauges in our bones that are sensing forces on the bones and that force is being turned via estrogen into a chemical signal to osteoblastin osteoclast to promote bone building and one estrogen goes down that goes away so if you take the estrogen off a woman 10 years post menopause she will once again go into a rapids state of decline now she's still better off because she'll still be further ahead than where she is if you put her into client 10 years sooner so you know i've had arguments with people on the anti HRT side and they say you should never use estrogen for treating bmd because we have disfossvenates and i say first of all you only use disfossvenates for three to five years too they suck meaning they're not as good as estrogen and third you can use estrogen for longer and and they say well yeah but once you take it off it still goes down and it's like yeah but it's a new baseline and it's a higher weighting to retat like you're going to have more in your retirement fund a few retire at seventy versus sixty bang so this is the big question because because i mean and my and and again we've done a back at the envelope calculation that would suggest even if the risk of Alzheimer's disease or heart disease or cancer even if you lost any protection from HRT and maybe how to slide in crease and risk given how big the risk of falling is you you might still end up being neutral risk carrying out HRT indefinitely so this is where you know the lifestyle factors which is probably only of life right but this is probably where lifestyle factors do play somewhat of a role as well because if you have obviously if you've been doing resistance training up until that point and continuing it you're building not only bone you know certainly built up a lot of bone density reserve earlier in life but muscle mass helps right and then let me throw this at you um because i've you know i've thought a lot about the nuclear hormone nuclear hormone it's basically like so so vitamin D is the one that i've really focused on and when i was doing a lot of research on it so so nuclear hormones you know we have serotonous nuclear serotonous I should say sorry so we have estrogen testosterone vitamin D is one so these are these are binding to a receptor that you know in some cases the receptor complexes with other ones it goes into the nucleus of a cell which is where all the DNA is and it goes down to the level of genes and it regular recognizes a little sequence of genes so in the case if estrogen is called an estrogen response element in eRE and the case of vitamin D is called a vdRE vitamin D response element um there's a lot of overlap between vitamin D and estrogen in terms of the genes they're regulating and so i'm wondering if avoiding vitamin D deficiency also becomes one of those important lifestyle factors because you know in some cases obviously vitamin D also plays a role in bone metabolism right but independent of that also just looking at the crosstalk of the genes that vitamin D and estrogen are regulate and they're like they're both and the response elements are they're different but there's somewhat i'm looking at that and it's like oh i wonder if there's like that seems like you might be able to compensate a little so it's kind of another interesting in addition to being you know physically active resistant training one of the most important things right um but also like i did a lot of jumpropping i was a star jumpropper as a kid lots and lots of jumping rope which there is evidence that that also builds bone density so i'm gonna ask you a question about this so what do we know about the relationship between call it naturally acquired vitamin D through sunlight versus supplementation of vitamin D uh exogenously through you know supplement do we do we have any reason to believe that those are different at the same level of vitamin D in the same like like in terms of like how vitamin D is acting so the thing is is that when you're in sunlight like there's other things going on right this is my point like if you're out sort of getting sunlight you're more active and you're nitric oxide like there's like other things that you're getting from the sunlight so there's a confounder there but um i mean like with respect to let's say forget like let's say you finally you you convert the vitamin D 3 into the 25 hydroxy vitamin D into the 125 you know at that level it's it is the same like you know to some degree i mean that's not when it's when it's binding to the vitamin D receptor like the the actual 125 hydroxy vitamin D which is the active steroid hormone it's the same um now with respect to like you know your body regulates how much vitamin D 3 is converted or is released in the bloodstream and converted into 25 hydroxy vitamin D at the level of sun exposure or set a certain level you're not making the vitamin D 3 when you've gotten so much of it that's how you avoid toxicity right like you're not gonna keep you know what's the highest level of vitamin D a person can ever get to naturally meaning if you just like took a an individual and put them in the sun put you know shorts only no shirt go out there and work in the sun for all summer like how high like how high where my vitamin D levels when I was in high school working construction I know there's like data out there where where people have looked at like you know you know people that are that are like out in the they're outside all the time but they're honestly often looking at people like in the tropics and stuff that have uh more melanin yeah which again so it might depend you know also on on that but that would be an interesting at least way to say like the body has a built-in mechanism to say I'm not gonna let you make more vitamin D than this supplementing above that would be a bad idea and it is yeah like and so that's why looking at measuring what if I think that threshold is I think going above 16 anagram's per milliliter is probably still okay like going to 80 you know like there's there's studies looking at 80 and it's still totally with lower all cosmitality um and in fact I mean honestly if you start to look at some of the literature you have to take a really high dose daily for like a decade to start getting like the high calcium but like the problem is that when you absorb when you're Biden when you have a lot of vitamin D you absorb more dietary calcium and you also absorb more phosphorus and calcium plus phosphorus can precipitate right and so like there's so many factors involved but I think most people are not supplemented like there's some people that are crazily supplementing and it's like they just think more of everything is good but I don't think most people are doing that like I don't think taking 5,000, 7,000,000 for most people some people have to take more than that because they have snips right and you've probably seen it in your patients where they're like they had to take a high level just to get up to 30 or 40 this by the way is why I think all these vitamin D trials the mega trials are so flawed is they're always doing it on the basis of A they're taking too low a dose and they're doing it based on dose not level like to me the dispositive study on this would be take a whole bunch of people who's vitamin D is 30 give half of them a placebo give half of them whatever vitamin D is necessary to get them to 60 or 80 yeah get something higher yeah get create separate reaction but be like do it the way we do blood pressure trials and we do a blood pressure trial we don't say you're going to take a fixed dose of a med we give you whatever dose of a med is necessary to change the blood pressure so we're comparing two blood pressure levels not placebo versus 10 milligrams of a drug that for one guy is too much and for one guy is too little and yep this isn't done in vitamin D and I find it infuriating that we have no really good reliable RCT data on what seems like a jugular question are you better off with a vitamin D level of 80 than you are of 30 I mean again we think the answer is yes but the you know evidence based medicine you know crowd will tell you no because this trial that gave people 2,000 IU for 10 minutes found no difference right or they they measured maybe if they if they measured anyone's level they measured like 10% of the population yes exactly let's reach that you we only got a level on 10% of people with with like you know the fact of the matter is so many people do have these snips too yeah and I remember having an email dialogue with Joanne Manson this was yours when I was postdoc and she was I think at the time she was doing the vital study it hadn't been published yet and it was like please please can you get the snip data in there can you get measure the levels like do everything you know like it's it's so important but I'm with you on that I think I think what is clear is avoiding deficiency and I do say that a lot because where are you drawing line is it's 30 or 40 where are you I say 30 I mean it does depend on are you looking are you looking at what the endocrine society says is more of an adequate level or an adequate or you're looking at deficiency where you're like literally like you know like your bones your bone health isn't you know good yeah so but for me I I wanted to do the same thing like I'm always kind of like hovering around 50 60 but I'm like should I be at 80 you know and I don't know so it's always like okay well I err on the side of caution you know err on the side of caution certainly avoiding deficiency yeah but even with respect to like all these genes I'm talking about you know like what if there's some cross talk with that there is cross talk but what if there's some way that having a level of vitamin D you know 50 50 or 60 nanograms for milliter does help alleviate some of the effects of having no estrogen you know like we don't really know it is especially when you look at the mechanism and I like I said I spent a lot of time looking at these response elements and and you know looking at the fact that estrogen can actually compensate for vitamin D deficiency in some cases with certain genes too and it goes both ways so I'm like well I feel like that should be an important component in the equation right but I'm with you on the tent like like this even the studies I was talking about where there was protective effects against you know in the cardiovascular health and cancer prevention with hormone replacement therapy when initiated like you know within a close range like not greater than six years so six years or less so if you're doing it seven years that's not part of the study um it they only did it for like 10 or 11 years and they stopped and it's like well what happens then when you're 65 and you start at 55 you know like so we don't we don't know the question to that I mean the answer to that either but I'm happy that you're thinking about it so you know one thing maybe even before we go to male hormones that I didn't mention on the female side was testosterone and this is you know I mentioned earlier of course the the abundance of testosterone and a woman prior to menopause but what's what's far less studied is the impact of testosterone replacement in women post menopause and this is something that is being studied so so by the time this podcast comes out there'll be a couple of podcasts I've released on the topic of sexual health but through the lens of both male and female so so Sharon parish and Moe Kara will be the two folks that I've discussed with on that and Moe's actually involved he's at Baylor in Texas he's involved in a study that is looking at the use of testosterone replacement in women for sexual function so both Moe and Sharon talk extensively about the importance of testosterone in sexual function specifically around libido and orgasmic function along with a rousal so this is like I mean I've said this before you know I said it I think to them on the podcast it's rare that I go into a podcast with so little information on a topic usually I like you know like you know all the answers to the questions you're asking me because you've prepared for it right but but you know usually when I'm going into a podcast I kind of know what's going on but I was blown away in my discussions with with with Moe and Sharon on these topics so the long and short of it is we have become much more liberal in our use of testosterone in women for any sort of sexual side effects also keep in mind we've talked about it but the importance of maintaining muscle mass as you age is imperative just as imperative for women as it is for men and testosterone is the dominant hormone there so again when people hear this they kind of think what we're talking about like animal extarides and it's like well yeah testosterone is an animal extarides what we're talking about is replacing women to the levels that they were at in there of 30s and 40s these are very very low levels of testosterone typically about one tenth the dose that men take to also have a physiologic replacement and that's about one tenth the level that you know body builders would take so we're not talking about huge amounts of testosterone but just restoring someone to physiologic levels can have profound impacts but is that in combination with also giving these women the the estrogen testosterone yes estrogen pressure because you you know what would happen if you just we're doing the testosterone and let's say a woman let's say a woman was 10 years out missed the whole uh yeah interesting yeah the missed the the the the window yeah yeah and and and this is something that people have asked me what what do I do like how do I how do I you know get some benefits you know without actually taking you know estrogen and testosterone um would you also give that person so the two questions there are yeah um great great question um we we handle each of those I hate to say this because it sounds like such an obvious cliche we handle each of those in a case by case basis um so I want you know I won't sugarcoat it like we're not very comfortable doing initiating HRT and women who are 10 years out but at the same time we realize there are a lot of women who are 60 today who went through menopause at the height of the stupidity around the WHI and as a result of that like their worse off today than they would have been had they been on the appropriate hormones 10 years ago and we have to make a very difficult decision about whether it's worth additional risk and I say that because we don't know what the risk is um and so the way we handle that is we basically try to figure out what is your risk of AD AACVD and cancer specifically breast cancer as it stands now and you know for example if a woman is especially high risk for one of those things particularly AD if she's a three three um or even an or even a three four four four and and or if she's very high risk of breast cancer we might be a little bit more reluctant to do so um or if we do it we do it at an even lower dose than we normally would and we have to increase our surveillance around those things so not not an easy question to your other question would we be comfortable using testosterone in isolation without opposition um I would say at this point I'm not I'm not I don't think I know the answer to that question yet um and I think that that's something that would need further study before we could sort of make a clear recommendation in in the cases of the uh in your clinical practice you're handling the hormone replacement therapy is is testosterone part of the equation or do you ask is it like a more of a symptom thing like my libido's down even though I'm also on estrogen with it's not a stand yeah it's not nothing is standard right everything is bespoke and I and I think that that's just really important for anybody listening to this right it's like you don't want to go to somebody who does paint by numbers you know paint by numbers is a bad approach everybody's on this everybody's on that no no it's like you know some women do not absorb testosterone very well apart me do not absorb estrogen very well from a cream some you know might end up requiring to take it orally some uh much prefer a cream some prefer a patch some can tolerate some some only need this dose some need that does some need a very small amount of oral progesterone you do need at least a hundred milligrams to oppose the estrogen at the endometrial level so you know somewhere between one hundred and two hundred is probably necessary some can't tolerate it at all and you have to use the iUD when it comes to testosterone there's lots of ways to deliver it right so one of the most interesting ways that's being studied now is using an FDA approved product it's not approved for this use so it's called netesto and it's an intranazile testosterone spray that is FDA approved for male use for testosterone replacement therapy but it's being used off label it's also being tested in a clinical trial for libido and women it has a higher acting so one another point to think about here is where the testosterone where the androgen receptors are factors into it so the intranazile testosterone probably is more rapid acting in terms of sex drive in libido whereas the intranazile testosterone for women increases or gasmic function so even the way in which you use testosterone can impact function and what your indication is I and a question I have is what one of the questions I had regarding men had to do with the types of testosterone like your administering but like taking a step back like you hear a lot about low T and there's this controversy around it like what defines low T is it levels is it combination of levels and symptoms so how are like we're looking at men opposing women we're talking about an average age about 51 or something like that right men let's take the same period of life from men okay 50s do they start to experience like a decrease in testosterone yeah but it's more gradual and it starts frankly in your 20s and 30s so so male testosterone probably peaks in the 20s and it's just a slow steady decline it's not it's not like in the case of women where they you know they go through puberty they have these hormones that are cyclical and then fall off a cliff with men it's sort of you go through puberty you kind of peak and then you're on a slow decline down so you're right low T is really a combination of levels and symptoms and it's really important to remember that symptoms matter because levels are really well how can I put it delicately I mean just not as helpful as we'd like to believe they are and it's actually comes back to something you've talked about a minute ago right which is how do these hormones work these hormones work by binding to endrogen receptors and they testosterone androgen receptor complex has to make its way into the nucleus where it impacts transcription factors now we know that not all men have the same density of endrogen receptors and we know that not all endrogen receptors function in the exact same way so have this problem which is we sit here and we measure testosterone levels in men and maybe we measure bio-available or free testosterone but those are just estimates they aren't actually telling you free testosterone level you're measuring total testosterone you're measuring sex hormone binding globular you're measuring albumin you use those to estimate the free amount of testosterone but that's still an estimate kind of like LDLC calculated by the free-dwell formulas and estimate and then you sort of have to guess well maybe their endrogen receptors are saturated maybe they're not but if you're giving a guy testosterone in the presence of mild to low T you're assuming his endrogen receptors are not saturated and therefore giving him more testosterone will lead to an increase saturation of the AR and will lead to more nuclear transcription but we have no way of measuring that and so what I always say to patients is I got to see a certain set of symptoms in combination with a biochemical set of labs that make sense and then we have to test it out but it's not going to be a placebo test so we're going to have a placebo effect and then if the if the response we see isn't a hell yes I think we should pull it all off and see if we notice a response in the deficit and I'm looking for symptoms as follows right so I'm looking for some signs and some symptoms most of it is symptoms so it's you know reduction in libido reduction in energy mood and then on the signs we're kind of looking for insulin resistance difficulty putting on muscle mass and difficulty recovering from exercise those are kind of your big ones and some combination of those signs and symptoms coupled with a biochemical story that's plausible so you know your total testosterone might be below the 30th percentile or even 40th percentile and your free is commensurate with that even though again that's an estimate is probably reason in my book to initiate and is there a level that you decide to go to like so I mean is there like a threshold where it's like this is too much to stop yeah it's actually kind of like what we were talking about on the vitamin D front like don't be too incremental you're not going to get the answer so if if if and again each lab's going to have different scales but in you know in the lab we use the fifth percentile of total testosterone well let's do free testosterone because we actually even though free is an estimate we kind of look more closely at free so approximately the fifth percentile is five nanograms per deciliter and the 95th percentile is about 24 nanograms per deciliter so call it five to 25 basically so if the guy is at eight and we have the the case to make that he's going to we should try TRT I'm not going to take him to 12 it's incremental like I'm going to take him from eight to 20 and see if something that and if he says to me at 20 I don't feel any different and we take it away and he says I don't feel any different unless we were only treating this for insulin resistance and muscle mass those were the only things in which case I would say we still say the course and see if those things get better but if he you know if if we were doing this because there was you know some of the other actual symptoms then I would say that look this guy might have been already saturated at at eight nanograms per deciliter where he started and all that additional testosterone may have done him no good whereas somebody else might have been woefully under saturated and when you you know increase in by 150 percent you actually got benefit from it does the like injection versus like a gel does that matter like we're very biased towards injections I think they're far more consistent I think you know you have variable absorption and it doesn't just vary by individual it varies by time of day so you know for example like if you're if you just finished a workout and you're sweating and even if you go and have a shower you're still kind of in a less absorptive state than maybe if you're cold you know what part of your body do you put it on do you have to exfoliate the skin first you have hair on the skin you know you want to put it on an area that doesn't have hair there's just more issues with it so we recommend in injection we also recommend instead of doing it every two weeks which is standard doing it twice a week at obviously a much lower dose so typical dose would be somewhere between 80 and 100 milligrams of testosterone a week so it would be 50 to 40 to 50 milligrams twice a week and that produces just a much more steady level because you're you're really trying to get the steadiest level possible and the problem with doing it every two weeks which was usually done in the days when people would go to their doctor to get the injection and you wanted to minimize the inconvenience of that you're just super physiologic for you know four or five days then you're kind of physiologic and then you're actually back to down to being very sub physiologic before the dose so we'd like to avoid that is there any like what's the relationship between testosterone placement therapy and like the prostate yeah very well studied so a couple things we know is clear is day right so we know that the lower the testosterone the higher the risk of high-grade prostate cancer so again contrary to popular belief testosterone placement therapy does not increase the risk of prostate cancer but what it does do is potentially increase BPH benign prosthetic hypertrophy so it does increase the size of the prostate potentially so so one you know needs to be mindful of that and also there are there are side effects of testosterone right it will drive hair loss in an individual who's susceptible to hair loss through the sort of androgen pathways there it can increase acne and a susceptible individual again these things are typically more the type of side effects that people talk about when testosterone is being used in super physiologic levels so I'm just trying to think the last time we saw a patient who had acne I'll probably see it once a year so these are really infrequent side effects but we do have a lot of patients who you know are concerned about hair loss and and so we say look I mean there are strategies around that of course you can take a five-alpha reductase inhibitor so those are drugs that block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotistosterone which is a more potent androgen and that's the that's the androgen that's driving androgen specific hair loss or they might say like I've had patients say oh you know what like my my hair matters more to me than my testosterone I don't want to take testosterone so so so those are the things that we just kind of want to point out the only other thing that's worth noting is I do believe that in a susceptible individual in the short run there's probably a slight increase in the risk of cardiovascular events with testosterone and it's probably born through an increase in blood pressure so there was a very large study that looked at kind of high risk men and they were given testosterone and at one year post initiation of TRT there was a slight increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events in the testosterone group compared to the placebo group that vanished at two and three years almost suggesting that the highest risk men probably those that were closest to having an event were actually pushed over the edge a little bit again I would probably attribute that to an increase in blood pressure as the thing that was potentially driving it so you know we're not keen to put guys on testosterone until we have the house in order with respect to everything else what what sort of blood pressure do you like levels do you like to do very aggressive right I mean if you look at the sprint trial I think it's very clear that 120 over 80 or better is the place to be and that's better than 130 over 85 which used to be the standard for hypertension right okay so we're very aggressive the good news with blood pressure unlike the lip you know we spent a lot of time talking about lipids and a listener may come away from that thinking okay there's some dietary stuff but you guys didn't talk about exercise and you're right exercise doesn't move lipids that much like you're gonna be you're heading down the path of pharmacology much sooner on the lipid front but blood pressure is just as big a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as lipids and it's way more amenable to I hate the word but lifestyle intervention you know losing weight and exercising will fix a lot of people's blood pressure not everybody we have some very lean fit healthy people in our practice who still have essential hypertension and it has to be lowered pharmacologically but for many people you know losing 20 pounds and exercising especially is going to do amazing things on their blood pressure have you looked at so I have a relative who exercises good diet like the only thing that lowers her blood pressure is hottubs interesting I in addition to the exercise and it's like very she's also a very high stress like which is obviously I wonder if it's funny I wonder if it's the impact of you know whether it be sauna or or hot tub on on hypercordicillemia that might be having the indirect effect on blood pressure because she is absolutely prone to high cortisol she's like it's a very high stress and the other thing is you know so Dan he also I mean he's exercises a lot diet like we have the same diet my blood pressure I mean like I've got phenomenal blood pressure like always always I mean like really love like I'm actually on the side of like I need to be make sure I'm not like too low but he at times like when measuring it at home by the way people at home should just get an automated cuff right I mean like absolutely yeah and then whenever you finish this story I'll walk through to make sure everybody's measuring correctly okay yes please do he has himacromatosis okay and there's some other relatives that had it and notice that their blood pressure was high like we're talking people that are like very like doing lots of super like you know you know running marathons they're doing you know like they're very super healthy and donating blood seem to help normalize the blood pressure for whatever reason I don't know which is important for obviously getting rid of the iron and hemacromatosis right but the other thing that's really helps it down is doing that now but the other thing that seems to really help him I mean he does sauna hot tub exercise you know and there'll be times when he's in his office working and he's like 135 systolic and it's like in the world that's crazy right green shakes help him so like tons of like nitrates so a bunch of like green vegetables and these are like nasty tasting shakes these are not like a tasting one not a G no and and that will that will help him as well so yeah exercise is very important but like there's also like has he tried like coca flavonoids things like that you know we I was I give that to so another story no I wasn't doing that where we haven't been doing that because we take a lot of our vitamins at night we do take some fish oil in the morning I did mention that to him because another story my mother who is sedentary she's lost a lot of weight but she's still overweight she you know she she's she's losing the weight was great I mean she's lost like 75 pounds like she's lost a lot of weight he look at the pictures it's like years to her life have been extended just by that it alone but I can't like I can get her in this sauna sometimes but it's still it's still like a little bit more of an effort but one thing about her is she will take the vitamins I give her and she's got she's homozygous for mth fr if she's not taking a high dose like b supplement along with like a methyl folae like her homocysteine will go high and her blood pressure goes up and she had stopped taking all those because she wasn't over my house all the time where I was giving it to her everyday and so I I got her you know this like sort of like battery of supplements that I was giving her including all the the methyl folae and lowering her things that were lowering her homocysteine along with magnesium and cocoa flavonoids I was giving her cocoa via she's getting four of those pills she gets forward she still takes them her blood pressure went from like one fifty five to like one twenty five okay her doctors are like they wanted to get her on anti-hat protective treatment of course she came to me and it's like and this has been like months now it's it's it's it's happy you know she measures it at home she takes she does the logs I mean so I'm very happy about that you know the fact that she's been able to do that but again it's just it's shows that there are they definitely are the lifestyle factors I know you that word but you know exercise being one of the main ones but there are people also that in addition to being very physically active like they still get high blood pressure you know yeah and there and and you know I don't think we have the outcome data to look at the direct impact of cocoa flavonoids or all the sweet of b vitamins that are necessary to to lower homocysteine and they're rampact on blood pressure but here's what we do know and again this is mechanistic and it's very strong mechanistic but that doesn't necessarily quite to outcomes but we know that as homocysteine is elevated it impairs the clearance of something called asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine I don't know if you've talked about ad ma and sdma and ad ma and sdma directly and indirectly inhibit so we know that homocysteine is associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease and I think that this mechanism of homocysteine impairing the clearance of ad ma and sdma is the is the mechanistic link because when you directly inhibit nitric oxide synthase in the endithelium you are preventing the creation of nitric oxide and of course that's what cocoa flavonoids actually do the opposite of that so I think the one-two punch of lowering homocysteine and raising nitric oxide synthase activity via cocoa flavonoids could certainly explain a reduction in blood pressure that's really interesting I was giving her the cocoa flavonoids because I had seen the studies on increased blood flow and I'm like okay this let's we need that you know let me that measuring blood pressure yeah so this was established really clearly through the sprint tile and and this has basically been now kind of the gold standard for how we use an automated cuff so that trial was done by having individuals sit for five minutes check a blood pressure no stimulation during that time so not talking not looking at a phone not doing anything and then repeat that two more times so it's a 15 I'm not suggesting this is what Dan does or what anybody does but just so you understand at the level of how the trials are done you're sitting for 15 minutes having a check at five ten and 15 minutes you're sitting like this the cuff is two inches above the elbow and the cuff is right at the level of the right at atrium so you know you're and by the way if anybody wants to do this experiment at home it's really interesting to do put a put an automated cuff on your arm and put your arm here put your arm above your head and put your arm in the right spot and look at how big a difference you get so measurement errors are a huge problem being overstimulated is a huge problem so you really want to make sure you're getting an accurate reading of that blood pressure and we have our patience do that twice a day you know an early in the day and a late in the day check and then you know we just have everybody do that for two weeks to start and that's that's what's considered your blood pressure so you know the idea that you're going to walk into the doctor's office and get a blood pressure is not valuable for most people so when someone says what's your blood pressure it should be what's the average of those two weeks of twice daily checks done where you take the five minute protocol and test perfectly and I think everybody listening this should know that number yeah that's great I'm gonna like what I'm gonna do it um Peter so this has been amazing I mean so much information actionable information a lot of people listening here they want medicine 3.0 they want aggressive prevention do you have some tool like some some some pointers maybe some strategies that people can work within the existing healthcare system to kind of like help them like how can they you know get some of these tests that we've talked about whether it's through Boston Heart or you know doing doing the the the grail um working with their physicians to like being able to order them you know like how can people try to get as close as they can to medicine 3.0 I mean we've I hate to sound like a shameless plug we've created something to help do this because you know I've talked here about our practice our practice is super small it's it's it's it's just never there's no desire to scale this practice and we will never be able to meet the demand of the you know the people that want to come in and the amount of room that we can make because um it's just not the model doesn't make sense right it's it's two labor intensive the way we're doing it but the good news is like I really don't think you need to be my patient to get the benefits of what we do I really think you can get most of these benefits if first and foremost you are a really thoughtful consumer of your own healthcare information so to that end we've we've created this product called early um it is um I mean it's going to be fully released next year but it's having a limited release this year so we released it for four days in the spring just to our subscribers um the the the the reception to that has been very positive it's going to be released again once more this year just to people on a waitlist so anybody who goes to I'm ashamed to say I don't know the website I think it's early dot com but maybe it's early medical dot com yeah I don't know yeah yeah yeah yeah something like that and there's a waitlist and those who sign up on the waitlist will be offered the next uh window it'll be a very short window in the fall and basically that program does everything right it walks you through everything how to operationalize everything that I've written about in the book or that we're talking about here today it also allows you to directly go to any lab you want and we've and we have no affiliation with any of these people so we don't want to make any money on how these labs are done but you can you can run our panel at Boston heart and get all these results and then we sort of you know give you our dashboard on how to walk through these we give you the these are the ranges and what I hope to be able to do because so far a lot of people who are buying this product from us are physicians what I really hope will eventually happen is we'll have a critical enough mass of both people who are buying this who want this kind of medicine and physicians who are buying this who want to practice this kind of medicine that there could be sort of a match made here and you know the good news is I think a lot of physicians really want to practice this way and the challenge of practicing this way is you just have to get reeducated and that takes a little bit of time and that's why we've put this together right we we sort of take into and a half years to build this program this curriculum and it's an investment I make no you know it's probably 30 hours of video plus tons of download and both material that are you know lead you through a bunch of exercises you have to do like how to take a correct family history like what to really look for in your family history um stuff like we're talking about the blood pressure stuff how to check the labs and all those things so you know I think that that's I think that's the way to maybe not at the societal level you know I don't have the policy solution for how to fix medicine but I think at the individual 11 at the individual level just sort of taking control over it and saying okay I'm done with medicine 2.0 it's time to go to medicine 3.0 and medicine 3.0 is really about highly preventive super early personalized care there are a couple of personal questions that I'm gonna ask you at just the very end of this that I know people are also very interested in one being your ideal your ideal diet and exercise routine and other factors that you're doing um for longevity or maybe for the day or for the week whatever whichever way you kind of bunch and like what's ideal for you for you to you know improve your longevity I know that's a very general way with respect to nutrition and exercise um nutrition exercise and anything else sleep like you know song whatever whatever's your ideal like program normal sweet yeah well I will say this I I'm sure that everything about to say is gonna make me sound really rigid and people are going to be like that guys a psycho so I'm always a little hesitant when in talking about what I do well they want it people want to know what you do okay so um look probably compared to most people I am considered quite regimented um I'm way less regimented than I used to be but nevertheless here here's sort of how I think about things so let's start with sleep um I really take my sleep seriously and I'm you know someone who believe who functions best with a consistent bed time and wake up time so I am in bed usually for eight hours a night and that's typically 10 to six and that usually results in probably seven and a half hours of sleep um I'm gonna just rattle off the names of things I use because I don't have any affiliation anything so I use eight sleep as my mattress cover I love what these guys have done it's a fantastic cooling product and it's made an enormous difference for me I've been using it for the last three years most of our patients are using it there are other products out there and I've tried them and they're good this one I just happen to fancy the most great um I'm also very particular about what I'm doing before bed and what I'm not doing before bed so I really and I'm not perfect with this I'm not perfect with any of these things Rhonda but I really go out of my way to not look at anything that's gonna activate me so I try not to look at email for a couple hours before bed in fact I have two separate phones I have like my regular phone that has email and social media and junk on it and then I have what I call my bat phone that literally has nothing it's just it has like the remote to the TV you know and it has like a phone and email but like I sort of phone and text but only like two people know the number my wife and my daughter and that's about it and the camera so it's basically an excuse to have a camera and a phone if I'm going someplace and I don't want my phone with me so that's kind of the phone that's with me if I'm watching TV downstairs or something like that but it I can't even be tempted to look at social media or look at email so it's it's all in the spirit of like turning the system down before bed um even little things like I'll brush and floss my teeth before I go in the sauna because I saw them before bed as well so that once I'm done with that sauna and shower like I'm just going straight into bed um so for me that's also a very productive sleep trick there's certain supplements that I use to sleep as well so I'm a fan of glycine Ashwaganda magnesium L3 and 8 and and just straight mag oxide as well I don't use melatonin or phosphatital serenin less I'm jet lagging if I'm hot times on hopping I'll use those as well so that's sleep um on the nutrition side I don't follow any particular diet I guess you could say I eat what's what's called what we call the balanced diet so I'm an omnivore who will probably always struggle with food in the sense that like if left to my own devices I would eat everything and too much of it so I do need to be mindful about what I eat so what do I pay attention to so I just generally pay attention to not eating junk that's that's like the most important credo of my diet I would say and I say this as someone who's done everything right like I've been vegan I've been keto I've been like the most you know you know hardcore fasting intermittent fasting time restricted eating I've done there's no diet I don't think I've done for long periods of time and I have found benefit in one form another from various different aspects of these things but you know right now I'm mostly optimize around energy balance which you know stay in energy balance um and protein intake and so most of my conscious effort around my diet goes into making sure I'm getting 40 to 50 grams of protein four times a day and a lot of times at least two of those are in meals that are just like just just venison or just you know eggs or something where it's just a protein and you know there's not a lot of other stuff in it um I do make sure I stop eating at least three hours before bed it really makes a difference going back to sleep that I go to bed a little hungry um if I ever go to bed with my belly too too full it feels nice but I don't sleep as well so I really try to air on the side of going to bed a little hungry and that's you know I'm really lucky because we have young kids so we eat early so we're eating at six so I'm going to bed typically with four hours between when I last eight and when I um when I go to sleep we can talk about alcohol I um I'm in the camp that believes there is absolutely no benefit to alcohol at any dose from a purely you know biochemical standpoint um however I acknowledge that there are probably some pro social benefits to it and I happen to really really like alcohol so I probably have well I don't know it depends I mean anywhere from zero to seven or eight drinks in a week probably I don't think there's a time that I can recall in the last five six years where I've had more than two drinks in a day and I also try to do my drinking early now but that I don't mean two in the afternoon but I mean with dinner so that again alcohol is completely functionally the alcohol doesn't factor into my sleep and I know this because I track all these things and I know exactly how alcohol negatively impacts sleep in me and I know that as long as I have that drinking done by six or seven it doesn't show up anywhere on any metric that I'm tracking with respect to sleep okay exercise most important thing from a physiologic standpoint for me I exercise every day and it's in a you know it's much of what I do revolves around it's even here being in San Diego this week I mean it's like I remember ship at a great gym every time I'm here and I just know that I'm going to get up first thing in the morning and I'm going to go and I'm going to do my workouts and they're going to be completely you know they're not going to be the exact same workouts I'd be doing at home but I'm still generally doing you know four hours of zone two a week with one sort of higher intensity work out that's geared towards VO two max a week and then four strength training sessions a week so that's kind of the foundational pillar of everything I do and then there's other things that get layered on top of that like rucking and recreational activities that are also physical as well so and then the the last thing I guess I would say on that which we didn't talk about but it's an equally important part of this is you know mental health so everything that we've talked about factors into so so the right sleep the right nutrition exercise all of that factors into creating you know what I kind of describe as a wider buffer zone around distressed tolerance and then you know therapy which I do at least one session a week sometimes to plus journaling and you know doing something called dialectical behavioral therapy these things have been you know enormously important and increasing kind of the quality of my life in the past five years that's amazing I mean thank you so much Peter so if people want to I mean people definitely are going to want to hear more from you you've got a podcast that drive I mentioned it's everywhere it's on YouTube Spotify iTunes you've got a book that is a must read I read it it took me about seven hours I did a flat I mean it was but there were parts where I was like I know what Peter has his thoughts on this and I was too exing it you know whatever you want to call it but yeah I was like oh you audio read it you mean no no I read it read it yeah I read it in seven hours I did but like I said there are fast reader well I I think the the the more important factor was I'm very familiar with your your thoughts and lots of things there were things where I was like I know I know when I'm just skimming this part and then there were things that were a little bit more so um phenomenal book I mean lots of import lots of things we talked about today but even more and lots of applications there so it's called Outlive I went to a spa the other day and I saw it right there and I was like awesome that you've got a website I mean Peter Tia.com yeah I think Peter Tia M.D.com is the website that's where you people can sign up for our newsletter which comes out every Sunday and then I think early medical that comes as a separate website where where that other thing exists so question for you when are you going to write a book is this ever is this ever something you thought about? I thought about it I'm not sure that I want to go that I mean I can't imagine the work like because your book was I mean it was it's impressive you know and to write a book in the scientific world like that that people are excited about can understand I mean it's it's really challenging so yeah I mean I guess all of those things are true and yet I think as I stand here on this side of it I can say I think there are benefits to it not I don't want to talk you into doing something that's really hard because it is but you know like Andrew Kuberman is working on a book and you know it's it's hard he knows it and but books do communicate in a way that podcasts don't and they reach different audiences too so there was a part of me throughout the process that was kind of like because I started the book two years before I started podcasting and then as I'm into the book and podcasting there was a lot of time when I thought why am I doing this like this is such a waste of time like this is taking so much time and I could cover all of this material in ten podcasts like the book could be summarized into ten really well thought out podcasts but now that it's all said and then I realize a couple things one writing sharpens you're thinking so much and I'm not saying that you're thinking is in sharper that my thinking wasn't sharp but there's just no two ways about it like as I said here talking I'm sort of blabbering but like when you have to write it down you really have to get clear on what you're saying and and as I said there's you know there's probably somebody out there more than somebody there's probably a lot of people out there who would who would get to know who you are and what your message is going to be that wouldn't figure it out from a podcast so you know maybe there's a bunch of listeners who are saying yeah Peter, Teller, Teller, Teller, but I think there'd be a lot of people who would love it if you wrote a book if you decided to make that commitment. It's good to hear that for me for sure especially being on the other side of it you know because you often wonder it was worth it you know like Peter there are other things that we didn't get to discuss believe it or not so let's please do this again my podcast or podcast I want to do both because you know there's just so much to dive into and we have so much overlap in our interests that it's always a pleasure to talk with you and so thank you again really really this conversation. Well thank you for having me and thank you for for pouring through the book and coming up with so many awesome topics to to get through and it's funny that we barely got through half of them. As a companion to today's episode I've created a free evidence-based blueprint that you can download. In this guide which you can find at bdneffprotacles.com you will find protocols designed to improve cognitive function and delay brain aging. This guide explores modifiable lifestyle factors the tactics strategies and things you can do particularly when it comes to exercise nutrition and even supplementation to improve cognition and enhanced neuroprotection many of which are at least partially mediated through increases in brain-dRIVE neuro-trophic factor levels. In this guide you will also find a section entitled Ronda's protocols. These protocols are either practices I actively engage in or strategies I'm currently exploring curated specifically for their promising potential for beneficial cognitive and neuroprotective impact. These protocols are detailed and specific everything you look for in a blueprint. So if you're looking to dive deeper into these insights and start implying them head over to bdnfprotacles.com to get your free guide. It's a valuable tool for anyone committed to optimizing their brain health and longevity. Once again that's bdnfprotacles.com

People in the low cardiovascular respiratory fitness group had a mortality risk that was either comparable or worse than smoking, having textured A-B-Ds, having cardiovascular disease. Right, all these things that we know are terrible. Well, guess what? Being sedentary, being physically inactive is a disease. Smokers with a high omega-3 index have the same life expectancy as non-smokers with a low omega-3 index. So, in other words, not getting enough omega-3 was like smoking for life expectancy. It reduced their brain aging in the way such that it was like two years reduced brain aging. That is huge from centrum silver, taking out just putting one pill in your mouth every day. Right. So, today we're going to talk about some of my favorites. I would say it's the things that I think can have a very robust effect with little effort. And then we're going to talk about some of the things that require more effort to really improve the way we age our quality of life and our life expectancy. So, just to kind of give you a heads up on what's coming up. We're going to talk about vitamin D, omega-3, and a simple multivitamin. I think these are what I call the low-hanging fruits in terms of just easy things that we can do to dramatically have an outsized effect on our health. I'm going to talk a little bit about increasing phytonutrient intake and specifically we're going to focus on so farfaint and why I think that's very important for chemo-prevention and detoxification. And we're going to get into exercise and specifically talk about vigorous intensity exercise and why vigorous intensity exercise is important for cardiovascular health, reversing heart aging and for the brain. So, let's just get in it and talk about like the first part of the talk which is really optimizing the micro nutrient intake and like I said, we're going to talk about vitamin D and omega-3 phyti acids and we're actually going to talk about a multivitamin instead of a magnesium today. And I know a lot of you here are practitioners and are pretty familiar with why vitamin D is so important. But for those of you that don't realize vitamin D is so much more than a vitamin, it's actually converted into a steroid hormone. That means that it goes into the nucleus of our cells and interacts with our DNA and it activates genes that are important and it deactivates genes that are important for in terms of the timing of this activation and deactivation. We know that vitamin D controls about 5% of the protein encoding human genome that's over a thousand genes. And it's very important to talk about this because of the widespread vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency. In fact, about 30% of the population is considered deficient. So that would be if you have your vitamin D levels measured in the form of 25-hydroxy vitamin D which is the major circular form of vitamin D. About 30% of the population has levels of 20 nanograms per milliliter or below. That's deficient. And then the other 40% has levels which is considered insufficient. So that would be 30 nanograms per milliliter or below. And so that's a huge part of the population that is just walking around vitamin D deficient doesn't really know they are and there's a simple solution. And that's why I like to talk about that solution is actually taking a vitamin D supplement. In fact, 4,000 I use a day really can correct a lot of vitamin D deficiency, not all but a lot. Why vitamin D deficiency is so prevalent? Many of you may already know this. We make vitamin D 3 in our skin upon UVB radiation. So that means that anything that blocks out the ability of UVB radiation to produce or to actually hit our skin is going to blunt vitamin D production. So that means sunscreen. It means melanin. That's the dark pigmentation that protects us from the burning rays of the sun. It also means depending on where we live in the time of year. So more northern latitudes, it's certain times of the year UVB rays are not even reaching the atmosphere. So if you're in a more northern latitude, then you know five months out of the year you're not even getting that UVB radiation. And then there's also age as you get older, you're less able to make as much vitamin D 3 from UVB radiation. And so that's a factor. And then also body fat is another factor. So as body fat goes up, vitamin D, which is a fat soluble vitamin, bioavailability goes down. In fact, there have been studies that have shown that about 50% of the vitamin D, bioavailability is reduced in people that are overweight in obese. So you're just not able to release vitamin D into the bloodstream to be converted into the active steroid hormone where it's going to change and regulate genes if you're overweight or obese. And I like to start about, I like to start talking about vitamin D in its role in aging by showing you this slide, which is a slide with rodents and clearly people are not rodents. And there's a lot of differences between us. But I think it's an important place to start because it really is visually highlights how of an important role vitamin D plays in the way we age. So the two mice on the top, their four months of age, the mouse that's on the left side here is a vitamin D receptor knockout animal. That means that it's vitamin D receptors knocked out. And so the action of vitamin D, you know, the hormonal function of vitamin D is not functioning. The mouse on the right is just a normal wild type, Mac mouse. And then if you look at the bottom panel, those are the same mice four months later, so they're about eight and a half months of age. The vitamin D receptor knockout mouse is a progeria type of aging model, so it's accelerated aging. Its organs are aging faster. Its skin is aging faster. The hair is falling out, bones are brittle. So like pretty much every organ system is aging at a more rapid rate. And it's not a surprise because vitamin D is affecting, like I said, over a thousand genes, you know genes that are obviously involved in bone homeostasis, but also immune function, brain function, just a lot of different processes that are important for regulating the aging process. And we know in humans, if we look at what's called medilean randomization. So there are many, many studies that have measured vitamin D levels in people and correlated that with a higher all-cause mortality. However, there's always the argument of, well, you're just looking at, you know, people that are sick and not going outside and exercising is much. And so therefore, they're vitamin D levels are low and vitamin D is just barb biomarking, you know, disease. And so that's where Mendelian randomization comes in, where we can actually use genetics to look at a specific environmental factor and how it affects an outcome. So in this case, we have genes that convert vitamin D 3 into the active steroid hormone. And so we can look at people. There are people that actually have single nucleotide polymorphisms in those genes, where they're not working as effectively. And therefore, people are actually they have lower levels of either the stable circulating form of vitamin D, which is 25-hydroxy vitamin D, or the active steroid hormone, which is 125-hydroxy vitamin D. And we know that people with those genes, they're genetically low levels of vitamin D, they have a higher all-cause mortality than people that don't have those genes. They also have a higher respiratory related mortality, and they have a higher cancer-related mortality. And so that data really, I think, strengthens a lot of the observational data that shows the same thing, of course, that you can never prove causation, and this is more of a way to look at actual causation because we're looking at these genes that are randomly, you know, distributed among the population, and those people with the low vitamin D have a higher all-cause mortality. There have also been a variety of studies. This is just one that I'm showing you here that have come out over the years showing that people that are deficient in vitamin D, they have low levels of vitamin D, they have accelerated epigenetic aging. So if you look at the DNA and you look at these methylation groups that are kind of sitting on top of DNA, there's a pattern of these methylation groups as we age. And, you know, Dr. Steve Horvath developed the first epigenetic clock that was really able to categorize this aging, but there's been subsequent clocks developed since that clock with also, you know, Dr. Steve Horvath and others looking at actually your biological age. And so you can look at your biological age, and it kind of gives you an idea of how well your body's aging. I would say it's one of the factors. It's not my favorite, but it's one. So people with vitamin D deficiency have accelerated epigenetic aging if they take vitamin D in this, in this case, these people were African-American and their obese, they're too compounding effects in terms of causing their vitamin D deficiency. They were severely deficient. And they were given 4,000 IU's of vitamin D per day for about a month. And that reversed their epigenetic age by almost two years. So essentially avoiding vitamin D deficiency is very important. And even if you are vitamin D deficient, you can get back to a sufficient level by supplementing and that may improve your biological age. At least in terms of what was the damage that was caused by the vitamin D deficiency. We also know that vitamin D deficiency has a pretty profound effect on the brain. We know that vitamin D activates cloth. This is one of the genes that activates. Cloth is very important for brain function, cognitive function. It's associated with longevity, and it's also associated with protecting against Alzheimer's disease. There have been a variety of studies done looking at vitamin D deficiency and dementia. Same problem as before, correlation does an equal causation. There's been studies linking about vitamin D deficiency with an 80% increased risk of dementia. If we turn to the Mendelian randomization studies, again, just looking at genetically low vitamin D, we do see that there's about a 50% increased dementia risk. So clearly there's something going on here with vitamin D deficiencies, deficiency increasing dementia risk. And then on the flip side of that, there have also been studies that have shown people that supplement with vitamin D are about 40% less likely to get dementia. So it decreases dementia risk by 40%. And that's what you want to see. You want to see that these studies are kind of all pointing in the right direction. Whether we're talking about deficiency increasing the risk or supplementation, decreasing the risk or the genetic component where it's like genes that are causing deficiency are also doing the same thing as people that are getting their blood levels measured. And so I think that the link between vitamin D different and dementia is pretty solid, especially when we look at some of the structural changes that happen with vitamin D deficiencies. So there have been studies looking at the white and matter part of the brain and the damage that's done to this white matter. Remember the white matter your brain's very important for the communication between the brain regions and vitamin D deficiencies causes this what's called white matter hyperintensity. So it's this type of damage and white matter that shows up as like a white spot on an FMRI. And it's an adose dependent manner. So actually if you increase your vitamin D levels in a dose dependent manner for every 10 animals per liter, I know I switched units, but this was like a UK study where their units are for every 10 animals per liter increase in vitamin D levels. There was a decrease in the damage to the to the white matter part of the brain. So this is also I think another important part of the story here where your vitamin D deficiency is affecting the brain. It's you know playing a role in brain aging, it's increasing dementia risk. And there's also evidence from randomized controlled trials that supplementing with vitamin D can actually improve cognitive function. There are two trials that I have here that I want to talk about. One was actually with Alzheimer's patients, so people that had Alzheimer's disease and they were actually only given a pretty low dose of vitamin D. They were given about 800 I use of vitamin D per day for one year. And that improved their cognitive performance. So memory cognition and it also reduced biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease including the amoloid beta, they looked at their amoloid beta pathology as well. There was another study that was done in people with mild cognitive decline. Again those individuals were given 800 I use a day for about a year and that also and these are both placebo controlled studies. And the vitamin D also improved cognitive function in those individuals with mild cognitive decline. And this is just again a lower dose of vitamin D. So I think that if you can get someone up to a more sufficient level, it's not necessarily that vitamin D is a nitropic or is going to improve your brain function. You want to correct deficiency. And I think that's the key here. There's a lot of mechanisms by which vitamin D affects the brain. So it plays a role in immune modulation, the immune response. We could go on and on about that. It plays a role in neuroplasticity and also amoloid beta clearance among other things. I mentioned it's over a thousand genes. It's regulating many of those genes are in the brain. And there's really a simple solution here and that is you have to get a blood test. And this is key even if you're just taking a supplement like you're taking let's say you're taking 4,000 I use a day. You have to get a blood test because there are single nucleotide polymorphisms, there are variations in genes that affect people's ability to metabolize vitamin D3 and you have it convert into this steroid hormone. And so some people actually require a much higher dose and you'll never know that if you're supplementing with vitamin D and you don't get a blood test. So blood test is the most important. And then the next thing that's pretty obvious would be supplementing to make sure you get to a sufficient level which would be 30 nanograms per mill or more. I think the sweet spot that I've seen really is about 30, if you're applying it safe, I like 40 nanograms per mill later to about 60 or 70, even can go up to 80. You don't want to go too high, but I mean that's a kind of a good sweet spot if you're getting between 40 to 80 nanograms per mill later. Okay, so let's switch topics. I want to talk about omega 3 and this is a topic that's very, it's very important to me and I'm really obsessed with it. Like the person that introduced me mentioned that I am a associate scientist at the fatty acid research institute that was established by Dr. Bill Harris and I'm involved with research, particularly looking at how omega 3 fatty acid affect the brain. But I think it's really, really important to talk about because most people are not eating seafood or fish. I mean it's like 90% of the global population does not eat enough omega 3 fatty acids or not getting enough omega 3 fatty acids from seafood. This is a Harvard study that was published a few years back that identified the top six preventable causes of death. So in other words, things that are pretty preventable that will have a dramatic effect on your life expectancy. And there were things like avoiding hypertension, avoiding type 2 diabetes in cardiovascular disease, not smoking, right? Low omega 3 intake from seafood was on that top six list, along with the things I just mentioned. There are three omega 3 fatty acids. The ones that are found in seafood are EPA and DHA. Those are the ones found in the marine sources. ALA is the plant source of omega 3. That was not part of the equation here in terms of the one of the top six preventable causes of death. And like I said, most people are not eating enough seafood or not supplementing with omega 3, you can measure your omega 3 levels. The way to do that would be in omega 3 index test. You want to measure your omega 3 levels in red blood cells. That's because red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over. So they're more of a long term marker of omega 3 versus just your plasma phospholipid. So omega 3 index tests is a really good way to measure omega 3 levels. It was pioneered by Bill Harris and one of his colleagues many years ago and I think it was back in 2004 about 20 years ago. And they identified what's called the omega 3 index, high omega 3 index and a low omega 3 index. The high omega 3 index is like 8% or more and the low omega 3 index is 4% or lower. And what they've one of their first publications, what they found was that people with a high omega 3 index of 8% or more had a 90% lower risk of sudden cardiac death. Like 90% lower risk. I mean, like if you're having a heart attack, which happens like every 30 seconds in the United States, you're 90% less likely to die from that heart attack. If you had a high omega 3 index and you're also less likely to actually experience the heart attack. Since then, Bill and his colleagues have published many different studies looking at different cohorts, whether it's the framing ham cohort or UK biobank data, lots and lots of big cohort data out there. And I think the the message is clear. So people with a high omega 3 index have about a five year increased life expectancy compared to people with a low omega 3 index. And this is after correcting for all these confounding variables. We know that actually if you think about the average seafood intake in the US versus Japan, we know it's much higher in Japan. So in Japan, there will make it three indexes about 10 very high. In the US, our average omega 3 index is about five five percent. So we're on that like low low end. And Japan, they have about a five year increased life expectancy than people in the US, both the male and female side. Within this framing ham data, what was so interesting to me, was that Bill and his colleagues had plotted, they looked at the omega 3 index. And then they looked at smokers versus non-smokers. And this is where it to me is so clear because we know that smoking, one of the worst things you can do for your cardiovascular health and your heart is to smoke. Most people think about lung cancer, forget lung cancer. That increase happens in a linear fashion, right? Your lung cancer risk goes up like decades later. Cardiovascular disease happens like pretty quick. Smoking is really bad for your heart. And we know that omega 3 is actually really good for your heart. And so if we look at the data here and I like people to kind of look at the slide, the green curve is the life expectancy curve, the green one. Those are non-smokers with a high omega 3 index. If you look at the red curve, people with the lowest life expectancy, those were smokers with a low omega 3 index, right? Big surprise. But what the biggest surprise to me was that if you look at the orange and blue, they're pretty much perfectly overlaid. I can't imagine anything being more overlaid and more perfectly matching. Smokers with a high omega 3 index had the same life expectancy as non-smokers with a low omega 3 index. So in other words, not getting enough omega 3 was like smoking for life expectancy. And that is just something that I think people should think about. I mean, obviously like smokers are like jumping up and down because they're like, I can take a fish oil supplement and have the same, you know, be healthy. But really, I think what we should be thinking about is that we're not eating enough seafood or supplementing with a high quality fish oil supplement to get our omega 3 index so that 8% range. And we'll talk about what it takes to get there. But I think even stronger data, we can turn to some of the large randomized controlled trials looking at supplementing with omega 3 fatty acids, whether it's the vesipa, which is the purified EPA form and the reduced it trial where people were given. I mean, we're tracking large, large populations of people were given. Four grams a day for was it two, five years. And their cardiovascular disease risk and the risk of having a cardiovascular event, whether that was a heart attack or stroke, that was reduced by 25% compared to placebo. And then there was the strength study that was actually stopped early because there was no benefit and the form that they were given these individuals was a free fatty acid form so it wasn't a terrifying to anything which can be very irritating on the gut. And then there was the vital study. And the study people were given a kind of a low dose in my opinion. They were given about 840 milligrams of levaza that's DHA and EPA combined. And this was also a five-year study. And the secondary outcomes, when they look at the secondary outcomes, the there was a reduced heart attack risk by almost 30% total coronary heart disease was reduced by 17% and particularly people, this was happening in people that were having a low fish intake. So we have, I think, a lot of evidence that omega 3 is very important for cardiovascular health. And it doesn't take a lot of omega 3. In fact, it only takes about 2, 1.5 to 2 grams of official supplement per day to get someone from a low omega 3 index to a high omega 3 index. It's very achievable. Okay, and the last, you know, like two slides, I want to just talk about a micro nutrient in the form of a multivitamin because I think it's such a low hanging through and, you know, I remember 10 years ago studies being published saying multivitamin are useless, they're expensive urine, it's not doing anything, it might even be harmful. It turns out that was, you know, completely wrong. We know that micronutrient deficiencies are very common in the U.S. from a lot of these large national surveys that have been done called Enhane Studies. So you can see here, we talked about vitamin D, that's not from the diet that's from sun exposure. The vitamin E, 60% of the U.S. population's not getting enough vitamin E, I mean, 45% of the population's not getting enough magnesium, calcium is 35%, vitamin A, 35%, I mean, it just goes on and on. Omega 3, I mentioned 80 to 90%. So people are not getting enough of these essential micronutrients from their foods. I mean, these things are running our metabolism, their co-factor for enzymes. They're doing a lot of important things, regulating inflammation, changing gene expression, and we don't think about them. We're so focused on macronutrients. That we forget about the micronutrients and how important they are for the way we're going to regulate the way we age. And so when I talk about the Cosmos studies, there are three trials that were done where older adults were given a daily multivitamin. And this was a very standard one run of the mill multivitamin. You may have heard a centrum silver. I mean, it's like you can buy it in any CVS, Walmart, right? It's not like a bougie type of multivitamin. They were given centrum silver for two years or a placebo. And it improved their cognitive function globally. So in fact, global cognitive function was improved by like two years. So it reduced their brain aging in the way such that it was like two years reduced brain aging. That is huge from centrum silver, taking it just putting one pill in your mouth every day, right? The what was so profound was the actually the effect on episodic memory. So that's the kind of memory, you know, where we remember events, people, things like that. That was improved. It was like reducing the aging of our episodic memory by almost five years, is 4.8 years, which is just astronomical from just taking a, you know, centrum silver every day. That's what I'm talking about. Like these micronutrients have effects on the way we're aging on our brain, on our cognitive function. I mean, name a person in here that doesn't want to get their parents taking a multivitamin every day, right? It's so easy. It's something they're going to do. They don't have to put a lot of effort in. And there's outsize effects, right? So I think that's kind of the the wrap up for my micronutrient part of this talk is that one you want to avoid vitamin D deficiency by getting a blood test. We know that about 4,000 I use a day in most people, 4,000 to 5,000 I use a day can get people to a sufficient level. There are outlier cases that have to take much more and you won't know that unless you get the blood test with the omega 3 index. I mean, I think it's pretty clear. You don't want to be smoking, right? I mean, your life expectancy, you don't want to be like a smoker that's taking a bunch of omega 3. It's it's so important for so many different processes. And I could spend like two hours talking about that, but I'm convinced that the data is clear. And when we're talking about going from a low omega 3 index to a high omega 3 index, we're not talking about a lot. 1.5 to 2 grams of high quality for soil supplement is easy to do. And then lastly, the multivitamin for brain aging, right? Easy. Super easy to do. Okay, so I want to get into this, oh my goodness, I've really gone over. I'm going to I'm going to blast through this part. So for a faint, really, it's something that is found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli. It's actually not in the vegetable itself. The precursor to it's in it, glucoraphone. When the vegetable is crushed or like broken, it's converted, the glucoraphone is converted into sulfur or faint. So for a faint is the biggest dietary activator of our NRF2 system. NRF2 is activating hundreds of genes. Many of them are involved in chemo prevention, preventing cancer. They're involved in detoxification. So it activates our phase to detoxification enzymes that we can detoxify, environmental toxins that we're exposed to on a daily basis. It deactivates phase one bio-transformation enzymes. These are enzymes that will convert a pro-carcinogen into a carcinogen. We actually are eating lots of these things all the time. We don't even know the pro-carcinogens. And it also activates anti-oxidin and anti-inflammatory systems. It's very, very powerful pathway. And sulfurophane is one of the major dietary activators of it. This is just a mechanism by which it's activating it, which I don't think we need to go into. There have been human studies showing that sulfurophane does reduce DNA damage in people. So people that ate 85 grams of watercress, that's a type of cruciferous vegetable per day for eight weeks, lowered their oxidative DNA damage by like 24 percent. Broccoli, 250 grams a day, people that ate broccoli for 250 grams of broccoli a day, lowered their oxidized DNA lesions by 41 percent, Brussels sprouts, 300 grams a day, this lowered another marker of oxidative damage by almost 30 percent. So again, it's really, DNA damage is the precursor to mutations I can lead to cancer oncogenic mutations. So you want to lower that DNA damage because that's something that accumulates over time and eventually, you know, in your fifth, sixth, seventh, thickative life, you get cancer. So it's really good if you can lower your oxidative DNA damage. There have also been studies looking at people given a sulfurophane extract and reducing the, basically, the etoxic burden. So there have been a couple of studies on most of them are out of China where their air pollution is very, very bad. And so benzene is a component that's found in air pollution. It's also in cigarettes, milk, wildfire smoke. It's a carcinogen. And so in these studies, individuals were given benzene. They were given about 40 micromoles per day and it increased the excretion of benzene through their urine by about 60 percent within 24 hours. So it didn't take a long time to start to work. I was just in China, I got back five days ago. I mean, I was taking myself for a few months, it was here the whole time. And there's multiple studies showing this. It increases the excretion of benzene and acrolyne. That's another carcinogen. Acrolyne is something that works, those are when we cook foods. So sulfurophane is really important for increasing the excretion of these toxic compounds. And then there have been studies looking at prostate cancer recurrence. So men with low-grade prostate cancer that were supplementary with about 16 milligrams of sulfurophane a day, slowed the doubling of their PSA antigen, which is with the major biomarker that's used to sort of monitor prostate cancer progression. It was slowed by about 86 percent. And then there's some studies on UV, topically putting sulfurophane on skin and also lowering the inflammation and that sort of effect as well. There's a lot of preclinical evidence out there on sulfurophane protecting against cancer, whether it's prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer. I mean, it just going to literature preclinical data's endless. Very clear, you can't argue that sulfurophane, basically, is lowering metastasis. It's lowering tumor burdens. So if you give mice, for example, breast cancer stem cells, it can decrease their tumor growth by more than 50 percent. So there's just countless studies out there showing this. So I think that the take-home here is that eating cruciferous vegetables and adding them to your diet is important. Broccoli sprouts are the best source of sulfurophane. They're the young plant. In fact, there's about 100 times more of the precursor of sulfurophane glucoraphone in broccoli sprouts compared to mature broccoli. So broccoli sprouts are a great source of sulfurophane, about 45 to 100 grams a day gets you about some of the doses that I talked about in these studies. If you're going to cook your broccoli, the enzyme that converts glucoraphone into sulfurophane is heat sensitive. And so you do do get a little bit less bang for your buck than eating like for example, raw broccoli. However, if you add mustard seed powder to your broccoli or to your brussel sprouts or to whatever fill in the blank cruciferous vegetable that you're kind of lightly cooking, it can increase that bioavailability. It basically helps it, it's adding an exogenous source of that enzyme arosinase back to the broccoli. So you're basically, by fourfold, getting more of that sulfurophane. So that's also important. And then there's supplements. You can actually find stabilized forms of sulfurophane out there as well. Okay. I want to get to my favorite part of the talk. And this is the effort full part. This is like exercise. There is absolutely nothing that I have found in all of my reading of the literature that is more powerful and poign at delaying every related aspect to aging in age-related disease than exercise. Particularly vigorous intensity exercise. And when I say vigorous intensity, I mean the kind of exercise that you're doing and you really can't have a conversation. You can't really talk to someone while you're doing it because you're so out of breath while you're doing that exercise. For people that wear heart rate monitors, we're talking about 80, 85 percent max heart rate. You're getting into that zone or more. That is vigorous intensity exercise. And I want to start by talking about cardiovascular respiratory fitness, which is something that it is a marker of, it's a marker of our, I would say life expectancy, mortality risk, dare to say longevity. We know that eventually, as we're aging, we're going on this cliff, our cardiovascular respiratory fitness is going down. And so you want to get as high up as you can. You want to have the highest cardiovascular respiratory fitness, as you can, because that cliff will come and the higher up, you start the longer it's going to take to get that cliff. And so VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen that you can take in during maximal exercise, is the way cardiovascular fitness is measured. We know that people that are have a low cardiovascular respiratory fitness. If they go anywhere above, being like the low, like let's say they go to just the low normal range, that's associated with just a two year increased life expectancy. If they go from like below, low to more of a high, then that's like a five year increased life expectancy. And there's been some researchers out there that have calculated each unit increase in your VO2 max, and your cardiovascular risk pre-fitness, is associated for each unit, which would be one milliliter per kilogram per minute. That correlates to about 45-day life extension. So for each unit you're going up, you're about you're gaining about 45 days of life expectancy. There have been a few studies now. One of them here, this is the drama one that have shown people that are in the more elite level, like the real high cardiovascular respiratory fitness. Again, they've got a five year increased life expectancy, but they also have a 80% lower mortality risk than people in the low cardiovascular respiratory fitness group. And what was interesting about this study is that even people with a high cardiovascular respiratory fitness, if you've compared them to the elite, people in the elite group, still had about a 20% lower mortality risk than people in the high. So it just keeps going up. But what was so interesting to me about that study was that people in the low cardiovascular respiratory fitness group had a mortality risk that was either comparable or worse than smoking, having type-ud-a-d-b-d's, having cardiovascular disease. All these things that we know are terrible, well guess what? Being sedentary, being physically inactive is a disease. And we need to start treating it as a disease because it is a disease. So that basically the cardiovascular fitness was predicting mortality risk like these other diseases that people know about as being terrible, right? People don't talk about cardiovascular fitness being terrible. We know, and this kind of brings it back to vigorous exercise. The question is how do you improve your cardiovascular respiratory fitness? Any exercise is really, especially aerobic training is really going to improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. However, when you get to a certain point, people that are even doing the physical activity guidelines. So let's say they're doing like two and a half hours per week of moderate intensity, you know moderate intensity physical activity. So this would be the kind of exercise that you can maybe have a conversation sort of like your breathy, but you can sort of talk, right? You're not like going all, you're not really going that that hard. You're still working, but not as hard as you would if you were doing more vigorous type of exercise. About 40% of people that are doing that, two and a half hours a week, cannot improve their cardiovascular respiratory fitness unless they engage in high intensity interval training, unless they mix in that vigorous intensity exercise. And it's not really known why that is, but at the end of the day, the challenge that you're putting on your cardiovascular system, on your lungs, your muscular system, your brain, everything that you're, you know, when you increase that challenge, like you do when you're engaging in vigorous intensity exercise, the adaptations to that are also greater. And so the adaptations being you can transport oxygen, you know, throughout your system quicker, right, to bring it to your muscles faster. And so and that's kind of the thought right now is that's what's happening is that basically it's just the stress, when the stress is stronger, the adaptation is also stronger. There's a variety of different protocols out there, high intensity interval training protocols that can improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. The longer the interval, the more robust the effect on improving cardiovascular fitness. So high intensity interval training is referring to these short bursts of like more vigorous intensity exercise followed by, you know, like a more light exercise recovery. There's so many protocols out there. And honestly, all of them do improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. If you're really wanting to like get an outsized effect, then you're going to start getting into the minutes long interval. So the Norwegian 4 by 4 is when I like to talk about because there's so many publications out there showing that it can improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. So that the Norwegian 4 by 4 was something that's practiced by these Norwegian skiing group. Essentially, they're doing four minutes interval and it's on a stationary bike. And they're going as hard as they can and maintain for that four minutes. So they're not going all that because there's no way you can do that. But they're just going as hard as they can to maintain for that four minutes. And then they have a three minute recovery where they're going super super light. They're letting their heart rate come down to recover and then they go back at it again. So that's repeated four times. It's a four by four. That is a really good way to improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. But it's not the only way. You can do a minute on and minute off. You can do 30 seconds on 20 seconds off. You can do 20 seconds on 10 like Tabadas. All these things do improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness. It's just the longer the interval, the more robust the effect. And I do want to talk about Dr. Ben Levine's study on reverse cardiac aging. So the reason I like to talk about this study is because it included the Norwegian 4 by 4 and also included a lot of vigorous intensity exercise. And essentially Ben took about 50 year olds that were sedentary. So they weren't physically active, but they didn't have any other diseases. And put them on this intense training protocol for two years. It was progressive that didn't just write out the gate start doing the Norwegian 4 by 4. They work their way up, right? When you have someone that's not active and then you're putting them on a pretty intense training protocol, you have to progressively get there. And so by the end of like the first six months people then started doing the Norwegian 4 by 4 once a week. They were doing 30 minutes of I would say, you know, getting to that 75% max heart rate zone for their more vigorous close for the vigorous intensity exercise they're doing about three times a week. In total, they were they were working out about five hours a week. And a large portion of that was vigorous intensity exercise. They also did a moderate intensity exercise in a little bit of resistance training the control group only did some kind of yoga-ish type of exercise. And after two years, their hearts were image compared to the baseline. So as we age, our hearts are aging as well. And our hearts shrink with age and they also get stiffer with age. And this affects our cardiovascular disease risk. It also affects the ability of our hearts to are being able to improve cardiovascular fitness. But it affects our cardiovascular disease risk. You don't want to stiff heart and you don't want it to keep shrinking. And so what happened after the two years of that intense exercise protocol is these 50 year olds reverse the aging of their heart by essentially 20 years. So their hearts grew and they became more flexible. And they looked structurally if you looked at them by all the imaging techniques and all the probing and stuff that's done, they looked more like a 30 year old tart. And I'm very much glossing over a lot of this data. But essentially the important thing is that it's not too late to start working now. And it will have a profound effect if you put in the time and the effort on the way you're aging. Not only the way you're heart is aging, but also the way your brain is aging. So we know exercise can immediately improve cognitive function, executive function. I mean, just a single 10 minute exercise about can do that. I'm going to blast for some of these. It happens immediately. Your brain can be rewired. I mean, I'm doing, I'm a big fan of just doing 10 minutes like before anything that you need to do if you've to learn something if you're, you know, giving a talk, whatever it is, exercise before you do it, it makes a big difference. It speeds up reaction time and proves a lot of executive function. A lot of that has to do with the fact that lactate is produced when you exercise intensely, when you work really hard, you're forcing your cells to make energy in a way that is producing lactate as a metabolic byproduct. Turns out it's not just a metabolic byproduct. In fact, lactate is a very important substrate not only to make energy. It's used. It's actually energetically more favorable to use the lactate than glucose to make energy. And lactate gets shuddled back into muscle and is used as energy. Lactate also shuddled to other parts of the body and most, I think, importantly, the brain where it acts as a signaling molecule. In other words, it's a way for your muscles to communicate with other parts of your body like your brain. And say, hey, I'm working hard here. We got to like respond to this work, right? And part of the way that it responds is by increasing brain drivener or terrific factor, BDNF. Brain drivener or terrific factor is so important for it helps grow new neurons. It is important for learning and memory and neuroplasticity. So that's the ability of your brain to adapt to changing environments. Very important. So brain drivener or terrific factor is something that I would say is a youthful elixir for your brain. And we know vigorous intensity exercise increases it through lactate. Lactate is that signaling molecule because when you're working out hard, your brain is also working hard. Your brain has to work hard when you're exercising hard. And this is an adaptation. This is the way the body is adapting to that hard exercise. Much like the improvements in cardiovascular respiratory fitness is the way your cardiovascular system adapts. It also increases neurotransmitters or the human studies that have found that they've looked at dose dependent in terms of exercise, moderate, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity exercise. And they looked at serotonin levels. And the more vigorous intensity the exercise, the higher the serotonin levels are. Serotonin levels in the plasma do correlate with brain serotonin levels. And in fact, individuals that were doing the vigorous intensity exercise had higher serotonin and they had more, they had better impulse control. So they had basically improved with called inhibitory control. We know that serotonin, most of us think of it as the neurotransmitter that's involved in the way we feel our mood. It's important for mood, but it's important for executive function, decision making, and it's really important for impulse control. You can take someone and deplete their serotonin by giving them a bunch of branch chain amino acids, which compete with triptophane, which is the precursor to make serotonin. And within like an hour to their impulse control is just shot. So it's very important for impulse control. It also increases neuropinephrine. Nourbinephrine is involved in focus intention. So lactate again is a signaling molecule that is telling the brain to increase these neurotransmitters as a response to intense exercise, essentially. A lot of particles out there for increasing beating after the Norwegian 4x4. Anything that's really going vigorous, you want to be at 8% your max heart rate, you want to go out. If you're doing that for like 30 minutes, that's a really big boost in BDNF. But there's a lot of protocols out there that can increase brain-draveneratrophic vector. Again, the lactate's the key to get the lactate, you have to go harder. You have to get the vigorous intensity exercise. And there's also this, I like to talk about this P&A study as a classic study published back in 2011, I think. And it really showed that older adults that engage in aerobic exercise, that they were doing more like 70-75% of their max heart rate, which is pretty good for someone who's 65 or older, right? They did this exercise for two years, and they not only counter the brain atrophy that happens with age, so as we age, as we get to an older adult, older adulthood, we start to lose between one to 2% of our hippocampal brain region, atrophies per year. These older adults that were engaging in the physical activity, like I said, close to vigorous intensity for that cohort. Not only did they not experience that one to 2% brain atrophy in the hippocampal regions, they experienced growth. They experienced a 2% growth in their hippocampal region. So that's effectively restoring about one to two years of previous loss of their hippocampal brain region. Again, brain-drevener atrophic factor is responsible for the growth of neurons, particularly in the hippocampal part of the brain. And they also had improvements in cognition that correlated as well with this increase in hippocampal part of the brain. And then I've got hardly any time here, in fact, I'm already over, so I'm going to just tell you guys about exercise snacks because I think it's a wonderful thing. These are short bursts of intense exercise. You're going, you're going that's 75% max heart rate. You can do anything from high knees to body weight squats, jumping jacks, whatever your favorite burpees, whatever your favorite thing is to do. They have now been enough studies out. They're showing that exercise snacks can improve longevity. They've been like three studies that I at least know that are pretty large studies where people are wearing accelerometers. Scientists can track their heart rate. And people that are doing these vigorous types of exercise snacks throughout the day, if they're doing it, which is between one to two minutes per bout. And if they do it three times a day, they have a 40% reduction in cancer related mortality. They have a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality and a 40% reduction in all cause mortality. So, and this is even in people that identify themselves as non-exerciser. So they don't go to the gym. What they're doing is they're taking advantage of like everyday situations to get their heart rate up. So they use the stairs. And they don't just walk up, but they sprint up them. Or they bite to work or go fast to work or whatever. Personally walk to work. They're doing these short bout of exercise snacks. Now, I'm talking about these more structured types of snacks versus the Villepa, which is the kind that's vigorous, intermittent lifestyle activity where these people are just doing, taking advantage of everyday situations or not necessarily stopping and doing air squats. But there's, I think every reason to do them, once increasing blood flow of the brain, to lactate gets produced immediately. And there've been studies shown that even just doing air squats throughout your work day can improve glucose regulation better than a 30-minute walk. So, for example, during like, you know, 30 air squats every 45 minutes for a eight-hour work day, was able to improve glucose regulation better than a 30-minute walk. So, we're going to get up and we're going to end with our, with our, actually snack because you all been sitting too long. And this is the best one, like most fun part. We're going to do just a minute. I mean, we could do two minutes, but I think after one minute, it'll be like, okay, we're done. Do you guys want to do high knees or air squats? Air squats? Okay. Dang, I just got back from China and I did, um, I did my barbell squats, like, two days ago and I'm so sore, but I'm going to do them. All right. Okay. Wait a minute. Let me get the wrong one here. Ready. Here we go. And try to, like, put in some effort. Okay. Try to put in the effort, right? Like fast. Now, I'm able to talk. So, it's not like super, super vigorous, but I can also measure my heart and see. I see some people doing them. Come on. Like, hurt. Are you burning? Okay. We're at 30 seconds. I know some of you hate me right now. Oh, whoops. Well, good thing we didn't do high knees. Okay. 10 seconds. Try to go three, two, one. All right. I just want to see what my heart rate. Say, my heart rate. Really? It's only 80. 145. Yeah. So exercise snacks, but don't you always feel good right now? Yes. Do them. Do them. Take a break every hour and do one minutes of air squats. If you do that, just three times, right? Three, well, it's two. The study was actually like two minutes. So you have to do that for two minutes or just do one minute, do six times a day. Right? It's huge. It's having a huge effect. And so with that, that's my conclusion. Right. Avoid micro-neged deficiencies. Increase your soul. You're so firfree, increased ifers vegetables. And at the very least gets a exercise snacks, but let's do some bigger intensity exercise, right? That's going to prove the way we age.

in order to understand how something works and also in order to develop new technologies, you need to be able to write and edit. It's like reverse engineering, electronic circuit, or some software. So I have no idea what this code does. Let's change it. In case the biology, you'll take a piece out and now it no longer handles glucose. See, so okay, that's part of the glucose monitoring system. And you can just get through that and you can get to more and more nuance changes for discovery's sake. But it's often entangled with not just discovering, but making useful synthetic biology. You'll have a challenge that you'll have out there and that will drive the reading and writing technology forward. It will drive our creativity in terms of how these things can possibly influence society and ecosystems. Hey, everyone. Today, I'm extraordinarily excited to you, bring to you Dr. George Church. It's really a special opportunity to talk to Dr. Church because he's one of those rare living historical figures whose work is so vastly influential that it can change our perspective on the potential of an entire field. In my opinion, this gives his generally optimistic take on technology and the future a very special waiting. Through his work in the Human Genome Project, in particular, he has directly contributed to exponential shifts in understanding feasibility and capability in the field of biology. The Human Genome Project began as a $3 billion moon shot shortly after Dr. Church, first pioneered a method of directing a sequencing in 1984. The goal to sequence a single reference genome for humans, completing the initial aim of that project, Dr. Church and his collaborators and colleagues ultimately set us on a path to where we find ourselves today. Sequencing is now over 10 million fold cheaper and most people can get their genome sequence inexpensively if they so desire. But where do we go from there is the question? Arguably, one of the most important geneticists of our time, Dr. Church, help initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984 and the personal genome project in 2005. His lab was one of the first that showed CRISPR Cas9 worked for precise gene editing in normal human cells and he has been behind countless other scientific innovations and disruptions, specifically in the world of precision genome sequencing. Dr. Church has described the key theme of his lab as technology development, radical transformative technologies. So let's talk about those. George, it's hard to know where to start large genome writing history, universal donor cells, multiplex editing and the ability to perform thousands of edits in his single cell, organoids. But maybe we can just start with the Human Genome Project. What is the backstory and how did we get to present day in era of writing? Thank you, Rhonda. Let's see. Let's start with the gene. I think we didn't realize that we were on an exponential when we started sequencing. I got introduced to it through RNA sequencing. There wasn't DNA sequencing. And then, while he Gilbert was my mentor, as a graduate student, and he invented his team in 1977 independently for a singer published in paper that same year, it took a little longer for the singer or method to get implemented. But what happened was very quickly, we got to a point where we were talking about doing a whole genome mainly at the Department of Energy request in 1984. They asked a harder problem, which was how he estimate mutation rates to the consequence of energy. And we felt a handful or maybe 10 of 10 scientists and what would later be called genomics. Said, well, we can't do that. But what we might be able to do is get one genome, and a reference genome. But that consolation prize was big enough that Charles Delicy at the Department of Energy just started writing checks. I mean, it didn't wait for an act of Congress or anything just had money for this kind of R&D because it helped with X. And then, took about three years. So my lab, I was transitioning from postdoc to professor and my lab got one of the first two genomic project grants. And then the NIH took about three years before the NIH got involved. But they got involved in a big way because they felt they were more appropriate vehicle for anything health related than the Department of Energy. And they did a kind of in a team work with maybe 30% DOE and 70% NIH in the United States component plus lots of international collaboration. Really starting in 1990, with a 15-year goal, there was a lot of talk of cutting corners at the beginning, and it didn't necessarily call it that. But there was a lot of people trying to do one X coverage, meaning doing every base pair exactly, reading it exactly once. And I didn't like most of these corner cutting things, but I was the most junior member of the project from the beginning didn't have a lot of sway. I also felt that we should put technology development up front because I could reduce the price and then we could do a lot more than one genome for a lot less than $3 billion. But as soon as some of the senior members of the visionary team, like Jim Watson, who came in later, started representing, getting up support in Congress, if he came evidence that we would have 3 billion and then the motivation for bringing the price down to some peer for a few years at a decade. But it did. So instead of some of the corner cutting was to not worry too much about repetitive sequences, which in the case of the fruit fly was about half the genome. You know, it doesn't matter. And at one point, they were gonna just do the coding regions, which is 1%, turns out we still haven't identified the 1% coding regions that would not have been a shortcut. So a lot of the short cuts were really ill conceived. But fortunately, we did get a decent 92% of the genome and declared victory. As a sub, I wanna make sure we've got that before we go on to writing genomes as a whole, another topic. Do we need more reference genomes and what are your expectations of finding new tools, elsewhere in the evolutionary tree? Well, so yes, we certainly need more genomes. It's not just the reference. It's the population variation of this important. We wanna, the variation is at least as important as the reference. And it helps us make sure we've got a good reference. So you can call that the reference. It's growing recognition that we can represent the reference as a diversity. We are finding tools in the genomes. So one of the new ones is it developed the first kind of recommendations for maybe the 1984, 1985, 1986 was the human genome. As if there were one and as if the Quaritan he other genomes. And I kept advocating for genome comparisons because when you compare to genomes, it's almost as good as an experiment. But it gives you a richer formulation for exploration. And we have part of that genome comparison is resulted in new tool discovery. And so it's kind of a positive feedback with you. You see those some genomes, you find some tools, use those to read and write genomes, find some more tools and so on. I don't know where that ends, but I do think that synthetic biology is probably ultimately unlimited, while the diversity on earth, even though it's vast, is limited, more limited. Almost by definition, we can explore more than currently exist, at least initially in narrow corridors where we're looking at specific tool building, ecosystem restoration and medical consequences. I think there's a rich field of, let's say you had one book and that's the only book you had. You could read it and reread it and you keep learning more and more. But as soon as you start writing books now you got millions of them. So that's how I think the synthetic biology or writing of genomes. I've read a quote, kind of reminds me of the quote that I read from you that stated, I have speculated that essentially everything that we can currently manufacture today without biology, we will be able to manufacture with biology and with potential advantages. Biology is intrinsically atomically precise and it's scalable to cover the whole plan essentially for free. That's pretty revolutionary. I mean, yeah. Maybe, yeah, I mean, that's accurate reflection of how I felt then and how I feel today. Why is it reasonable? So they are atomically precise. It doesn't, biology does not yet gracefully use the entire periodic table or all the chemical bonds that you might wanna make out of that periodic pairs of elements. But it comes pretty quickly. It uses a lot pretty close. It uses a lot of inorganic bonds that might surprise some people. So you can make there are biological systems if you look widely enough. And now we're not talking about necessarily your enzymatic tools which might have been implied in the previous, but all the things that all the chemistry and physics that biology uses, they can make fiber optics, things that are fiber optics, like in sponges, you can make semiconductor, sphero magnetic materials that help it encompass all kinds of dicroics and gradings and that generate colors, and the list goes on on the materials that are used either naturally or where the enzymatic apparatus that is used, actually, if you give it a new set of elements, it will incorporate those. You can say missing, incorporate them, but the point is, it's automatically precise and it could reproducibly make a molecule with thousands of atoms in it. And the next molecule over has exactly as as an atoms and exactly the same configuration. Off by less than an atomic bond in length. So it's really, this is not something that happens in Silicon Valley or other worldwide manufacturing of silicon-based circuits. Or any other organic circuits, it is so far unique to biology. Another thing that's unique to biology is ability to replicate, so you can make it copy of yourself. So to make it copy, the idea that a cell phone can make a copy of a cell phone is ludicrous or so far. But there might be a use of a hybrid system where we use biological inspiration, electronics inspiration, we kind of devices that can replicate, use the full periodic table. And do a few things that electronics is a little bit better at telecommunications, at certain wavelengths, very hazardous wavelengths, like X-ray and Gamma, as well as the other end of the spectrum, the radio. Let's talk about how writing the human genome may help us better understand it. So Francis Collins described the working draft of the human genome as the first glimpse of our own instruction book. But today, many scientists believe that to truly understand the instruction book, we also have to write it. Can you explain why that is? Right. I'm not sure I would say half two, but it is certainly very advantageous. I should mention that we don't even have the full instruction book of any human being yet. We have, we have the, we declared victory in 2001 on a kind of a rough draft of 92% actually. It was considered the final draft of a rough draft in 2001, it was final draft in 2004, but it was still haploid, meaning it's just one genome, while all, essentially, all of us are deployed and hereto's from Mother and Father, except for our gametes. So the, the sequence we have, the one human genome that we have is not of a gamete as of a strange haploid cell. So that's part of the, but that's not the big barrier to understanding, the big barriers, as you say, is, is, in order to understand how something works and also in order to develop new technologies, you need to be able to write and edit and alter. And, and you understand it because you'll, you'll say, it's, yeah, I have no idea, it's like reverse engineering, electronic circuit or some software. So I have no idea what this code does, let's, let's change it and then he's, oh, that, that changes the calendar, okay? So that, that code does calendar, or in case the biology, you'll, you'll take a piece out and now no longer handles, you know, glucose, see, say, okay, that's part of the glucose monitoring system. And, and you can just get through that and you can get to more and more nuance changes for discovery's sake, but it's often entangled with not just discovering but making useful synthetic biology. That, there, you'll have a, these challenge that you'll have out there and that will drive the reading and writing technology forward, it will drive our creativity in terms of how these things can possibly influence society and ecosystems. What's the goal of writing a large, or a whole genome, or an entire chromosome? So, there, there are a few ideas that, that have come up where one, where something at a genomic scale is more desirable than a single gene. So a huge fraction of, recommended the NSTMOs and synthetic biology, historically has been changing one or two genes. And you don't, it doesn't make sense to synthesize whole genome if you just want to change one or two genes, but more and more we're seeing advantages of changing. So many genes, you might as well rewrite the thing. And as the example of that, we have a project to change the genetic code to make any cell resistant to all viruses. And we just published a paper where we think we did that. And the way that it works is that the viruses, as far as we know, depend on the host genetic code, the translation, ribosomal machinery. And if you can change the code without hurting the host, that the host could be a cell, it could be an organism. So far, we've only done it in one industrial organism, you call it. But anyway, if you change that enough, the virus can't mutate. There would be too many changes that are required to get the virus to be back to its healthy state. So, and we think this is completely general, and essentially every plant, microbe, and animal on earth, shares a very similar genetic code to one another. And in any case, have a genetic code that they share with the viruses. And if you take it offline, change it enough. Like sometimes it's few as two codons, let's say two codons at code for searing, loosey and argin in our favorites once, because there's, they have so many codons for each. They're triplets of ACG and T. So, like AA, AA codes for lysine, the amino acid lysine. So, there's 64 of those, and if you change one, you get a new genetic code, you can change two, and now you get something that's multi-virus resistant. So, that's an example where you have to make so many changes, tens of thousands of change them, why they're interspersed throughout the genome, you might as well just synthesize it, and that's what was done. Another example is de-extinction. There, the number of changes you might have to make in order to bring back some physiology, like cold resistance, and all the traits that go along with cold resistance, maybe scattered and round enough that you can think of it either as highly multiplex editing, or as a complete rewrite. And even when you do a complete rewrite, you're not changing every single base pair, all three billion times two bases. You're leaving a mostly intact. You've chemically synthesized it, but it's still useful to think of it as a lot of edits. So, you know, sort of, the maximum number of edits we've done by editing, meaning having an enzyme that's targeted at a particular place is 24,000. And the maximum we've done by synthesis is almost the same amount, although we have synthetic projects which are now getting close to done at 60,000. But then we're gonna take the editing up to a million pretty soon. So, they go back and forth. This is a technical, one leapfrogging that goes on between editing and writing of genomes. This sort of moonshot goal of changing genomes or writing large genomes in a way, writing editing them, where, you know, as you mentioned, you make, let's say you take a human cell and a petro dish, make it resistant to viruses or, you know, make it capable of synthesizing essential micronutrients that we usually have to get from our diet. Like, even if it just sits in a petro dish forever, and that's all, that's the only place it goes. To me, there's something very just fundamentally, you know, all inspiring about that, is that something is that kind of like, along the lines of your thinking with doing some of those things? Yeah, I think the community, the synthetic biology community has responded very in the same kind of awe, inspiring the, the initiation of this kind of project. I hesitate to call it a moonshot because I actually think the moonshot was not as inspiring to me as the satellites, the GPS satellites, the weather satellites and, you know, surveillance of land and, so, and the same thing goes for other big projects. Genome project wasn't as impressive to me as the reducing the cost project, a thousand dollar genome project, sort of the technology development, and the Manhattan project was certainly not as attractive to me as say the projects for a nuclear fusion, which could have, all of these things, could have started much earlier on. They sound maybe a little bit harder, but they have in common is there, they're very much more consciously aimed at positive societal consequences. And I think it's a little easier to get everybody excited about these sort of things, and I think being able to make industrial microorganisms, plants and animals are important for ecosystems, and agriculture and humans stem cells. They won't stay in that future plate. They will make their way into cell therapies in humans. And if we're going to fix something that's broken, that you can fix with blood cells, you might as well have those blood cells be resistant for all viruses as well. If that is shown to be safe and effective by the FDA and some more organizations. You kind of alluded to this earlier, but how do you think the vertebrate genomes project will affect the field of genetics and biology? So the vertebrates genome project, I think is just indicative of our wish to sequence the whole biosphere. Vertibrate's in particular are helpful because they often constitute keystone species in the wild. And I hope, I think there's a reason to believe that we will be restoring more and more of the non-urban environment to wilderness, certainly you can see about a thousand successful we wilding projects, a local we wilding. So for the most famous one is probably restoring the wolves to Yellowstone after 70 years. They had a typical keystone effect. At a ripple effect was anticipated and worked out, which was they changed the abundance of large herbivores, which then changed the abundance of the willows and other trees, which changed the beavers, behavior, which changed the built lakes, which were sold to the aquaculture. So just introducing one verb at all this ripple effect. That's one reason to do it, but there are many others. And if we are causing the extinction of many species, we are also causing the hybridization, which is the creation of new species. It's not clear that we're making extinction faster or more significant than new species. I think our gut feeling is that we are, but it's not proven yet. But in any case, we need to do that survey to see in detail what we're doing. And in some cases, we need to freeze away, as many organisms possible, but we shouldn't be confused, that freezing it away or putting it in a data base, doesn't mean that it's gonna be easy or even possible to restore. We need to do everything. We need to document, freeze, and protect what is already there by shrinking our agricultural use. Possibly by 10 or 100 fold, I think that's totally these old to do with synthetic biology and other new tools that we have. Can you talk about the advantages of perhaps computer, aided design of genomes, the sort of aspirational software heart and soul of the genome project, right? So in particular, I'm curious about advances in AI, like those coming out of deep mine, such as the alpha fold, and if they have special relevance for this sort of complex work. Right, so the genome consists of one percent of it codes for proteins and alpha fold is focused on mostly on the proteins. But there's some software for folding RNA and folding even the genome itself. That can either be predictive or it can be measured. So there's a lot of software that's used for looking through microscopes and determining the structure and try and correlate that structure, again, by synthetic biology, you see, let's change the shape, not just the sequence and see how that see what function that affects. So in that trial and error, I can go very quickly or even exponentially, once you get going, you see the patterns and you start testing more and more sophisticated hypotheses. But alpha fold is not the only way to do it, so there are other machine learning based methods in fact machine learning coupled with multiplex libraries, which can be in the millions or billions of synthetic molecules that act as there are subtle variations or no-summers, not so subtle variations, as you know. If you do machine learning, you're supposed to make a library, so you're focusing on functionality rather than on structure, alpha fold predicts the 3D structure. And to illustrate this, you have let's say you take a serene protease. It's called a serene protease because there's a very key serene at the act of sight. And that serene has an oxygen, as part of the mechanism. If you change that oxygen that hydroxyl to a hydrogen, it now becomes an alanine and it's completely functionless. But the 3D emotional structure is completely preserved. It is atomically precise throughout the structure, but it's a dead enzyme. So it's more interesting, I think, for most practical applications, just setting what functional consequences are of substituting. And that applies not just to proteins, which alpha fold, but also RNAs and DNAs, you want to know what the landscape of functionality is. And that can be done partly by phylogen evolutionary trees, where you line up. We now have tens of thousands of examples of almost every major macromolechule in the cell, proteins, RNAs and DNAs. And then using that, or if you feel less not enough, the evolution has improvised with enough diversity for your machine learning. You can generate your own data set. So when they were learning chess and go, they would have the computer play these games against itself to generate more data. Big data is good in the case of machine learning. And in our case, we use these megalibrers, these millions and billions, even trillions, that act as a kind of a wetware computer. It can do all this computing, and you can read it out in terms of the sequencing that you were talking about earlier. And barcodes, so you can barcode all these molecules and combination of molecules. And so you can think of this synthetic biology library as a kind of an honorary computation device that would use together with the machine learning, which is typically done on a classic monnoyman machine, meaning ordinary kind of computers, most of us would recognize. In your opinion, how is the idea of biology as a software reading, writing, programming, and debugging sort of held up over time? Well, metaphors are imperfect. I think their advantages outweigh the disadvantages of using Greece metaphor. I'm a programmer since the mid 60s, as a preteen. And I've been programming both computers and biology. And I find that the metaphor really works for me personally. Where it breaks down a little bit is, when you say that your goals should be set by the goals of the metaphor, in the early days synthetic biology, or multiple camps, and one of them was camp, where we're going to have nann gates and or gates and if then else is. And all the Boolean logic that might characterize a certain category of computation, electronics. And I felt, and I still feel that there's a lot of interesting biology that occurs with analog circuits. And we've kind of lost track of that, or some of us, of a lost track of that key component of the electronics. But it is there. But anyway, the analogs, there's the evolution, typically when you make cell phones, as far as I know, you make a very small number of prototypes that are very similar to one another and you test them out. But in biology, like I said a couple times now, you can make millions and trillions, and you can do accelerated evolution while with most, you know, fridge building and building trains and jets and cell phones, you really don't have that luxury of making trillions of them and seeing which one works best. How fast is the field of synthetic biology advancing? Are you excited about where the field's going? Do you have any concerns or fears? Yeah, let's say both excitement and concerns. And I think that applies to all technologies. I think that we, the more radical and, just, you know, it could be positively disruptive, but you have to think of all the potential negatives. So it is happening exponentially how fast it's doubles at least once a year. Sometimes we'll get a factor of 10 per year, as measured by both reading and writing DNA. Most of the 10, 20, 30 million fold has occurred within the last decade or two. So it's potentially faster than Moore's law for electronics. And it has kind of this atomic limit that is very comfortable, it's very comfortable programming precise atomic positions using biology. That, that both substitutes, we've gotten, we're getting more and more. Now, on the negative side, we need to be, we have good government agencies, that that we should be very supportive of both intellectually and financially, like the FDA, the EPA, the USDA and their foreign equivalents. These are not sufficient though, because they're things like equitable distribution of technology. We want everybody on the planet to have at least have a chance to, not only theoretically have access to it because the prices right, but also have the education or the dialogue that allows them to evaluate whether they, to know that it exists until an evaluate what they want to use it or not, and whether it's good for them. So it's not sufficient to just like lob over a free piece of software, like, you know, GPS software, not, and they don't know what the satellites are doing, so for now, modern uses of GPS, like Google Maps, is fairly accessible, but there's almost no technology is completely equally accessible, clean water, roads, cell phones are getting accessible in remote parts of the world. So the world, don't think that I, is truly accessible equally that I can think of. Pan is a biotechnology and that is smallpox. It was, it's completely extinct, and so you don't have to constantly be bringing out a new drug or a new vaccine that maybe not everybody can afford every government can't give out for free, smallpox extinction is something we can give out for free, generation after generation. So I'm looking for more and more of those, you know, bringing down the price of reading and writing DNA by 10 million full, it's just a start, we should look for that, and almost everything we do is synthetic biology. Do we need the NIH to embrace the human genome right project, like the did the read or that sort of already happening? I think it would be lovely if they did, I think we need to pursue multiple routes, philanthropy, industry, government, multiple, again, having DOE and NIH in the game was helpful, but there's a number of others that are interested in genome project right in SF, DARPA, DARPA, and IRPA. These have supported it in various forms of supported synthetic biology. Genome project right has, you know, been, it's the air of all those, wonderful funding sources, and I think it's, but, but it, as long as it has a vision that includes something that is net positive for society, that there will be a way and hopefully multiple different ways for different flavors of it. And I think one of those, one of the early flagship challenges is, is, is, is resistance to all viruses in multiple organisms. I think that's something that can be clearly articulated, and it has a much, I think, a much higher positives and negatives, and in most of the negatives, I think we can mitigate about by, you know, thinking of all the, all the, all the possible downsides in how to protect against them. So let's, let's take a dive into some of the gene editing tools and, and whatnot a little bit over the last 10 years since Jennifer, Dowden and colleagues first developed CRISPR gene editing. There's been a lot of excitement about it. Your lab was one of the first to show that gene editing using CRISPR past name could be done in normal human cells, but acknowledging the endotally like revolutionary impact of CRISPR. Do you think it's possible it's been overhyped from the standpoint of the public at large, not having a more comprehensive or appropriate understanding of where it sort of fits within the existing tool sets of synthetic biology? Yeah, I think, I hesitate to use word hype because it implies somebody is being hyperbolic. I think it was, it was kind of a team effort of, it's just, it's wonderful that we're bringing it any part of reading and writing genomes and synthetic biology to people's attention or science for that matter. This is one of the more exciting things in science right now. It's getting people, but it's not, it's not just about CRISPR. First of all, you can't really edit if you can't read. So I think the big revolution here is being able to read the genomes. You read them at the beginning to find the tools. You read them again to decide what your goals of editing are. Then you're, you read it a few times to make sure you're editing is going well. And then you read it again to see that the edit that you made has the physiological consequences, which increasingly we're using DNA reading as a way of, or RNA reading to see how the physiology is going. It's a so-called epigenomics, the physiology. So that reading is important. Another thing that's important is there was some pretty good editing methods that are still in use to predate CRISPR, notably homologous recombination, which smithies and compets you got the Nobel Prize for decades before, Jennifer and Emmanuel. I'm a big fan of Jennifer Panyol, by the way, we've started a few companies together, Jennifer and I. But there's homologous recombination, which is very powerful, it's precise and over large distances, while CRISPR tends to be imprecise and over and or small in scope. Another one that dates back two decades before CRISPR is SSAPs or Lambda Red, sometimes called it's a way of getting precise editing. And that's what we actually used to around 2009 to make libraries of billions of edited cells in a day, single person. So that shows some of the power and the other evidence of its power was that that was the first completely recoded genome was done mostly at a combination of SSAPs and recombinases, which is also very precise. CRISPR was basically a hatchet and I sometimes call it genome vandalism. So I think we need to embrace all of these methods and a few more that are coming now, diaminases that can be done with it without CRISPR and more sophisticated SSAPs and integracies, transposingases. So it's a rich, I think it's okay if the public just lies on the one aspect of it, but it's nice, it is nice whenever a more nuanced and visionary form where it illustrates the importance of reading and other more precise and larger scale editing and writing, where you right synthesize something from scratch, and usually competent by some could be copped in by CRISPR but more commonly as the pop-ton using recombinases or integracies. What about some of the existing capabilities of gene editing therapy, things that have been done in transgenic models for decade at least, or more, deleting versus addition, of a missing gene? Right, so, yeah, so you can think of CRISPR as a subset of editing, editing is a subset of genome engineering, and genome engineering is not a subset of, but it's kind of a vandalogram overlapping set with therapies and GMOs and so forth. So, most gene therapies that have been approved are adding genes, and this is done typically without CRISPR, and when you have a genetic disease, you're missing a gene, so you don't really want to edit necessarily, you want to add it back in. As you grow older, a lot of your gene products, your gene expression is dropping down, one way to deal with that would boost it back up, and we've explored these sorts of things. The use of gene therapy, putting in a missing gene, and in fact, editing for that matter, for rare gene diseases is, by its nature expensive. It's millions of dollars per person over a lifetime, partly because the R&D costs and the pallet of care and all sorts of health care for someone has a very severe disease that might have died young years ago, but thanks to the orphan drug act and others, they can now weed closer to normal life, but it millions of dollars. There is, it's great to have, and we'll keep developing these gene therapies in better ways of delivery. Oh, I forgot to mention, delivery is another thing that sometimes missed when people just shout CRISPR. You have to get it to the right place, the right dose, the right time, maybe to turn off, and it's done a job, so keep it off target, keep it off target, so many of them. Anyway, that this delivery and alternative to this expensive solution is a much lower cost, which is genetic counseling, where you basically tell people before they get married, before they pre-conception, or sometimes post-conception, that they, that they're at risk. They, themselves, are carriers. They are healthy. They will be healthy, but if they marry someone that has the same carrier status, they put their children at risk. So there's, there are two methods. I think a lot of the Western rule tends to go towards interventionists, you know, reactive medicine, where we'll spend millions of dollars, and, you know, by not pursuing preventative medicine, but the preventative medicine in this case is, you know, low hundreds of dollars, just to know yourself, to know how to keep your children healthy by making pre-conception choices. Well, probably circle back to a little bit more of that in a minute, but since we're talking about, you mentioned a few other types of, you know, gene editing, the Damanese, and you've talked about this multiplex editing. What does it mean to be able to go, you know, to performing 26,000 edits, or you said, I mean a million, potentially a million edits in human cells, you know, versus the previous record of something like 62. I mean, what applications does this most impact? Is it, you know, the large genome creation, or tissue engineering or germline? Right, so we did our previous record of 62 or 42, depending on how you count it, was in pigs, and it was for tissue engineering, it was germline. So germline is kind of off the table for human, in part, because there's no clearly articulated medical need, and the time for discovering safety and efficacy is over a lifetime, which is, you know, on affordable and ill-advised. So anyway, but germline certainly gets into humans via, um, uh, pigs. So, so that, this has been the idea of transplanting organs from animals to humans goes back at least in the 1960s, where, uh, chimpanzee kidney survived for nine months in a, in a, in a school teacher, uh, who went back to teach, and, you know, was normal for nine months. But that was, that was the exception then, and it would, and it would, it would be the exception now, except for the synthetic biology that we do on the germline of pigs, which now are made into, uh, many, uh, pre-clanical, uh, primate tribe, primate, uh, transplant trials, pig the, uh, primate, and a few, uh, pig the human trials that are going on. Primate survival looks like around 600 days so far, and there's still, uh, a couple of them are still alive, uh, at 500 or 600 days. Um, we're going to, we're keeping improving these. Um, but that's, that's in the order of 40 to 60, uh, at its per genome in the germline. Uh, if the, the multi virus resistance requires more than that, uh, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, some things that are done for, uh, diversity and ecosystem, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a type of tape recorder, so I'm just going to call it a flight recorder, so it's analogous to planes that, that record a lot of data, but typically you don't read it, so a lot of writing that much reading, unless the plane goes down and then you'll look at, you'll look at selective regions for debugging what went wrong. That same thing could be put into the, uh, bodies of plants animals and, and even humans, um, because it's a very compact reporting device of the physiological states of every cell in the body. We, we, we've, we've shown this works sort of in the scale of 60 to 24,000, and that's, that's probably our next, our first effort at, at making a million edits will be in these, the form of these molecular flight recorder. So there's a few examples, but the number will grow as soon as, as soon as we get more than a handful of people working on on these, uh, visionary projects, um, what we'll see, uh, a blossoming of all sorts of creative uses of, of making a multiplex editing. I think non-multiplex editing will become the exception. So you mentioned your lab, you know, g-netted pigs and you enhanced them by making them resistant to some retro viruses. Do you think, you know, as a more visionary kind of question that you could use, you know, more precise, genetic, the D M N A is a CRISPR, whatever, to eliminate viral spillover events from livestock to humans. So, I mean, there's a lot of viruses that originate from, from livestock when we're raising animals and captivity. Yeah, so this is, uh, important, um, so that the, the viruses that we got rid of were in Dodge and a stretch of ours, it's meaning they're built into the pig genome, every pig on the planet. And so, and they, are, have been shown to infect human cells and to replicate and go into other human cells. So this is, particularly, um, bad scenario, uh, in immune compromised patients, and the FDA recognizes decades ago, and really was, I think, pleased to see progress being made on eliminating them from the germline of the pigs. So that, that, that, but in addition to viruses that are built into the germline of animals and humans, there are viruses coming in from outside. And we just published, uh, the first example, this is with Luv Hanyang's team. She was a graduate student at a post-doctoral fellow on my lab and co-founded, uh, egenesis and key hand for making cell therapies and organ therapies. But anyway, as a side project, um, we publish the paper on, um, getting rid of African swine fever virus by making CRISPR to attack the viral DNA. This is, um, what, what CRISPR originally evolved to do is to take out bacterial viruses. We think this is the first case of using CRISPR in a practical sense for eliminating mammalian viruses from the environment. It's using CRISPR against mammalian viruses. So, um, but zoonotic diseases is bigger than that. If we could bake a huge fraction of the, uh, plants animals and humans resistance those viruses because of their genetic code, that actually anticipates viruses. We haven't even seen yet. It should handle all natural viruses. So, like, um, you know, Marburg Ebola, uh, HIV CRISPR, these should not have been, these would not have been surprises. They would have been surprises to scientists, but not to, um, these cancerers, sorry, virus resistance cells. So, sounds like CRISPR seems to be uniquely positioned for that, you know, type of use. Well, not necessarily, I don't, you know, I like the, I love CRISPR. I personally benefited from it, but it is, um, I like the balance that there are other nucleases that some people claim are more specific, but soft target. There are DM and ACEs that don't evolve CRISPR. So, I wouldn't say, uh, what, you, term unique is too strong. Uh, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox and, um, you know, and it, a lot of it has to do with, um, delivery and testing to testing as a big deal, which is somewhat, just slipped, swept under the rug, um, when we're just, it's just like, oh, yeah, who the design, you know, CRISPR and take care of everything, but there's a lot of reading and, uh, right, you know, synthesis, which is in CRISPR and, and then the delivery and testing. So, it's a, it's a integrated whole that doesn't require CRISPR. So, another technology would be base editing, which, uh, you know, doesn't evolve double stranded breaks and DNA, and I know there's a phase one be trial with the PCSK9 target. They're targeting it, doing targeting for the liver as a potential treatment for the hyper cholesterolemia, a familiar form. Um, I'm, you know, I just read about this recently and pretty excited. I mean, I've, you know, I know people that are, that are taking the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, which are very expensive, um, and you have to get a Marbytree to four weeks. So, uh, it'll be interesting to see, you know, if the base editing could be a one and done treatment, you think, or, uh, that, that is one of the advantage of gene therapy in general, whether it's editing or, or adding genes. Um, uh, I, yeah, I think that a lot of, a lot of our diseases are diseases of wealth. I mean, we used to have much more active, uh, vegan diets, um, low, you know, low and overall carbohydrates mainly because those low and calories all together. Um, and so diabetes and, uh, part of, in some of the cardiovascular diseases, in effect, this also we didn't live as long in general. Uh, so it was less of an issue. So these are, but, but, but PCSK9 is, it looks like shaping up to be a terrific, uh, example, um, of something that basically all humans can be thought of as having the same disease. And therefore, it's a large market could be low cost. Um, aging is another, uh, a variety of age related diseases that might have a common core where we are programmed to die at a certain age. And my style at two years old, both at whales at 200 human summary of the queen. And so that's probably negotiable. Um, PCSK9 is, it is not solving aging in general. It's, it's a very specific, um, thing that may become in the most, human's. It was de-risk because there were a few humans that were walking around that were basically double-nall for both copies of their PCSK9 from on-dath. And that, that kind of showed us that it was going to be safe and effective. Um, although there's still quite a bit of studied long term studies that have to be shown that makes sure it doesn't cause early, um, onset neurodegeneration in the particular way that we're, uh, implementing it, which is not germline, which is how it. The, uh, people that previously had PCSK and those, not, nulls for germline via natural rotations. Since you mentioned aging, uh, and it sounds like, and I think you think aging is fundamentally a program. It's, it's a really interesting idea when that's probably, it's got many implications. So, um, whether, especially when we're thinking about whether or not we can mitigate aging or potentially cure it. So, could you talk about your perspectives on that? What you think might mean for the future of human aging? Well, so we're, uh, mostly aiming for as serious diseases of aging. They, they, they may have very, relatively little in common in terms of what organ is affected, you know, what system there may be nine or ten different pathways that can be affected so called hallmarks of aging. So there's a great diversity, but they have it. We, there is a school of thought that they have it and a small core set of systems biology systems medicine that if you get it that core, you can, you can change the clock, you can make it shorter, uh, as in mice or longer as a bowie whales. And, and, and, and then you can rejuvenate, uh, there is rejuvenation that occurs whenever you go through gameta genesis and fertilization through a normal reproduction, uh, you reset the age clock. And you also reset it when you do something unnatural, which is cloning where you take the nucleus from an old animal and put it into rejuvenating environment of an egg. There's a, and there's also a rejuvenation process that occurs, unnaturally when you use transcription factors is a DNA binding proteins that regulate the expression of genes. Four of them, so called yam and acrophactors or so OSKM is a, the abbreviation. Um, these, uh, will very convincingly take a very old cell in terms of it into a very young, so immediately like say a skin cell from 80 year old and it will be, it will take on many of the characteristics, most of the significant characteristics of an embryonic cell. And then it can, um, produce almost all the tissues of the, of the body, probably all of them, except for the, um, extra embryonic and parts of our part of the body that, that should be to early embryogenesis. So, um, so those are a few, uh, and then, and there are many others that are shown that the blood, uh, what's in the blood of older and younger animals can influence one another older blood makes the younger ones old and the young blood makes older animals younger by a variety of biomarkers and, and a disease related things. And so, so, so I, I, I fall into the school, there's two school, at least two schools of thought here that there's a damage school where you have to go in there and kind of micromanage a surgery that fix the damage, as you surgeon might fix a damage, broken arm. And then, then there's the, uh, epigenetic school where it says that if you convince the cell that it's young, it will fix itself, uh, to a large extent, there will be some exceptions. And, and so, and we've seen that over, over these, you know, fertilization, cloning and OSKM factors, uh, are, are threes in the bloodborne factors, or for examples. Uh, and we need to reset all of the, uh, mechanisms, all mine hallmarks of aging in probably all of the, it's tissue types of the body, at least the stem cells for each of the body parts, uh, to have a shot at, um, we're aiming for, for youthfulness, uh, lack of age related diseases. So, you should be youthful at that age, which you're, or you normally would be, um, unhealthy, uh, even if you're not, um, dying of any particular disease. So, that's, that's what aiming for, it will be approved by the FDA for specific indications for specific diseases of aging, but then, if it really is getting at the core of aging, it will be immediately applicable to almost all of the disease aging. And, and this aging just affects everything, almost every morbidity, mortality, even like accidental death, um, infectious diseases like COVID has a very, and, and it's cognitive consequences have very steep, um, increases, um, at around 60 years old. So, I, I recall like one of your, your former publications, I forgot what year, I think it was a P&A S1 where you, you did gene therapy and added three transcription factors to, to rodents to mice, and there was some reversal of aging or biomarkers. And, um, and it was like, GDF beta receptor and FGF 21 and, uh, alpha cloth, oh yeah, those are not transcription factors, those were soluble factors. That's right. Okay. But we also did a separate experiment, we took three transcription factors, OS and K of OSKM, separate experiments, uh, but delivered in similar ways, uh, a deno associated virus. And we did some other experiments with full of statin and plomerase, so that it affects the ends of the chromosomes, the telomeres, full of statin, this, um, most muscle, but each of these has, um, you know, reproducible impact on home, of, of, home archivaging of biomarkers of aging and diseases of aging, um, and it affects multiple diseases, about seven different categories of diseases that we've done now in mice and some, uh, subset of those have been tested in dogs now, aiming for a veterinary product. So, um, the three that you mentioned, I think have slight advantages, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, FGF 21 and TGF beta, I should mention, that is an art, the, the other two are natural alpha cloth on five of it FGF, um, 21, but the TGF beta, uh, receptor is normally membrane bound, we made a soluble form of it. So, all three of them tend to be soluble and they affect the way, uh, act like the young blood, inter, interjuvenating these mice and dogs, and hopefully soon they'll be in human clinical trials. Um, and, and that has the advantage that we don't yet have a good way of delivering to every cell on the body or every stem cell on the body. Um, and I've already said delivery was very important and we're, it's so important we have it, uh, we need to fix it. But anyway, the meantime, we can deliver the genes to subset of cells in various parts of the body, and then those subset will deliver the proteins, those three proteins to mention, more broadly, and so you can, in principle, affect the whole body by that combination of two kind of tears of delivery. Um, so that that's the idea behind that. And the dogs is a particularly good conduit to humans because their large mammals like humans, they live often in a human environment, eat human, like sometimes eat human food. Uh, they have similar kind of emotions and bonding in eye contact and all the rest. Uh, and the owners can really sense their their states so they can get it more subtle, um, positive and negative consequences, earlier. So anyways, and it's a product that people care deeply about their their pets. So, so, um, I'm very excited about, you know, rejuvenate bio and know what Davis and was supposed to talk on my lab and he started rejuvenate bio and it seems to be shaping up to be a good product. Yeah, it'll be exciting to follow this results. It was the kind of answer what are my questions, which was, you know, a lot of the the rodent research, particularly with aging. It's not not not a lot of it translates, you know, to humans and, and you know, one thing in particular, I think that is is important to consider with human aging is that, you know, humans are exposed to disease and viruses. And we're not in this like sterile lab environment and we have these periods of real like illness and muscle disuse and it's just very different than than a rodent, but there's advantages to studying to using rodents. Right. What, what do you think like why why should we use rodents to study aging? So, um, so as the prelude to the experiment that you mentioned or we use three three, uh, soluble factors in dogs, we did, we did 45 different gene therapies, single one at a time in rodents. And we're going to use a lot of them to make sure to find the subset of three that we wanted to test in rodents in combinations, various combinations. And then once we had settled on the three factors out of 45, then we moved into dogs and then we'll, we'll next move into humans. So, you shouldn't blindly expect the, the rodent mouth work, but it, it's, it's their advantages because they only live two years. It's easy to see along the effect. We're not always looking for longevity, we're, we're usually looking for aging reversal of age-related diseases because that's what the FDA wants as well. But we do occasionally measure longevity in the case of the full statin and turt treatments those did show a pretty significant, very significant, longevity effect on the on the rodents. So, even even primate trials can be deceptive, there's a lot of differences in the way that they're treated, you know, the, just, in fact, the certain ways dogs have, I think, a more similar environment, maybe, you know, more to their liking, more natural for them. Since they've been our companion for tens of thousands of years. So, but even dogs are not an ideal, larger, you know, pigs are very close to humans and their organs. They use this transplants, but they're also perfect. So, so in alternative to all of the animal models is human organoids. And, and those are getting increasingly accurate also, we can basically skip a lot of the developmental biology and go straight to a particular organ. We can't go, we can't go via normal human development because there's a ban on letting human embryos develop past 14 days in a dish. But it's considered ethical to make an isolated heart or even heart plus lungs, plus muscle, plus liver, plus neurons. But not a whole brain. And, you know, so we're, as this is rapidly developing, we're exploring collectively with diverse set of voices, you know, what, how to do this in a way that's, you may, to the animals or, or develop, you know, completely animal independent strategies for both testing therapies, but also being the therapies. And, so, we can see organoids are increasingly moving their way into clinical trials. So, for example, we showed restoration of a demylenating disease in, in rodents by putting human organoids brain organoids that contain, that re-mylenate and are protected against the demylenating mechanisms. So, they're supercells and that they are not just replacing this cells or damaged because they just get damaged themselves, but they are resistant to the damage. And that's, and I think that this repeated over and over again in both cell therapies and organ therapies we're developing is that the goal is not just to deal with the organ shortage, or it's to have something against the pancissus, immunologically superior, but less rejected, resistant to pathogens, resistance, cancer, or sonessence, cryoproservation, all of these things have been demonstrated in animals. And now we want to, you, you get them to humans via cell or organ transplants. If I remember correctly, you were, you didn't, you enhanced the brain organoid to, I think you edited it from April 4, which, if you're homozygous, you have like a 20-fold increase risk for Alzheimer's to April 3. Right. What, so, so, making it more resilient against Alzheimer's, I guess. Right. So, so that's somewhat depending on how you look at the composition of various genes, that particular case E4 is not the predominant of the leal, and so you might call it an enhancement, PCS canine, and is very rare in the population. And so, if you make everybody or a large fraction population PCS canine, negative, that could be called an enhancement relative to the average, but it's not an enhancement relative to minority. In the case of April E3, or even April E2, which is, that is, rare than the E3 plus E4, and that would be an enhancement, but E3 over E4 is probably about closer to average. But this whole definition of, or this whole obsession about enhancement seems odd, because a huge fraction of our popular technologies are enhancements, you know, our smartphone makes a smarter or a certain way. It can also make us dumber, but the point is it has the capability of helping us navigate, helping getting access to the world's facts, in fact, boys. And so, as far as jets, so worth enhance our ability to locomote. So, so I think increasingly we're going to recognize that the biotechnology for producing or not just reactive medicine, where we're putting out fires, they're preventative medicine, where we're, by enhancement, we're protecting ourselves. Vaccines, is a beautiful example of enhancement that protects us. We're far healthier than our ancestors were because of vaccines. I kind of would like to just move into a little bit to the, to the germline editing, we've kind of talked a little bit here and there, but. You've said, in, in previously that you felt like an obligation to be balanced. And, but you've also, of course, said it's important to focus on outcomes and not to rationalize addictions to future and. You're even involved in calling for a temporary moratorium on germline editing. No, actually, I was not, I was opposed to the obsession with moratorium because we already have a moratorium on all new drugs. We don't put, we don't allow anybody to use new drugs that haven't been through the FDA testing and. So yes, it's, it sounds subtle, but I was. Concerned that we would be developing germline where there's no need. But there's also no need for moratorium because we have very good regulatory mechanisms for preventing that sort of thing from from happening at a market scale. Now, a moratorium would not do anything more at the market scale and also would not do anything more at the individual scale. Both the FDA and and in fact, most laws do not work on individuals that want to break the laws that are willing to accept the consequences or think they're above the consequences. So, and that's what happened in the case of germline, someone either misinterpreted willfully. The guidelines or didn't didn't think it was a law. And in fact, you didn't get convicted of germline manipulation. This is JK, and China, he got convicted of, you know, not following the rules for. Getting the consent of the funding agencies and the patients and so forth. He actually did a pretty good job of getting the consent by some criteria. He spent an hour of video tape counseling to make sure they understood what they were getting into. But anyway, as far as I know, he was not convicted of germline therapy, but something more nuanced. And he's out now. He's spent the three years is up and he's out. And as far as we know, the children are healthy, which is more than you can say for the most revolutionary new treatments. So that's what I mean by balance. Let's let's talk about what did he actually do that was harmful to the patients or harmful society. And he's more than just having a nature of response. We were all. Poiled up ready to say that he actually did try to pay attention to the ethics. But there wasn't a clear ethical consensus beyond the national counting of sciences report that I participated in in a minor way. He was trying to go down there checklist, but he was doing it. He's being the judge of whether he was doing the checklist right enough. I think that rubbed people the wrong way. And I think the Chinese government was very sensitive to what international opinion would be. It's not clearly would have acted quite so harshly if there had been no international backlash. They might have nominated for Nobel Prize and their all universe. A couple of questions come to mind there. I mean, the public, the public, international reaction. I mean, the differences in the public response, you know, in 1978 the first. It was Luis Brown was the first baby born as you can see by in vitro fertilization and considered one of the biggest medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. But presumably at the time it was quite controversial. And you know, I'm just sort of interested in the in the the public response to that sort of medical technology and you said it versus the CRISPR edited babies in 2018. If they were all proportional. Well, I think that this concern about. This about doing things that are unnatural happens again and again and natural is is often. It's not defined as the way the world was before humans is usually it's the way our grandparents lived. It's so kind of nostalgic. Reification of of way our grandparents lived even though we weren't there. We just imagine that they had a perfect life without antibiotics or. Motors or that sort of thing. And so what's natural keeps is a moving target and a lot of things that were. Demonize, villainize in the past are taken for granted now. You know, for example, some of us might remember how cell phones were demonized as melting your brain or you know, you know, giving radiation to your brain and. But now people on cell phones all day and they don't even use my own lines anymore. And you could even say so anyway that they're the. You know, response is is one of caution and the appropriate responses were get cautiously take this the drug administration. But that requires that the government allows us to take it if we can the drug administration which right now. We can't do because a 2016 writer says we can't. And so we can't allow the FDA to accept these. Nonominations for clinical trials. So this is a very, you know, head in the sand kind of approach to science. Usually that the the careful and in most FDA trials are very carefully vetted before they go in preventing of that careful.<|sr|> A Comentially said that day to could cause lives. Um, I don't think it's urgent with a case in the case of Germany no one has articulated a particular thing Other than HIV resistance, which is with je...? I think that's actually a pretty good choice of CC R5 and HIV and HIV resistance us and Jka houses. Case. Um, I think some people maybe don't appreciate how stigmatizing HIV can be in certain communities in China, so um. So anyway, it's a complicated issue that I think we need to be respectful of both the potential future and the path, safe path towards it. How do you think we can equip people with a right knowledge in order to come to well-reason and conclusions surrounding germline editing? Understanding zip complexities, we've got background rotational rate and offspring impact. If you compare it to again, a background rotational rate or a paternal chemo, if a man goes and gets cancer and gets treatment and then after the treatment goes off and has a child, we kind of accept that, you know, rotational rate. So things that are known about germline mutagen, I guess. Right, I mean, the chemotherapy is a perfect example or the radiation you get living at high altitude. This falls into what I was saying about nature or natural, which is defined as whatever we've accepted, whatever technology we've accepted up to this point are natural and any new one. So chemotherapy is okay, even if it's more mutagenic than gene therapy. I don't think we necessarily have to educate people or establish what the right answer is. I think it's about conversation and some of those, you know, sometimes people say, well, you know, you need to, you know, reach out to everybody. Well, thing is, a lot of people you read out to aren't particularly interested, they don't have the time to have a discussion about some abstract science that isn't in the supermarket. So that's one issue. One way to make that connection, though, is with more common media, like, you know, books and movies, television, these, these are things where you can put it in a framework, this entertaining and educational, you know, my wife, for example, contributed to the grazing anatomy genome lab episodes. That's one form of dialogue where they can say, oh, yeah, we're worried about Jurassic Park. There's no reason to avoid the negatives, or some of my colleagues don't like negative, negative, hating of scientists and entertainment, but I think it's good. It protects us from those scenarios and slight generalizations of scenarios. And the more we think of, more we're protected, there's, I think the way that germline, if germline, you get accepted, the way that in vitro fertilization was eventually accepted, it was, it was demonized too, that whole term, test tube babies, which we think is quaint now, was supposed to be scary back then. And the 70s, test tube babies, you know, it's like, that's totally unnatural. But now, you know, it is millions of, like, six million babies have been worn that way. It's including some more close colleagues. So, I think the way it may make it into popular acceptance, so it's considered natural, and the next thing is unnatural, is number one is if we're already getting humans that are getting transplants from germline, manipulate pigs. So, germline is not hurting the, the herds of pigs that are providing all these organs, and it's not hurting the patient, it's getting the organ, and maybe that's one way. The other way is we'll get, we'll have more and more gene therapies that are somatic, not germline, but they're done at early age, maybe to cure early onset childhood diseases. And so we, or maybe even done in fetuses, but not in germline. So, people will say, oh, yeah, you can do it really, really early in utero. What do we really worry about? And some of these gene therapies, this people start to get to be quite old, we'll say, okay, it doesn't have long-term consequences, and then, and then somebody will come up with a use case that is very compelling for someone has a very serious medical disease, might be infertility, might be something more fatal than that, and then that will be the tipping point. If there is a tipping point, could be that it has to do with something that we all share in common, that's very hard to fix in adults. The problem is there are very few examples of that. Maybe space travel requires some efforts in the germline, but even that, you know, we might be able to make every cell in the body radiation resistant, maybe we can make some kind of multiplex edited solution to the low gravity. So, I think maybe we can make a multiplex edit that makes this multip virus resistant. These are things where you think it might be germline, but it might be just as feasible or at least feasible enough, maybe maybe more expensive, less equity distributed. Nice thing about germline is every subsequent generation gets it for free. Some people say it's a bug or a feature to think I look at it, but if you can do it, it will get cheaper to do it sematically, and it will be inherited in the way that we used to mean inheritance, which is what your grandfather hands down, it's the great credential for set of technologies, tools, possessions. That multiplex editing will be something that won't be germline, but it will be just as surely inherited. Right, the equality of access is interesting as you've brought up multiple times because, you know, like HIV is great because, I mean HIV is essentially cured with the right drugs and most developing people live and developed countries with health care can do that, but it's not the case for you know, developing nations with governments that aren't, you know, running correctly. And so it's an interesting point that it's you know, is it easier to genetically cure HIV through the germline or you know, eliminate poverty essentially when you're talking about something, I mean potentially I guess. Yeah, I think, eliminate poverty sounds like a moonshot, but I think it qualifies as a, as a positive grand challenge, more like the satellites than the moonshot. And it may not be so far off in that there could be a virtuous site positive feedback loop where you reduce the medical load from infectious disease and other diseases that slow down, not just the individual, it has disease, but the whole family, the whole village around that person because they want to care for that person. And, and then that that lightning of the medical load results in a little more time and money to dedicate to things like educating children, adult women and so forth. And then that results in better medical care and you just gets better and better and it could it could help. The other thing that can help is, you know, better agriculture, maybe less use of land and water for animals and more on nutritious plants. Golden rice is an example of something where vitamin A deficiency kills a million people a year and golden rice is one cost effective way reducing the poverty burden, you know, to a town with a few blind people that are likely to go be dead within a year or two of going blind. But, but, um, I'm saying the, I think the diseases of poverty can be eliminated in that manner. We also, could in principle, HIV is one of the infectious diseases that is mostly human specific, even though a lot of these so-called humans, specific diseases did come from an animal originally, I mean, to where to where else did it come from. But it's so rare that if you eliminated it, you know, the, it would be essentially extinct, like smallpox. I mean, there could be anotherpox virus that replaces smallpox someday, but the point is smallpox has been eliminated for so many decades that is unquestionably a success. And I think the same thing could be done with HIV. You know, condoms is another thing that works a little bit better in industrialized nations. It doesn't really necessarily protect against uncooperative partners or rape, that sort of thing. So, I think we need, there's a, just a multi-pronged effort to eliminate HIV, but once we do, it could be a smallpox. It's been a calcium, the vaccines, which are so powerful. The latest round of vaccines are kind of in a format of gene therapy and are a very inexpensive compared to most gene therapies that are typically $2 million. In the case of COVID-19, there was a little was $2 for a, a den of viral caps that are around the double-trained DNA for three of the top five vaccines. You talked a little bit about genetic counseling and, you know, there's, there's next-generation embryos selection and I'm sort of, I'm interested in, in your thoughts, in the practical and or if it's a philosophical difference is between doing next-generation embryos selection and germline editing. I guess put it another way, you know, does advances in sequencing and understanding of the genetics of disease and complex traits, polygenic traits, eventually lead to a point of practical editing through embryos selection? I think it will be intermediate. It won't, it won't be as powerful as one could do with germline genome engineering, but it, it could achieve many of the same goals for, you know, eliminated certain diseases. Many of those diseases that could, that could be eliminated by a vitro fertilization, embryo choice, could also be eliminated or greatly reduced by pre-conception choices. If that were more common, it's, it's really a matter of social norms. So there's a tiny sector of society that practices pre-conception decision-making and those have almost eliminated major serious genetic diseases. Why, it isn't common in other parts of society, is a complicated socio-economic educational cultural issue, but I think there will be a tipping point where people realize, you know, get to know their own genome better, get to know their choices when they're still very young and dating. And there's a whole variety of ways it could work out. So the things are done before the point of the vitro fertilization, which is not a, it's not the most pleasant medical procedure. I mean, the hormone treatments have negative consequences for quite a few women. Sometimes it has to be repeated multiple times, sometimes six times in case of one of my colleagues was the result of six rounds of idea. But the number of embryos that could be made by a vitro fertilization could skyrocket without in any way interfering with the germline and so forth by epigenetically reprogramming cells to become florepoteostom cells and then the florepoteostom cells can become eggs. And then those eggs, they might be randomly mutated. And if you sequence enough of them you'll find one that is what you want. So if you haven't induced the mutation in Wispurre, it just happens the way it happens in the world. This is far from efficient compared to editing, but it illustrates how we have this kind of double standard. If you achieve the same goal, germline engineering, this way it's okay, it's not okay. It's the same as GMO argument, but if you mutate a tomato or soybean by random ultraviolet mutation where you're making hundreds of mutations, random, when no control, that's somehow more attractive than if you do a precise set it and you make sure the rest of the genome is clean and you haven't touched anything else. It just doesn't, you know, for some people that make sense, if friends people doesn't, it's like saying that, oh, if I'm going to, you know, fix my car engine, I'm going to, you know, throw all kinds of random chemicals and shotguns and stuff into it and hope that one of those things makes the right fix the car. Anyway, I think that's what's going on in germline is very similar to what's going on in GMOs. You can, you can radically change this, the plant species by one method but not by another, you can change an embryo's fate, but you know negatively with chemotherapy or positively by IVF but not by germline editing. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, and it's good, good topic of conversation and then eventually I think it will sort of sell out. What about understanding the unknown, you know, so, there's a lot of genetic variants that are thought to be mostly deleterious or, you know, a quote unquote, not beneficial but upon deeper inspection, perhaps there's an advantage in an esenario, we don't quite understand and so, uh, and I've heard, I've read some some articles, uh, you kind of talk a little bit about this, not necessarily in the regard of, you know, germline editing or anything but, uh, with respect to the importance of neurodivergence, you know, and how you have narcolepsy and how you've basically, I think you've talked about, you know, many creative ideas coming from potentially having having that quote unquote disorder. So, I'm kind of just curious on your thoughts about how to foresee or like what, you know, like that, that sort of territory, understanding the unknown, you know, right. So it's, it's very similar to other technologies, you know, it was, it was unknown, what the cell phones were going to fry our brains was unknown, you know, for MRIs, uh, which have, you know, very big magnets, uh, um, you know, locomotives crashed, they collided, had the head, because of course, schedule like, uh, so when we, uh, think, so there will be negative consequences, some of them are caught in the phase one, two and three clinical trials at FDA requires, some of them are caught later, sometimes semi humorously referred to as phase four clinical trials, but meaning it's out in the population and catch them later, like homeowner placement therapy and biox or two examples, recent examples, um, the lid of mine is a slightly older example, that. So, I think that point is not to have zero risk, there is no way to have zero risk, doing nothing is very risky. Status quo is very risky relative to the future. So what we need to do is just be very cautious, start with small, uh, animal studies or human organoids, start with small human clinical trials, and then slowly grow, um, as we gain confidence, it is safe and effective. Um, in the specific examples of where there's a trade-out, I mean, I think it's very interesting to talk about trade-offs. Sometimes people will say, what about the perfect human? I said, is there a perfect human? I mean, what does that even mean? Is there a perfect means of transportation? Is, as a comeback, you know, it's like, it's a bicycle, perfect, or is it the, uh, super tanker, you know, bicycle is not so good at carrying, you know, tons of, of goods. Um, and, uh, super tanker does not get you to school in a few minutes. So, there's no perfect. There's just, there's all these trade-offs that depend on the environment. So, people will say, well, CCR5 is not a good idea for germline, and maybe it's not even a good idea for some, because it could make you sensitive to West Nile, or to certain influenza. But, another way of thinking about it, well, you don't have to knock out CCR5 just because there are people walking around with CCR5 and alls. You could be a more nuanced, where you take out the parts that you engineer the protein, as we were talking about earlier with the machine learning, you'd knock out the parts of the protein that bind to the virus, but not the parts of the protein that do their immunological function. So, you could end up with something that's HIV-resistant and West Nile-resistant, um, rather than OR. Um, uh, and, and, uh, you know, I think narco-lepsium dyslexia that I've had, um, and ADD, OCD, high-functioning, uh, autistic bipolar. These do have potential advantages to society. We don't have to eliminate them, but we should maybe give the affected people a choice if we can. It's not always possible. Some of the damage is done during embryogenesis, but some of that might be fixable as an adult, or we might be able to give them a knob that they can twist, they could say, okay, I want to be autistic for the next three days so I can get, you know, finish my thesis, you know, I can just focus and just don't think about human relations, and then I can dial it back, um, because I have to meet with the president for the university, you know, and I have to be charming, uh, and not, uh, by his definition, his neurotypical view of the world, and so you're accommodating. Or, you know, you name it, that a lot of the reason that neuro-typicals are beneficial is not because a particular disease is not a disease, or that particular disease that benefit. It's just because we're off of center in any direction, maybe even obesity, or religious choice, anything that takes us far away from the center of the bell curve makes us feel alienated, which gives us maybe more time to pursue intellectual activities rather than social media, or it, or it makes us focus on, like, proving that we're just as good as the, the, you know, handsome, you know, well articulated, you know, model in the middle of the cell curve. It's anyway, whatever it is, it isn't necessarily a particular thing that we need to preserve in the population. Although we should think creatively about, um, about that. So maybe one last topic before we, before we, and, and another area of a research that you've been involved in is the gene drive. You know, maybe some people listening or, you know, watching know what that is, but using it to eradicate insect-carrying human disease, like malaria, the technology, yeah, lime disease. Yeah, so I'm just sort of curious about, you know, your, your work on that, and, and your work on also trying to make sure your address concerns, like, and potentially, leading to extinction and obspecies or something. Right. So, I think, one approach to, so, so the extinction of species is one part of it. So you can do gene drives, whose intention is to make a species resistant to something that's bad for a third species. So, for example, you could make mosquitoes resistant to malaria. They don't carry it on to humans. There's a three species problem. Now, you're not really making anything extinct necessarily, although, since malaria is a human specific disease, you might make malaria extinct. But you could inadvertently, I think, the scenario you're painting here inadvertently make that mosquito as think as well. Now, there's a limited number of mosquitoes that carry malaria, maybe half dozen major ones out of 3500 species of mosquito. What could argue that there are very few known species that are dependent upon mosquitoes. The males are pollinators, females are the blood suckers, in this case. But even mosquito fish does not depend on mosquitoes. But anyway, we should do more study of the ecosystem interactions. We should test them extensively to see that the condom cause extinction in, they have these large enclosed ecosystems, you know, that include small villages and farms and so forth. Exinction tends to occur more easily in small populations as long as the environment is still complex. So, so we could do tests like that. But it also helps if the species that we're putting at risk is okay to go extinct. I mean, there are a lot of species going extinct and I probably, you know, getting rid of half a dozen mosquito species that are pretty confident that they only impact other species might be acceptable. But first priority is to try to do it without that. And the way that it's going to make it into, again, into public positive consciousness is, you know, my former postdoc and colleague at MIT Kevin S.V.L. is going to and tuck in Martha's Vineyard and ask whether they would be favor having a gene drive wipe out line disease or the hate line disease. But I mean, gene drive wipe out line disease do nothing or to have a non-gene drive, a shock and a whole new engineer rodent population that is resistant to line disease, but not the gene drive. And of those three scenarios, I think they like the third one the best. We don't want to do nothing. They don't want to gene drive just yet. Let's try a genetically engineered rodent population. So a little more expensive, a little, you know, probably less sure. But that's the kind of communication and the dialogue between all of, almost all of the people on the islands or the representatives and the town councils, they were surprisingly interested in the science and how it could affect the line disease of horrible disease. It'd be hard to do the same thing in malaria and that's why in line might be a better choice for these two different GMO strategies. But I think that's the pathway by which it might get better. There is a pretty good line vaccine that was blocked for no particularly great reason. It happened the bad timing that happened around the same time as the fake data on vaccines causing autism. Wakefield, I think, was this scientist named who would fake the data later which when that was revealed. But the damage was already done. People kept repeating it as if or if back for many years after it was shown to be false. And so they pulled the line disease vaccine off. Now back then, line disease was also less serious disease. I think if they were put to a vote today, they would have kept the vaccine. And then there are some new vaccines that are slightly better and either at multiple tick-borne diseases, not just line, multiple strains of line. So that's hopefully those will since now people do know the consequences of voting against the vaccine, hopefully they'll accept it this time. It's been a new syn dog several the whole time. It's one of these cases where dogs get better medical care than humans do because we love our dogs and apparently we don't care about ourselves. Yeah, you're experiments with the dogs and seeking FDA approval for that being a treatment in animal is pretty exciting. As is the line disease vaccine for dogs. Okay, so I have a personal question for you. We talked a little bit about the Narklepsy and I know I've read that you've attributed a lot of creative ideas to perhaps being in a limbo between dreaming and wakeness. But I'm wondering, what your days like do you have a routine or how do you get these creative ideas or remember them or just any insights into that? Yeah, I mean, first of all, any personal stories that scientists says shouldn't be taken as recommendations, but they're just anecdotes. The recommendations come from clinical trials. It's a little hard to do with things like Narklepsy, but it's possible. Anyway, in my case, you know, I found that I had it. It's one of these diseases that you could be very impactful, but nevertheless, combination of ignorance and denial and so forth. I just didn't recognize it until I was maybe late 30s. Probably it had a serious onset when I was 13 looking back on it. I had a lot of headaches to glow in medications for headaches and then it just headaches disappeared, but sleeping in a started kicking in much more. The so I, so after discovering it, one thing I do is I communicated. I don't hide it. You know, that sometimes your diseases that you don't tell people about can kill you more than people that things that you communicate. So, you know, Narklepsy is potentially fatal in traffic accidents. I know some of my colleagues hid their diabetes from her, but it's at me. They, which can be fatal, almost was fatal in one case, just because the people around of didn't know what was happening when he went into shock. So that's one thing is disclosure. You know, I'm not necessarily recommending them, just saying what I do. The second thing is I don't eat during most of the day. I eat right before I get a bed, which is not a good thing for most people. You want to eat well before you get a bed, but I basically, the tendency to go to sleep after a meal, which is true for many people, especially true for me. And so I found that that was good. If I'm not in a conversation like this, I tend not to fall asleep in conversations, but I will fall asleep in lectures. So I tend to try to stand or pace or do some other activity. It's not too, doesn't require too much brain power, but keeps me awake. I will however fall asleep standing up or walking or even riding my bicycle. So, and I don't drive. So that's another coping mechanism. You know, there's a whole bunch of jobs that I couldn't get. An employable in many jobs. So I happen to pick one that fits. Those are some anecdotes. Oh, yeah. In terms of, I think you want, like, for inspiration, you know, that I don't have a lot of control over it. I tend to fall asleep when I'm either super bored or super excited slash have a difficult problem. So they have a difficult problem. Very, very calm. They all fall asleep. If my computer is having trouble or crashing, I'll fall asleep. And I'll often come up with an answer to either the abstract problem or the practical problem within seconds of waking. I wake up, like, you know, it's some people are kind of groggy. I'm like already at a high heightened state of awareness when I wake up from a nap. The nap lasts from anywhere from a second to an hour. Usually in the multi-second range. Anyway, it's a very strange experience. I'm not sure how recommended, but you get used to it after a while. And as you're going out, your decision making is very poor. You're like blurring reality with, with a dream, we'll see it, you're like you're incorporating things that you're seeing because your eyes are still open, typically my eyes are still open. And then I'll be completely asleep. When I didn't know that I had, when I had it, I would, I did have drivers license for few years. I would pull up to stop the two of us, stop light, and I'd put on the parking break. Because I didn't know what I was going to sleep, but didn't want to go to sleep with the parking break. So, and then at that point, I sort of realized, I got a problem. I went to sleep clinics to make sure that I had a problem. And then I stopped. I stopped driving. I don't know how much of this is true. I once read that Salvador Dalí used to put a spoon on his nose, and he'd sit up and fall asleep with it. And he would, when he would wake, you know, with a spoon woke him or something, when it was falling, that he had this inspiration and creative ideas for his paintings. I don't know if it's real but. I think that's, I think that is true. I think it's true for a lot of people. He just tried to capture it. He tried to, you know, harness it. There's one set of theories that dreaming is where you're doing kind of trash collection and you're like cleaning up house and or preparing yourself for unlikely scenarios. And you really shouldn't interrupt that. It's not good for you. But if your goal is to harness weird stuff, then it's a good thing. So yeah, his art is, it really reflects the dream state. I think better than most of the data is, and surrealist artists around that era. So maybe he had something, you know, it's hard to say. Right. He was good at making up stories. Definitely. Well, Dr. Church, thank you again, such an honor to have you on the podcast and have a discussion with you, be able to ask you some questions. I usually, at the end of the podcast, direct people that want to kind of follow more of your work. I know you're on Twitter. Your Twitter, Twitter handle is at geo church, GEO, CH, you are CH. You also have a lab website. And if you Google church lab website and you don't click the first hit. But you also wrote a book published within 2014, Regenesis, how synthetic biology will reinvent nature and ourselves. And there was a very kind of interesting backstory to that. Well, there were a bunch of backstories to that one. Let's see, what's one you're thinking about? I mean, you know, whichever, whichever is the most interesting. I'll tell too. Well, the short one is, Ed Regis was a co-author and my agents and publisher wanted me to have a ghost writer. And I did not feel comfortable with having a true ghost writer where you don't acknowledge them. So, Ed had just interviewed me for Discover magazine. And he had written, I don't know, nine popular science books already. So, I thought that was, that would be a good partnership. And I learned a ton about writing. I hope you enjoyed his lessons in synthetic biology. So, that was, that was one part. The other thing that's probably slightly more interesting is the book was encoded into DNA. And I bet that's what he was thinking. I got to the point where we were working on reading and writing DNA for a few years. And I realized, hey, we can read it right very easily. Why don't we write a book in DNA and then read it with the best technologies of the day. And that was partly prompted by a review that I wrote of a scientific paper where the authors had synthesized a very tiny genome and had put their names in the genome in a simple code. And I was asked to review that paper from that letter to the venture Clyde Hutchinson Ham Smith for some of senior authors. And so, I reviewed the article and I decided I would write it in DNA, the whole review in DNA. And I sent it in. In a different code than they had used, a better, I thought it was a better code. And the editor, formerly, would you would think, would send it back to me and say, like, using English. But instead, the editor sent it on to them, unchanged without any English at all. And fortunately, one of the senior authors, I think, was Clyde Hutchinson doing enough programming that he broke the code and and and and and wrote through and understood the review. So then having written that code to write the review, I said, well, I'll use that same code to do my book because it was already available. And the and the and the code had the advantage. There's only dealt with uppercase letters, while mine had all the zeros and ones. The zeros and ones were a much more general coding method. And so I could not just encode the uppercase letters, but pictures, pictures in JPEG, former zeros and ones, you know, in principle, later movies, audio, all kinds of things that have been encoded using these zeros and one strategy. So I wrote, I did the book made 1970 billion copies, which is more than, you know, like the top 100 books put together prior to that. And and it and it and it to my surprise, it kind of launched an industry. There's now an international consortium for this kind of digital encoding. It's not displacing, you know, you know, just little distrives, but it is moving in that direction. But another thing that it's happening is is we're incorporating it into recording into living organisms, which I kind of alluded to when we're getting the million, you know, why would we do a million edits is we can record physiological data. So for example, we recorded two terabytes of information in a mouse in one billionth the mass of the mouse. So it's the world's smallest reporting devices. A billionth of a mouse can encode two terabytes. And the next step will be to take it up to 20 petabytes using these multiplex or the peted elements. So those are two of the back story. So there's a few more. Some of them are documented in the book I'll let the readers read the books. I think the book really has not aged much since 2014, even though the field is like exponentially improving and so forth, the book I think was futuristic enough that it wasn't wrong yet anyway. Well, I look forward to reading it. I learned to tremendous amount just from doing some background research. I had no idea synthetic biology. I mean, I just knew so little about it. And you know, I came into this podcast. I've focused a lot on aging and I've been very what humans not interested in me and what human adults not interested in aging, right? But after preparing and and during this background research and reading, this field of synthetic biology and everything that you're doing is just so exciting. I mean, just understatement, just so exciting. So thank you so much for all your research and what you know what you're going to continue to do. I mean, the world, you're you're going to be history books and all that stuff. So again, huge honor, Dr. Church. Thank you so much. Thank you. You've created one of the best set of questions I've ever seen. You took us from where most people stopped to to a whole other level. And I hope the next interview starts where you left off with fossil. But anyway, it's terrific job. And I greatly enjoyed it. Hard to believe you didn't know much synthetic biology before this. But I'm reading your book and I'm so excited. I can't wait to continue following. I'm writing another one now. It's been eight years. I have a lot of day jobs. So I don't have that much time. But it won't be exactly as SQL, but it will be wildly different. But I learned a lot for writing that one. This one I'll probably write solo. All right, have been writing solo so far. Anyway. Well, I hope to have another conversation with you again. Okay. Thank you. That was good. Take care. You too. Thanks.

Brain Drive Neurotrophic factor or BDNF is not just a key player in enhancing brain neuroplasticity and promoting neurogenesis. It's also a central figure in the scientific narrative on brain health. Extensive research reveals a consistent pattern, almost every lifestyle factor. We can modify to boost brain function is connected through some form, various mechanisms to heightened levels of BDNF. In this free nine-page protocol guide, you will find protocols designed with a goal in mind, improve cognitive function and delay brain aging. We'll explore modifiable lifestyle factors, the tactics, strategies and things you can do, particularly when it comes to exercise, nutrition and even supplementation. The protocols I outline are detailed and specific. Everything you look for in a blueprint. You'll also find a section entitled Ronda's protocols. These protocols are either practices I actively engage in or strategies I'm currently exploring curated specifically for their promising potential for beneficial cognitive and neuroprotective impact. Low risk, high upside.

Hello, everyone, Dr. Rhonda Patrick here. Today, we're embarking on a deep dive into a fascinating aspect of sleep health. The potential enhancement of sleep quality through heat exposure. It's been my personal experience that heat exposure along with appropriate cooldown has helped me with aspects of my sleep. I'd like to share with you a little bit about why I think that happens in some of the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, which should equally apply to hot baths, sauna's and to some degree exercise. These include the release of ATP, increased adenosine levels, and the signaling of sleep regulating cytokines. In other words, aspects of our immune system that can promote sleepiness. Now you might already be aware of the importance of early bright light exposure in resetting arcercadian clock and the value of avoiding blue light exposure at night for optimizing sleep. These are significant elements in the realm of sleep hygiene. But today, I'd like to temporarily skirt past those fundamentals and focus on another intriguing avenue, the potential of passive body heating. What if the simple act of raising your body temperature through taking a warm bath or using the hot tub before bed or spending time in the sauna could significantly improve sleep quality? This isn't just an enticing theory, there's some scientific research supporting this. Passive body heating, in other words, raising your body temperature without exerting yourself through physical activity, has been shown to facilitate sleep onset. Likewise, taking a warm bath before sleep, increased the proportion of slow wave sleep, the deep restorative phase of our sleep cycle that is important for staving off neuro-degenerate diseases like Alzheimer's disease. For our older population, where sleep issues are very common, passive body heating could be an invaluable tool. As systematic review, found that passive body heating can aid in sleep initiation and maintenance in the elderly, offering a non-pharmaceutical approach to combating sleep disturbances. So let's dive into heating. So there's heating, elevating core body temperature via exercise. There's also elevating core body temperature through different heat modalities like hot baths and sauna, for example. But heating via exercise stimulates ATP release and increases adenosine and signaling of sleep regulating cytokines. So these include TNF alpha, IL1, these are released from the periphery or from astrocytes in the brain. So let's talk about ATP release. So exercise increases the demand for energy in the body. That leads to the production and release of adenosine triphosphate. That's ATP, the major energy, you know, currency in the body. So ATP is a molecule that stores and provides energy for all the cellular processes, including muscle contractions. Denosine, so as ATP is being used or utilized during exercise, it breaks down into adenosine. And adenosine is a neuromodulator that plays a role in promoting sleep. So accumulation of adenosine in the brain, particularly in the basal for brain, is associated with increased sleep pressure that causes you to feel drowsy, sleepy, and it promotes the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Sort of as a side note, caffeine is binding to adenosine receptors and essentially, you know, blunting the effect of adenosine, any adenosine that's still left over in the morning, from binding to those receptors and causing you to feel sleepy. And it's one of the reasons why you get that acute alertness effect from drinking caffeine, because you're not then a feeling that effect of adenosine, the impact of adenosine binding to those receptors. So sleep regulating cytokines, I mentioned, also exercise stimulates the production of certain cytokines such as tumor, necrosis factor alpha. That's also known as T enough alpha or interlucin one or IL1. These are actually somnogenic cytokines. They're involved in sleep regulation. These cytokines are released from the periphery or from astrocytes, which is our type of glial cell in the brain, and they act on specific brain regions to promote sleep. Whole body hypothermia, a therapeutic technique that involves increasing the body temperature to his level similar to moderate to high fever generally through use of infrared sonas and warm blankets, has also been shown to increase the production of somnogenic cytokines. T enough alpha and IL1 have both been shown to increase non rapid eye movement sleep, non-rem sleep, which could be referring to deep restorative phases of sleep. So in short summary of that section, heating the body, particularly through exercise, which does stimulate the utilization, the release and utilization of ATP, which then breaks down into a denocene, and then that increases the signaling of this sleep regulating cytokines as well like T enough alpha, IL1. These factors contribute to promoting feelings of drowsiness via the adenosine, the somnogenic cytokines. They facilitate the transition from wakefulness to sleep, so they potentially then improve overall sleep quality, and also the deep sleep as well. But it is important to know that exercising too close to bedtime might have the opposite effect due to the acute effects of the increased alertness and the increases in core body temperature without being able to cool down before going to bed. So it's generally, I think, recommended to engage in exercise earlier in the day or just not right before bedtime, so you want to at least do it a couple of hours before bedtime to allow the body to cool down to promote more restful sleep to allow the alertness and your brain to kind of calm down as well. Of course, like any exercise is better than none, but when we're talking about it in the context of sleep, it is better to try to not do it literally like right before you're going to go to bed. So the effects of heat and exercise, let's talk about some very interesting effects that we have definitely discussed in the past growth hormone and prolaactin are there are two key hormones that are important in the regulation of slow wave activity. The relationship between growth hormone and sleep appears to be bi-directional. On the one hand, the majority of daily growth hormones secretion occurs in the initial phase of slow wave sleep. On the other hand, growth hormone and its releasing hormone, growth hormone, releasing hormone, have also been shown to promote sleep, particularly slow wave sleep. Regular sauna use is probably one of the most powerful stimuli that increases both growth hormone and prolaactin. So growth hormone, the effects of sauna use on growth hormone levels really depend on many factors, including duration, temperature and frequency. So for instance, to 20 minutes sauna sessions at 80 degrees Celsius with 30 minutes of cooling period in between can double growth hormone levels basically from their baseline. On the other hand, to 15 minutes on a sessions at about 100 degrees Celsius dry heat separated by a 30 minute cooling period can cause a fivefold increase in growth hormone levels. So there's also a really remarked effect when you do sort of repeated sauna use. So repeated sauna use for example, you do one, you do two one-hour sauna sessions at 80 degrees Celsius. This is very, very high for seven days in a row that leads to a 16-fold increase in growth hormone levels in men. It's kind of just as a proof of principle, example of how there is a dose dependent effect of heat stress on growth hormone and that's something again that is temperature and duration dependent. I don't necessarily think it's good to do that much heat stress. That's pretty intense, but I just wanted to highlight the effect that sauna use does have on growth hormone levels. The heightened growth hormone levels typically last a few, I would say more like a couple hours after sauna use. They released after about two hours, they start to go down close to baseline levels. It's also kind of an interesting that combining exercise with heat stress or sauna use may also increase growth hormone levels even further than when you just do for example sauna alone. Mostly it probably has to do with the, again, your elevations in core body temperature going even higher than one than one alone. The release of prolactin alongside growth hormone is one of the classic responses to heat stress. Prolactin is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that is known for its role in lactation and women, but it also has various other functions. One of these is its role in the regulation of sleep. Prolactin has been found to increase during sleep and particularly during REM sleep. It's also been suggested that it may help to promote slow wave sleep, the deepest phase of non REM sleep. So in one study, intravenous and administration of prolactin in humans was found to increase slow wave sleep. Moreover, some research has suggested that sleep disturbances such as insomnia can occur in conditions with prolactin deficiency. Prolactin in one study, men that used the sauna, they were in the sauna for an 80 degrees Celsius sauna until they felt exhausted. They had a tenfold increase in prolactin levels. In another study, women who did a 20 minute dry sauna twice a week had a 510% increase in prolactin levels after each sauna session. Similar to growth hormone, prolactin levels lasted for a couple of hours. There are some other lifestyle factors in addition to sauna use, potentially even hot baths, again, something that is going to elevate core body temperature. Exercise is one, so exercise can also increase both growth hormone and prolactin. I don't know the exact quantitative numbers and how much, but they also do increase it. And then sexual activities in another one that also increases in prolactin. The effects of growth hormone and prolactin also affect slow wave deep sleep. The idea is that doing these activities a couple of hours. You want to make sure you're not doing it again right before bed because you want to allow your body time to cool down. If you're getting the sauna literally like right before bed, you might still be really hot and you won't cool down unless you then perhaps get into a cold plunder or do a cold shower to cool down. But doing it like a couple of hours before bed time seems like a good time. It's typically when I do my hot tubs. I do a lot of hot tubs in the evening and I do a couple of hours before I go to bed. So that's all I think super interesting stuff that we haven't talked about before. Heating activates warm sensitive neurons in the hypotheralamus that promote slow wave activity in response to increase core body temperature and skin temperature. Yet again, another potential mechanism behind why sauna use, why hot baths and even exercise which elevates core body temperature may promote slow wave deep sleep and then exercise combined with body cooling and warm baths combined with body cooling also may help again to promote slow wave activity in deep sleep. There are a variety of sauna and hot tub or hot bath protocols that could be derived from the scientific literature on sauna use in longevity and potential effects on sleep. An example of a sauna protocol could be 20 minutes in a at least 176 degree Fahrenheit sauna, at least one to two hours before bed, allowing the body enough time to cool down before sleep. That may vary in terms of the time it takes someone to cool down before sleep. But what if you don't have a sauna or even a thermometer? An example of a hot tub or a hot bath protocol would be a temperature of around 104 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes with as much of the body from shoulders down submerged as possible. For hot baths you may need to add more hot water throughout to keep the water temperature at around 104 so in that case the thermometer may be helpful to monitor the temperature. For me personally I have a pretty good sense of how hot I feel when I'm in the sauna for 20 minutes so by knowing that I can also make an approximation with how I feel in a hot bath. So again timing may be important by allowing the body enough time to cool down ideally a couple hours before sleep. Some of you may enjoy a cool shower afterwards which may also help cool the body down. To tie this all together pass a body heating whether through a hot bath or a hot tub or a sauna or through physical activity may be a really useful way to improve sleep quality especially slow wave sleep. Rather than being a substitute for good sleep hygiene it potentially adds a whole new dimension to it.

So people that had a high omega 3 index, but smoked, had the same life expectancy as people that didn't smoke, but had a low omega 3 index. So essentially, if you just look at this data along, smoking with like having a low omega 3 index. If you could pill up what you can do with vigorous exercise, then I think that is like right now, the best longevity drug we have for delaying the aging process and improving health span and improving lifespan. Good morning. Nice to be here today. I was just mentioning that my son eats about two cups of pomegranate a day, so his year will live in A. Levels must be off the charts, and maybe he'll live to be honored. But probably Gene Therapy is gonna be involved in that. At today, we're gonna be talking about some of the, what I think are powerful lifestyle habits that can affect the way you age. So there's some what I call low hanging fruit, so these are things that I think are really easy. It can be as simple as a dietary modification or a supplement you take. And then there's some things that are a little more effortful, which require effort. And so that would of course be exercise and so we're gonna get into that as well. So the first part of the talk, we're gonna just talk about optimizing micronutrient deficiencies and in the second part, we're gonna be talking about what kind of exercise and how it affects the way we age on a molecular level as well. So first up, I think there's really three main micronutrient deficiencies that I wanna talk about for a couple of reasons, one because they're widespread prevalence in terms of either deficiency or inadequacy. And two because I think they played a very important role in a lot of physiological processes and our body and that affect the way we age. So first we're gonna talk about vitamin D. And most of you guys probably have already heard enough about vitamin D, but it's important to talk about because it's more than a vitamin. So vitamin D gets converted into a steroid hormone and it goes into the nucleus of cells and interacts with DNA. So it recognizes a very specific sequence of DNA called the vitamin D response element. And this is encoded in our DNA. And that interaction then either turns genes on and activates them or it does the opposite is sort of turns them down and represses them. So it's very important for orchestrating, I mean we're talking about over 5% of the protein encoding human genome is regulated by vitamin D, which is quite a lot. And so you can imagine if you're running a car and your pistons are firing out of sync with each other. I mean that's kind of what's happening when you don't have adequate levels of vitamin D, your genes aren't being regulated in the way they're supposed to be. So things aren't being activated when they're supposed to be or repressed when they're supposed to be. So things are kind of going awry. And as I mentioned about it, it's widespread prevalence in terms of inadequacy. So about 70% of the population has inadequate levels of vitamin D, which we'll talk about in a minute. It's about 30 nanograms per milliliter or less. And it's a very simple solution. And that's also why I like to talk about it because it's almost just as simple as taking a basically a supplement that costs a penny up hill. Vitamin D supplements are one of the most affordable supplements out there. And there's really just no reason other than lack of education about vitamin D. For people to be so deficient and insufficient. A lot of reasons for the widespread deficiency, we make vitamin D three in our skin. So UVB radiation is essential to make vitamin D three. Anything that blocks out UVB radiation is going to stop that production of vitamin D. So we're talking sunscreen melanin, which is the dark skin pigmentation that protects us from the burning rays of the sun. Also is a natural sunscreen. So that is also a form of sunscreen. Also depending on where you live. So in northern latitude, UVB radiation can't even reach the atmosphere several months out of the year. So when you combine some of these factors, let's say you take someone with darker pigmentation from, let's say, East Asia. And they move somewhere like Chicago or they move to Sweden, where six months out of the year, you're not even getting that UVB radiation. You're talking about just a compounding effect on vitamin D deficiency because there've been studies out of the University of Chicago that have shown that, for example, African Americans have to stay in the sun anywhere between six to 10 times longer than Caucasians with air skin to make the same amount of vitamin D three in their skin. So it's a compounding effect with respect to the melanin production as well. And then age plays a role. So as we age, everything is less efficient. So a seven-year-old makes about, I think it's four times less vitamin D three in their skin, then they're four and we're 20-year-old self. So then of course, modern day societies that we have were inside indoors, were at our computers, were in our cubicles, were technology. We're not an agricultural society, we're not outside as much as we used to be. And so vitamin D is just not being made in our skins like it was a hundred years ago. So there's a lot of reasons why it's widespread. I like to show this slide. It was the study published several years ago, it was 2009. And it's showing when you knock out the vitamin D receptor in mice that it affects the way they age. So the top of the panel, you can see that both mice that wild type and then the vitamin D receptor knock out, sort of aging the same. And then four months later, the vitamin D receptor mouse is just it's a accelerated aging model. And yeah, it looks terrible. But like the organs and every level of things were sort of accelerated in the way they were aging. So it's just kind of a nice visual to see. But of course, we're not mice. And I've always often wondered why mice even need vitamin D because they're nocturnal. And it's just one of those things where it's like, I don't know how much of that actually translates to humans. So let's talk about some human studies. We know that there's a lot of data out there, observational data that's correlated vitamin D levels to low vitamin D levels to higher all cause mortality risk, higher cancer mortality. But there's always that question of healthy user bias, maybe people with higher vitamin D are outside and more physically active. And of course, you try to correct for as many confounding factors as possible, you never really can establish causation. That's where a Mendelian randomization comes into play. So this is we have a variety of genes that are responsible for converting vitamin D3 into 25 hydroxy vitamin D, which is the most active circulating form of vitamin D, and then subsequently into the steroid hormone, which is 125 hydroxy vitamin D. Some of these genes that make enzymes, we all are different. And so some people have ones that don't do it as efficiently. And so Mendelian randomization takes these genes, these single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes, and says, OK, we're going to randomize them. People that have these genes that we know make them basically have lower levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin D, and see what they're correlate that to health outcomes, like all cause mortality. So it's kind of in a way randomizing people. And people that have genetically low vitamin D levels, independent of what their lifestyle is. They have a much higher all cause mortality. They have a higher cancer related mortality, and they have a higher respiratory disease mortality, and with very little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality. And there's also been, with randomized control trials, obviously you're not going to have a lifelong randomized control trial looking at mortality, but there's, you know, there's other biomarkers that can be looked at. One is epigenetic aging, which I'm sure you've heard about yesterday. So one study that took people that were vitamin D deficient, and that's important to start out with a cohort of participants that are deficient, right? Because if you already have someone that's sufficient, giving them a vitamin D supplement really shouldn't do much because they're already at a sufficient level. So these were African-American individuals that were also overweight, and so they were very vitamin D deficient. They were given a vitamin D supplement with 4,000 I use a vitamin D a day, and it decreased their epigenetic age by almost two years. So the question is what is deficiency in sefficiency, adequacy? So technically it's kind of, I would say, depending on what institute you're looking at, but the endocrinology institute defines deficiency as 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels less than 20 nanograms per mill. Sefficiency is about 30 getting, you know, so if you're insufficient, you're less than 30, but if you're sufficient, you're lower than 30. And it seems as though the sweet spot for vitamin D is between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter. And there's all cause mortality, so it's also looking at vitamin D levels. There's meta-analysis of these ranging from 1960s all the way to the mid, like 2015. And it's really, it seems like 40 to 60 is a really good sweet spot for the lowest all cause mortality with vitamin D. As I mentioned, I mentioned 4,000 I used a vitamin D a day, because that's the tolerable upper intake for vitamin D. So it's quite safe. And in general, 1,000 I use a vitamin D, generally raises people's blood levels by about five nanograms per mill. So the key is to get a vitamin D blood test, do it after you're supplementing, make sure your levels are adequate, because again, a lot of these single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that affect our enzymes that are metabolizing vitamin D also affect how we respond to supplemental vitamin D. And some people can require a much higher dose than other people. So really, the key here is blood test and measuring. You don't know what you don't measure, right? So the next micronutrient I want to shift gears and talk about is magnesium. And this again, it's widespread in adequacy here about half the US population has inadequate levels of magnesium. So magnesium is found at the center of a chlorophyll molecule. So plants, you know, chlorophyll gifts plants to a green color. So dark leafy greens are a really good source of magnesium and essentially, people are needing enough greens, which is why half the country doesn't have adequate levels of magnesium. And magnesium is a co-factor for over 300 different enzymes in the body, a lot of metabolic processes. So it's important for the production of energy in the form of ATP. It's important for the utilization of energy in the form of ATP. But it's also important for repairing DNA damage. So DNA repair enzymes require magnesium to function. And this is where I think the aging, its role in aging comes into play because DNA damage is something that's happening every day. It's happening right now and all of us, as you know, are metabolizing food, was we're breathing in oxygen, immune system, slightly activated, whatever. It's constantly happening and our bodies are repairing that damage. But it's an insidious type of damage, right? It's not something that you can just wake up and look in the mirror and see, right? You're not, you're, you're, you're scurvy is like, okay, my guns are bleeding and things something's wrong. You can see that, right? DNA damage isn't something that you really think about on a daily basis, but it's happening. And it accumulates with age. So you want to be able to repair that damage effectively, right? For many reasons, so DNA damage can lead eventually over the course of several decades to oncogenic mutations that could lead to cancer. And so there've been actually a variety of studies that have looked and correlated magnesium levels, magnesium intake with cancer mortality. So there was one study that found for every 100 milligrams of magnesium intake. There was a 24% decrease in pancreatic cancer risk. And also another study that found that people that had the highest levels of magnesium, they were in the top quintile, had a 40% lower all cause mortality compared to people in the lowest. And then they had a 50% decrease in cancer mortality compared to people in the lowest. So magnesium is one of those but again, I think it's best to try to get it from dietary sources, dark leafy greens or a great source. But also supplemental forms of magnesium, I think is a great sort of insurance, sort of speak. So magnesium glycinate, magnesium malate, magnesium's the truth. These are all pretty bio-available forms of magnesium. The requirements for magnesium depend on age gender. So men require a little bit more than women. It's somewhere like 400 milligrams a day for men somewhere like 300 to 350 or something like that for women. If you're athletic, if you're sweating, if you're physically active a lot, use the sauna, you actually can require anywhere between 10 to 20% above the RGA, because you do lose magnesium through sweat. So if half the U.S. population isn't meaning even that RGA, then you can imagine the physically active people are probably fair and even worse because they're their requirements are even higher. So it's a simple dietary modification supplement. You can take to help get your magnesium levels higher. So omega 3 is the last micronutrient that I want to cover before getting into the next part of my talk. And omega 3, there's three forms of it. So there's ALA, which is found in plant forms, like black seed, walnuts. There's EPA and DHA, which are marine sources to their found in seafood. And there's a study on a Harvard that was published gosh, it was like 2009. And this study identified the top six preventable causes of death. So these are things that are lifestyle related. So hypertension, for example, smoking, like not having avoiding hypertension, avoiding smoking, those were some of the top six preventable causes of death. Well omega 3, not getting an F omega 3 from seafood. So this was the marine source of omega 3, EPA and DHA, was in that top six. And researchers from Harvard had identified that not getting an F omega 3 from seafood was responsible for about 84,000 deaths a year. And that was compared to a trans fat. So trans fats were also consuming trans fats were one of the top avoidable causes of death. Well, eating trans fats were responsible for 82,000 deaths for year, pretty much the same as not getting enough omega 3 from seafood. And what's funny is that everybody knows about trans fats. You walk into any supermarket, any grocery store, everything's marketed. Oh, zero trans fats, zero trans fats. But nobody's thinking about they're not getting enough omega 3. They're not eating enough seafood or fish or taking micro algae or fish oil supplement to get omega 3. And so I just kind of like to highlight that because it's, again, I think that the way thinking about food in that, what do we need to feed our body, our metabolism? We need co-factors, magnesium, vitamin D, omega 3. These are things if we focus on what we need to consume, we don't end up eating all the other stuff. And so people sort of get fixed and want to avoid and don't think about what they're actually supposed to be taking in, what they're supposed to be eating. So the omega 3 index is one of the best measures of omega 3. So this was pioneered by Dr. Bill Harris and his calling von Schackie many years ago back in 2004. And it's measuring omega 3 levels in red blood cell membranes as opposed to plasma phospholibates. And the reason for that is because it is a long term biomarker of omega 3. So your red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over whereas your plasma phospholibates, it's more like, if you get your omega 3 levels measured and it's plasma phospholipates, it's more like, what did I eat the past week or something like that? So it's kind of a comparison is fasting blood glucose would be the immediate biomarker. And then the HPA1C is your long term, blood glucose level. So it's sort of similar here. So omega 3 index is a really important way to measure omega 3. And it's now being increasingly used in many scientific studies. Of course, many, I think a lot of conflicting data out there also has to do with the fact that plasma phospholibates were measured. And again, it goes down to this, well, was it just that they didn't eat omega 3 in the last week or they did. And so we're saying they have high omega 3 because of that just recent dietary choice. Omega 3 index was, this is again from Bill Harris's group, he found him and his colleagues found that, people with a high omega 3 index, which is defined as 8%, at least 8%. Had a 90% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death, compared to people with a low omega 3 index of 4%. The standard in the US, the omega 3 index, most people, it's less than 5%. So it's about 4%. So most people in the United States are at a very low omega 3 and they don't even have seafood and fish. You know, so sudden cardiac death was reduced by 90% if you're in that high omega 3 index group. Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the United States and actually most all developed countries, every 33 seconds, someone died of a heart attack. So anything you can do to improve cardiovascular health is really, really on your side in terms of improving health span and improving life span. High omega 3 index also from Bill Harris's group found that people again with an 8% omega 3 index, had a 5 year increase life expectancy, compared to people with a 4% omega 3 index, so that was the low end. And it's interesting because in Japan, their life expectancy on average is about five years longer than in the United States or average life expectancy is five years less here than in Japan. And they happen to have an omega 3 index in general, above 8% whereas again, I mentioned were below 5%. So sort of an interesting sort of observation that also correlates with the increased average life expectancy in a country that eats a lot of seafood. But this is what really I think is almost, it's eye opening. It's part of the same study from Bill Harris's group where they stratified these participants and looked at their omega 3 index and then also looked at their smoking. So they're very, very top curve, the green curve, people live the longest if they had the 8% omega 3 index and they were non-smokers. And the very, very bottom curve, the red one was people that were smokers and had a low omega 3 index 4%. So those, they had the lowest life expectancy. But this is what blows my mind. If you look at the orange and blue curve, they're completely overlaid on top of each other. So people that had a high omega 3 index, but smoked had the same life expectancy as people that didn't smoke, but had a low omega 3 index. So essentially, if you just look at this data along, smoking with like having a low omega 3 index. And then just again, it's one of those things where, of course, it's observational data and you can never really establish causation. But I just feel like that's really eye opening because again, everyone knows smoking is bad for you, but nobody's thinking about how we're not getting an off omega 3. And how easy is it to take a official oil supplement for example, or increase your, you know, salmon intake? So to summarize this part of my talk with respect to micro nutrients, we talked about vitamin D, low hanging fruit, a simple as a supplement, 4,000 I use a day is pretty good start to get most people who are deficient to a sufficient level. That's been shown in several studies, getting people from a deficient level up to a sufficient level can be done with 4,000 I use a vitamin D a day. Omega 3 fatty acids, omega 3 index, getting the omega 3 index test, you want your levels to be in the 8%, you want to be high. And then there's been studies showing that it takes around two grams of supplemental omega 3 to get from a 4% omega 3 index, which you can get to an 8%, really not that hard. And then again, omega 3 is found in prescription form. I didn't go into all the randomized controlled trials today because that would take the remainder of my time here. But you can get omega 3 in purified at the lesser form, either in the form of EPA, only at SEPA or DHA plus EPA, Lovaisa. And those are prescribed in 4 grams a day per dose. And so what I said was sort of conservative, it takes about two grams a day just to get from a 4% on average, 4% omega 3 index and 8% and again, it's just simple as getting the test done and supplementing and then testing again and seeing if you're getting your index up to 8%. And then magnesium, we talked about getting that RDA, hitting it with either increasing or a combination ideally, increasing leafy greens and also taking a supplement, magnesium, glycinate. It's a trait, malay are all pretty bioavailable sources of magnesium. Okay, so we're gonna shift gears and we're gonna get into the effortful part of this presentation this talk. This requires putting in the work, right? This isn't as simple as taking a pill, but at the very least, I think that taking the pill is easier for a lot of people. But then there's the, of course, the people that want to go this step further and they're willing to put in the effort. So let's talk about that. We're gonna talk about why I'm convinced that vigorous exercise is the most powerful longevity drug that you're gonna get. More than met foreman, more than, back on my ass and more than any of those things. If you could pill up what you can do with vigorous exercise, then I think that is like right now, the best longevity drug we have for delaying the aging process and improving health span and improving life span. So when I say vigorous exercise, what do I mean? Generally speaking, of course, there's a sliding scale here because you can take someone who's completely centenary and never really done any aerobic exercise. vigorous exercise for them is gonna be probably more what light to modern exercises for people that are physically active. But generally speaking, once you kind of adapt and get used to being physically active, vigorous exercise is about getting to 80% of your max heart rate or estimated max heart rate. That's really what I'm talking about, 75% to 80% of your maximum heart rate. So cardiovascular respiratory fitness, this is one of the best biomarkers for longevity in my opinion. So cardiovascular respiratory fitness is measured empirically by VO2 max. So that's the maximal amount of oxygen that you can take up during maximal exercise. So when I use VO2 max, sometimes these are like interchangeable cardiovascular respiratory fitness, VO2 max, I kind of use them interchangeably in this talk. But VO2 max is just directly measuring cardiovascular respiratory fitness. So cardiovascular respiratory fitness is associated with improved longevity. It does improve longevity. And the biggest improvements you're gonna get is if you're going from low normal, so for your age group, for your gender, if you're low normal and going anywhere above that is where you get the biggest bang for your buck. So people that have a low normal VO2 max, if they just go up to a, if they're below, sorry, if they're below normal, and they go up to just low normal, they get about a 2.1 increased life expectancy. If they're below normal and they go up to high normal, they get almost a three year increased life expectancy. And then if they go from below normal to the upper amount of normal, so this is the top 5% of the population. This is more like you're getting into the elite athlete level. That's associated with almost a five year increase in life expectancy. So just to give you some perspective here, about half of the U.S. population is, they have a low normal cardiovascular respiratory fitness, and the other half has about a high normal cardiovascular respiratory fitness. So again, you're just mostly having to do with being physically active or not, because being physically active. And on average, for every unit, increase in VO2 max, it's associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy. And there was a really important study published in JAMA back in 2018 that I just liked to mention because it kind of established that there was no upper limit to the mortality reduction of having a high cardiovascular respiratory fitness. I mean, obviously with any human normal human life expectancy ranges, right? So people that were in the bottom 25% of cardiovascular respiratory fitness, or their VO2 max. And also, I like these studies because they're measuring something empirically. I'm talking about VO2 max, right? This is a fitness test that's done. It's measured. It's empirical. Versus a lot of studies in conflicting data out there where you have these questionnaires. How physically active are you? And you see, think about your last week or a month. And then that's like you extrapolated out and you go, OK, well, based on this last week, this is how physically active we think this person is over the, you know, their lifetime or whatever. And I just, it's not a very, you know, it's all we have in some respects, but if you can measure something empirically, it's going to really help clear up a lot of the confounding and a lot of the conflicting data that you see out there. So I really like studies that measure VO2 max because it's something that's actual, it actually empirical rather than going off the questionnaire, right? With, that's, it does have all sorts of problems. So going from the low bottom 25% of VO2 max up to the elite level, so that you're talking about the top 2.3% I mean, the cities are the elite athletes. That's associated with an 80% reduction in all cause mortality. So comparing those two groups, people in the low 25% group versus the elite level. But even going from the high cardiovascular fitness, so this is a top 25% of the population. They're good. These are people that are, they're committed exercises, they're really, they're physically active. They, if they go up to the elite level, they get it, you know, even 20% more reduction in all cause mortality. So if you compare the elite to the high cardiovascular fitness, you're still, you're still getting a 20% lower all cause mortality by just moving up to that elite level. And what was really interesting about this study was that being in that low 25% group that they're in the bottom 25% for VO2 max, that was comparable to either the same risk or greater risk than for mortality, early mortality as type 2 diabetes as smoking and as having heart disease. So again, putting that into perspective, we all think about these diseases and how they're, you know, increasing our early mortality risk, but just not having a good cardiovascular respiratory fitness can do the same thing. So how do you improve your VO2 max? How do you improve your cardiovascular fitness? Well, any exercise, any aerobic exercise is, obviously, going to be good for small changes in cardiovascular respiratory fitness. But in particular, there have been meta analysis that I found that vigorous intensity exercises, as I mentioned, and particularly high intensity interval training, which we're going to talk about. So this is where you're doing sort of short bursts of, you know, very vigorous exercise, you're at least at 80% max heart rate, sometimes going even above that, and then having rest periods and doing those intervals. And why that's important is because they've been some studies that have found that even people that are meeting the guidelines for moderate aerobic exercise, so they're doing two and a half hours of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week. Do not, about 40% of those people do not respond. In other words, they do not get VO2 max improvements. They are not improving their cardiovascular fitness by doing two and a half hours of moderate intensity exercise every week. And it's not really known why exactly there's these non-responder effect, but that's large percent of the population. However, when those people do more of a high intensity interval training workout, they do more vigorous exercise, they start to respond and improve their VO2 max. And it's thought because, you know, VO2 max, cardiovascular respiratory fitness, to get those changes, to get those improvements, you really have to increase cardiac output. So the stronger the more intense the adaptations or greater, so your body responds by improving the delivery of oxygen tier tissues. So that's essentially what you're wanting to improve your cardiovascular's pre-finness. And so that's, it's kind of thought why vigorous intensity and particularly high intensity will training is so important for improving cardiovascular's pre-finness. And one of the, there's been several studies looking at this, and for example, Dr. Martin DeBal, Gabala, out of McMaster University, over non-Tario Canada, has then a lot of studies looking at different high intensity interval training protocols. And it really seems if you're really wanting to improve that cardiovascular's pre-finness that you have to do longer intervals. So three to five minute intervals of just the maximum intensity that you can maintain for that three to five minutes. And so a really good and well-studied a lot of evidence on the Norwegian 4x4 protocol. So this is four minutes of the highest intensity that you can do, and then it's three minutes recovery. So you're really going down to like light, light exercise. You want your heart rate to go down. You want to sort of really give yourself some rest so that you can do it again. So you repeat this four times. That's why it's called 4x4. And this is one of the best protocols for improving VO2 Max. If you don't want to go into a lab to get your VO2 Max measured or you don't have access to it for whatever reason, one of the best evidence-based ways of measuring VO2 Max at home, so to speak, not necessarily home, is what's called the 12 minute run test or walk test depending on your fitness level. Essentially you need some sort of wearable device that can track your distance. So Apple Watch, your Fitbit, whatever. And you need to have a flat surface that you can run on. So like a track field. And you want to run for 12 minutes or walk depending on your fitness level. The maximum intensity that you can maintain for that 12 minutes. And basically your distance is going to be covered. And then you look up this equation and it converts your VO2 Max based on that distance. And the reason you don't want hills and stuff is because that'll make you run the distance will be less. So you want to make sure you're giving yourself a flat surface so that you actually are more accurate in terms of what your distance is during that 12 minute run test. This study out of UT Southwest in Dallas by Dr. Ben Levine is really what has convinced me that vigorous exercise is extremely important for the heart and the way the heart ages. So I mentioned cardiovascular disease. I mean, that's the number one killer in developed countries, right? So as we age, our heart undergoes certain in and out of old changes. It gets smaller, it shrinks, it gets stiffer, less flexible. And this affects a lot of things that affects our cardiovascular disease risk. It affects our cardiovascular risk and the ability for us to do aerobic exercise. And so what Ben did in the study, Dr. Levine did in the study was really remarkable. He took a cohort of participants that were 50 years old on average. And these were sedentary individuals that were otherwise healthy. So they didn't have any peptid IVs, hypertension, et cetera. They were quantum-point healthy, but they were sedentary. And he separated them into two groups. So the first group was the control group who did sort of stretching and yoga for two years. And then the second group was the exercise intervention group. So these were the people that were going to be doing the exercise and ended up being a bigger exercise protocol. But because their recentaries started out sort of lower to moderate intensity. And by the time it was six months, these individuals were doing five to six hours a week of aerobic exercise with a large percentage of that time being in what's called the maximal steady state. So that's what I'm talking about when you're going as hard as you can. And you maintain that for about 20 or 30 minutes. So it's usually around 75, 80% max heart rate. And you're doing that for about 20 or 30 minutes. They also did the Norwegian IV by for a protocol once a week. And after two years, they essentially reverse these structural changes in their aging heart by like 20 years. So their hearts were essentially looking more like a 30 year old heart after that two years of vigorous intensity exercise. Now like I mentioned, they were doing five to six hours a week of vigorous, a large portion of it in vigorous, vigorous exercise. But it's simply astonishing the structural changes that they found. So there was more than 25% improvement in the elasticity of the heart. After those two years, particularly in the left for ventricular muscle of the heart. Of course, they did increase their VO2 max by about 20% as well. So it's just quite a stand that you can take a 50 year old. Put them on a pretty intense exercise program for two years. And essentially reverse a lot of the structural changes that happen with the heart, with the aging process. Blood pressure improvements are also, you know, for people that are willing to put in the effort most of the time, and there's always non-responders. But they can have drug-sized effects, in other words, they can be comparable to some drugs that are given to reduce hypertension. So there's been an analysis of 24 different randomized controlled trials found that six weeks of a pretty, you know, moderate to vigorous intensity exercise, 20 to 60 minutes of that three to four days a week. Like had almost drug-sized effects in reducing blood pressure. So, you know, high-pretension is not only a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It's also a very, very important risk factor for dementia. And also, risk disease. So there's every reason to want to not have hypertension. And 20% of young people aged, you know, 18 to 39 have hypertension. And then half the, you know, about half the US population, you know, older adults have hypertension. So it's a very common, you know, thing that, again, can be modified to a quite a bit of an extent where aerobic exercise, particularly vigorous intensity exercise. Let's talk a little bit about on the molecular level. Why I'm talking about vigorous exercise and really that 80% max heart rate. It has to do with the fact that you are pushing, when you push your muscles to work harder, then the oxygen can get to them to make energy. They shift from using mitochondria and using oxygen for energy, using glucose through glycolysis. And it's a quick process that doesn't require oxygen. It makes lactate as a lip product. Only it's not a lip product. We often thought about it as a metabolic product, but it's so much more than that. So lactate generated from muscles is what, it's an extra kind, it's a myocine, and it's a signaling molecule. It gets into circulation, and it is consumed by the brain. It's consumed by the heart, by the liver, also by the muscle. It's consumed as a very easily utilized a resource of energy, but also as a signaling molecule, as we'll talk about. And this is called the lactate shuttle. It was pioneered by Dr. George Brooks at O'Reilly UC Berkeley. And when I say it's signaling molecule, it's a way for your muscles to directly communicate with other parts of the body like the brain. And so lactated self has been shown to be responsible for increasing brain-drivenerotropic factor. Both in the plasma, this is in human studies, humans that exercise lactate correlates with the BDNF activation plasma, BDNF, can cross over the blood brain barrier, but also animal studies showing that it directly increases brain-drivenerotropic factor in the brain. So BDNF is a very important neuro-trivic factor. It's responsible for neuroplasticity, so that's the ability of your brain, your neurons, and your brain to adapt to changing environment. And it's very important during the aging process. As things are changing and stuff, you want your brain to adapt to those changes. It's also important for depression. People with depression don't often adapt to changing environment, and it is partly responsible for some of the depressive symptoms. But if a brain-drivenerotropic factor also is important for neurogenesis, the increase of neurons, particularly in some brain regions, like the hippocampus, which is involved in learning, and memory, it helps existing neurons survive. There have been animal studies that have shown that when you induce them to do exercise, and they get those learning and memory improvements, that have also been found in human studies, that if you give them a drug and block brain-drivenerotropic factor, they don't get those learning and memory benefits. So really, it seems as though brain-drivenerotropic factor is important to get those learning and memory benefits from exercise. And again, lactate is a key signaling molecule that increases brain-drivenerotropic factor. Lactate is generated from your exercising muscles when you're forcing them to work hard. If this isn't just going on a brisk walk, this is really getting your heart rate up, sweating, getting flush in the face. Lactate is also a signaling molecule to increase neurotransmitters in the brain. This has been shown in both human studies and animal studies. So it's important for the production of serotonin. So studies have found that people that exercise produce a lot of lactate, this correlates with an increase in serotonin, which also correlated with improved impulse control. Serotonin plays an important role in many neurological processes, including impulse control, so they're being able to have this inhibitory effect, which also plays a role in focus and attention. Norophenephen is another one that's been shown. So as we're exercising really hard, our muscles are working harder, our heart is working harder, but our brain is also working harder. On the urban human studies out of, I believe, it's a Norway that I found that the lactate produced during vigorous intensity exercise, but crosses the blood brain barrier is consumed by the brain. And this correlates with a burst, a indoor epinephen production, which fuels the brain to work harder during exercise. It's also important for focus and attention in some of those effects that you get after, after you do a vigorous intensity workout. So there's some protocols that have been shown to maximize brain-dereveneratropic factor in humans, and some of these have also correlated with lactate levels. It seems as though the best is getting, getting the best of both the world. So you want vigorous intensity about 80% max heart rate, but you also want duration. So you want to get like 30 to 40 minutes of that is the most robust at increasing brain-dreb neuro-traffic factor as measured in plasma on people, but 20 minutes will also increase it as well, just 30 to 40 minutes does it even more. There's also some protocols that are more high-intensity interval training. So doing six rounds of 40 second intervals where you're going as hard as you can for 40 seconds, followed by a recovery period, also really increases brain-dreb neuro-traffic factor. Increases it four to five times more in people compared to individuals that are doing about an hour and a half of more lower intensity cycling at about 25% their VO2 max peak. I want to just shift gears for a minute and talk about some of the anti-cancer effects of vigorous intensity exercise, independent of the immune system. So the immune system exercise activates the immune system as a robust effect on a variety of anti-magnistatic effects there. But just the mechanical force of blood flow actually affects what are called circulating true-reselles. So circulating true-reselles escape from the primary side of the tumor, get into circulation, eventually travel with a distant sites and then they take residents in the established and new tumor elsewhere. So this is some test cases. So circulating true-reselles, you obviously do not want to have them in circulation because they can play role in test cases. While the shearing forces of blood flow, itself can kill the circulating true-reselles because on every cell surface we have a mechanical, we have these mechanical receptors that respond to movement and cancer cells are all wonky and disrupted and messed up. And so they just can't handle that movement and they die. So the more intense the exercise, the more the greater the blood flow, the higher proportion of circulating true-reselles that are actually undergo apoptosis and die. The Vincent studies looking at people that undergo about six months of a robotic exercise anywhere between 50 to 70% max heart rate for 150 minutes a week. That significantly reduces the circulating true-reselles in people with anywhere between stage one to stage three, colon cancer. Other studies have found and correlated that circulating true-reselles are linked to a three times higher risk of cancer recurrence and a four times higher risk of cancer mortality in people with cancer. Also stage three, colon cancer patients that engage in a rubric exercise have a 40% reduction in cancer recurrence and a 63% reduction in cancer mortality. So exercise is also a very important place of very important role in cancer metastasis and also in helping as an adjunct therapy to treating cancer as well. But you don't have to do the 40 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise every day to get benefits. So there's something called exercise snacks. These are very short and where between one to three minutes bursts of intense exercise. You're getting your heart rate up 75, 80, 90% max heart rate. You can be doing anything from jumping jacks to sprinting stairs to high knees, to air squats. There's a lot of ways to do it. And you do it just in a short burst. So it's a really great way to break up the work day. It's also a really great way to improve metabolic health, particularly when you're time it around meals, which we'll talk about in the minute. And the way it does that partly, well, there's a lot of mechanisms that play. But one of them, again, comes back to lactate being generated very cutely from exercising muscle, which then causes glucose transporters on the muscle surface, which translocate to the muscle surface. So these are glute four transporters. These then allow glucose circulating in circulation to them and take it up into muscle. Therefore, improving your blood glucose levels and it also improves insulin sensitivity as well. When they're timed around meal time, anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour, dramatically, has an effect on blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity, the particularly in people with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes. So it's a great way also you just get up, do some high knees for a minute, or jumping jacks or do something that you can do quickly to get that exercise snack in. And another way it's improving metabolic health, I'll just mention briefly, because we're running out of time, is through improving mitochondrial biogenesis, the generation of new healthy young mitochondria. It's been shown to do this in muscle cells. And this is also happening through lactate. Lactate is a signaling molecule, yet again, increasing the expression of a very important protein involved in mitochondrial biogenesis called PGC1 alpha. And so it plays an important role in increasing new mitochondria in muscle. This has been shown in human studies, but also animal studies have found that exercise increases lactate, which crosses the blood brain barrier, gets into the brain, and increases mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus, in neurons, in the hippocampus, so mitochondria in neurons, in the hippocampus or being increased. I don't know why that mechanism wouldn't be conserved in humans. So the fact that it's happening in animals is also encouraging. But exercise snacks are also associated with improved longevity. So I was talking about this sort of deliberate form of exercise snacks, were you doing hi-needs or jumping jacks? Well, there's large studies that have been underway, and I've been published, and there's ongoing studies, looking at vigorous intermittent lifestyle activity. So at the type of exercise snack where you use everyday life situations to get your heart rate up high for a minute or two minutes or three minutes. For example, you have to take the stairs every day to get to work. Once that I'm walking up the stairs, you sprint. So people are wearing these accelerometers. And so their heart rate is being measured, and scientists have been able to gather all the state and they found, a people that have engaged in one to two minutes of vigorous intermittent activity, three times a day, have a 40% reduction in all cause and in cancer mortality, and a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality. This is compared to non-exercisers. Now, also, people that even identify themselves as non-exercisers, so they're doing this in this vigorous stair climbing and stuff, but they don't actually go to the gym, we're taking doing leisure time activity. They still get these improvements. So it's a really great way to break up sedentary time. Sedent being sedentary itself is an independent risk factor for all cause mortality, cancer mortality. So in other words, just periods when we're sitting like now is a risk factor. Even if you're going to go to the gym later today. So breaking up sedentary time is really important. There's a lot of ways to break up your sedentary time. And I think that these exercise snacks are a great way to do it. You just get up and you do high knees for one minute, two minutes, three minutes. And it really kind of wanted to just have everyone do it for 30 seconds if we could do that real quick. I'm the endying right talk. So if you guys could just get up and we're going to do high knees right now. So that is where you do the, you try to get your leg as high as you can. And you do the opposite hand up and then we're going to just do it. We're just doing for 30 seconds, but really try to do it as hard as you can if you're wearing heels, take them off. You ready? Set, go. All right. Get your heart right up. You really want to get your heart right up. They're going fast. Now remember, we're doing 30 seconds. And I said one, two minutes. You're doing this. You're actually going to retire. You're probably like, oh my gosh, is this not up yet? All right, we're only going to do 30 seconds because of time. All right, time. But as you can see, it works, right? So maybe maybe we get a little more brain generator, try to, no, neurochopic factor, a little more attentive for the next talk. And I just want to close by saying, yeah, we've talked a lot about vigorous intensity exercise. But the reality is that any exercise you can do to form a habit to that you can do in a daily basis. If it's not vigorous intensity, any kind of exercise is beneficial. So keep that in mind. I was kind of going for the top here, like you want to reach for the stars. But really what you want to do is the form a habit. So that's the most important thing. With that said, we talked about a lot today. I think I've covered a lot of the summaries, avoiding micro nutrient insufficiency, addressing the lack of vigorous intensity exercise. But again, forming that habit, do what you can do. I think I've been, you guys a lot of tools here to measure things, try to implement some Norwegian 4x4, which is gribrittle, or just two extra sites next. You guys, tell the next, speak your, you know, in a couple of hours. We got to get up and get our blood flow higher, hurry it up, and with that. Thank you so much for listening today. I hope you guys learned something.

There's an array of things that are supported critically by testosterone. I often hear from many people about testosterone levels being lower now and men than they ever ever been. Is there a trend downwards? I would say yes. What are some of the major contributors? Pollution, I think, is a big factor to be chronically dealing with a toxic environment will inhibit broad systems. If their libido is totally down, they're having a harder time losing fat, gain also losing fat. It could come down to this, right? Balling integrity. Balling integrity, right. So your top four supplements for testosterone would be zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, not in order, just the top three, I would say, and then who should consider home on replacement therapy? In general, I think. I'm sitting here with Derek from more plates and more dates. You may know him from his very large YouTube channel, where he talks about all sorts of things. Hormones, exercise, training, I became sort of aware of your work because you're on our mutual friends, podcast, Peter, Tia, a couple of times. Super interested in your own personal experience, but you also run a company that's a preventative health company that helps people optimize their hormones among other things. And so I'm excited to have a conversation with you. You've got a lot of this experience, personal experience, but also experience just running this company where people are coming to your company to help optimize their hormones. And so it's a little bit of a different episode here. As you guys know, I cite everything on the podcast, and so I'm excited to kind of dive in and talk about all things hormones with you, Derek. So thanks for coming on the show. Is it ever me? I really appreciate the invite. I'd love to kind of start. I want to talk about testosterone, as you know, kind of discuss this earlier. You're a very knowledgeable in this area. In fact, we had a conversation, and I was asking you some questions, and your knowledge was very impressive in terms of the scope and depth. That's how you do. All things testosterone kind of just wanted to start with the role of testosterone and men. I mean, it's obviously fundamental for male health, but I'd love if you could kind of just outline some of the primary functions of testosterone and men. Yeah, I think at a basic level, it is the primary animal, a hormone, men rely on for the sustainment or growth of muscle tissue, bone health, bone integrity, inhibiting degradation, indirectly through some of those pathways as well, insulin sensitivity. If you have worse and body composition, it becomes a more difficult to handle glucose adequately. Neurological health, through the rheumatization, in the actual tissues themselves, there's an array of things that are supported critically by testosterone, and it's in the brain. Critically, by testosterone, and it's indirect metabolite activity, as well through its aromatization to estrogen, and I guess notably, but often overlooked, it's easy to forget, but in adolescence, the five-alpha reduction to DHT, so the conversion to testosterone to DHT is necessary for full maturation, sexual differentiation, to basically reach full adult male maturity. And there's a, I'm hearing out of examples, where if DHT is either to low via genetic predispositions or through different means, then there is inhibited maturation, and that's where you get into some of these more unique intersex cases, but essentially at a base level, this is the primary male, all-but significantly impactful in females as well, hormone that is present at about 10x, the concentrations in males and kind of differentiates them in terms of sexual identity and male characteristics. I do, we are gonna focus a lot on the role of testosterone and males and men, but I do kind of just briefly, before we will eventually talk about females and women, but what is the major role of testosterone and women? I mean, women obviously don't make as much as men, but they do make testosterone, and it does play a functional role. Yeah, yeah, and it's a non-exhausted list that I just presented, like the list extends beyond into a retropoasis, the production of red blood cells, intratistic, alert testosterone production, absolutely critical for fertility as well. And women, all but not directly analogous, intra-gonataly, but elsewhere in the body, the activity of testosterone is still necessary for a lot of the same things, cognitive health, some level of cardiovascular support, bone integrity, as anabolic activity and muscle tissue, all of the same stuff is still the case in women just to a much lower magnitude. So, but as you would expect, there's less of a concentration required to sustain a female muscular turt that amale, so the concentration differential is about 10x, in women the main function of testosterone, still overlaps with males, but intra-gonataly is more to facilitate as a substrate of estrogen production. So, getting that sufficient amount of a romanticization into a astrodial, but also the conversion into estron, which then turns into estronial as well, to facilitate all of the female fertility facilitated processes. So, given the role of testosterone in all these important physiological processes that you just described everything from muscle health, bone health, neurological health, red cell production, et cetera, what about trade-offs of testosterone? And I mentioned this because of my interest in longevity, my long interest in life expectancy and looking at life expectancy between men and women, and you really see amongst, like, pretty much all mammal species that the females outlive the males. Obviously, there's a lot of differences going on there, but testosterone is something that does differentiate. There's a big difference between the levels of testosterone between males and females. So, I'm kind of curious, I know you think about a lot of these things, and some curious what your thoughts are with respect to the trade-offs of testosterone, with respect to longevity. I think it would be highly speculative because obviously I would love to just point to some clear literature that says, based on these studies on, you know, inhibiting IGF1 or having really low, androgen levels equals lower body weights, equals longer lifespan, or something, so that effect that could be a common kind of denominator, but it's not as cut in dry. I do think there is some level of metabolic resource demand that is needed to actually support the infrastructure of a male that is more intensive than a female, so I would, in general, like larger humans are gonna die quicker than smaller ones, at least from an I've seen trendwise, and in supporting that, it is something that requires more hormone production in general, which is also more intensive on all organ systems, accordingly, to actually facilitate and get that hormone production to the level that needs to sustain that larger human. So that's a highly speculative take on it, but that would be part of the reason, but at a high level if you want to extrapolate to, you know, at higher levels, androgen to will be neurotoxic and a dose-dependent manner past super levels. It will cause cardiac remodeling in a negative manner, like all of the dyslipidemia, all of the negatives that you would hear about when it comes to animal exteroid use, to some extent at super levels are going to be present from testosterone, all but to a more muted extent, because it's not a synthetic derogeth that is manipulated and allowed to create, you know, something that is not a substrate for a romanticization, and some of the other stuff that is protective, but that's a high level speculative take. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a loaded question, because there's probably a lot of factors that play here in terms of like the differences in life expectancy between males and females, and you're pointing out the size difference is one, one, you know, maybe it's the lack of estrogen, right, not the presence of testosterone, but lack of estrogen obviously men make estrogen, but not to the same degree as women, premenopausal women, but have you looked at any of that literature, are you aware of it, the like the male castraughty, like so the men that are like, the castrate are like, they are osteoporotic as a consequence of a lack of sufficient to romanticization into estrogen, and their growth plates, the epiphysial growth plates don't close fully because of that lack of a romanticization in adolescents, which is facilitated essentially entirely by testosterone as a substrate, similar to what it is in women, but if you castrate a male and adolescents, and you know, while your has in particular testosterone production, he is now functioning off of solely adrenal production, which is like a drop in the bucket to what you actually need the function at a high level, like you're not gonna have sufficient bone development, and you are going to suffer from osteoporosis inevitably. And if those who don't know what the kastrotic are actually interesting, so it's individuals who were head and jelly singing voices, and I'm not sure where the last, who the last documented one was, but it was actually more recent than many would probably think. It's like, within the last 100 to 200 years. But anyways, you get listened to them on YouTube singing, and some of these old audios that were recorded. And it's, you know, a youthful and jelly singing voice that comes across as somewhat and like, androgynous to some extent, and obviously going through male puberty and being subjected to male amounts of testosterone and DHT, like quote unquote, wreck that voice because it's going to be masculinized and get like fully, you know, the deepening that would happen, that's irreversible. So the kastrotic were individuals that were castrated in order to prevent them literally, from going through puberty adequately. So they would actually grow into men without the full maturation that would come from Andrews and Exposure and Adolescent, and as a result, you know, they would have a lack of adequate sexual differentiation maturation, and their bones would reflect that as well via the osteoporotic outcomes they underwent. Did you happen to see that their life expectancy was increased, though? Yeah. So I mean, it's like you're living longer, but not necessarily the quality of life is not. Notably, though, their estrogen levels are in the ground. So you say a second ago about the estrogen. Right. So maybe it's interesting, like, what is it? Well, it's definitely a lower capacity to build muscle and bone, which is less resource intensive and you're a smaller human. So maybe as a result, you are literally a walking, I don't know, like shell of a man essentially. So you don't require as much to sustain but your quality of life is dramatically hindered. Right. Yeah. So you live longer, but you don't necessarily want to. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So that was kind of interesting. I just kind of want to get your perspective on that. And so I'd love to kind of dive into an area that I know you have a lot of knowledge. You know, just based off of your company, Mayor Kelly, for you guys really helping people optimize their hormone levels. And so I kind of want to talk a little bit about some of the best practices for measuring testosterone interpreting the results. Could you kind of outline some of the optimal best practices for actually measuring testosterone level? So you know, optimal timing repeated measures, like free testosterone versus bound testosterone or total testosterone, right? Like what's the difference here? What do people, what should they like consider? So total testosterone is the number that most people are familiar with, which reflects the total production that can be detected in your sample of blood that was taken. So floating around how much testosterone is there inclusive of the testosterone bound to binding proteins. So just because it's in your blood, though, it doesn't mean it's biologically active. If it's bound to these binding proteins produced by the liver, it could be either entirely an active or like readily available to be dissociated, but not yet fully active as well. So you have, you know, S-H-B-G is the primary one, sex hormone binding, lobbulin produced by the liver that's acts as a regulator of endrogenicity in the body, which is like how much endrogen exposure systemically you would be exposed to and the body has this kind of regulating mechanism to partly to make sure that, you know, female, stay feminine, male, stay male and regulate which tissues get which hormones when and transported around the body, because these are hydrophobic, like their fat soluble and would not go through the blood to where you want them without some sort of carriers. So they have a hydrophilic vehicle similar to like how cholesterol will get moved around through, you know, apopy particles and whatnot. And these binding proteins, S-H-B-G and L-B-Min comprise the vast majority to sth-Rone. I think S-H-B-G is about 60% of your total T will be bound by S-H-B-G and then like 38% is L-B-Min. And then 2% to 3% roughly depending on how much S-H-B-G produced in some other factors is actually free to sth-Rone. So the free to sth-Rone number is just like freely circulating, not bound to binding proteins and it's like ready and readily available to be used by target tissues, which should it bind to the energy and receptor and cause the transcriptional activity. But in general, the two numbers you care about the most are going to be the total testosterone, which is like total production reflection. So like how much are you actually capable of making, which is important. And a lot of people will just say, just like a year free, because that's like the number of the manners that's what's actually available to use. And that's true, but it still doesn't reflect total production capacity, which is important to assess the viability of the organ, response to the pituitary output, a mirror-head of things. So total testosterone total production, including that bound to binding proteins, influence by liver health, diet, bunch of different factors, free testosterone, about 2% to 3% in an optimally healthy male, typically, that is just freely available to be used. And then as far as measurement, kind of like best practices, typically in the morning is the best testosterone is kind of, it's like a pulse-a-tile secretion fashion. So you would see in a diurnal rhythm chart showing the secretions of testosterone throughout the day, they kind of pulse is out in waves. So you would have like the biggest pulse early in the morning, and then that kind of like goes across abs and flows throughout the day until it reaches its low point later at night. And then as you sleep, it starts to ramp back up again. So typically the best way to assess peak levels would be early in the morning. And ideally you would have not taken certain confounding variable supplements like biotin that can cross detect as you know, estrogen's and whatnot. And typically labs will provide kind of like a guideline of what not to do, but in general the rule of thumb is, you know, going fasted early in the morning, avoid your multivitamin probably if as biotin and in our biotin containing supplements, and biotin to reflect your actual hematology profile correctly, because some people incorrectly think they have a elevated hematocrit level when in reality they're just super dehydrated when they go in because they just got up, rolled out a bed, and are dehydrated from hours of sleeping and not hydrating properly when they wake up and they just roll in and think that, oh, I'm gonna have our attack and then I gotta do night blood now, which might not be the case. So I know that's a mouthful, but early in the morning, and ideally you would get a repeat measurement before you make any sort of, especially before you make any sort of choices on path forward, because you definitely want to get confirmation if you have a low rating or even one that's like mildly concerning, because again, these things can be so variable depending on so many factors that you might have a bullet where it's a snapshot in time of your blood, you see, you know, a 495 total T and you think, well that's not great, it should be close through a thousand, that's what I hear is good, you know, all these podcasts and whatnot. So my friends are at 900, like I only have 495, I should have way more than that, and some people have as early on to software on jogging late, but it happens. There's a lot of clinics that will tell you, like, oh yeah, you can get that up, let's get this up to 900, and that's all they need to, give, you know, to justify to themselves. So yeah, you definitely don't want to go off of one reading, you want to go off of symptoms and repeat measurement to confirm your findings before you even decide what the path forward is for natural interventions and assessment of what is happening at the organ level and at the hypothylamic pituitary level. So you sort of alluded to this, like talking about reference ranges, and I kind of want to get into that, because like, you know, there are these like reference ranges that you see, and I'm just kind of like curious, like how does a man navigate where their testosterone should be, what the reference ranges mean? How do you look at this, you, how does like, how does your company look at this in respect to, with respect to age, with respect to symptoms? Let's say someone's on the lower end of the reference range, but they have no symptoms, or someone's at the higher end of the range, but they have symptoms. Like how does one sort of interpret what their testosterone data shows? And how does the potential for someone who's actually hypogonautal, so people that are actually not making testosterone, right? How does that sort of complicated it? In general, I think it does get convoluted, because people will see a reference range in a sum, and understandably so, like there's a lot of things that people will just say, oh, it's hard at the top of the reference range, because this is where you should be. And in general, it's not a bad recommendation, often for things that modulate quality of life related outcomes. Like you might want to talk about vitamin D, it's like, you know, who should probably be at like 60, even though the low end is like 30, typically if you were at 40, people would be like, you know, trying to bump that up to 50 or 60, with testosterone people think similarly, and justifiably so sometimes, but often what is overlooked is the fact that the actual energy and receptor content, which is like how many energy and receptors you have in like a concentrated area, or also the sensitivity of it, like what kind of transcriptional activity do you get subsequent to binding? Those things all factor into like how much of an impact the energy and has after binding to the receptor. So just because you have a less testosterone than the next guy, it doesn't necessarily even mean that you have less, most of the real potential or less, you know, bone support capacity or less neurological support. Like it's not guaranteed any of these things based on absolute values. It should be a combination of symptoms as well as blood values. But oftentimes too, the blood values should be superseded by symptoms in some cases too, because you'll have some individuals who have in sensitivity at the AR. So it's not just about how sensitive are you and can you get away with a lower testosterone? So guys need higher testosterone to be able to actually function well, and they might otherwise be told, oh, you know, you don't need testosterone. You're told if testosterone is 900, but they might have a super high sex hormone binding globular, and that's gauping it all up, and they have a low-free testosterone, or their actual receptor activity after binding is like subpar or they have a gene mutation that inhibits the actual activity of it. And that's where you enter some of these convoluted cases with like the Olympic box, or like we're not gonna go down that road, but some of these individuals who, like, you know, there's a spectrum of endogenic activity that is influenced not just by the total levels on paper, but it is very much dictated by your actual response to the hormone too. Okay, is that something that's measured readily? Like, can you measure your response to your angiogen receptor activity? Is that something that's not really known? And you kind of have to do some... There are like proxies for it. In general, it's very crude the way they assess if you are one of the individuals on this like spectrum of endogen insensitivity, it's literally like manual assessment, essentially, of like your gonaddle development, which is like kind of, you know, demeaning potentially, if you're somebody who is like, are you obviously insecure about what's happening, and then you're just subjected to some sort of like subjective analysis of like an expert who determines if you've had sufficient enough like male sexual secondary characteristic development. But in general, there are proxies for activity, and you know, if you're somebody who has, like if you look at blood work, for example, some individuals think, oh, the guy with a natural like 1300 total T, that's probably great, that guy is like, an outlier genetic phenom. Oftentimes it's a reflection of some sort of problem. Like they need to produce more to reach adequate activity. So like sometimes the body is screaming at the testy, it's not getting adequate production to do what it needs to do, and it's resulting in you shooting out more than adentroblins to make more testosterone. So typically you will see this reflected in some sort of symptom, either through actual development in adolescence being not adequate or through biomarkers it becomes pretty clear, because there will be other factors that are clearly outlier oddities in blood work when you see somebody who is not responding adequately. What will you mention the Gneta trip ends like what would like the loot and loonizing hormone or follicle stimulating hormone of FSH? What would those kind of look like in the cases where it's kind of like a red flag? I mean, it's like these are very outlier scenarios that I'd be a DVA into where people are like, you know, overshooting to try and meet some sort of physiologic act and maybe like most guys are going to be falling into the bucket of they have low-genetic tropans or low response to it from age related to cline. That's more of like, you know, what most people will find relevant. So I'll start there. In general, the thing you would be looking to first is, okay, like what are your levels, your total and your free levels? Are they, do they look good? Do you have any symptoms? And let's just say you do have symptoms and you're looking at these numbers and they look, you know, okay. At that point, you would be looking, um, the actual output from the pituitary is going to be dictating what the signal to your test uses to actually produce testosterone. So the L8s from the pituitary signals to the light excels to make the intro to stick alerts the testosterone. So is that signal adequate? Is one thing to assess and that has a clinical reference range? Um, but also individuals who are primary hypogonatal, similar to what we talked about when it comes to assessing, you know, when women are hitting menopause, like what kind of would you look to? In men, if you are not responding and producing adequate testosterone at in the testies, like you will be trying to make more loonizing her moment typically to try and push that signal. So it's your body is going to recognize, I'm not getting enough testosterone out of this L8s that I'm making. So the signal isn't sufficient. I'm not getting enough testosterone and or enough estrogen from that to provide the negative feedback that tells me to stop making GNRH and other the pituitary hormones. So I would just it would just keep shooting and trying to like probably overshoot you into adequate territory. So you would, if you were primary hypogonatal, you would see the reflection typically of high-genetic tropans. Or you would also see some sort of structural defects. And that's where you would get into like, you know, ultra sounding for, I think the prevalence in males is like 15% of males have a vericous seal. I don't know if you know what that is, but it's like vericose veins in your testies essentially. And it looks like like twisted kind of like the same thing you would see in vericose veins in your legs. It's like in the side of like the testies. And it inhibits the thermal regulation and significantly impedes testosterone production locally and fertility. So that oftentimes, well, 15% of men from what I recall is the number for prevalence pretty significant though for something a lot of people don't know exists. And if you are, you know, doing all the lifestyle stuff and it's not working. And you think you're doing everything correctly and you must need testosterone. Sometimes it can be overlooked that there are structural defects. So like typically the first thing you would look to is like, M.I. capable at the organ of responding to the signal. And like is the signal adequate to begin with because if there's like a primary hypogannatol outcome, it would be some sort of like structural response problem in the testies themselves. If that's not an issue and you've ruled out all structural problems, you know, age-related decline and is not a factor and you're, you know, otherwise, you know, everything's all accounted for from that angle. You would look upstream to the pituitary and say, okay, well, at that point, am I producing enough LH and FSH? And this is typically the outcome you would see in men, not always, but like a lot of men who are kind of like not sure if they need testosterone, they'll have like a relative proportional inadequate signaling driven through a myriad of factors, including but not limited to lifestyle, some age-related decline, toxins, exposures, myriad of things. And that's kind of like where people have this opportunity to try and incrementally maximize all the areas in their life to try and improve the output. Because if you have sufficient functioning organs and your output is just insufficient, you might be able to get that up to stuff to where you need it just by getting leaner, losing body fat, fixing your diet, addressing micronutrient deficiencies, quitting smoking, drinking any more, fixing your sleep, all the smorgas boregave things. Yeah, we're going to get into a little bit, but okay, what about the sex binding globulin hormone, SBGH? SBH, SBG, sex hormone binding globulin. Sex hormone binding globulin. What about the sex hormone binding globulin? Like you're talking about, if you have a lot, if you have a high level of that and it's bound up to testosterone, so several, a couple of questions here, what regulates those levels? And what regulates, how much of that testosterone can then get away from that binding protein and then be used to, obviously, exert hormonal activity. So, can you dial in looking at just that binding protein itself to help kind of solve some issues? Yeah, and it gets really complicated in this regard because what a lot of people don't address is. So, DHT, Dahai Drought testosterone, mentioned earlier, how it's like the primary hormone that will determine if you reach full maturity in adolescence, if you will still be markedly male, probably if you have adequate testosterone production, but you won't get full maturation if you have zero DHT from a defect in the enzyme that encodes for five L for a duck taste or something. But that hormone, the most androgenic hormone in the body that essentially determines if you fully masculine lines are not, where you end up with a micro penis, that has a much higher binding affinity for SHBG than testosterone does. And then testosterone has a much higher binding affinity for SHBG than estrogen does. So, even though on paper, we're talking about the importance of free test versus total test, which is very important. Also, very important, which most people are going to test in their blood, is the DHT level that males will rely on throughout adolescence and to some extent in adulthood potentially depending on their test levels, that's going to get galloped up even more proportionally by SHBG. So, if you have high SHBG, not only is your free test potentially inadequate despite adequate testosterone production, proportionally you're free DHT, which is like the main androgenic hormone is like way more gobbed up. And this gets really rough in females because they a lot of them are using things like combinerial contraceptives, which crank SHBG through the roof through the liver interaction with the oral combinerial contraceptive pills depending on which drug they're using in general ethanol, acidity, plus some persistent depending on how androgenic the progestin is it'll depend on how much the SHBG goes up, but you'll see in adolescent women or women who are, you know, in full adulthood that are taking combinerial contraceptives, they're total total testosterone will suppress upwards of 50 to 60 percent and free testosterone upwards of like 70 to 80 percent. So, they're walking around like borderline, A-sexual, castrated by a pill essentially. And that's only with oral. That's with oral, but like any sort of progestin that is synthetic, we'll have negative feedback to some degree, all but much lesser so via a localized iUD releasing a level of no-redestroller or something. And you're not having to take that supporting estrogen, estrogen, estrogen, that comes compounded into it. So it depends on the format, but a lot of girls are still using the combined pill. So it's just noting on the last that when these SHBG levels are skyrocketed or even like high on, you know, a clinical reference range. If you are somebody who is like moderate, you know, T production or low normal or whatever, like the proportional hit to your DHT getting goved up could be like the differential between you being symptomatic or not, as well as your free T, even though it's proportionally less goved up, the DHT could be like nuked entirely essentially via the SHBG levels being high. Since we're talking about the SPGH levels, I kind of want to like, what is there lifestyle? So does age regulate that and also like lifestyle factors? Yeah, so like a common thing that people hear is when you get 30 years old, you're total testosterone decline by 1% per year, but the reality of what makes this even worse is your SHBG levels will increase year over year, proportionally faster thus making the velocity of free testosterone decreases dramatically more so proportionally. So even though total test decreases by 1% a year, your free test will decrease by up to 2% per year. And that's the one that you need to like do stuff in the body through like freely circulating activity. So it's very important and very relevant for dictating what activity you have in different tissues in the body because it's ultimately the only one that can actually bind to the receptor and do what it's supposed to do. So the SHBG levels will be dictated by age will be dictated by liver health to some extent. We'll be dictated by other medications, especially oral formulations, insolagenic signaling as well. hugely implicated if you're on a ketogenic diet, you can absolutely expect your SHBG levels to be through the roof and your free test to be much lower. So carnivore diet guys, there's a reason they eat fruit now. It's because they're free test levels, we're all shit and they're total test levels were high and they thought it was fine. But in reality, they had like borderline hypoconatal free test levels often because they were overlooking the fact that insolagenic signaling is needed to actually get SHBG to a meaningfully reasonable level for a male. So and this is also something that would be relevant for females too, right? Yeah, and these binding proteins also exist for other hormones in the body because they all function in similar ways through cargo systems and transport mechanisms in the body like you will have binding proteins for IGF1, you'll have binding proteins for thyroid hormones. Like it's not uncommon to see people with normal on paper levels for certain hormones, but then when you dig deeper, all the free hormones are like proportionally horrible because they're all about like the total production looks okay, but it's because it's factory and all of these like bound up hormones that are in use like unusable essentially. Is that something that's common? Like I mean, would you say that's depends on the person in lifestyle? So yeah, probably especially among women because like, you know, a lot of them are you only have so much androgens to work with to be in it. Like your production is a tenth of males typically. And then if you are occupying all of your androgens because you know essentially the SHBG is going to with a much higher binding affinity mop up all your DHT into testosterone, not all of it, but like a significant amount of it if it's high and any like higher than it should be. Like it will impact your like free endogenic signaling so significantly that might put you into like the you know female hypogonatal equivalent territory essentially. So you could be like it's not uncommon for girls to walk around borderline asexual or like literally no drive throughout their entire adolescence 20s 30s and think it's normal and it's just not what they're supposed to be walking around like. So in other words like if they have if their libido is like totally down perhaps like they're having a harder time losing fat, getting so losing fat, it might it could come down to this right? Bowing integrity, whole of stone integrity, right? Yeah, so that sounds like a little bit less or so depending on if they're on like obviously you know if you're on a commondromal contraceptive pill has estrogen and it's you know however much it does that to what dose you know you get into the nuance but ultimately like you're inhibiting natural hormone production quite dramatically through a myriad of means like think about guys who are just like natural having to deal with what they deal with as is you know the sleep impact the cortisol impacts the fat impact of being you know obese and then if you have women who deal with all those same problems you're gonna have all the the suppressive results of all of those lifestyle things the diet the nutrition the whatever and then you also factor in medications on top of that too that maybe men don't typically have to take to you know achieve contraception like you know that's typical what often I think the final blow that will like push women into like you know closer to low-dribs territory often and almost certainly lower quality of life for a lot of them now that's not to say because I think this gets misconstrued often is it's not to say don't use contraceptives at all like they're absolutely better ways to go about it I'm just giving examples that I see is commonplace no no it's this is great this is great information um you know since we're kind of talking a little bit about symptoms that's kind of a circle back to talking about like what are the symptoms of low testosterone you know we're talking about men here but like we talked about libido muscle mass like what are what are like the classic symptoms that men should be looking out for is it something that's hard to differentiate between okay this is testosterone or other things it does get tough because as you would imagine a lot of the lifestyle related things that lead to low testosterone will come with the decrement to quality of life just via you know if you have poor sleep like you're not going to feel great because you didn't rest enough and then you add that on top of the inhibition of you know your output of get added tropans, pituitary hormones and response to them as well like it's like a one-two punch off and a lot of the stuff so in general I would look to things like libido, erection quality obviously that's more you know circulatory often but still notable nonetheless if you suddenly you know if you know I'm mourning would anymore like you gotta look into it regardless of its circulatory or hormone mediated might be a combination of both um you know longer able to hold muscle as easily or build muscle as easily you know losing strength in the gym you recover incapacities inhibited relative to what it was when you were younger um mood dysregulation irritability and these are all like really general vague symptoms and I would love to just say oh look it you know this exact thing will happen but in reality it's often a constellation of things that comes as a vicious circle effect of the you know factors that lead to that deterioration of testosterone to begin with or if you were just you know never had reasonable testosterone to begin with you would have probably not gone through puberty adequately to begin with so like the genetic factors like some of these like more outlier cases become a bit more obvious because it's like you just never really like fully masculine eyes and adolescence you may have a higher voice you know you a lot of those things but are less relevant for the average person for the average person it's gonna be more of these general symptoms and it's warranted to get a test at that point just see what's up right yeah so then that in combination with the test and things that we just talked about is kind of like where you know like pre diabetic you know progressing towards you know pre diabetes um insulin resistance a lot of the stuff is going to be ultimately determined by blood work though because a lot of people aren't going to be able to identify this autonomously reliably so that's kind of where I'd point to the more vague stuff like the quality of life like do you notice a blatant deterioration with no other factors change erection quality you know libido uh vigor muscle mass strength fat body composition stuff like that so you mentioned that the by age 30 total testosterone decreases by about 1% per year then you mentioned even in general in general right right on average like yeah exactly there's and that's where I'm absolutely seeing the 70 year olds with you know 900 totalties so so the the question is then like there there are lifestyle factors that really can sort of modulate that you know general decrease or not so it might be can accelerate it or maybe can slow it right and I kind of want to dive into some of those those lifestyle factors like what should men avoid or try to minimize in terms of their environmental exposure or lifestyle factors that are known to accelerate the decline into testosterone and or increase the binding proteins so there's less free testosterone right anything that's going to necessarily regulate the ability of testosterone to exert its you know function essentially mm-hmm I would love to bang out an exhaustive list but forgive me I guarantee we'll miss something but like alcohol you know the direct toxicity effects of that does inhibit actual steroid genesis in the testicles themselves it will also impact sleep dramatically which has the vicious back-end effect of you know inhibited output of signaling hormones which indirectly will also impact body composition which you know the whole downturn cascade of that smoking obviously not helpful how much alcohol is it like any amount or like light drinking moderate drinking I think like obviously the safe answer for me is to say no drinking I think it would be more like a dose dependence toxicity effect and what is your capacity to handle it because ultimately the testes are very affected by oxidative stress and if you're not capable of handling that adequately like it will reflect in your inadequate output of hormones locally so I would love to give like hard and fast numbers but there are a lot of people who will be able to get away with like murder and probably be okay then or some guys who like you might be low normal function to begin with and like that you know coupled drinks a week like you know throws off your sleep a bit and kind of pushes you over the edge like it all depends um it is very much a spectrum so like going from like optimal to like blatantly hypogannaddle from a symptom perspective it's not like it's just onverse off like your way there is a you know it's transition of you know chidiness as you arrive to that like worst case scenario so other things I could point to if you have a totally fat deficient diet I think that's you know of a macro distribution that would be reflective of something that's almost certainly going to hinder your capacity to produce hormones also if you have a void of carbohydrate intake diet it would also be something that would inhibit freely circulating hormones from liberating themselves um and lack of protein like you would not be able to produce you know get as robust of a response recovering from workouts and be able to build muscle which indirectly is going to improve body composition and improve your hormones as well so it's all kind of like balanced diet don't eat bad um micro nutrient intake I could definitely point to if you're deficient and not every mineral or vitamin is going to be you know game changing dramatic impact on your test levels but things like zinc, magnesium, vitamin D like these all have a marked impact on your testosterone either response to it or capacity to produce it or even like like you mentioned our podcast conversion of vitamin D into active vitamin D like you might think you have adequate vitamin D status of via your dose you're taking that super high but you're not actually utilizing it but you think you are and that's that's impacting your testosterone production and your response to it at the end of your gym receptor itself as well so I think from a minerals and vitamin standpoint the low-hanging fruits are typically going to be like B vitamins but in particular like from a mineral side you know you have you know magnesium, zinc and the vitamin D3 are going to be three things that specifically on top of the minerals and vitamins and everyone's familiar with from multivitimins and whatnot are more difficult to get in adequate doses all but zinc is typically adequately in many multivitimins but the magnesium in particular almost never is because of the weight of it you would be having to take a multivitimins that's like eight to ten capsules otherwise which just nobody does and then the vitamin D it's fat soluble typically you're going to have it in like a soft gel or something and it's not always going to be at the dose you need in the multivitimins to just work noting so those are just some low-heating fruits that are if you don't look to those as part of your micronutrient optimization strategy like you could be overlooking low-heating fruit that debt like is a deterioration of you know 100 plus nanograms per decilator per deficient micro-potentially depending on how severe the deficiency other things I get point to being obese like the worst one probably that I probably should have mentioned first but is like so dramatically impactful on your negative feedback to the hypothalmic pituitary access so by that I mean men who are obese and women if you have a significant amount of fat it is going to elevate your aromatization which is you know your conversion of testosterone to estrogen and this is more impactful in males because of how the brain gets signaled from estrogen not testosterone directly as significantly there's a bit of a nuance there but in general you need adequate estrogen to tell your brain okay we're good you don't need to make enough testosterone because I have enough estrogen like that's kind of like the downstream cascade of these metabolite conversions is you produce testosterone in order to produce other things too and the estrogen is a very potent mediator of telling your brain were good and if you have a significantly elevated amount of estrogen being converted from your testosterone that you make because of how much fat you have you are basically achieving the proportional increase in estrogen it is much higher than the amount of testosterone substrate that led to that conversion so you have that signal telling your brain okay we're good but the amount of testosterone you actually had to begin with was not good so that's problematic people who are obese have you know upwards of I would love to have hard and fast numbers but it could be like a significant like half of a reference range maybe you know but it could be the differential between you being you know the quality of life of your fine blades and flate in you know severe deficiency and what else could I point to you um what is weight loss due to to the to those levels like if you are some of the diabetes and then you lose weight does that bring you back yeah as long as you are losing ideally like this real fat and like overall fat loss is going to be very supporting of getting that ratio back into balance of your estrogen and the amount that's converted to estrogen, estrogen, estrogen and particular and once that balance is favorable because you are leaner you will have a balanced amount of feedback to the brain that then regulates like the perfect homeostasis between okay now we have adequate testosterone and estrogen so you will actually notice more testosterone being produced because it realizes to get this signal that we deem adequate we had to produce more testosterone to get that amount of estrogen so there's this goldie lock zone of course you can't just you know become you know a malnourished you know low like bodybuilder shredded person and just continue to get this elevation and proportion it's at some point you will end up essentially starving your body of the nutrients needed to actually support hormone production but in general you know guys you are you know like 12 like 12 the 15% body fat ish will find that they have an increase in testosterone dramatically relative to when they were obese and it's like super significant and how much it will improve hormones status so and then the sleep I think I might have already mentioned that yeah what I definitely want to dive into some of the diet things in a minute but I wanted to ask you about a couple of things for with respect to maybe factors to avoid what effect is like excessive endurance training have on testosterone because I thought I came across some literature where it was a negative effect and I wasn't sure like how robust I think it is pretty dramatic pending and exceed your capacity to recover so that sounds like a weird way to answer the question well like some people have at higher tolerance for stress and that's you know reliance on a bunch of different factors but if you are somebody who is not feeling yourself correctly to handle that amount of endurance training like you were let's say you're in a calorie deficit and you're trying to be like I don't know six pack shredded for the summer and like look as good as possible but also feel you're like endurance event efforts like you're probably like not doing to you're not doing two birds one stone like you're doing two things like inadequately almost certainly and malnourishing yourself and ending up in a state of hormone deficiency as a result probably like you see in studies all there are cases that you can point to of what happened to natural bodybuilders as they diet for a show and you can see in like as they start to get closer to stage ready which is like the most shredded basically any documented human gets essentially the requirement to get there is a state of malnourishment essentially and at some point typically once you start to cross into that like you know single digit body fat threshold you start to become so malnourished that you are inhibiting your actual capacity to produce hormones adequately and it will enter into like you know preservation mode slash like hibernation or something and it's kind of just like save yourself we're starving to death like how do I stop everything metabolic attacks from happening let's shut down all systems nor do we have this substrate to actually produce these hormones to begin with that's kind of what happens when you get like really really malnourished and with endurance running like I've seen guys out you know 5,000 plus calorie per day diets when they're doing like really intensive endurance activity so if you were not fueling adequately and with the right fuel micronutrient density macruble lot meant the how much of it is like carbs or fat versus protein yeah you could absolutely exercise yourself into a state of hypogganatism easily I kind of like I would caveat not easily it's hard to train that hard right yeah I know it's definitely not easily like there's not a lot of people that are accudos to the people mentally are strong enough to do that I guess well I kind of think of the analogy here for women it would be like when women are excessively endurance training and in a severe caloric deficit and they become a mannered it right so they're essentially not obligating anymore in effect you mentioned like wanting to get shredded for the summer will I actually in my 20s was was doing this very thing where I mean I was running like 10 miles a day and I was eating like carrots and hummus and that's it you know when I was like not fueling myself no like hardly any fat you know it was very like very sort of like low protein you know low fat diet and I definitely got shredded ish but like I became a burneretic for several months you know where I just didn't get my period and so it wasn't obligating and so I had to add back the calories in the food it was like in a took a while for my body kind of like recalibrated yeah but I feel like that's kind of like the analogy that like it is it's like you sure body shuts down it's like okay I'm not getting enough calories reproductions than essential right now survival mode right not reproductive like happy growth mode it's like survival mode and like some people might not even realize how significant of a deterioration hormone production and I'm talking about like to give context men who are dieting for body building shows naturally it is not uncommon to see the end result of a hormone profile unlike the last week then to look more female on paper than like their girlfriend like that's a loader testosterone levels are that's wild that's wild just to kind of sum up the like factors to avoid not always but sometimes I wanted to get your opinion on endocrine disrupting chemicals like how how have you or has your you know your company looked or seen anything or do you have any speculation to like what the scientific literature has shown in terms of them affecting hormone levels yeah they were pretty convinced that there isn't a fact it's just the magnitude at which you often see hyped up I think maybe overexaggerated there are low hanging food things to absolutely avoid like don't use you know plastic top of air and like heated up and stuff like that trying to glass when you can try and ensure you have like high quality air if possible like pollution I think is a big factor for like your body's capacity to deal with stress and like the allocation of resources to be chronically dealing with a toxic environment will inhibit systemic like broad systems um water quality like you can make sure you have like decent water if you got to be solid but as far as like the actual magnitude of impact of those things for most people I think is going to be relatively negligible and contrast to like the obesity diet the exercise the sleep quality the potential uh course engines that might be exposing themselves to you know some of the lifestyle stuff is like way more important to be addressing as like the basin for structure before you start thinking about like oh it must be my like shower that is like shooting chlorine I mean like it must be that or it sure could a shower filter but like it's not going to be the game changer I do think of avoiding like the basic so like you know switch to glass where you can don't use plastic water bottles stuff like that and there is blatant evidence showing interactions with estrogen receptors with some of these compounds as well as estrogen receptors which in turn will impede the ability of the actual hormones you produce to bind to those receptors and do what it needs to do so you're like essentially competing with yourself for activity in the body like you're you know competing with these like even if they're like mood activity compound they still act as like anti-androgens or anti-estrogens via the occupying of receptors so to whatever degree they are doing it at all is not ideal because it's inhibiting like space that could be occupied by actual endogenous hormones that you need to produce and need to work properly and you don't want to be competing with like environmental toxins so like do things in the body what do you hear like I often hear from many people popular you know media as well as just people I speak to or comments that I read about testosterone levels being lower now and men than they ever have ever been for one like is that true do you think that's true and too like what are some of the major contributors is it obesity since obesity is rampant I mean or is it just like everything that you mentioned all sort of like compounding together and not necessarily just like increase in you know BPA and plastic you know endocrine disrupting chemicals that are now a lot more prevalent than they were you know six years 70 years ago as a video a while ago on like the earliest finding I could find of recorded testosterone levels and I think it was like military soldiers or something one thing that I think is notable is the actual detection sensitivity of testing is absolutely much different now than it was you know 60 years ago so to contrast like oh the total test of some guy 60 years ago of verse now is equivalent even on like a testing methodology basis is like flawed to begin with because it's probably not an accurate comparison but is there a trend downwards I would say yes and I think it is mostly dictated by the obesity the diet the lifestyle stuff so you know like you there's obviously things to deal with in the environment that are less favorable and are not supportive and probably not benign but like in general I think most people that worry about this stuff they would be put their mind at ease by dialing in everything else which is not that hard to do it's often free or you know cost less money you're looking eating less food you know go to the gym etc I'm not saying that's easy to do but like dialing your basics I want you to do that you have like an anchor you have your baseline let's just say you get a blood test and you see where you're at from there you can start doing something my new changes like putting you know a chlorine filled your own your shower head do this change your water source whatever do you notice that incremental uptick in your ganata trip and output or your response to it at that point if yes like okay maybe it was a meaningful change but until you do that you're kind of just taking shots in the dark assuming all of these things or you know occupying your mental bandwidth and concerning you that may not be worth your concern to that degree. Just chlorine having effect on to stuff your own I don't like maybe okay yeah I think I think more of like BPA but um and consuming it like or like he's hot like heating up the plastic or like hot beverages like going into like something plastic but um yeah I agree I think these lifestyle factors are a paramount and I'd love to kind of get a little bit more into some of those particularly like so you've already mentioned the diet and I'm kind of you mentioned protein fat carbohydrate you know like so what what what why are some of these importance of fats are important to make you know the back bones of hormones maybe we can talk just a little bit about like while low fat diets and why people should be incorporating fat into their diet to make sure that they're yeah like in general it's not like if you have for example if you just cholesterol it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have like a dose dependent elevation and you're like serum cholesterol as I'm sure everyone knows here but there are like certain baseline requirements to serve as the substrate for producing cholesterol derived steroids in the body and these are all ultimately derived from cholesterol and then get cleaved and manipulated through enzymatic processes to make all the hormones in your body including been all limited to testosterone, estradiol etc so in general it does seem like having a sufficient amount of fat is worthwhile and does seem to impact how much hormones you can actually produce and the carbs for actually mediating and it's going to depend on you know activity levels how demanding of exercise you do if you burn through them for snive or sedentary versus not but in general it's going to be the insologenic signaling is somewhat necessary to facilitate a balance of free and urgent including free other hormones in the body that often go overlooked to actually do with their supposed to do because a lot of people even measure the free levels of you know like the IGF1 the you know the T3 that you'll you know some of the stuff gets like hyper nuance reading into what hormones are actually bound up that you don't realize estrogen, DHT etc so having a balanced diet and then the protein like you mentioned from like a mechanistic perspective like I think in general these things all serve as building blocks is the simplest way I can put it and having a deficiency entirely of one or the other it's just like kind of the expected outcome like it's often not going to be ideal to be missing something entirely that your body utilizes for critical you know structural things well it's interesting I learned something from you because I you know I was aware of the importance for you know of of fat particularly like you know a certain amount of saturated fat which is known to increase endogenous cholesterol production but the carbohydrates in the insulin response and like having that insulin action or response like and I didn't realize that was also important and you know especially for the free you know hormones like the act or the amount of free hormones so it's it's it's interesting to think about like a ketogenic diet you know as you mentioned like some people can really be in a problematic state if they're on a ketogenic diet and they're free to toss around just kind of tanks and it's not to say that it will absolutely happen like I'm sure there are a lot of people that thrive on long term ketogenic diets or may even clinically require them so like I certainly don't want to come out here and suggest if you're on a ketogenic diet stop doing it like talk to your doctor first obviously it's just like mechanistically this is what happens if you have a lack of insulin signaling you will have less capacity to suppress the binding protein well what you're saying is like get your hormones measure measure them right and make sure that your monitoring yeah be informed before you like freak out of anything right yeah um with respect to other sort of like lifestyle factors that can maybe boost testosterone so we're talking about dietary factors here what about exercise I you know resistance training is when that comes to my mind when I think about trying to boost testosterone I mean is there merit to that is that something that moves the needle yeah I think it's kind of like in the simplest way I put is like descending order of intensity essentially so like you know weight lifting at the top and then you have like some of your more like hit style workouts underneath that and then at the bottom of it would be like the most basic of I don't know barely exerting yourself but like getting out there moving that is going to have the least impact in general and at the top it's going to be you know the muscle building facilitating processes the things that build bone etc resistance training that's going to be the most directly impactful but ultimately it's also going to be what is the overall exercise regimen that you adhere to because a lot of people the problem is not even necessary like oh it's the perfect thing like it has to be something you enjoy enough that you'll adhere to it so like adherence almost trumps up the optimal in some capacity so like get the thing you can adhere to the diet model that you can adhere to like a lot of people the diet that on paper is the best like won't be the one that you stick to you for more than like six weeks so like don't do that one if that's the case because you're not going to stick to it and you're just going to end up where you are before so calories shrump everything unfortunately you know or fortunately because it gives you a lot more versatility with like your choices I think it's not like you're stuck in a myopic kind of you know box of I have to be on like the Mediterranean diet or I have to be on the current board diet or I have to be on the vegan you know whatever there are a lot of ways to skin a cat and ultimately it's going to come in mainly from energy balance and then also from their optimizing for you know having adequate protein fat presence carbohydrate balance to support your at you know whatever exercise you're doing and the intensity of it and all the things underlying up before we continue I just want to mention something important if you're finding these episodes valuable please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell it's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live many people assume they'll be alerted automatically but unless the bell is clicked they won't be we cover a lot of detailed evidence based content here and I want to make sure that you don't miss any of it now back to the episode with respect to some of the micro nutrients it kind of this kind of gets into the this supplement area as well but you mentioned some important ones that I've also kind of like come across in the literature and that being vitamin D zinc magnesium can we can we just dive a little bit into their effectiveness like there's like is there a human data on it like do you know anything about how they're working I mean I've seen I've read some of the human studies particularly on the vitamin D in like getting like higher dose vitamin D supplementation improving testosterone but I mean I love to kind of just take a moment to kind of talk a little bit more about that if you want yeah again general I think the most reliable things that move the needle if you were deficient what is I don't know people are familiar with the ZMA I was like a the first like combo supplement that was sort of seen as like a testosterone booster that was available in the market and it's you know like zinc magnesium and I don't know if the A was something else but vitamin D is the third thing in the last case or I'm about the age then before but those are the three things that move the needle most reliably that are natural you know otherwise would get through diet but likely non-sufficiently maybe zinc you might but like magnesium pretty difficult I would say for a lot of people they don't realize how deficient they are and then even like supplementing accordingly it's like you know getting one that you respond that you tolerate well with your digestive system has the yield that actually produces enough magnesium from like the elemental weight of the supplement which is not that complicated I don't want to make it sound super complicated like a lot of them are fine and ronda has great articles on magnesium formats that are bioavailable and yield more than enough magnesium and yeah the vitamin D having an adequate amount making sure converting it and actually getting the activity from it mechanistically there is some level of like gene transcription capacity facilitated through these like vitamin D's a hormone for example and it does also affect androgen receptor activity and some like the capacity for androgen to do what they do not just like the production of the amount of them so similar to what I talked about earlier where you have this kind of like receptor interaction how well can you actually utilize these hormones to do the things it needs to do in the body some of this is going to be facilitated by the adequate minerals and hormones for vitamin D supporting it and it's not necessarily measurable as much like directly but all you can really do is like backfill accordingly to hit your needs and then assess your kind of like proxies and your blood work and your symptoms and kind of go from there. In your opinion like let's say someone is on the deficient range of vitamin D they're inadequate magnesium perhaps there's ink is you know maybe okay or in the inadequate range would getting to that sufficient status really move the needle with respect to like testosterone. I think if you were on the low end of the reference range or literally hypogonaddle and you were clinically low or deficient for those depending if it's all three or not because obviously there are some of the more I mean at least vitamin vitamin D magnesium pretty common. Yeah I would say like you're looking at probably a potential incremental difference of 100 to 150 total T maybe it kind of depends on the person of course like I've seen more robust response in some studies but I also don't want to like over exaggerate the expectations but it is meaningful like it's something that and some of it can't be directly measured either like we're talking about the total T number but it's like how do you know how much of it deficient vitamin D is impacting your ability to like use it correctly and then even if you had the sufficient vitamin D the magnesium impact on all that and the DNA interactions and whatnot it's like you know you would have you be speculating at best so and then there are some other more like uh 10 gencial supplements that are not as like obvious no brainers that are helpful they're just facilitating mechanisms that are not like this is a vitamin you need almost regardless of what your test levels work kind of thing yeah I'd love to talk about those I'm any here some of these herbal supplements and like some of the ashwagon death in a Greek with Tonga-alli I mean let's dive into that like are they effective which ones are effective which ones are hype yeah um I mean one that I would would be worth mentioning all but the literature isn't super robust it is uh bull run so that potentially has a suppressive effect on SHBG levels there's some literature that looks promising all but I wouldn't hang my head on and say it's a guarantee it's going to suppress your SHBG from like the hind of the reference range to something that's like much more you know much better but like it may it does seem to work for some people and in general it can be a supporting ad junk that some people are it sounds like you typically get through your diet and like significant quantities anyways like often people will it will come into multivitum intipically but the quantity that moves the needle for SHBG I believe it was like 6 to 12 milligrams and can be meaningful for actually liberating freestosterous or not for actually producing more total tea um the other ones probably worth mentioning Ashwaganda specifically uh extract that is standard dies to a sufficient quantity of with analyze and not just your standard run in the mill generic Ashwaganda you want to look for ideally a patented you know uh sensorill or a kSM66 these are patented format of Ashwaganda that are standardized to a um target yield so you know that what you're getting is what you're supposed to be getting rather than relying on you know certificate of analysis from China of a generic extract so how what was that compound they're standardized to again with analyze it's like the it'll show right on the label of you like Ashwaganda bracket standardized to x percentage with lan with analyze and depending on if you have kSM66 that's 5% sensorill is 10% the difference between why you would pick one or the other is the actual total dose you could get away with using a less milligrams of the ks of the sensorill because it has more with analyze per milligram inclusion in your product but they're both like an exact full is that the active compound that affects testosterone? Yeah it seems to be and when I say testosterone it's like the indirect effect vs suppressing cortisol seemingly and kind of like the stress response manipulations that I can induce which are favorable for people who are anxious who have very stressful lifestyles who could benefit from it but there's not a catch all supplement that will benefit everyone and some people that will push them into and hedonia territory which is like a numbing of emotion so you don't want to really yeah if you overdo it will like literally suppress your stress response so significantly that everything's just like black and white what's so what what's a dose that would be considered overdoing it and what's a dose that would maybe be effective for suppressing the cortisol response and indirectly affecting testosterone by not having the cortisol decreasing the testosterone. Like I would go with the clinically like supported dose for something that's efficacious I wouldn't necessarily suggest somebody you know take something that's lower than what I've seen to actually work but in general it seems to be a cumulative effect over time maybe there are some people who might push you over the edge sooner and like certainly it's something to be cautious of and be aware of as a disclaimer before you jump on any testosterone augmenting supplements just be aware of the mechanism of how it works based on your own individual biochemistry because there's not something like a vitamin D that you can just sequester into subcue fan just like get rid of at some point it's like it could impact your mood regulation quite significantly for a bit depending on like what your neurotransmitter balance is at baseline like if you are already borderline like emotionally numb as a person you take ask for gondola like you might literally like cease to care about anything for all I know that sounds awful yeah but I mean for someone who is more of an anxious phenotype like six hundred milligrams six hundred milligrams I think is the dose but double check on that because I might be misremembering right I'm pretty sure and that is impactful to the tune of upwards of another hundred points seemingly I could be misremembering exactly but it's like I think it's triple digits pretty reliably for those who can benefit from it and for some people it's like a game changer supplement that really improves the quality of life outside of just the testosterone enhancing capacity of it because some people deal with a lot of stress in their life and need that extra resilience or suppression of how much it's affecting their mental state like some people they can't even get to sleep because they're rumminating and they're constantly anxious and having that kind of suppressed stress response can be very very net beneficial and then on top of that improves their sleep and also improves their testosterone through the reduction of the kind of like google courted-coider responses and yeah so it's good it works for sure the literature seems sound on it some of it is funded by some of these companies that do have the patented extracts just be aware of that but at least from an eye-opening blood-work anecdotally too it seems to work Tonka Valley another very notable one this is one that works for a different mechanism it seems to be a bit more speculative of how it works but it seems to do a few things potentially one being minor surmactivity potentially and this is more speculative surm is like a selective estrogen receptor modulator so something that binds to estrogen receptors and either like positively or negatively modulates them in selective tissues so there are certain tissues where it would be more favorable to have a selective inhibition of certain hormones versus others it would be detrimental like you wouldn't want to inhibit estrogen's activity and bone for example because I would cause bone degradation having an inhibition at the hypophalamus level level may depending on the person help increase testosterone via the inhibition in that feedback loop now I don't necessarily think it is a surm that's just like the tertiary potential mechanism and it is speculative the main mechanism that people seem to agree on that it does do suppression of SATBG to some extent as well as the upregulation of steroidogenesis intratesticularly so like locally upregulating I believe it's steroidogenic to keep regulatory protein that basically incorporate cholesterol into the mitochondria to actually undergo these enzymatic cleaving sequences that result in the production of testosterone locally so it seems to like help upregulate the process that actually enzymatically spit out testosterone essentially locally so that one seems to work well for individuals who have high SHBG levels or potentially higher estrogen levels than they you know as otherwise fixable via basic lifestyle changes and whatnot because everyone has run proportion of metabolism at the end of the day and it's not always going to be optimal even if you have what is otherwise like a great diet lifestyle but also it's just like I think it's for people who have adequate everything looks on paper to be sufficient but their SHBG might be a bit high or they could use a little bit of a boost and it seems to work to the tune of 100 to 200 nanograms per deceler for some people and depends on how potent of a standardized extra actually you want to look for one that is HPLC tested for a yearly commonone that's the active ingredient in Tonket Ali that actually has the bioactive effect that you're looking for there are a lot of Tonket Ali supplements that just say Tonket Ali or it'll say Tonket Ali like a hundred to one or like ten to one or whatever like these are kind of meaningless numbers from what I understand like you're not going to get a 200 to one version of a Tonket and even if you did there's no indication there's any Yuri Komino in it so similar to the Ashwaganda you want something that actually says this is how much of the literal ingredient that does what you're looking to get out of it in it and here's a third party test to verify it so and what was that in gradient called again Yuri Kominoan got it and you are YACO and ANO any I think now how does Tonket Ali compare to like boron it is it I mean it sounds like for men it might be like you're getting a bigger bang because it's doing it's working in two different ways yeah it's a good question boron is a mineral that is seems to be something that is mechanistically I wouldn't be able to say for certain what the differential is how they affect the SHAs you buy in complex like I would be trying to I might miss remember and I don't want to miss a B. yeah so okay well yeah I just kind of interesting but would would the Tonket Ali work in women as well just through the SHAG or maybe the boron like I don't know which it's just for off the like off the you know topic here boron has also kind of been thought to potentially be a longevity molecule as well there's some evidence that boron may be involved in like improving aging so yeah when you said boron I was like oh really that's interesting yeah I feel like that's almost like a lower hanging fruit thing because it's just typically part of a multivitamin that may just not be dosed high enough and you can just like stack on top and see if it has an incremental decrease to SHAG and then the Tonket is like more of a speculative one that you don't want to just like take until you've exhausted some of the other options but it's like the more exotic kind of like hammer that you might want to take to the situation if it's like your last resort before you know I've tried everything my life style perfect my diet's dialed my micro nutrients are accounted for my sleep is good I don't drink I don't smoke and my totality is still inadequate and I don't feel that great should I try some of this like one of these exotic things that seems to have a reasonable safety profile and like an efficacious you know you know impact and men and young healthy men at that like there are literature showing the effects and young healthy men not just like age related like decline to men notable now as far as it's impact on women I would think mechanistically would do a similar thing but like I don't have a steady I could point to that says it's the same so I would think but I don't know are there are there any others you know I hear about you know the the fenigreek and then the some of these like diaspora as per acid or are there any others that are notable or would you say more hype um I think a lot of those have been disperring like tribulus de-esportic acid fenugreek um one is notable that might do something as shiligit if you get a high quality shiligit it may provide enough like the the actual capacity of your organ to respond to hormones is partly conditional on its ability to tolerate stress and reactive oxygen species locally too so if you have more than you can deal with and you introduce say potent anti-oxidanty equation you may be able to like attenuate and neutralize the kind of like decrement to performance and kind of like net out more local hormonal yield so shiligit seems to be impactful and in-treatistic killer antioxidant activity but I wouldn't it's another one that requires like careful sourcing and it's also one that's like more speculative and indirect because like they're probably better ways to manage your like your antioxidant profile I would think so so your top four supplements for testosterone would be zinc magnesium vitamin D not in order just the top three I would say and then I guess for impact I would probably say like tunket alley but probably boron would be my safer next choice just for like safety profile okay great unless and then if you're like the anxious person at a yes we're gonna just be like cognizant of what it's how it works because you you maybe only get the benefit at a lower dose you may be able to cycle it I'm depending on how you respond to it like similar to you with caffeine like there's no hardened fast rules and all this stuff because our studies you could adhere to like the protocols design but they're ultimately just designed by you know scientists who thought this was the way to do it and like for you and your individual biochemistry may not be the ideal way right I mean I've been interested in Ashwaganda I kind of experimented with it like half-heartedly like years ago and I think I'm gonna now bring it back into circulation because I do I am interested in in the stress management part of it like lowering some of the the cortisol and stress although I do that with exercise but if there's like a side effect of like you know just a little bit of testosterone boost like that would be great you know for me yeah so I think that's gonna be another experiment to mind that I try out um check your blood first yeah no I'm that's already told you I want to get my my hormones it's I've had the measured but like I don't feel confident I haven't had repeated measurements I don't want to get that blood test you're going to be like fuck I shouldn't have taken ash for gone because now I have no idea what this means what's the what the baseline was yeah I know definitely for sure but let's talk about like let's say people are you know trying out if you do assess your cortisol stress response I would highly recommend a Dutch test over a blood test why is that salivary cortisol levels are far more indicative of what's happening from a stress response standpoint than your like transient serum cortisol levels will be a really yeah and because just like the snapshot in time and it in the serum is just like not an accurate reflective measure um the salivary levels will fluctuate and they get like multiple readings they create like an average curve for you and they should map out your day as opposed to blood you like one big draw the cortisol is measured one time and say okay you're like high end of normal like what do we do with that information the salivary ones a little bit more indicative of like you're a multiple time points of the day and like here's where we'd expect you to be at these points and like this is how you're responding to your day stressors kind of thing cool all right and it's like less intrusive to like spit into you know whatever right and do they end to usually you spit in multiple times a day to kind of get that yeah I actually not done a Dutch test personally but I'm pretty sure it's as you spit in the tube yeah okay um good information let's kind of transition to like people that have let's say like let's get back into the men category here that have like exhausted these natural ways they've like you know perhaps lost weight or done all the lifestyle factors that we've talked about to improve their testosterone they're both total and free all all that above who should consider hormone replacement therapy like how does a man identify whether or not they're a good candidate I mean is it really just recommended for men with clinically low testosterone and symptoms or like what we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier but I kind of want to just go into this area now of actual testosterone placement therapy so um like there are definitely scenarios in which it's more obvious because there is a structural issue that cannot be rectified via any sort of lifestyle change or like sleep hygiene manipulation or whatever like if you have primary hypogenatism and you've ruled out the ultrasound like vericoseal there's no issues you're not like cooking your testies and like a hot tub every night you're not like your sleep is dialed your micronutrient it it takes on point also satisfactory amounts of calories like I think I might probably indirectly touched on this but like via the getting to a good buy fat like you still need to have an adequate amount of energy to actually meet the needs to produce hormone too it's like adequate amount of calories not over doing and under doing it um if you've done all the stuff that we kind of like talked about and you've ruled out um pituitary out of no amount you've ruled out any sort of like I don't know like um structural defects and signaling is adequate or even super physiologic and you're just not responding like at that point it's kind of like okay you're we could try hammering you with some HCG and see if we can stimulate a satisfactory response with like a manual like extra push at the light excel or you some you know some these other like augmenting you know steroidogenic supporting things like tongue cat or whatever but if that's not working either like your testies or cooks and you got to be on test at that point because you're just not responding to any natural stimulation whatsoever that is not typically the eye the outcome of a lot of guys who end up onto testosterone a lot of guys end up on it through like like secondary diet like type of organ adult symptoms through like the pituitary either inadequate output or insufficient response to that output plus an insufficient amount coupled with it coming out of the pituitary there's not a lot of people that are literally showing up like your testies don't respond to whatsoever um in those individuals like it's kind of like if you've exhausted all resources you've tried the whole manual stimulation directly because HCG is the way you would actually test that out is you would actually look at okay if we actually hit your lighting cells directly with a signal and we ask you like that to like the maximum degree and we use FSH2 exogenous it's like if you're still responding that there's no saving at that point unless you have like such a significant amount of oxidative stress that you're just like not dealing with but that would have been taken care of with the lifestyle stuff we mentioned so primary hypergenital like you're gonna probably be on exogenous testosterone and it's literally like testosterone. You can't fix it with an chromophene, you can't fix it with HCG, you can't fix it with HCG. There's no other way around it like you're taking the literal hormone because it's the only thing that will get you testosterone like you can't produce it. So there's that um there's different ways you can take it of course which we could you know get into later but the next situation that's a bit more relevant is like the secondary hypergonatism situation where somebody has like testies that function just potentially to like a sub-optimal capacity and there might be some level of like low-genatotropin output facility through some level of like lifestyle or diet or whatever um like Peter for example like he's pretty dialed and like he did a lot of stuff to try and like fix it before he went to any sort of replacement sleep hygiene is on point like the guy like what else could you do when you're hammering it he's I think 50 years old so what he did was he used HCG which was assessing okay like are the testies responding to like a manual signal and they were and he's like replaced his hormones entirely by using a manual LH mimic essentially why his pituitary wasn't shooting out enough LH to hit the amount like the enough stimulation he would need to produce the same amount of test that would hit his like optimal variety of factors age related to decline who knows but probably a combination of multiple things and at that point it's kind of like do you want to manually backfill with signal or do you want to take hormones pending you've done all the exhaust of you know uh things to try and like check the boxes because you know some people don't care as much and don't want to check the boxes but like in general I would say it would be worthwhile to learn why you have the problem even if your intention is to just end up on testosterone anyway like I wouldn't I wouldn't delay treatment if you're symptomatic and it's like hurting your quality of life but I also would like do some due diligence to just like assess like what's happening and I think HCG for people who are like secondary hypogonaddle is sometimes a good middle ground of assessing like is it's a testicle functionality problem or is it like my pituitary output is not sufficient because at that point you can kind of tell like which organ is it that's failing me here so there's that and then like upstream to that there's the actual hypothalmess and the GNRH output which is the thing that stimulates the pituitary to make the LH and the FCAH and throw that whole cascade you could have insufficient signal from that insufficient response to that signal and then insufficient pituitary output from that weakened signal and the response to it like it's a deteriorating thing that by the end of it when it actually hits your testies may just be like sub-optimal for your response to be adequate through often age related to decline but it's a culmination of things so certainly back to the original question like how do you make sense of all this into side when is the appropriate time to be on hormones or not that's where you've met the workers like a really highly educated medical professional in general like I would not try and cowboy this yourself even trying to like learn it from you know online content whatever like I think it's I think it's good to learn how the stuff works mechanistically so you go in and form and don't end up putting on a half-asad regimen by a doctor who actually just wanted you on medications because if you know this stuff it's pretty easy to identify who's like a shitty clinic who just wants to like get you committed and stuck on life long hormone support and you can like weed it out really quick even if the doctor seems well intention you want to help you you want to you know support your quality of life says all the right things seems professional seems knowledgeable if you don't know this stuff it's kind of like you would be going in blind and assuming that's what you need to do and a lot of people just end up on hormones and that's it and sometimes there's nothing wrong with that sometimes that might be what you need but sometimes people want to know what were the natural avenues I could have taken could I have you know done something else could I have maintained the signal for my brain to my testies this whole time I'm just missing something no it's a really good point you know and also like talking about what any you know curious and side effects are as well so I mean that's that's kind of important but like before we get to the risk like what kind of benefits for can someone who is you know clearly like experiencing these symptoms of low testosterone expect from you know perhaps doing testosterone replacement therapy I mean you mentioned HCCHCG but I'm kind of you're directing it more towards like actual testosterone placement therapy yeah it would be in general if you are satisfactory in your replacement of these hormones to a physiological replacement level like you should notice a meal duration of all symptoms that's the best way I could put it um now again it's uh obviously you should not expect that you're gonna feel exactly the same as you did when you're like 20 years old like I think somebody will think when they're 50 oh I'm gonna get on TRT and it's gonna be you know like being 20 again like to some extent it could be because like on paper like your test levels might be the equivalent but it doesn't mean the way you metabolize the hormones into estrogen is gonna be the same it doesn't mean that the way you respond is gonna be exactly the same in general though the target is to ameliorate the symptoms and then like dial in from their kind of thing so like I think what people should expect is like the intention of it is get rid of your symptoms similar to like menopausal therapy like you want to get rid of your hot flashes you want to ensure that you are not like your bone integrity is like actually supported like all these things are like your baseline requirements of why you're doing it is just to like get rid of the negative and get to a baseline indirectly you will feel much better so it's like you will feel better from a result of it but like don't expect to be Superman unless you're you might feel like Superman relatives here stage just depends how deficient you were to begin with and it's all contingent on multiple things so it's hard to put hard and fast generalities on this stuff but like your targets should ideally be symptom relief right so you're not like necessarily gonna be shredded in a couple of weeks and yeah I mean I think you know it's it's important to point out like some guys might see that their testosterone is like on lower and of the normal reference range and like want to do something about it like with respect to like not it's skipping over the lifestyle factors and just like I'm gonna go straight into like I'm just gonna take some testosterone right and I think that would be the case to avoid right for not especially not really having symptoms but you're just kind of like freaked out by the numbers right yeah I definitely wouldn't make any rash decisions based on numbers on a piece of paper because I I know a lot of guys who like the best physics in natural bodybuilding are like guys with 500 total of the sauce runs like I know guys with three times the amount of testosterone production much worse physics like it's not always the number on a piece of paper it's your genetics your response to it literally how many muscle fibers you have at birth like there are a lot of factors that determine what you're gonna look like how you're gonna respond the shape of your muscle bellies and how they appear to people your body fat level especially like if you are leaner and you will just appear more muscular you know stuff like that right yeah okay so let's talk about some of the important risks that you know people should keep in mind when they're gonna start to test testosterone replacement therapy I know you've like talked about this hurt about it like the cardiovascular disease risk I mean for a while it was a controversy right like doing testosterone replacement therapy is going to increase your cardiovascular disease risk there's the the the traverse trial that came that's kind of we've got some pre pre public like pre pre data here where it seems as though um this is very large trial placebo controlled whereas seems as though men these are older men that were at least it seems to be hypogonatal like they were low testosterone and if they were given testosterone replacement therapy to a normal like physiological restoration range there's no really adverse effects on cardiovascular outcomes what are what's what's the thought here with respect to cardiovascular disease risk um any of the only issues like defining what restoration of physiological testosterone production equates to is like when we were talking about like coffee and like how much caffeine is in a cup of coffee like it could vary so much like some guys replacement to adequate physiologic replacement what he was when he was younger highly variable and in that traverse trial using Android gel to bump your total T from like hypogonatal to like 400 is not necessarily indicative of what I would say a lot of people are looking to the data to see what the results were of testosterone therapy because a lot of guys are on injectable test boosting the 1000 total T with a disproportionately high free testosterone because we're even jacked and frequently too you drive your HPG down proportionally that is not the same as a guy who's using a Android gel to get like 430 total T so taking that outcome and running with it as like no cardiovascular risk the I think it's a bit haphazard personally now it's obviously promising data and like it's great that it came out like it's very very promising the only problem is it's like how many guys are actually using that medium of therapy like I don't know none like I don't know a single guy using and that's fine like it's still data and it's still worthwhile and it's still good it's just like not don't take that as like the the sign off that like you're you know 200 milligrams of testosterone an anthape per week that you're like you know more a aggressive protocol has been designed to do is like going to be the same outcome like it's not you're going to have the a rithropruse poises increase that might be reflecting the traverse trial you're going to have the disproportionately high-endogenic signaling like you're going to have a lot of things that you would or you're looking to get the reassurance that won't happen but you have absolutely need to be cognizant of because will probably happen still yeah this is this is so important and that's kind of why I was like these are hyper go-nattle and you know it's like I guess their normal physiological range is not really accurate if it's only going to like 400 so basically you're just making them non hyper-bonyattle but it is important because you mentioned your rithropruse isn't so this is this is another kind of concern you know with testosterone which does regulate red blood cell production it does increase you know the thickness of blood and polycythemia is it is it I would say a risk factor right so you know how how substantial is this I mean I think I've read studies where it's like almost 25% of men have thicker blood that are on testosterone replacement therapy now doesn't necessarily mean it's like to the point where has to be treated but it is thicker right it is like the hermatica is is is thicker so you know how how should men weigh these wrists for the cardiovascular disease risk the polycythemia so for people like listening or watching that is it is a concern because it increases you know stroke risk it increases the the potential for you know cardiovascular events as well so like what are your thoughts on sort of weighing those risks to the opposite side of the coin on that and regel you know like it's not necessarily physiological replacement the thing to note is it should be expected that if you use more testosterone you're going to have more of a thorough poises like that's literally what it does so to think that it would be a net negative because you have a 25% increase in that v-egg or testosterone administration if you were hypoganniled to begin with which presumably is the reason you're getting on TRT you know depending on the person but like going from hypogannatal where you might be like border line like anemic for all we know and then having the 25% bump like maybe you need that to actually like have adequate oxygen carrying capacity and like actually sufficiently fuel your body so it's not to say it's like net bad net good it's all about where do you achieve like the problem is it's like the definition of symptom relief too is so vague because you could achieve symptom relief you know 450 total TB depending on the person or it might be at like 800 or it might have been like even if it was 450 like if you got up to 800 you're still a normal on paper so is that bad you know who's to say yeah well any most people would say it's the high of normal because that's literally what it is on a reference range so it all is going to be just being cognizant of the fact that androgens will do what androgens do which is they will in a dose dependent manner drive orthopoices they will induce cardiac remodeling if you push it too hard not necessarily within physiological limits but like these are things to be aware of this lipidemia will become more of a concern at a higher level especially depending on the medium of administration if you're dosing in frequently like once a week with a shot it's going to be a different outcome than if you're doing like daily you know little pulse of tile uh cream administration or like micro injections like subcutaneous they were bleeding out the effect more it will all be impactful so I think it's more about there is a risk all but there's not going to be data that says directly if you replace the 800 total T it's going to be dangerous nor is there data that says it's safe either like you can kind of take from the reverse tile what they found and extrapolate out like what you know from grated dose response studies which do exist and like realize okay like summer in the middle here if you're one of those guys who like wants to hit that you know high normal because I don't know like who's to say you're in the wrong for wanting to be like optimally vital too it all kind of depends on the person you have to weigh the risk accordingly because it's not risk free you're still going to have to keep him on eye on your hematology panel is it getting out of whack to a degree that is like unsustainable you're like looking at full body it's just a maintain-time outlook normal or is it like adequate slash like optimal for you now to feel like you have enough energy to not like faint when you get up i don't know it depends on the person yeah it's just like an understanding of all of the interplay of things and not taking the sign off, you know, the one the traverse trial is like, you know, you're getting a jail free card. Like it's just you're still going to have to keep an eye on your blood work. You're still going to have to have like a doctor who knows what they're talking about and is like very rigorous about this stuff. You have to know how the different administration methods and frequency will impact things because like you're probably not going to be on Andrew Jell using it a little dose that gets you to 420 nanograms per decilator. You're probably not on that protocol. And if you are, like, yeah, okay, look at the traverse trial. And like, maybe you can get like a bit more reassurance. But like, you're probably not that guy. And that's fine. If you're not, it's just like being very realistic about what to expect. And, you know, there is a dislippidemia, there isn't increase in blood viscosity to some extent, there will be a suppression of SHBG if you're doing injections in frequently, which will elevate your endogenic signaling beyond what is physiologic. Like, most people are super at least transiently without knowing it. And by that, I mean, by super, I mean, like more than you would have produced physiologically because it's not physiologic to have your hormones transiently shoot to like, I don't know, 1200 or 1500 total T with a disproportionately high free testosterone from administering once or twice a week twice a week, quite a bit better. But once a week, for example. And then it crashing back down before you shoot again, like that's not physiologic really at all. So you need to be aware that's going to cause more elevations in these like problematic biomarkers, then would be if you tried to maintain what is reflective of like daily normal production. So like the ideal protocol would be literally replacing your daily testicular output, which is adherence problematic for a lot of people because not everyone wants to be using like a scrodoly application of cream twice a day. A lot of people don't want to be injecting daily subcutaneously with like a micro-manetestosterone. They just want to be one and done one shot a week. Even some of the problem too is like the pharma has set it up so you might be forced to take it infrequently and at a high dose because they have these auto injector pens that are preloaded. So you like half the shoot at in one shot or you don't take it. Yeah, so like xia sted is like the preloaded testosterone and an antheid pharma grade that is often prescribed and it's like well you got you either do the one shot one kill and take the whole dose or you like don't take it. So so with the you're you're touching on an important point here that's the super-off physiologic level like the amount that you wouldn't necessarily have in like a normal physiologically. I mean I read a study where it was like 25% of men have this and it seems like it might be due to this like dosing this injection you know protocol. What what's wrong with the cream like is that something that doesn't get your levels high enough or is it just like annoying to have to do every day. It kind of. What's the I mean like it depends on the person because there would be personal subjective opinion for me to say like why I wouldn't want to do it in general the reason most people don't want to do it is adherence to life long like this is something you're going to do forever. Typically. Somebody going to apply a cream to their scrotum twice a day. It's not that fun like it's like something that you have to go out of your way to do wherever you are you're traveling whatever like you will go hypogonaddle with pretty quick if you don't get in the bathroom and wipe some cream on your balls. Yeah that's not I mean I get that but like you know like stroke risk cardiovascular disease. I think you want to be optimal the problem is a lot of people favor adherence and sustainability similar to diet over optimal and that's fine. Just if they'll be accepting of the risk profile it comes along with it. Okay what about other like parts of the risk profile so like how does it affect the prostate um I read about fertility. I mean being big one too it's it's depressing fertility. Yeah sleep apnea can be exacerbated as well and these are all like part of the risk profile things to consider. Yeah when it comes to prostate that is something that at least based on the most recent literature that I'm aware of is are you familiar with the Androgen saturation model? Basically if you go from hypodesy. Yes yes okay. But go ahead please explain it again. So essentially from what I understand based on most recent literature it shows that if you go from hypogonaddle to you get an atle we're like the threshold of it which is like you know on a reference range roughly like 300 plus anagrams per deciliter going from hypotu that that differential will be positively stimulating of like prostate growth you know PSA levels will go up etc but beyond that you were not necessarily in a dose dependent manner like a muscle or something going to be inducing sizing creases like if you took even if that were the case you'd have body builders who take you know thousands of milligrams of steroids per week they would have prostate it's like busking out of their bodies at that point so it's not necessarily the case but it's not like it's it's still worth monitoring your PSA for trends and longitudinal patterns as you get older because like it will still have the same you know susceptibility to things that happen as you age but the actual impact on prostate related issues and growing cancer from scratch if you don't have preexisting cancer cells like you're not going to just like spawn cancer from taking testosterone so I think that risk is a little bit overblown fortunately we have data that seems to be pretty strongly indicating that you're not going to have to worry about that if you are somebody who is otherwise healthy cancer free and you're just going from like you know like you would probably have a small prostate to begin with if you were hypogonaddle anyways you're probably just going to where you would be if you had normal levels so it's not like that growth is even bad either getting to the eukinidal state so keep an eye on the PSA and be aware of it but it's not something that seems to just like dose dependently escalate the other stuff is worth mentioning um you in general like when I said testosterone does testosterone things in a dose dependent manner even if your protocol is dialed in if you're producing more than you would physiologically that year body can tolerate as well like you will have the whatever backhand consequence of managing the extra estrogen the extra DHT you know that could lead to extra acne hair loss um gynachromastia if you have excessive aromatization locally in the tissue that is not antagonized sufficiently by the DHT and testosterone signaling hair loss in the scalp annoying body hair that sucks they get rid of if you care about that sort of thing more facial hair growth deepening of the voice um more than you already have as a male surprising like there's like often like if you're if you were low to you to be you know it's like typically guys you get on and then like push their test levels up to high normal especially we'll notice like a little bit of a deepening um like these are all kind of like the it's kind of like the maximization of the male secondary sexual characteristics being like pushed to the end of the gray um with in physiologic parameters um sleep apnea will get exacerbated pending your neck sizing creases muscle increases in size things that are contributing to the obstructive nature of your soft tissue falling into your airway will get worse pending you are dosing in a manner that pushes either so if you're physiologically replacing like a lot of the stuff is probably a mute point um but a lot of people won't be they'll be pushing to optimal optimal quote unquote which is fine just be aware that you will potentially increase your risk of sleep apnea keep an eye on it I would absolutely recommend anybody even before they get on TRT get their like a basic sleep study done um to a lot less intensive than you might think and they're actually like pretty reasonable at home devices that measure like a apnea episode to power level like essentially put you on a chart of how many uh um episodes of like seizing breathing or you having par hour and you could have a baseline there and see if that goes up when you get on TRT so it's not like this is a questionable like what's going to happen in your sleep apnea susceptibility like literally measure it like you have your baseline when you're not on it now you're on it what's the difference and like you would see in real time the literal diagnostic metric either going up or not changing at all and then you would have your answer kind of thing but it is a possibility for sure I'm just like any of the stuff is um but if you're physiologically replacing like the risk is relatively low unless we're talking about that super physiological level where it seems as though like one in four men don't even know they're in that level they are even transiently to run in blood work if you for example if I'm on the ziastead and I'm shooting once a week and auto injector pen and I'm checking on TRT today which means like typically you're a lot of physicians will say check your test levels on like the day where your test levels are lowest based on the pharmacokinetic profile of whatever the format of testosterone you're using so if you're on a long astrotestosterone formulation like a testosteronecipinator and an anathate these are the typical prescriptions to make allow you to get away with dosing only like once or twice a week for adherence but the reflection of that in blood work is you would typically see because you're bolus dosing it at once your blood work works shoot into super range depending on the total dose of course but like a lot of people this is what happens the shoot into like I don't know 1314 hundred 15 hundred total to with the proportional five-alph reduction to DHT suppression of SHBG disproportionate freeing a free endogenic signaling via more DHT being free than when otherwise be normal more free tea than it's proportionally normal more romanticization that would be possible if that dose was like even spread out on an even curved throat the week on micro injections increase in a breath rope who uses acutely beyond physiologic you know capacity to you know an unhealthy acute level at least for a periodic period of time and then you're in like a slow or steep depending on like the ester trash essentially into like sort of normal looking territory until your next shot that's the reality for a lot of guys they need a year up they do testosterone uh undecanement maybe or it's either a sustenant formulation maybe it's undecanement they'll do like one shot every like few weeks to crazy so they'll like shoot their test end of the stratosphere and then like trash in the hypogonatol territory and then they pin again shoot inject so I mean by pin yeah I mean I mean it's like a roller coaster of like I can imagine it's like the equivalence of what females deal with times like some magnitude I mean it sounds really must be like also just like they could aggressive and stuff and like what irritable irritable yeah you shouldn't be like impossible to expect you know like I don't know like I wouldn't want to wish that on anyone like that would suck I mean to me so like let's say adherence like compliance that's a whole issue right obviously but let's just like if we're just talking about risk profile right like you're not wanting to really get into that super off physiological love like you're not like you know you're not like the body builder you're not like you know the person that just really wants to keep that risk low but you want to get the benefits okay like that's that's what you want you really don't want the risk like just not not on the on the table for you what would be the best there's the different methods you kind of mentioned if you maybe you could kind of just go through the McAam briefly but like what would be the best method to get you to a more normal range maybe you're not someone that's totally hypogonatol but like you know low tea symptoms right lower tea and symptoms but what what your aging we were in age you know like 50 year old man or something but would be the ideal delivery method that would really get you this benefits but lower that risk profile yeah and one thing just to add before we entered that subtopic I do want to clarify if somebody was to take an amount of testosterone even if it put them to like high normal of the reference range but it was something you tolerated in youth and like your body was capable of handling which a lot of people are if you do it responsibly understand where you're taking know how to monitor your biomarkers are lean healthy have a good diet life styles dial in you're aware of the risks all that stuff is like overseen with a level of education some level of rigor and like obviously decreasing need over time as you start to dial it in you'll it's not it's like rigorous of an oversight process because after you're getting your dialed on protocol it's just kind of like living your life and you know what to expect from your blood work at that point and how it affects everything you'll probably be fine probably it's just being aware it's not zero risk like it's just like that's the thing people need to accept if they want to be pushing you know to some level that is like just in general like it's never going to be risk free but I could still also say with certainty that if you're hypogonaddle you're going to be healthier replacing to physiologic then you would stay hypogonaddle for sure like you are a thousand percent in cardiotoxic neurotoxic quality of life down the you know the toilet territory if you're like in hypogonaddle levels almost certainly so hopefully that's like somewhat of a consolidated arrafe because I don't want to like sound to it's worth being cautious in a way of all this stuff but like it's certainly not to don't diswage yourself out of like fixing your levels too like it's critical that you have adequate hormone production similar to women in menopause like the benefit outweighs the risk like essentially every single time essentially and you just have to be responsible your approach to what that is the same well especially if you're your monitoring biomarkers and we'd love to like talk about some of those in a minute but I think that's that's the key to right like monitoring right yeah okay so then you're circling back to administration like the ideal way to go about it um I can say off the rip I would not do pellets I would probably not do androgyl if you're a male if you're a female it's a bit different which we can get into the creams through compounding pharmacies that's probably the only like tolerable way you're gonna have something that you can apply scrotally to get the ideal absorption from a co-conedic profile that would be reflective of something that's like more natural so like that is probably on paper arguably the best way to go about it it's just not necessarily something everyone wants to but it it works well and it will get you to the levels that are great and look pretty physiologic and like kind of reflect the pulsatile diurnal nature of normal testosterone secretion and it's also converting like locally like in the area you would actually be producing it too like there is a local effect too through like five off reduction in the skin and stuff like that um which can result in that's why monitoring like DHT and some of those other stuff can be important but that's like a whole more nuanced discussion but in general the creams scrotally is reliable good produces a very favorable outcome and a lot of guys will be quite happy with that method. The other method that I would say is worth considering and like the typical one that most guys do is injection which it's a bit more predictable typically in terms of like what you're going to get out of it in terms of adherence it's a lot easier because you don't have to shoot it daily you can also modulate the release pattern of it through either the ester so like you'll typically it prescribe like the longest bleed ester so sipping it has a half life of like I think it's like 10 days or something the 8 to 10 days depending on how depending on individual biochemistry and how you kind of like cleave the ester but you can also change the way it absorbs via injecting sub continuously into stomach fat or into any subq fat versus intramuscularly where it's more quickly going to get absorbed and assimilated so you can also bleed out the effect even more and make it even more stable in your blood levels and it's pretty easy to adhere to a TRT protocol of like micro injections even on like a relative frequent basis like every other day is pretty damn stable subcontainously is what a lot of guys do when it works really really well and keeps it very stable a hormonal concentration curve it's pretty predictable and what's going to happen you just kind of like gotta be aware of the you know how hard you're pushing it and what that will do to your risk profile accordingly the other way that's promising that I would say is a oral testosterone undecanuate lymphatic absorption patented format so there is three I believe Tlando, Jitendo and KaiserTrix and they basically managed to make a lymphatic leabsorb testosterone undecanuate you can actually swallow or lay where it was back and then day they would have had to make it hepatotoxics to actually make it through the liver through first pass metabolism and actually like make it into circulation to any meaningful level they'd have to like add like a 17 alpha alkalated group to it and make it like a terrible for you oral steroid essentially this does not have the same level of stress it's not stress free as far as I know but it's will get you with the meat a meaningfully significant like get you replacement of total two levels to like mid to high range depending on the person likely achieve symptom relief for guys who are hypogonatal and is pretty sustainable because you're just popping something so some people prefer that pretty expensive though and kind of like a newer medium of administration but promising nonetheless typically what guys are doing those still is the injections and the or the crème and the other method is intra-neasal which I'm sure you've probably heard of for like you know hyperactive sexual disorder for women but has a potential for that as well as for men as like a different medium of getting like an arith row poeces stimulating free version of task so acute it's just like an unsustainable daily treatment unfortunately like it's okay if you're trying to have like an on demand libido boost as a female or something but for a guy using it like multiple times a day in snording something it's like not something any guy I think would want to do for I don't even think it's cool to begin with I think for once you get to like the month or couple month mark the novelty would probably fade like a lot of guys are you know super excited when they start testosterone injections like it's like this roster using like this hormone and it's you know I'm replacing and it's you know I feel like this big significant thing and then you know year-end it's just like oh I gotta do my injection so it's like whatever you can most sustainably adhere to that is like the safest will achieve the alchemy desire the symptom relief is the one you should stick to and the cream I guess I didn't mention the obvious but like transference if you have children you have pets like there are concerns with you know like what you were gonna rub it off on and like how like you're hygiene with it so that's worth mentioning because like there are cases of transference issues that have been noted in the media you know I think I did a video a while ago where some dad accidentally was like wiping a residue one is kid without even realizing it even after you like thought he cleaned it and his kid was like starting to get masculine eyes from the from the testosterone residue or something wow yeah crazy because it's like the levels are so low like any like significant amount will like push things in like a significant incremental direction that is like gonna cause problems so that's a thing Rosenjektion it's like you're in the bathroom you do it and it's clean and done totally sterile you know I'm not that worried about like on my hands fully clean you know it's something to get into it like good luck accidentally like breaking into like a multi-dose vial or something like it's not gonna happen so yeah there's like difference like logistical advantages to some of these administration methods that probably should not be understated but are worth mentioning so yeah I think three most viable cream scroll up application injection intramuscal or sub cue if you want to bleed out the effect or maybe the oral all but I want to see more of the literature as it evolves right so it's kind of a new new thing and when it comes to the injections it sounds like more frequent sub cue is like sub tainus is like where you're gonna get more less of the probability of having that super physiological peak versus like if you're just doing it once a week intramuscular not bleeding out that like response that are effect but again as you mentioned it compliance is definitely gonna be better if you're doing it once a week but I mean twice a week three times like every other day I mean you know for people that are really concerned about risk profile perhaps they have already like you know a family history of cardiovascular disease or stroke or whatever they probably are more incentivized to like lower that risk for any potential side effects yeah like in general I think or utility what about I mean I mean men that are wanting to reproduce yeah yeah I'll talk about that too but one rule of thumb that's like to make it as easy to understand at least for me this is the easiest to understand like how I remember it is the closer something is to what would be equivalent to what you would naturally make should you have had should you have healthy functioning tests these producing natural testosterone that's gonna be the one that has the least impact on all of the unlike intentional consequences of like spikes in our mountain so like normally on a daily basis you would pulse out like in abs and flows multiple times so like the more you can get these like the more stable you can get it with the more micro administration spread throughout the week the more stable everything will be and as a consequence less spikes into the territory that would produce things that are not representative of physiologic and typically daily administration is the way to go whether it's like cream is gonna be twice a day at least but then for injection it's like every day in every other day there's diminishing returns but you can kind of like we said bleed it out a bit so yeah so as far as fertility goes yeah you will absolutely crush your fertility pretty significantly if not entirely depending on some things so in for testicular testosterone is the significant mediator of spermatogenesis so it's not uncommon even for body builders who are on huge amounts of steroids to still accidentally get their wives girlfriend pregnant thinking that their sterile when in fact they have so much testosterone in their body that it's like actually like producing these permata genesis effect via the exogenous hormone what that does the epigenetics all that stuff no idea would freak me out of it well like it's it happens and it's like on paper these guys should be completely infertile but still see accidental pregnancies all the time in the body building world so I wouldn't rely on that as a means of a contraception as a guy first of all but you will almost certainly have like inhibited to like horrifically low if not a zoo spermic level fertility if you are on even just like baseline replacement because you are shutting down the signaling from your brand that otherwise dictates the intratisticular activity so by that I mean the hypothal messed releases the gnrh like an adetropin releasing hormone so it's the hormone that causes the release of genetropin's hence the name at the petuitary gland the petuitary response to that gnrh to then produce the genetropin's which are the luteenizing hormone lh and the fsh follicles stimulating hormone just like in women goes down to the go and ends and the thing that happens is you produce intratisticular testosterone at the light excel and women do too which is a thickest cells instead of lighting cells and that intratisticular testosterone mediates permated genesis in unison with the subtly cells which are also supported by follicle stimulating hormone so if you have exogenous testosterone so you're administering it yourself synthetically you have basically told you brain I have enough estrogen and testosterone via this injection I'm doing or whatever it is so you cannot produce any more gnrh because like why would we need you to we have enough hormones like okay let's turn that off let's turn off as a result we have no signal to produce petuitary hormones or the the gnrh to be turned that off and now you have no signaling to your testiest and now you're just like literal organ atrophy is a current because there's no signaling happening there so the only thing you can really do at that point if your HRT protocol is not built around replicating manual signal because that is a means that some people do if you have adequate organ function you could theoretically do that instead of TRT but if you're going to be on TRT like you either replicate that natural signal or you sustain organ atrophy to the point of potentially some permanent likely deterioration all but likely not inability to restore fertility it's very rare that I see guys who are actually like not truly fully hypogonatal like their testiest still work they just had inadequate signaling or something via like secondary hypogonatism if those individuals maintain the signaling only you can retain the structural integrity for the most part of the testies and then if you want to get pregnant or whatever you are either currently fertile still because you're manually stimulating it or you could like you can basically manually manipulate how fertile you are in real time essentially so you could fully retain all fertility parameters even push them to super levels if you wanted to I don't recommend it but like you can maintain everything while you're in testosterone via that manual signaling of ATG plus recombinant FSH that's like the combo that basically replicates what would otherwise be the LH nephasace from your pituitary to your testies you maintain structural the size the functionality sperm production etc but then you also have to account for the extra testosterone you're producing that's stacked on top of your exogenous test now so now your dose might have to change any amount of estrogen there's like local activity in the testies for how much aromatization happens in what not which is different than if you're injecting it like in your butt or something so you have to account for that differential too some people get highly estrogenic from ATG in particular which is like a female like literally in pregnant women's urine to stimulate light excels that's what it's like purified from um and you know there's some speculation as to if ATG is like healthy to be on as a guy like you're taking like an extract of like women's urine it's like a light excel stimulator similar to LH and seems to mimic the effects of LH but it's still not LH it's ATG which like human coriander can't get at and for open isn't what comes from your pituitary to your testies it's just something that stimulates the light excels significantly so do we see any like notable effects on like I don't know epigenetic modifications from ATG plus FSH mediated babies like not that I'm aware of not that I've seen any literature point to but it's worth noting nonetheless that ATG is not like a bio identical genetic rope and for men that you would otherwise be using to chew to your testies it's like a replacement for it and recommend an FSH is like it's FSH but it's still like brown and a lab it's not from your pituitary does that matter I don't know for sure but either way you can maintain your fertility metrics to literal baseline if you had an adequate adjunct therapy it's just very cost prohibitive like the cost of recombinant FSH is insane and ATG itself is expensive and then you're stacking that on top of your testosterone that you're using it's not necessarily an affordable thing for everyone so a lot of guys just let their testies after fee because that's what they can afford to do and they want to still get the symptom relief and then once it comes time to have a kid they have a bit of a more intensive protocol ahead of them to restore organ size and functionality which is more intensive of a process than if you just sustained I am sure like you could speak to like it's easier to keep stuff where it is than it is to try and like regain health so if you've literally atrefried an organ until like you know a fraction of its functionality it's trying to like bring it back from the it's not dead but it's like very compromised it's likely not going to restore to like full functionality and the road to getting the interval require more aggressive intervention you'll still probably get back to fertile but like it might not be as good of health of the sperm for all we know it might not be the same capacity to produce the same volume who knows so all that to say yeah you should expect your fertility to go down the toilet and you should expect that you have an adjunct protocol in place if you want to sustain it if you're on testosterone and you want to sustain the fertility but it's possible to sustain a lot of people thought until like relatively recently that if you're on testosterone you just couldn't and you're going to be infertile for sure and it's unfortunate because there's a lot of guys especially body builders who underwent severe atrophy and then had like really more difficult roads to recovery because of just bad information wow I mean it's like imagine finding out like for 10 years you've been on like hormone therapy and you could have kept your testicles where they were the whole time and now you just have like these shriveled you know like raisins they have to like re-stimulate the baseline through like insane aggressive dosages of ACHG and FSAG like not cool so I mean what point does that after restart to occur I mean like how long do you have to be on you know TNT before that really starts to happen um it's pretty quick because like the suppression of the cananasropens happens like within dates like once you start to inject that hormone like you've introduced an amount that is going to tell your brain we have enough to make any more in the month that cananasropens bottom out you have no signal like you will afterfie over you know the next months and get to some level of afterfie that is variable depending on the person but regardless you're not stimulating activity so even if like the structural size isn't like as significant of a drop like there's a lack of activity entirely so like you know it's all kind of individual dependent but like you should expect shrinkage within you know weeks to months. Wow and so this is also kind of important to point out for like guys that are you know caboing it and trying to like they want to they want to get their T-up for like maybe some muscular effects or something right and they're just kind of like maybe not hypogonautal but like lower range yeah like every series very seriously like it's you know that you want to be on it it's also something to experiment with in my opinion if it's like the route of hormone therapy like treat it as such like you treat it like you are on it forever probably. And biomarkers to monitor right let's say you are going to be on this and so some of the biomarker you mentioned like lipids and we're talking about hematocrit right like some of these biomarkers are important like what what would be or what are some of the ones that that your company measures or what you think are important to measure PSA right. Mm-hmm yeah I think uh um hematology you know that's kind of like covers the basics of you know red blood cell count and medicare to hemoglobin et cetera um metabolic parameters um like there's a lot of stuff you want to incrementally assess like how well it's working to like how much more metabolically like fit or are you becoming your blood work in insulin sensitive and whatnot because these are metrics of progress you can use to actually determine how well this is going for you so it's not just about like where did your total T and free T end up on paper it's also about like the real health benefits that you're seeking not just from a symptom relief aspect but also from like yeah what you're fasting insulin now is it like way better because you have more muscle mass when your body like if not like you know there's things to be had that are going to be net beneficial from a health standpoint not just like a cosmetic and like I don't know sexual health standpoint that should be monitored regularly and I think one of the key things is just making sure you have a good baseline because it's like once you a lot of people make the mistake of like this is kind of like mediated by default through us like you have to get a baseline to even like see where you're at before you would get even recommended to do anything but a lot of people they get on hormones before they have a baseline and then they just like don't know what they're looking at after they're on it and if you have a problem and you've shut down your system via hormones and you're trying to like retroactively figure out what happened in one when and wrong it's pretty difficult to see what like the change was that was marked and like significant that led you to where you are that might be you know a problem so if you have like a reasonably comprehensive baseline that assesses the hematology CMP that assesses your kidney status via sustenance estimated GFR or a SDA May which is like a symmetric symmetric dim it's another marker more progress mark for kidney function that is a proxy for anyone clearance with relative accuracy which is like the gold standard of actual GFR for kidney filtration capacity for your distance where you could just type in ADMA and STMA and you'll see what the acronym stands for I think you've talked about on your show too I don't know what this stands for either yeah one of the asymmetric dimethyl originate in one's yeah so one of the successes a vast so dilation potential and one is more like a for cardiovascular one is more of like a kidney marker that is equivalent or slightly better than sustenance estimated GFR which is not influenced by muscle mass creatinine intake or the array of things that can cause transient complete like to the point of it being unusable changes in the marker because creatinine calculated EGFR the amount of guys I've seen think that they're on borderline like death store of kidney failure from a creatine that's high because they're you know a muscle bound guy who takes creatine and like works out harder whatever it's like it's startling that this isn't more widely known so either of those two kind of like strong proxies for anyone clearance you have your kind of metabolic parameters to see your insulin sensitivity, human global anyone see you know all the kind of basics um I think the lipid panel definitely a baseline HDL to see how much it gets lowered by the dose of testosterone you're using because you will likely see a suppression if you are elevating your testosterone beyond what you are at doesn't mean that it's bad or good it's just worth noting like how much of a deterioration it has based on your dose because that's one of the proxies we're kind of like an energetic activity SHBG your binding proteins like what's your baseline relative to after because if you are injecting infrequently or a dose that is significantly suppressive like it might otherwise be a proxy for like using more than you might need not necessarily the case always but SHBG will get suppressed dramatically by exogenous and regions in a dose dependent manner so it's not uncommon to see what bodybuilders are using full-blown steroid cycles SHBG levels in the single digit which is like you have essentially no regulation of androgen exceedingly at that point it's just like everything's flying around so with guys on TRT it's like worth knowing where you stood to begin with and then how much a decrease because it's like if you didn't know the baseline too any of your diet changes at that point the carbon impulations the exercise change the caloric intake change the sleep you had a no idea what the impact thing was for sure that impact to the SHBG if you didn't have the baseline so um what else as far as assessing um free tea and total tea measured through the accurate asses which would be the gold standard for total testosterone is the liquid chromatography of a tandem mass spectrometry if you use an equilibrium if you use a immunocytes test which is like the cheaper version often it will be relatively inaccurate especially at lower like more low levels it is like notoriously inaccurate because the very low numbers like you need to be more specific so like with women especially like you don't want to be messing around with the amino asset test you want to be using sensitive asset extra dial every single time sensitive asset testing for total tea and for free testosterone you don't want to be using a calculation ideally you would want to be measuring through equilibrium ultra filtration or equilibrium dialysis which are like actual measurements not estimate based on calculations um it's kind of what I recommend I would recommend and then extra dial is LC and S as well the same as what you use for total testosterone and what else um probably missing some stuff basically liver markers to be the have like oh so this stuff is going to get directly affected the most by androgens though is going to be like your genatotropans lhnfsh they're going to be in the ground and if they're not it kind of indicates that you don't have adequate either androgen or estrogen signaling it would be odd if you're on testosterone replacement your lhnfsh won't like at the bottom of the barrel it would almost be questioning at that point like am I having something inhibit the androgens from working or the estrogen is it's like you could theoretically blunt estrogen mediated feedback by using you know an aromatase inhibitor or a serm or something and like blunt that response and you would see in your blood work it'd be like your body still thinks it needs to make more natural testosterone and you know it's kicking up the genatotropans so if you're on like true replacement those levels should be like not like even present essentially um which is odd like seeking to have like a bottom known number as like what the target is um that would kind of indicate you've definitely kind of like satisfactory replaced to what you need to stimulate like the negative feedback um yeah and I mentioned the lipids um yeah I'm definitely missing something but fast the insulin some of the insulin resistance markers and um there's some stuff you should probably check like baseline like clotting risks you know predispositions uh factor five latent you know things like this um L people at a lay at baseline especially because androgens suppress L p little a uniquely which a lot of people don't realize is affected by androgens which is typically not something could be manipulated through anything really that I'm aware of through like diet and lifestyle so you might think you have like uh I don't know you might have like I think you have a better L p little lay than you actually had a baseline so like your genetics might be like masked a bit by your endogenous um I don't know thyroid balance you know thyroid levels are good to have how much TSH do you have you know T4 T3 the free balance of those hormones IGF1 none of these are like critical necessarily but there's worth having for basic health assessments and to see where you land but like yeah it's basically like your total test your free test your estradile the free levels um sensitive assay measurements L H F H H E hematology H D L kind of like the basics metabolic health insulin sensitivity metrics I think are kind of like the critical baseline ones. It's a great comprehensive yeah I don't I don't imagine everyone is doing that uh well fortunately a lot of good panels was just like have it for you like it's not like you would ever be expected to remember all that stuff and I'm probably missing like I'm sure I like I can't remember it all I'd have to go look at our own pre-designed panels to tell you I probably should have done that at the beginning of the thing or other of rambling non-sensically so just briefly women you know this is another I'd love to know we've talked a lot of already about like testing methodology timing testing you know time of the day to test and all that stuff but you know how how does a woman go about like determining whether or not she has low testosterone he needs to kind of figure out dietary lifestyle wise like you know obviously that's the first blind of you know defense right you kind of dress that first but I just would like to talk about like generally speaking clinical symptoms and women sounds like it's pretty similar to men we talked about that um what females are a candidate for testosterone placement therapy like what's the actual reference range for women let's say they also have symptoms or maybe they just want to have some of the benefits of a little bit more testosterone as they're getting into perimenopause and um and such so yeah can we talk a little bit about like women yeah so the reference range I believe it's it's gonna depend on the lab of course but in general I believe lab corp is 15 to 70 nanograms per decilator so like the rough equivalent of you know a bit less than maybe like one tenth that of men um and for them defining low tea gets a bit more difficult because you're so close to like zero essentially that one if you're not doing sensitive enough testing like you're probably not gonna be accurate so that's where the it's super critical that you have these levels assessed accurately through the LCMS methodology that I mentioned um but also like are they doing anything that is extra-suppressive on top of all the stuff men already have to consider like contraceptives because it's like you could be artificially inducing a state of low tea that you otherwise wouldn't have and then maybe like self-diagnosing thinking that you have it like what you technically do maybe on paper but it's like self mediated through something that you were also prescribed that's like a hormone too so that gets a bit tough but in general it's a simplified like a lot of the stuff we just mentioned is like directly analogous to like what women should look to as well it's the same micro nutrients it's the same just a different scale and proportions the same eating enough calories and not starving yourself and leading to you know a manoria it's making sure you have like a normal you know menstrual period all this stuff um um up up uh and then yeah like you know the you know the the oral contraceptives is significant and worth noting if you're on that like you almost certainly are artificially suppressing yourself into like the equivalent of hypotarotaurator for women so if you're on it like I would probably check where you stand and you know decide if that's the medium you want to continue moving forward and for some women it works like it's not to say that that's something you shouldn't be on at all some women like that some women have like hyper and virgin leaning you know uh phenotypes and they might actually maybe benefit from some suppression it kind of depends like some women need to use like anti-antergence to maintain like a more neutral profile to not get like hersatism and whatnot which is like like hair growth that would be reflective of like masculine characteristics um so yeah like in general I'd be looking to that um basics symptom and symptoms and the biomarkers while there is a reference range of 15 to 70 I don't think you're ever gonna have a doctor who's not part of like I don't know like the more progressive kind of like preventive really on the cutting edge tell them for sure just because they were low or like clinically low that they should replace because there's not really like uh there's no FDA approved medication for women for testosterone in the US there isn't the Australia apparently which is kind of wild considering it's like the most regulated uh place ever that you there's like almost nothing's legal there but somehow like testosterone is for women shockingly but in uh the US everything's like awful able so you're gonna have to use like a male formulation and rangel and like apply like a pea size amount to your arm or something if you use it and then even that would be done with the oversight of like a pretty rigorous doctor ideally and one of the things that can point to is if somebody was to go on TRT as a woman one of the things that would be freaking most of them out is the side effect profile that are irreversible like for men side of here just deal if you had a bit of a deeper voice like it might be a benefit and you get a bit of her or whatever for women if you get irreversible voice deepening like that is quality of life destroying for some of them and you can't just fix it so one of the things I would absolutely do because there are a lot of doctors now that are like in the cutting edge that will overshoot women based on their more like liberal kind of like women should be optimal and like you they should be like 200 total to you and like I had one doctor even when I was like first getting into this industry who's like really respected I'm not gonna necessarily put them on blasts it's hopefully it's kind of fixed his protocols but he had a cookie cutter protocol that was like way too aggressive and like I could uh he had my mom on the protocol and I picked up the phone one day and like I didn't even recognize her voice I was like what the hell and fortunately we like got her off in immediately and it's sort of like self regulated in some extent but it was like fast and aggressive and blatant and I was like if I wasn't looking for this like she could have been like for sure viralized to the point of an unrecognizable voice within a matter of weeks yeah yeah so you gotta be like hyper aware even if you think you have like the most knowledgeable guy overseeing you I would recommend downloading like a really vetted and highly reviewed app that monitors your actual like tone of your voice to assess any sort of changing inflection tonality deepness because that's the only thing that will assess in real time that change without just some subjective assessment from your like significant other or something because eventually if you don't when you're seeing yourself every day and it's like micro changes you don't really notice and then all of a sudden one day you notice in the mirror you have hair loss or all of a sudden you have like you know hair on your lip that you didn't have or somebody tells you like your voice sounds deeper and you didn't even realize it was happening this stuff is insidious but it will still creep up quick and you might not notice the changing tremendously because you're so either the changes are still like on a daily basis you might not notice yourself but also a lot of women are kind of with even some of them are willing to like overlook it because they feel so good with the protocol it's like my quality of life is so great now I don't want to mess with anything and they'll just stay the course and then like fuck themselves up and they don't need to they could have got the same symptom really felt like a much lower dose so wow yeah you gotta be careful if you're a woman like replacing test especially because it's uh we're a lot of doctors that like especially the ones that have cookie cut up protocols that are like you know everyone should get to a total of you know 200 to 300 like might be a bit aggressive maybe she's like you know yeah I mean especially as you're mentioning like the the range is so small for us right women that like I mean I I'm concerned like even trying I mean I don't know if I need it right now but so you know I'm not saying that I'm going to but you know for women that like do go and get a test again we don't even know that they got the right test maybe it wasn't even sensitive enough right and so now they're getting on testosterone replacement therapy and then it's like you know it feels like kind of like the wild west in a way right like you mentioned it's there's no FDA approved TRT for women so it's off-label you're kind of just yeah go and I don't know it feels like uncharted territory so yeah you know I mean like there's definitely a way to go about it that I think is net beneficial for sure it's not like clinically like this one there's a guideline that says like at this level equals you know you're the equivalent of hypogonaddle and you should be on testosterone like it's always going to be an awfulable recommendation based on a assessment of like what kind of net benefit you would hopefully get out of it which for a lot of people with a responsible use in menopause would probably be in that benefit if they needed it but your deterioration and testosterone production is not going to diminish to the same degree of velocity as your estrogen and progesterone that essentially plummet into nothingness like a lot of the testosterone is mediated through adrenal synthesis and like peripheral tissue conversion it's not all ovarian so like your the proportion of how much testosterone you make in each area is not going to be equivalent women to women it's going to change depending you know individual genetics so like you might not have that big of a drop in testosterone or even like the perceived impact of that drop relative to another woman it might not be nearly a significant like you might be totally fine and menopause just being on estrogen and progesterone micronized or whatever um it all depends and that's where like and a new one's assessment and like no cookie cutter protocol it's like there are general guidelines of kind of like where to start with things but like that's the reason you have to be like insanely educated about the stuff going in especially for your a woman using like an off label prescription of something that is not FDA approved like there could be a huge quality of life bump but like you got to know what you're doing when you go in and like it sounds bad you almost like got to know what the ideal protocol is for you like before the doctor tells you you have to like find the doctor who like even though his response was crazy yeah you've got to do your due diligence you got to educate yourself no I mean this with podcasts like this from her as well and if you find that there's a um a way that you could get there like for example if you found out you were like adrenal insufficient for example like there are natural things that you could do on the women's side like DHA I'm sure at some point we would have ended up talking about not meaningfully impactful for men's testosterone levels because the majority is driven through intratusicular testosterone production but for women because you only have such a amount like you know 15 to 70 total a significant chunk of that could be driven through DHA mediated conversion and if that is the case in your low DHA via an assessment of the biomarker DHA as typically as a proxy sulfated DHA you may highly benefit from like a basic DHA oral supplement that's like you know uh easier to protect what's going to happen it's like an actual marker you can point to as deficient based on like a validated you know clinical biomarker and you know exactly what happens when like like there isn't a it could convert technically to different metabolites but in general women respond favorably to an adequate DHA dose when warranted for testosterone conversion like I've seen pretty dramatic changes to the degree of women on combined oral contraceptives attenuating entirely the loss in testosterone production via the pregesting and estrogen induced suppression through the DHA so like by that I mean starting off with like a 70 total T getting suppressed down to like you know 30 years something on your combined oral contraceptive taking DHA and getting back up to 70 while you're still on the combined oral contraceptive. What kind of dose of DHA? 25 to 50 would be like what you've seen the studies but I would start lower for sure just to see how you respond because it is again an androgen and women some of them respond pretty aggressively with acne flare ups and anrogenic side effects and it should still be treated with the respect that it deserves because it's an androgen it will still mediate similar side effects and some women don't respond favorably to it and like you know testosterone could be warranted depending on the person you just gotta know like the dose is like really really small and like it's probably like a tiny little blip of cream or gel like whatever you're using it's probably going to be uh just be like a wear of you know an extremely cautious about like who you're deferring to for information on it because it's not something you want to mess with without like knowing exactly where your dose should theoretically put you on like a reference range and like what that might yield in terms of symptom relief or like benefit quality of life of an array of people that are trusted in the they don't like widespread community for this kind of stuff and you you know multiple opinions not just like one guy who you know is a cowboy dog. Totally yeah no this is great info um kind of the last topic to to get to and we've already sort of touched on it was like some of the side effects of maybe perhaps some of this engine you know therapy or hormone replacement therapy hair loss and this is a thing I know you've personally talked about it's it's very interesting and I sort of just want to talk about it out of my own my own interests like why why does hair loss occur like what is the role of DHT in that process you know it's kind of a crazy thing how in this day and age we have like advanced AI stuff we have like all these like cutting edge treatments for you can like literally completely get rid of the likely of ASCVDs or crushing APO being like different things of this nature but like hair loss no one has a fucking clue what happens or how to prevent it without just crushing your DHT levels essentially which is wild that that's still a thing but as long as I've been researching this stuff there's been people that are like oh the you know the solutions on the horizon like every two weeks you'll see some viral article on Twitter like you see a lady scientist found like wrote in regroup all his hair after shaved from like random thing like oh my god D ribos is the solution I'm gonna dump it on my head you should see the nutty shit that people on like red it and whatnot dump on the head yeah thanks for a fan was one two it went wrongly sprouts on the head didn't end up working though um I'm sure it has like some like indirect benefit for like systemic health at the end of the day the unfortunate reality inherently in the name of what it is is what is causing it which is an energetic, androgen mediated alipisa so the mineralization of hair follicles mediated by androgens primarily the one that is the most potent in its androgenic activity which is DHT and these hormones it's not just like they convert and then have like in the in the blood or like at the liver or something that is like tissue specific concentrations of enzymes that are more prominent and in particular in the skin in the scalp especially too you will have there's way more five alpha reductase density in men for converting testosterone to DHT so that like local reaction where you converting more test, or on into DHT is resulting in like a significantly high per surface area amount of DHT than like any almost any other area in the body with exception of like other other skin areas that are hairy you know the prostate as well like the scrotum when you apply the cream like you actually get a bit of a disproportionate spike in DHT and mention earlier but anyway in the scalp highly expressing five alpha reductase and that conversion seems to be what mediates androgenic alipisa and essentially all cases there are some fringe cases in men where okay you might have a nutrient deficiency or you might have some weird genetic predisposition that was totally corrected by adding in fill in the blank thing or you had undiagnosed hypothyroidism or what have you typically not the case typically it's pattern hair loss, mineralization of the hair follicle and if a lot of people unfortunately get misled by these like crazy you know wild stories like oh the solutions on the horizon I just like wipes them broccoli on your head oh do this and they just lose their hair and there's no recovery because unfortunately what happens is if you leave it for too long the area starts to undergo fibrosis so it's not like it's something that you can necessarily recover to baseline if you're completely slick bald the scalp environment is no longer habitable to like healthy hair follicles that are like you know your original hair you're not going to grow it back probably until it starts like cloning hair follicles are something so you kind of got to get in front of it similar to ASCVD is absurd as it sounds like before it starts stacking because it's something that's cumulative and in city is an overtime eventually all of a sudden to problem so when you're young you know why is it this is one of the stupidest things to hear why is it that when you're DHT levels are at their highest when you're young you have no hair loss but then when you're old you have hair loss it's like the same reason that you've been stacking, placking your order since you were like a teenager like it's cumulative so being preventative and proactive is the name of the game and it comes to hair loss and I'm not to say that like there isn't a solution that exists in the planet that somehow addresses the downstream cascade of like you know TGF beta and like you know the the WNT pathway all this fringe stuff that is a result of the Androgen induced transcriptional activity but at the end of the day nothing seems to be potent enough to attenuate whatever is happening downstream so like the net result is the follicle literally like Starves itself and miniaturizes like the follicle becomes weaker thinner and over time the anrogen phase which is like the growth phase of the hair follicle shortens shortens shortens and over time you're just like shedding weaker and weaker hair and it's growing back thinner and thinner and eventually it's so thin sparse and insignificant cosmetically that you can't even see it and it's just like these follicles of essentially died and gone undergone literal apoptosis because each one is an organ and itself individually and once it dies like it's not can just come back from the dead and in that area you know fibrosis or undergoes fibrosis and like you're screwed and that's spot essentially unless you transplant non-agia androgenic alopecia effect of hair follicles into that dead zone but like you need a lot of hair to offset like a completely bald head and it's like typically not possible if you've let yourself get too far gone so and it's really interesting too because these hair follicles they're not prone to the same miniaturization so like even if you transplant it from here to here like it's not gonna undergo the same effect even though it's like in that area interestingly enough but these hair follicles are like highly prone to miniaturization if you are susceptible to hair loss what makes you susceptible to hair loss genetics but in general are you gonna bank on you being the one guy like how many guys do you know who 50 years old plus have like no visible hair loss whatsoever and it looks like they did when they were 19 years old my dad but his hair's gray but it's just literally the same is that actually yeah yeah yeah full stick like okay how to hair but it's just white I feel very thick yeah but it's it's now he's an ally or for sure and you you have a son you said I do oh he must be using me thrilled then is it if you get a mom side typically it's thought to be the mom's dad it doesn't always play out like that's it always does but like that's a good he might not have to take you know the hormone crushing drugs he might be one of the fringe lucky ones oh we will talk about the proactive I mean so you know what what are these proactive measurements that can be done that to grow actively as unfortunate of a reality as it is you have to weigh the risk to reward on inhibiting DHT so how far ahead of you get of this kind of impacts how intensive of a protocol you have to use as well as your like susceptibility to that endogenic stimulation which is also going to be contingent on your hormone level so if you're you know hypogonaddle and then you correct that and bump yourself up to you know high normal like you might have doubled your endogenous load in your scalp for all you know and the proportional increases like magnified multiple fold because it's more five-alph or a ductase expression in the scalp than like anywhere else essentially so getting in front of it the only thing like how they developed these drugs was they found that individuals that had a mutation in the gene that encodes for five-alph or a ductase seem to not undergo full sexual maturation in adolescence and they would end up with shockingly the same amount of muscle mass as like you know they're like for example siblings who weren't affected but inhibited a maturation of genitals for example like not full that often end up with like a micro penis that's like where that comes from typically but also no facial hair growth really and no temporal recession is like one of the pal marks of yeah the they're called pseudo hermaphrodites which is like I don't know male pseudo hermaphrodites and maybe that's not like I put a correct term now but that's what they are on the literature and it is literally these individuals have no inhibition in their capacity to produce testosterone it is all the DHC now it doesn't mean that testosterone doesn't also have a similar effect on hair follicles it's just the magnitude of effect is so much less that if you get in front of it like day one unless you're highly susceptible the inhibition via inhibiting that enzyme is likely going to be sufficient to offset loss for your visibly for your entire life because it's a progressive thing and you won't even notice the cosmetic difference in hair density until you've lost like 25 plus percent of your hair so like if I pull a hair on my head right now visibly we look no different if I pull two hairs on my head we look visibly no different but once you start to get to like tens of thousands of hair follicles you have on average depending on the ethnicity but like it's like 70 to like 80,000 upwards of 100,000 hair follicles on your head once you've gone to the point that you'd down like 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 all of a sudden you're starting to see visibly like in downlight and you can see through your scalp and you couldn't before you're starting to see yourself in pictures and you're like oh that's weird like I don't remember seeing I have to like part my hair we were now to cover the spot like the whole thing went on and then like one day it hits you and it's devastating and you're just like shit I guess I am prone to hair loss I thought I was immune this whole time it's not the kiss yeah yeah that's rough that's depressing okay so now I certainly don't want to leave a part of that saying you know in finance right we're detached from a very astray screwed like there's an ROI calculation to be made similar to any sort of hormonal therapy that is not to be minimized there are side effect profiles with these drugs just as there is with any drugs but I would compel you to look at the actual literature and assess what the prevalence was among those who were subjected to DHT deprivation in finance right users and detached right and it is not much different than placebo in very very rigorous and significant high number of subject studies that were well well constructed studies like this is not something that a lot of it is media driven it's not to be ignored some people have devastated but it's a minority of individuals and it's just kind of like do you want to be one of those individuals who takes the risk or not there are ways to assess if you're more likely to be one of those individuals if you were a low androgen status individual to begin with for example I have low normal free testosterone with a borderline you know hypogonatal looking DHT level to begin with and I'm still already having hair loss like and I already have symptoms will crushing my DHT to nothing be more likely to result in a side effect than somebody who's like vital no side like thriving no issues whatsoever seemingly like there is an androgen load component to assess like how significant of an impact that might have on your ability to support functions driven through androgens because it's like every person is going to have a some degree of impact it just might not be perceivable in any noticeable way whatsoever like you might have like a some like few percent deterioration to your nitric oxide capacity in your erection boy you notice that I don't know depends on the person in a study that doesn't seem like the prevalence is very significant and shockingly do task right is a similar side effect profile to finasteride even studies comparing them or you have near full inhibition of systemic DHT versus only 60 to 70 percent of the if an asteroid which only inhibits two of the three iso enzymes in the scalp so it's like it's not there's a side effect profile it's just overblown by media but it's not zero and it's definitely worth reading the literal studies yourself before you come to an opinion because there will be people who try and plant their opinion and their subjective assessment based on their experience in your mind like oh I had no side effects it's fine just get on a brodoinary but or I had the worst experience ever and ruined my life it's gonna fuck you up join my lawsuit to superk you know that's like the kind of like disparity in these communities and they will have like some it's it's not like they're both wrong like everyone has their own individual drug response and some people have like the most insane response to Tylenol and only it's not like anything is risk free in this world so just be aware that these are ultimately hormone therapies that you're getting on like it's not it will also not dramatically but could suppress fertility metrics mildly because intratistic healer androgenic signaling does dictate spermantigenesis that includes DHT so like if you're reducing the DHT a lot that might impede your fertility the stomachs then too if even if you're natural and have no you know testosterone therapy or like a u-genatyl male but yeah the most impactful therapy for sure intervention wise is going to be inhibiting DHT the degree to which you inhibited will be dictated on how susceptible you are but if you nuke DHT into nothingness via high dose due to asteroid it's pretty difficult if not near impossible to lose heresumail now the most susceptible might need to be on a topical anti-androgen or maybe their side effect profile will be superior with a lower DHT inhibition and some sort of adjunct topical anti-androgen therapy with it or some topical five-alpha reductase inhibition with the topical anti-androgen it's all kind of like a bit of a strategy approach based on your individual risk profile and the way you want to take but if you don't attenuate miniaturization potential like you're not going to prevent hereloss you could take monoxidol they you could take all the pump concedoial, sapel metodumsel for a fan on your head whatever you want like it's not going to move the needle for inhibiting miniaturization mediated through androgens which is ultimately what it is and for females PCOS females like it doesn't take that much of an androgens burden to start to miniaturize like it's pretty quick and noticeable and most hairloss outcomes with women come from autoimmune related alopecia aerogata Hashimoto styroider's nutrient deficiencies things of this nature they're typically not in a pattern of like androgen related miniaturization but when it is it's like often pretty obvious why and it's just more rare so like you know when people want to speculate about what cause it what doesn't cause it's like the largest anecdotal experiment plays out in a real life everyday with men vs women aging and it's like who's the ones with hairloss like the guy it's like I know the most dialed of bio hackers with infinite resources who are still bald as hell regardless of all the special stuff they tried that wasn't like the drugs that work and it didn't work unfortunately I would love to have a natural therapy that moves the needle but at least for me and what my knowledge the extent of it it's that DHT inhibition is almost a necessity if you're prone to air loss the capacity to which to do it is dictated by genetics androgen load in the scalp and free androgenic signaling and your risk profile will be dictated by your own you know tolerance based on your interpretation of the scientific literature and then there's some adjunct stuff like once you attenuate the miniaturization potential through the androgen related activity in the scalp that's where you can then look to you can have a bit of a top up like kida conzo shampoo for example it's like a mild anti-androgen to that could add some additive protection on top of let's say you're on finasteride instead of the more nuclear do-taste ride and you feel like that risk profile is superior for example get a conzo does help their studies showing anti-quivalent to the hair growth results of 2% minoxidol via a totally different mechanism which is like very significant for something that's taken over the counter shampoo that also you can get that attenuated dandruff to some extent suborbidimate dermatitis can improve the scalp environment to your scalp environment to some extent depending on I don't know if you're prone to like I don't know fungal overgrowth for example but in general it's like a mild 5-alph reductase inhibitor in topical anti-androgen that's just like a good shampoo that doesn't require like the risk profile of a finasteride due to asteroid but it's like typically for most people not going to be sufficient to offset it unless you're like mildly very lightly prone that's where you need to like layer up with the 5-alph reductase inhibition form suitically and then minoxidol is the growth stimulant those FDA approved and the works reliably it's just hit remiss if it works based on your own enzymatic conversion capacity so it needs to convert into minoxidol sulfate in the scalp to actually work and if you have inadequate sulfote transporase enzyme activity it will not you can be a total non-responder even though you're using the full drug dose every day those individuals either have a issue with the scalp environment like they're not getting it into our needs because with topical some of the problem often is just like your scalp either is unhealthy the environment or it's not clean enough or like you're not using a high enough dose of the drug at all depends on the person and the formulation that you're using but in general if you're using it properly and it'll high enough dose you'll be limited by this enzymatic pathway and there are ways to upregulate it one is compounding the monoxidol with treetinoin which can upregulate the sulfate transporase enzyme and allow more of that conversion to take place and then there's micro-needling which also seems to be pretty dramatic turning some non-responders into like significant responders or magnifying the results like multiple fold for people who are responding just not as well as it could be either driven through lack of adequate absorption and or lack of adequate sulfate transporase enzyme activity that also seems to be upregulated via this like manual like micro damage essentially later some crazy studies with individuals who've like burned their scalp that had balding and then they ended up like a regrowing hair after which is pretty weird. The like the recruitment of growth factors that like you wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for that like dramatic event now obviously no one's gonna light their head on fire hopefully but that's a thing. So with the respect to the the topical you know strategies like the monoxidol I mean obviously what what are the side effects of that is that. So it's like a very terrible blood pressure drug so it was originally prescribed for a high blood pressure as a lonesum or yeah. I thought it was taco. Yeah so what they found when they prescribed it for blood pressure decades ago was that one of the side effects besides like people like fainting when they're standing up or having a low blood pressure or water retention was hair growth everywhere including their scalp significantly. So are like huh maybe we can take this drug and repurpose it for a topical for hair growth because it's like essentially a really bad blood pressure drug with a black box warning on it and they did successfully and now it's known to be like the growth stimulant for your hair and seems to avoid a lot of that systemic side effect profile that comes with the oral formulation. Some people still use the oral formulation dermatologists have seemingly adopted it. I would say a little bit haphazardly without really accepting the risk profile accordingly because it's like a pretty it is a bit of a sketchy primitive drug or really especially because the liver has so much sulfo trans raise enzyme conversion enzyme activity that leads to the main oxytl sulfate conversion that you get systemically it leads to some people like pericardial if fusion like water retention, dysregulation of electrolate balance it gets a potassium channel opener and that's how it works and systemically it has a much more significant side effect profile than topically and it's not uncommon to see people even micro dosing it getting arethmias and like talking about like chest pains like freaking out and going to hospital and it's a lot of people just get chucked on it like low dose but it's still low enough it's still high enough that it causes like these problems and some people works really well though but topically it's like the most benign at least entry level way where you can not you can get over the counter like you can just buy it off Amazon or Red Costscore or whatever um way more likely that you won't undergo side effects using it topically and there are some studies many studies that show like similar benefit profiles it's just like a bit more of a nuisance because it's topical and you have to adhere to the protocol but like you know blackbox warning drug from like you know pre 2000 for blood pressure versus like the topical reiteration that is like likely not to cause that worst case scenario you can elevate the efficacy profile by trying to threaten no one with it trying to mend the micro needleing within it if it doesn't work like maybe at that point look at the the oral if you want but like that's kind of like the escalation risk um is the threat knowing oral or topical you would get like compounding pharmacy so formulate it with a monoxidol because you can't buy that over the counter and that would be like you would now have gone to the pharmaceutical route at that point because you would typically what I would do if it were me is like I'd serve it the monoxidol topically if no response I would probably look at micro needleing to ensure there's actual absorption occurring and or the enzyme activity that can be manipulated via that manual cause it's not an extra drug that I'm adding it's just like manual like micro damage essentially that I do once a week and nuisance literature reveals that you might be able to get away with only doing a 0.6 millimeter depth as opposed to the old studies had everyone doing 1.5 which was like guaranteed to draw blood like I have some of my old YouTube videos were like I have like a bloody scalp in the video because of like the depth that I would I would be going to it to be you know using this uh the devices so 0.6 seems to be potentially uh as efficacious with less of a cosmetic issue quicker recovery etc and it's not it's not more drugs it's something that like I recover from quicker my scalp seemingly you know as are some potential downstream issues to hitting my scalp with that once a week I don't know but like so far so good from a lot of the data that I've seen and like for me using it and then from there I would escalate to like the pharmaceutical compound it route at that point if you needed to with like the no compounded monoxidol it's funny that micro needleing like I'm interested in it for skin effects and so yeah people use on the face too like oh yeah so I you know it is something I'm going to do and when I went to my dermatologist and saw like some of the brochures with their studies like because my dermatologist does actual research and it was funny in the brochure it was like there was like this whole hair loss area to the micro needleing some of the stem cell growth factors that they use and I was like hmm what's going on here and I was like oh so it's like regrowing hair and she was like yeah we've done like a small study and we added some it was like a combination of growth factors that are involved in like you know stem cell production and the hair follicle and so I'm wondering if like you that's what I was like interested in the micro needleing too with the hair was like oh so they're essentially just making it better absorbed you're like you're getting whereas if you were to put some seen as stem cell factors on just your scalp like it's just not gonna get absorbed really yeah I think the majority of the benefit is the likely mediated via ensuring adequate absorption of the drug because when you do micro needleing on its own like versus monoxid on its own versus micro needleing plus monoxid like it's not a comparable outcome in terms of like you would expect the micro needleing alone group to be very significant if it was recruiting some sort of local growth factors that were dramatic it seems more like it's probably in ensuring you're actually getting this to where it was supposed to go to begin with but maybe wasn't getting fully assimilated which is fine if that's what it does it's just like that's what some people need in order to get the absorption but it could be like the difference of four acts of results I've seen in some studies so that seems like a legit pathway for for some men that are like a little bit skittish about potential side effects with the oral drugs as well because like the finastroid and do what is the other one do test ride you know you mentioned the the erection but like is there are are there any other serious side effects with those that are really good logical potentially through the balance of like neurotransmitters and zeolytic versus like there's a whole rabbit hole to go down of like inhibition of alipregnant alone which is thought to be the main thing implicating postpartum depression being deprived of it and there's a literal pharmaceutical that was developed to like manually restore that and women that just had birth and have postpartum depression and it seems to be efficacious and seemingly by inhibiting five-alpha reductase he may be inhibiting that like gab or geosegling through that like anti-lidic kind of like calming thing uh molecule essentially and it results in kind of like a depends on the person I think get pretty severe I'm sure you've seen um or at least you know depending on if you're seeing a podcast or people to talk about it or not but I've heard of this like post do test or are post finastroid syndrome you'll never have you you'll never hear about post do test rides syndrome though you know it's a way more potent drug because it's largely a media driven construction it's not to say it's not real there's definitely side effects from these drugs but like there's a huge nissy bow effect that comes with these drugs where you know I have friends who get on and they're like dude I swear like you know my penis is not working like I used to I'm like dude like you're probably fine like don't worry about it and it's like they've read all the stuff that could happen and they're convinced they just like killed the ability to you know hapsect or something and it's like you know the no-sibo effect is absolutely real insignificant and I think it's accounting for a large proportion of people who think they are affected because you can actually know sebo yourself into like real side effects by believing you have that for sure it's very real yeah and there's actually believe it not there's genes that you can there's SNPs that are known that you can look at and even 23 of me does measure these SNPs for placebo versus no sebo and so like some people are more like susceptible to a placebo effect where they like believe in something and it's gonna happen and I'm like like I'm taking on my creatine and I'm like yes I'm like I'm not getting sleepy in the afternoon and it could be placebo but I don't care because it's a real effect right no sebo effect is the same and again there's steps that like some people that have those steps are more susceptible to to believing that something is harming them if they're like aware of those things and so yeah well that's interesting to know but clarifying click on the monoxial though it's a growth stimulant it does absolutely nothing that we know of to attenuate the mineralization caused by DHG so like the only strategy that works is attenuating androgenic activity via either like the mild ketoconeslo which probably is not going to be sufficient but like over the counter pretty benign helpful good champion veraulus that's why I use it but financial energy test right or topical anti-endrogen probably going to be necessary for most monoxials that thing used to regrow hair it's not the thing that prevents loss you can cause medically offset the visual perception of loss via the growing of hair but it does absolutely nothing to prevent the further mineralization so at some point if you just use monoxidil you will have a net catch up where you miniaturize to the point that you are caught up with what you've grown and then you blast past it and you still end up losing your hair okay I see so what you can still delay the visual perception of it still if here's somebody who wants to avoid inhibiting hormones entirely yeah that's a strategy it's still like biting time transplants by time you know it all makes it different yeah but essentially if you want to completely bypass it you have to get you have to inhibit essentially you have to like turn your scalp into a female okay well interesting stuff and your mild exaggeration well like you got it and you're and you're you've been doing this yourself yeah I've been on due tasks right now for years and at least to date I have had no perceivable detriment to my cognitive state to my sexual function to anything that I would point to and I know a lot of individuals that I respect in you know the anti-aging longevity community who also use it and think that it's you know a reasonable enough risk profile for them and that's not to say that I that means I endorse it or I don't endorse it I just use it and I've been okay today not going to win because maybe it's something will happen I don't know either any long-term studies looking at yeah because like these are drugs that are used for pro benign prosthetic hyperplasia and even at dosages up to like 2.5 milligrams daily of due tasks where it has been used with great success with individuals with like no you know like a minority of prevalence of side effects and like the relatively minor from what I've seen the longest study that I know of off the top my head like there's definitely studies assessing follow-ups of individuals who've been on it for like a decade plus I think have they looked at like all cosmortality or any of these like if any I'll get this is going to be a controversial one but my speculation is that if anything these would net or increase your longevity because they're decreasing endogenic stimulation significantly because DHC is literally the most endogenic hormone in your body and if you're inhibiting it and you're just left with the testosterone and the anabolic activity because DHC is entirely inactivated in muscle tissue so you get no muscle growth benefit. Grated dose response studies using due tasks right alongside testosterone even at super dosages the due tasks right getting wiped out had no impact whatsoever on strength and muscular hypertrophy so like there's no benefit muscular early to DHC in any capacity as an adult which is notable because a lot of people think their physique is going to deteriorate if they use one of these drugs not the case has no impact on it whatsoever so I would think especially somebody who's on TRT and like candidly I don't take enough to put me at 400 total T like I taken off to put me at like 800 and like my free tea is like the high normal I think that the due tasks right like probably whatever like excitotosit toxicity or cardio toxicity that I might otherwise be like net netting over into like an area I wouldn't want I would anticipate and speculate that the DHC reduction is probably inhibiting that whatever detriment might be there to some magnitude to be wrong but like I have a net increase in an intritissue aromatization from the inhibition and the 5A R enzyme so like in you know all the tissues that would otherwise be like pro longevity from estrogen locally you're getting a benefit you're getting the proportional increase of 15 to 20% of intratissue estridile and if you don't have any side effect from that if anything you would think okay well it's probably uh vasodilative it's probably like more pro antioxidant it's probably less excitotoxic it's probably less gloomit gloominurgic like all the stuff that is going to be potentially damaging of I don't killing a brain cells this is a speculative thing though I wouldn't hang my head on that or tell anybody that that is the case I do think if there's some sort of direct study though that would be interesting that I was just going to say the same thing pretty sure there is some anti-aging studies on do finance run due to transfer that might I wish we could pull up but we don't have the yeah well something to dive into later for sure and maybe you know it'd be nice to have a study to see like people that are on tier T and you know doing these these antigen you know blockers like how how that affects life expectancy or cardiovascular related disease right so and just like wrap it up on the hair loss front like just because I do something like it does not mean I endorse it because it's a very controversial topic side effects are real not to be ignored some people they deemed the risk profiles worthwhile to the benefit they get the depression and mental anguish they endure from going bald might outweigh the risk profile it's all an individual decision don't listen to a guy on a podcast who tells you he uses something as your indicator if you should use a heavily hormone modulating drug like these are like very significant drugs that should be respected accordingly yeah yeah for real thank you well this has been a very interesting conversation Derek we've been talking for I mean just hours I don't even have hours eight was that your first double pod back yeah was my first back to back yeah especially like long yeah back to long podcast back to back so it's been it's been a fun day talking to you thank you so much for coming on the show talking all things hormones very informative I've learned a lot I have a lot to look into I learned you know I've made no mental notes of things that I want to look into and I'll go back and when I look at the read the episode again read the transcript the episode I'll go back and look at some of these studies so thank you so much for coming on the show and you obviously have a big YouTube channel podcast called more played smart dates where else can people follow you you have your your healthcare company your miracles yeah I think miracles on social media is just at miracle health or the website is at miracle.com if you wanted to check it out and yeah I think I'm more played smart dates everywhere except Twitter I don't think that was a handle like you yet so I think I'm just Derek fitness there but yeah that's that's me awesome well thanks so much Derek thank you for having me I appreciate it

Dr. Rhonda Patrick here, today we're going to go deep on coffee. We've spent the last month or so reading through all of the latest research on coffee and in this episode, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know about how to get the maximum health and longevity benefits while minimizing the negative side effects. The good news is that coffee can slow down your epigenetic aging clock, drop cardiovascular risk and sharpen cognition. But how you source your coffee, how you brew it and how you time it makes a big difference. And if done the wrong way, coffee can raise LDL, disrupt sleep, and you'll miss out on some of the benefits I just mentioned. So in this episode, we'll answer questions like how coffee actually slows down aging and how to maximize those benefits, which beans and roast levels are healthiest, why a paper filter matters for cholesterol and cancer risk. The best way to source and store your beans to avoid mold in your coffee. The exact caffeine dose for endurance, strength, and mental focus, which supplement you can take to reduce some of the side effects of coffee, such as the jitters, whether cream can blunt some of the positive benefits of coffee and much more. By the end of this episode, you'll know how to turn coffee into a precise, science-backed protocol for longer life, better metabolism, and peak brain performance. So let's get started. Science increasingly demonstrates that coffee actively slows biological aging. It protects cells from damage and helps the body adapt to stress, effectively slowing down aging at the cellular level. Biological aging is not just counting the chronological age. It's the actual rate at which your cells and tissues deteriorate. Your DNA accumulates damage and your body becomes more vulnerable to disease. One powerful way scientists measure this biological aging is through something called epigenetic age. How genes turn on and off as we age, reflecting the functional state of cells or tissues relative to chronological age. The faster your epigenetic clock runs, the quicker you age and the sooner diseases of aging appear. Here's the fascinating part, drinking coffee appears to actively slow this biological aging process. In fact, multiple large-scale studies show that regular coffee drinkers have significantly younger epigenetic age signatures compared to non-drinkers, meaning their DNA isn't just healthier, it literally behaves as if it's younger. For example, a recent analysis of nearly 16,000 people identified consistent changes in DNA methylation. These are the chemical marks controlling gene activity. At 11 distinct sites closely tied to inflammation, metabolism, the aging process itself. In another comprehensive US health survey, researchers found that each additional cup of coffee corresponded to about 0.12 years younger biological age. Even more strikingly, people who consumed three or more cups per day had a 34 to 41 percent lower chance of accelerated biological aging compared to non-drinkers. In a separate multi-ethnic study using advanced epigenetic clocks, further supported this. So regular coffee intake correlated with roughly 0.7 to a full year reduction in epigenetic age for each daily cup consumed. This effect appeared consistently across multiple robust measures of biological aging. Now, it's important to mention. These are observational studies, which means they can't prove direct causation yet. But the consistency across numerous rigorous analyses strongly suggests that coffee's bioactive components, things like the chlorogenic acids, caffeine, an antioxidant's form during roasting, are actively reshaping our epigenome. In other words, coffee may be literally rewiring our genetic expression to slow down aging at the cellular level, potentially extending health span, and consistent robust scientific evidence does show regular coffee drinkers do actually live longer, and not only that, they also experience lower rates of the deadliest chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and even certain cancers. We now know coffee impacts nearly every major biological mechanism underlying aging and chronic disease. First of all, coffee drinkers consistently have up to a 27 percent lower risk of dying from any cause than non-coffee drinkers. This translates to almost two extra years of life, and even de-caf coffee delivers a similar benefit. So this really suggests that compounds beyond caffeine like polyphenols and the chlorogenic acids do act as powerful anti-aging agents. For decades, coffee was actually thought to be bad for the heart. Turns out, that was wrong. Coffee significantly reduces cardiovascular disease risk by about 10 to 15 percent. Coffee consumption protects against heart attacks, stroke, and cardiovascular-related death. In here's where it gets even crazier. Contrary to expectations since coffee is generally contraindicated for aridmias, caffeine uniquely appears to reduce the risk of developing aridmias. And this was in a dose-dependent manner with two to three cups of daily coffee linked to 12 percent lower aridmiar risk and four to five cups associated with a 17 percent lower risk. Decaf doesn't offer this aridmiar protection, which really highlights caffeine's unique role in somehow stabilizing heart rhythms. Most people reach for the cup of coffee in the morning. When you drink your coffee actually matters, recent large-scale studies tell us something pretty fascinating. People who consume their coffee exclusively in the morning show significant longevity benefits compared to those who spread caffeine throughout the day. Specifically, morning coffee drinkers experience a 12 percent lower risk of death from all causes, and an impressive 31 percent lower risk of cardiovascular-related death compared to non-coffee drinkers. Spreading your coffee throughout the day, so in the morning afternoon and evening, didn't show the same health benefits. The protective effects seems unique to starting your day with coffee rather than drinking it continuously throughout the day. So why the morning? It really comes down largely to circadian biology. The internal clock governing our sleep wake cycles, hormone release, metabolism. So caffeine consumed late in the day, powerfully disrupts this clock. There's controlled laboratory studies that show that caffeine taken within about three hours of natural bedtime shifts the internal clock later by roughly 45 minutes to an hour. So this is like giving yourself a mini dose of jet lag every day. The result delayed melatonin release, disrupted sleep patterns, reduced deep sleep quality, and ultimately compromised health. But caffeine consumed early in the day actually works with your natural circadian rhythm. It supports alertness. It reinforces stable cortisol timing, and it may help anchor your internal clock optimizing your metabolism and cardiovascular health. So there seems to be a clear takeaway protocol for coffee timing. Consuming caffeine early, so aiming to stop caffeine at least 8 to 10 hours before your natural bedtime. For most people, that means cutting off caffeine around noon or the early afternoon. You also want to keep it moderate. So two to three cups of coffee in the morning is ideal. This range provides maximum protective benefits without negative circadian disruption. You can also drink de-caf coffee after noon. So if you love the taste of coffee, there's a little bit of a placebo effect as well. You get these benefits from the polyphenols if you drink the coffee later in the day. So you can actually choose de-caf to avoid interfering with your sleep quality. So in short, early caffeine intake seems to really align well with biological rhythms. It enhances cognitive performance during the day, protects against cardiovascular disease, and it maximizes coffee's powerful longevity benefits. But you don't want to continuously keep drinking it all throughout the day. Coffee also has powerful effects on metabolism, particularly the body's ability to regulate glucose and fat utilization. Regular coffee drinking, especially around two to three cups per day, consistently reduces the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In fact, studies show that drinking two to three cups of coffee daily can cut diabetes risk by as much as 60%. But why does coffee have such a profound metabolic benefit? One reason appears to be its ability to activate AMP kinase or AMP K for short. This is a central metabolic regulator inside of ourselves. It's activated when we're in a fasted stay in a caloric deficit after intense exercise or metabolic stress. Compounds in coffee like caffeine and the chlorogenic acids can actually flip that AMP K switch on, and that controls how ourselves process energy, how it manages glucose levels, and how our cells handle fats. When AMP kinase turns on, it tells the cell to burn fat, take up glucose, shut down growth pathways like M-tore. So by boosting AMP kinase activity, coffee actually helps the body become more efficient at using energy and maintaining healthier blood sugar levels. Chronic mild AMP K activation is a leading explanation, but it's not the only one. Improved gut microbiome composition reduced inflammation, enhanced fat oxidation, also play roles as well. There's a bit of a twist here because coffee can acutely raise fasting blood glucose in some individuals and may slightly decrease insulin sensitivity in the short term. Largely via acutic activation, but the overall long term effect is protective. It improves glucose tolerance, reduces triglyceride levels, and lowers long-term diabetes risk. So coffee seems to make our metabolic machinery healthier and more responsive and better able to protect itself against age-related metabolic disease. Believe it or not, coffee used to be labeled a potential carcinogen from the 1990s to about 2016. That was wrong. The label rested on weak confounded evidence, but a crillamide was really at the heart of it. A crillamide is a chemical form naturally when coffee beans are roasted as well as during the cooking of starchy foods at high temperatures. Although a crillamide has caused cancer and lab animals at very high doses, the levels typically found in coffee pose a minimal risk to humans. One standard bootcup delivers roughly 2-5 micrograms of a crillamide. You need to drink 25-50 cups a day to hit the conservative reference level, which is around 2 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day. What we now know is that coffee does not increase your cancer risk. In fact, it probably reduces it, particularly for certain major cancers, including liver cancer andometrial cancer and skin cancer. The evidence here is compelling. Each daily cup of coffee you drink is associated with roughly a 15-20% reduction in liver cancer risk and about a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer, with maximum benefit seen around 4-5 cups per day. Even the international agency for research on cancer recently acknowledged coffee's protective role, officially removing coffee from their list of possible carcinogens. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and it is the leading cause of death in Canada, Japan, and many Western European Union states. So it is important to pay attention to. Why does coffee have these powerful anti-cancer effects? Well, coffee doesn't just have anti-oxidant properties. It actively reduces DNA damage. This is one of the fundamental triggers of cancer. A compelling randomized controlled trial demonstrated that people drinking dark-roast coffee daily had a 23% reduction in their DNA double-stranded brakes compared to water alone. Now, DNA double-stranded brakes are among the most severe forms of genetic damage. To give you context, this is the type of damage you typically see from ionizing radiation, the kind that directly threatens your genetic code and your chromosomes, the structures that house your DNA. And this is not just the DNA integrity at stake. Chromosomal damage directly accelerates the shortening of telomeres, these are the tiny caps that protect our chromosomes from damage or DNA that's packaged in our chromosomes. And telomeres naturally shortened with age, but damage accelerates this process dramatically. And once the telomeres become critically short, our cells then enter a state known as senescence. This is kind of a cellular aging that not only drives the aging process itself, but also greatly increases our risk for chronic diseases including cancer. By actively reducing DNA double-stranded brakes, coffeemen at only protect against cancer directly, but also may help maintain telomere length thereby potentially slowing cellular aging and preserving genomics stability. And in fact, studies have found that regular coffee drinkers do have longer telomeres compared to non-copy drinkers. Mechanistically, coffee triggers are cells to activate something called NRF2. This is a master cellular switch that ramps up our body's own antioxidant defenses, including glutathione. This is enhancing our natural capacity for DNA repair. But coffee's protective effects go even broader. It also influences liver metabolism, hormone regulation, and inflammation, all critical on preventing cancers that thrive on metabolic dysfunction or hormone imbalance. Interestingly, decaffinated coffee consistently shows similar protective effects, which strongly suggests that beneficial compounds beyond caffeine, such as polyphenols and the melanoidins, are primarily driving these anti-cancer benefits. Coffee's health effects may actually start in the gut. Each cup of coffee delivers up to two grams of soluble fiber, plus a pharmacy of polyphenols, chlorogenic acids, melanoidins, diterpines, and trigoneline. In a 23,000-person natural microbiology data set, coffee was the single strongest dietary factor shaping the microbiome, enriching 115 bacterial species. One loss in Ibackter species shows up almost exclusively in habitual coffee drinkers, essentially acting as a microbial coffee fingerprint. What this bacterial species actually does is firmens coffee, fiber, and polyphenols into bioactive compounds, such as quinnic acid conjugate and short chain fatty acids. Short chain fatty acids tighten gut barrier integrity, dampen inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, and the quinnic acid metabolites flip on the NRF2 switch for anti-oxininactivity, and in animal models, even lower PCSK9, which is a regulator of LDL cholesterol clearance. This is early data, but intriguing for heart health. Sur randomized controlled trials actually back this up. Three cups of filtered coffee per day for eight weeks increased bifidobacterium and fecalibacterium abundance. These are both major, short chain fatty acid producers, and it did this without harming gut microbial diversity. So parallel rodent work shows that coffee melidoidens actually thicken the mucus layer, and it suppresses opportunistic pathogens from taking hold in the gut. And coffee dose does matter. The sweet spot appears to be two to four cups a day. That range reliably enriches short chain fatty acid producing bacteria while keeping the pro and flammatory strains in check. Go much higher in the data gets noisy and diversity shifts our study dependent. So I think the key takeaway here is that coffee, caffeinated or decaffinated acts as a prebiotic matrix. It has fibers, melanoidins, and polyphenols that feed the gut ecosystem that in turn generate metabolites linked to lower inflammation, that'll better cholesterol handling, and neuroprotection. So the next time you're having your coffee, remember you're not just stimulating your brain, you're actually feeding an entire microbial network in your gut that may be central to coffee's longevity signal. There is an important nuance when it comes to coffee's health benefits such as the cancer protective effects. Brewing method does matter. Most studies show clear cancer protection involved filtered coffee. Boyle or unfiltered methods like the French press or espresso allow oily compounds called dieterpeens to enter our cup of coffee. At higher consumption levels, these dieterpeens have an associated with slightly elevated risk of certain cancers such as pancreatic cancer and respiratory tract cancers. So why does brewing method have such a profound impact on health outcomes? It comes down to two key groups of coffee compounds. On the one hand, coffee is rich in polyphenols. These are powerful anti-oxidins that can lower dementia risk by as much as 50% and reduce DNA damage. This is a critical precursor to cancer by around 23%. On the other hand, coffee also contains these fat soluble dieterpeens. If not filtered out, the dieterpeens can significantly raise LDL cholesterol. By as much as 30 milligrams per deciliter within just a few weeks, this elevates cardiovascular risk. Regardless of one's perspective on LDL's role in cardiovascular disease, there is no reason coffee should be raising your LDL by this much. So this is best avoided if possible. To fully optimize coffee's health benefits, we need to understand how different brewing methods dramatically change its chemical makeup, and ultimately it's impact on our health. Coffee contains two critical types of compounds we're going to focus on. First, dieterpeens specifically calf stall and kaiwial. These are fat soluble molecules that naturally are found in coffee beans. The problem with these dieterpeens is that they significantly raise LDL cholesterol. In fact, studies have found that people who regularly drink unfiltered coffee like from French press, espresso, or boiled coffee, it can raise their LDL levels by roughly 10 to 30 milligrams per deciliter within just a few weeks, and that does increase cardiovascular disease risk. There's also links between higher dieterpeen exposure from unfiltered coffee with slightly elevated risk of certain cancers. Second and more beneficially, coffee beans are rich in polyphenols, primarily the chlorogenic acids. Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants that reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, protect us from chronic diseases, unlike dieterpeens, polyphenols are water soluble so they dissolve in water and easily pass through paper filters. Here's why this chemical difference matters. Brewing methods dictate how much these compounds end up in our coffee. Unfiltered methods like espresso, French press, boiled coffee, or stove top percolators, retain the oily dieterpeens. For perspective, espresso contains around 1100 milligrams of calfstall per liter. Turkish boiled coffee contains around 900 milligrams per liter, while French press and mocha pots contain 70 to 90 milligrams per liter. Practically, that means one espresso shot has about 30 milligrams of calfstall and a typical cup of coffee from other unfiltered methods have between 10 and 200 milligrams. In contrast, filtered coffees like traditional paper drip, instant cold brew, trap these dieterpeens in the filter essentially eliminating their negative effects while still preserving beneficial polyphenols. Recent studies have shown that even work place coffee machines would usually lack proper filtration, deliver significantly higher dieterpeen concentrations between 140 to 170 milligrams per liter. Compared to filtered coffee prepared which often shows undetectable levels. As a side note, I do want to mention that many traditional paper drip coffee machines do run hot water through plastic. In other words, hot water going to plastic will accelerate the release of microplastics into your beverage as well as their plastic associated chemicals. So if you are going to do filtered coffee, pour over is probably your best bet doing something into a glass container and not having the hot water touch plastic. On a similar note, if you're drinking espresso, those espresso pods are also plastic and so having hot water go through those pods is also releasing microplastics and their associated chemicals into your beverage as well. Just something to keep in mind. Now, what about the anti-oxidants which significantly contribute to the health benefits of coffee? The story shifts here a little bit as espresso actually tops the chart in anti-oxyactivity per volume. This is because it has a very intense extraction. Cold brew also ranks very highly because it's extended brewing duration, French press and percolators provide moderate antioxidant levels while filtered drip and instant coffee, though slightly lower still offer substantial antioxidant benefits. But antioxidants don't depend solely on brewing methods. They're also influenced by being type, roast level, how the beans are grown and brewing temperature. First, let's consider the two major coffee species, Arabaca and Robusta. Arabaca beans are generally preferred for flavor. They contain less caffeine, so about half as much and there's somewhat fewer chlorogenic acids. Those are the key antioxidant than Robusta beans. Robusta beans are higher in caffeine, higher in the chlorogenic acids and they deliver more potent antioxidant effects and stronger mental stimulation. But they also tend to taste more bitter and earthy. But origin matters too, where and how coffee is grown, also influences its biochemical makeup in important ways. So altitude does matter. Beans grown at higher altitude elevations, like those from Columbia's high altitude regions, mature slowly leading to a sweeter brighter flavor and less caffeine and antioxidant density, compared to beans grown at lower altitudes. Sun exposure and latitude matter, so coffee beans from regions near the equator, like Ethiopia or Kenya typically develop higher concentrations of antioxidants like the chlorogenic acids, as protection against intense sunlight and environmental stress. So it's an adaptation. It's kind of a stress response at the coffee bean plant. It's producing more of these antioxidants. Soil type matter, so mineral rich volcanic soils found in regions like Guatemala and Colombia, influence coffee bean composition. It enhances the sweetness and complex flavors due to the elevated sucrose and lipicontent and processing techniques washed versus natural also matter. So how beans are processed after harvesting can affect their fermentation and amino acid levels and how antioxidants form during the roasting process. This directly influences their final biochemical composition and also their health potential. So practically speaking, I think the best way to choose a coffee bean. If your goal is higher antioxidants, cognitive enhancement, maximum caffeine kick, you might want to lean towards robust abeans or as a second best-being grown closer to the equator, like a coffee from Ethiopia or Kenya. If you prefer milder simulation, a sweeter taste, slightly lower caffeine than a higher altitude orabaca like those from Colombia or Ethiopia would be ideal. Remember that roasting and brewing methods can also dramatically influence the final antioxidant content in coffee. It generally peaks around medium roast. A darker roast reduces antioxidant levels regardless of species and brewing methods like paper filtered coffee will remove most of the cholesterol-raising dieterpeans and the leave most of the polyphenols there no matter where your beans are from. Finally, brewing temperature also does play a role. Really hot brewing methods like espresso or drip brewing quickly extract antioxidants due to the higher temperatures and shorter brew times, cold brewing while lower and temperature can reach comparable antioxidant levels if it's steeped long enough so this is typically 12 to 24 hours, but hot methods generally yield higher concentrations per serving. So here's how to translate all this science into a smarter coffee shopping decision. You want to focus on three variables, species, origin and roast. First, if you want maximum antioxidant, a robust adominent blend is your highest yield option. Robusted beans contain about 60% more chlorogenic acids than arabica. If you prefer the flavor of arabica, choose lots grown near the equator at high elevation, think altitude, Ethiopia, Kenya, because equatorial sunlight and slow maturation will boost the polyphenol density well above lower latitude arabica from say Colombia or Peru. And finally, keep the roast in the light to medium range that window preserves the greatest fraction of chlorogenic acids, whereas dark roast burn off a significant portion of those antioxidants. So given everything we've discussed so far, it might not surprise you that the brewing method you choose can dramatically influence coffee's health impact, but what's truly fascinating and maybe surprising is just how distinct these outcomes can be depending on how you prepare your coffee. Filtered coffee consistently stands out as the best choice for longevity and overall health. A major cohort study found that regularly drinking filtered coffee was linked to about a 15% lower all-cosmortality compared to drinking no coffee at all. Similarly, regular consumption of filtered coffee around 2 to 5 cups per day is strongly associated with a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular related mortality compared to drinking no coffee at all. Neither of these protective associations were observed with unfiltered coffee methods like French press likely due to their cholesterol-raising deterpines. And when it comes to cognitive health, the data is even more striking. Consistently drinking filtered coffee can lower your dementia risk by as much as 50% compared to not drinking coffee, but these benefits diminish sharply or even reverse when using unfiltered brewing methods, particularly when consuming extreme quantities of coffee. For instance, heavy consumption of boiled coffee like Turkish coffee, we're talking extreme around 8 cups or more per day is linked to a nearly double risk of dementia compared to moderate drinkers likely due to those deterpines which I mentioned earlier. They're raising LDL cholesterol. High intake of boiled coffee also shows potential association with increased risk for specific cancers as mentioned earlier. Pancreatic cancer respiratory tract cancers as well. So it really highlights the need for moderation and caution when you're drinking boiled coffee. Don't want to go to that extreme level of drinking 8 cups per day. I would say given the otherwise strong evidence for coffee's anti-dementia effects at more normal doses, either excessive intake itself or specifically boiled coffee is likely the culprit here with respect to increased dementia risk because as I mentioned earlier, filtered coffee is associated with as much as a 50% lower dementia risk compared to not drinking coffee. Now, espresso is somewhat of a special case, while espresso does still contain those cholesterol-raising dieterpines, moderate espresso consumption like two to three servings daily remains strongly associated with a lower overall mortality likely due to his exceptionally high antioxidant density per ounce. Espresso's robust polyphenol continent might actually balance out some of the dieterping-related downsides, providing that you're maintaining a moderate consumption of espresso. Instant coffee, which is often overlooked, actually holds up remarkably well against filtered coffee. Studies consistently find that instant coffee drinkers also benefit from a lower all-caused mortality as well as a significant protection against diabetes and cognitive decline. That's probably because instant coffee also has high antioxidant levels similar to traditionally brewed coffee. So to sum it up, filtered coffee really emerges as the best way to brew coffee. It offers the strongest, most consistent health benefits across cardiovascular metabolic cognitive and longevity outcomes. Espresso and instant coffee also provides substantial protective effects that moderate consumption levels. Unfiltered methods, especially boiled coffee, or very heavy-french press consumption require greater caution due to their cholesterol-raising dieterpines and at very, very extreme high levels, eight cups or more a day, potential cognitive risks, even though moderate intake probably still offers beneficial polyphenols and antioxidants. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. Now, back to the episode. And coffee's health benefits extend far beyond just its caffeine content, and that really challenges a major assumption that many people hold that caffeine alone drives coffee's benefits. But the story shifts dramatically when we look at neurological outcomes, like cognitive decline and neurodrenarb diseases. This is where caffeine clearly takes center stage. Regular caffeinated coffee drinkers typically those consuming around three or more cups per day show a remarkable 34 to 37% reduction in the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease compared to non-drinkers. Even moderate caffeine intake about two cups per day, or around 200 milligrams daily, noticeably slows cognitive decline, particularly in people already showing signs of mild cognitive impairment. This is a common precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, genetically predicted higher caffeine levels in the bloodstream have also been linked to lower Alzheimer's disease risk, suggesting caffeine itself might directly influence brain aging. The neuroprotective effects of caffeine can be traced directly to its unique biological mechanism of action. Caffeine functions as a competitive antagonist at denacing a2A and a1 receptors. The a2A subtype is especially critical here because these receptors are densely expressed along the indirect pathway of our basal ganglia. This is a key brain region that's involved in motor control and movement regulation. By blocking a2A receptors caffeine reduces the excessive inhibitory that's characteristic of Parkinson's disease simultaneously boosting dopamine de-tube receptor activity. Animal studies reinforce this mechanistic picture, so chronic blockade of the A2A receptors with caffeine consistently reduces neuroinflammation. It limits harmful aggregation of alphastic nucleon. This is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and it also preserves mitochondrial function in dopamine producing neurons. The clinical relevance is pretty striking in that some Parkinson's drugs now specifically target the same A2A receptors. The precise molecular action of A2A receptors could explain why caffeine delivers unique neurological benefits that de-caffeinated coffee does not replicate. So if you're wanting to preserve your cognitive function, if protecting your brain is a primary goal, caffeinated coffee clearly emerges as this superior choice. Now beyond just protecting your brain against long-term neurogenar diseases, caffeine is also a powerful rapid acting cognitive enhancer. At moderate doses roughly 100 to 300 milligrams per day or about 1 to 3 cups of coffee, it reliably boosts attention, improves working memory, speeds up reaction times by about 10 to 15 percent, and enhances overall cognitive performance, especially when you're tired or at those less optimal times of the day like early morning or the mid afternoon slump. How does caffeine achieve these immediate cognitive improvements? It all comes back to a dentistine. So as you stay awake, a dentistine builds up binding to specific receptors A1 and A2 in the brain, slowing down neural activity and increasing sleep pressure. Caffeine blocks these receptors, essentially removing that break, allowing the brain circuits associated with alertness and attention, powered by neurotransmitters like dopamine and neuropinephrine and acetylcholine to become more active. And the result is greater mental clarity, quicker thinking, reduced feelings that fatigue, but caffeine is not the whole story. Coffee contains several other bioactive compounds, particularly the polyphenols like the chlorogenic acids that independently benefit the brain, even without caffeine. Decaffeinated coffee, which preserves these polyphenols, can still improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to active brain regions during challenging tasks. This is a process called neurovascular coupling. Polyphenols also increase levels of brain-driveneratrophic factor or BDNF, which is an essential growth factor for neuroplasticity, for learning and memory. So for example, studies have shown that a single serving of coffee fruit extract can boost circulating BDNF levels by over 140%. In addition, these coffee polyphenols act as anti-oxidance and anti-inflammatory agents, activating protective-solar pathways like NRF2, and reducing inflammation-promoting ones like NFCB. And this helps maintain vascular health and neuronal integrity. So practically speaking, achieving these polyphenols-driven cognitive benefits typically requires around 400-800 milligrams of the chlorogenic acids per day, which is roughly found in about two cups of medium-rose filtered coffee. Interestingly, a small amount of caffeine around 75 milligrams to 100 milligrams actually seems to improve your body's absorption of these polyphenols, creating a beneficial synergy. Higher-cafing doses might narrow blood vessels, constriction, slightly counteracting some of the vascular benefits. So again, moderation remains key, and while caffeine clearly drives many of coffee's immediate cognitive enhancements and long-term neuroprotective effects, the rich blend of other bioactive compounds in coffee does deliver meaningful brain benefits even without caffeine. D-caf won't match caffeine's potential impact on a denocene signaling, but it does remain a valuable option to be preferred to avoid caffeine, and you still want to have some brain support of effects. Now let's talk about caffeine and physical performance with the data says how to use caffeine optimally and when you're getting too much. So first off, caffeine is arguably the most studied and reliable performance enhance your available. It consistently improves performance across endurance sports, strength training, and cognitive tasks requiring focus and reaction speed. So how much caffeine do you actually need? The science points to a dose range of about three to six milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of your body weight. Practically speaking, if you weigh about 70 kilograms or 155 pounds, that's roughly 200 to 400 milligrams of caffeine or about one to four cups of coffee depending on how strong your coffee is. Lower endoces around three milligrams per kilogram body weight are effective for most people, but higher doses up to six milligrams per kilogram body weight might be necessary if you're habituated to caffeine. In endurance events like running, cycling, swimming, you typically see about a three to five percent improvement in performance. In strength or power-based activities, caffeine reliably boost strength output and muscular endurance by about two to four percent. And even again, cognitive skills, focus, reaction time, attention. These get about 10 to 15 percent bump from a modest caffeine dose of about 100 to 150 milligrams. Caffeine peaks in your bloodstream around 45 to 60 minutes after ingestion and the performance enhancing effects do last about two to four hours. So keep this timing in mind to maximize its benefits, especially for competition or intense workouts or if you're looking for that mental pump. There's a clear ceiling to caffeine's benefits going beyond 400 milligrams rarely provides additional performance gains and frequently increases negative effects like anxiety, jitters, increased heart rate, digestive issues, and crucially, sleep disruption. So consuming caffeine later than about eight hours before your bedtime will cut into your sleep quality, undermining training adaptations and recovery. Unfortunately, D.C.F. Coffee does not have the same performance benefits. Studies consistently show D.C.F. Coffee is essentially equivalent to placebo for physical performance. D.C. Coffee does provide beneficial polyphenols and there's a variety of health benefits that we've already discussed. But if you're looking for this documented urgogenic physical performance enhancement, caffeine itself is necessary. If you are wanting to harness some of the urgogenic effects from your coffee, you might aim for a dose around 1.5 to 2 cups of coffee and consume it around 45 minutes to 60 minutes before your event or your training. If you use caffeine daily periodically taking short breaks anywhere between two to seven days can actually resensitize you to caffeine, making caffeine more effective when you return to it. And again, it's very wise for most people to stop consuming caffeine at least eight to 10 hours before bedtime. You want to protect your sleep, you want your sleep quality be good and you want to be able to recover. For general health, longevity and even cancer prevention, both caffeinated and de-caffinated coffee do offer substantial benefits. Regular consumption of either type of coffee is consistently associated with impressive reductions in chronic disease risk, including lower rates of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. And importantly, studies reassure us that neither caffeinated nor de-caffinated coffee increases cancer risk. Instead, these protective benefits largely stem from coffee's rich, complex-bend of polyphenols, anti-oxidants and other bioactive compounds not just caffeine itself. But if you do drink de-caff coffee, it's important to be aware of how the caffeine was removed. Most de-caffination processes use chemical solvents like methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Methylene chloride, for example, can sound concerning, it's industrially used in paint strippers. But the levels permitted in coffee are extremely low and strictly regulated, generally far below any threshold considered harmful by the FDA. Ethel acetate is sometimes called natural because it occurs in fruits, is similarly safe at these tiny residual concentrations. Independent testing consistently shows actual residues of these solvents in commercial de-caff coffee are often undetectable or far lower than the FDA's already stringent standards, which is reassuring. But if you do prefer to avoid chemical solvents entirely, there are excellent alternatives. The Swiss water process, for instance, uses only water and activated carbon, no chemicals involved. Another popular solvent for your approach is the carbon dioxide decapination, which uses presheride carbon dioxide gas to gently remove caffeine without affecting flavor or leaving residues. Both methods reliably eliminate caffeine while keeping beneficial polyphenols, anti-oxidance vitamins and coffee oils in them largely intact. Nutritionally, de-caff coffee remains virtually identical to regular coffee just minus the caffeine. And modern solvent-free methods also also preserve the flavor remarkably well. So, the science does show that de-caff coffee no matter how it's produced, even with solvents, is safe and has beneficial effects overall. If you look at most of these studies that have been done showing the beneficial effects of de-caffinated coffee, most people are just drinking standard de-caffinated coffee that is not using a solvent-free method. But if even trace amounts of chemical solvents, do make you uncomfortable choosing the Swiss water method or carbon dioxide decaffination coffee is probably your best bet. There's a lot of discussion out there about whether coffee is contaminated by mold toxins called micro toxins. And if these pose real health risks, let's cut through the noise and look at what the science actually says and then talk about practical steps to ensure your coffee remains safe. First, what exactly are micro toxins? Their natural toxins produced by certain molds. In coffee, the primary micro toxin of concern is called okrotoxin A or OTA. At high chronic doses, far above what you'd ever encounter in coffee, OTA can damage kidneys and is considered a probable carcinogen. Occasionally, you might hear about aflatoxins too, but they're mostly never detected in coffee. Now, how common are these micro toxins actually? Large scale global surveys involving thousands of coffee samples show that more than 95 percent are well below international safety limits for OTA. Importantly, roasting your coffee beans destroys roughly 70 to 90 percent of any existing OTA and brewing removes even more leaving the final amount in your cup extremely low. Far below any scientifically established health risk. In fact, epidemiological studies consistently show coffee drinkers have a reduced risk of liver and kidney diseases, exactly the opposite of what you'd expect if a low level OTA micro toxin exposure was a significant issue. So, the reality is, for most coffee drinkers, consuming moderate amounts, any micro toxin exposure is minimal and far outweighed by coffee's proven health benefits. But if you're still concerned and it's reasonable to want to minimize any potential risk, here are some of the best practices you can follow. One, choose specially grade coffee beans from reputable roasters, specially coffee is carefully screened, tested and graded dramatically reducing mold risk. Two, opt for washed wet process coffees. Wash coffees from regions like Ethiopia or Columbia have lower mold risk due to the removal of surface contaminants during processing. Three, make sure you store your beans properly, keep coffee beans in an airtight container away from moisture and heat to prevent mold growth, ideally consume them within about a month of roasting. And number four, use paper filters when brewing. Paper filters can help capture residual compounds including potential trace micotoxins, which further reduces exposure. So, in summary, yes, molds can occasionally grow on coffee beans, but good sourcing, storage, roasting and brewing practices reliably eliminate any meaningful risk. I think the bottom line here is coffees proven cardiovascular metabolic cognitive and neuroprotective benefits far outweigh any theoretical micotoxin concern, especially when you source and handle your beans with these simple precautions. Now let's talk about coffee additives. Many people ask, does adding dairy to your coffee blunt its beneficial effects? The shorter answer is partially yes, especially if your goal is rapid polyphenol absorption and maximum cognitive benefit. So here's what happens. Milk contains casine and way proteins which bind tightly to coffee's main anti-oxinins, the chlorogenic acids. These protein polyphenol complexes slow down early absorption in the small intestine, reducing the sharp immediate surge in these antioxidants in your bloodstream by about 20 to 30 percent. Instead polyphenols travel farther down that digestive track where the gut microbiomes eventually break them down. You're not losing the benefits completely, but you're massively delaying them and modifying how these compounds are metabolized. If you want to have immediate brain enhancing effects such as improved cognition, rapid antioxidant activity, and early anti-inflammatory signaling, black coffee or coffee with minimal protein is the way to go even small amounts of dairy can significantly blunt this rapid polyphenol availability. On the other hand, if your priority is general health, gut microbiome support, or simply taste an enjoyment, modest dairy consumption likely won't erase coffee's broader benefits. But if you want peak immediate cognitive enhancement from coffee's polyphenols, I strongly suggest you keep your coffee black or use a small amount of plant-based milk, such as almond milk, which interacts minimally with these beneficial compounds. Or what about MCT powder? Medium chain triglycerides or MCTs behave differently from dairy proteins, unlike casine and way protein and milk, MCT powder does not bind polyphenols in coffee so it won't significantly delay their absorption or blunt their rapid bio-availability. In fact, adding MCT to your coffee can potentially enhance cognitive benefits through a different pathway by increasing keyto levels, which provide an alternative rapidly available energy source for neurons. This can support alertness, focus, and even mood, especially in a fasted or low-carb state. But there is another critical point to consider when you're using MCT powder, and that would be the saturated fat content. Heavy cream, MCT powders, these contain substantial amounts of saturated fat, and if you're consuming multiple cups of coffee daily, say three to four cups, you could be easily taking in an extra 15 to 20 grams of saturated fat per day and just your coffee. Consistent high-saturated fat intake does elevate apobie containing lipropotines, which is the primary driver of cardiovascular disease risk. So you don't want to be consistently elevating your apobie with every cup of coffee that you're drinking. If you do drink coffee frequently throughout the day, it's probably wise to be mindful of what you add to your coffee. So occasionally use MCT or cream is likely harmless, but multiple times a day, and you're doing if you're doing heavy additions of it to your coffee, it might actually have a significant impact on your lipid profile. If you do want to keep your apobie in check, well, maximize in coffee health benefits, you should probably stick with black coffee or small amounts of cream, small amounts of MCT, or also opt for the unsweetened plant-based milks like almond milk. Another common question I get is, can you add something to your coffee to amplify its cognitive benefits and reduce some of the jitteriness caffeine can cause? And the answer is yes, a particularly effective compound is L-theane. This is an amino acid naturally found in green tea that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Eltheane works synergistically with caffeine on its own caffeine enhances alertness by blocking a denysing receptors, boosting dopamine and norphenaphrine, great for focus, but sometimes this creates anxiety or jitteriness. Eltheane increases GABA and glycine signaling in the brain creating a state of characterized alpha brain waves. These are the primary brain rhythms that are linked to calm, attentive states without sedation. So what you're doing by pairing the two is essentially smoothing out caffeine's stimulatory spike. Multiple studies show that combining roughly 100 to 200 milligrams of eltheane with about 100 to 150 milligrams of caffeine, approximately the amount in a standard cup of coffee, significantly improves cognitive performance. People experience enhanced sustained attention, faster reaction times, better accuracy on demanding cognitive tasks, and notably fewer feelings of anxiety or jitterness. Eltheane even dampens caffeine's transient blood pressure increase without sacrificing alertness. So practically speaking, here's what I think is best for maximizing the cognitive benefits of coffee. Parabout 1 cup of coffee, so 100 to about 150 milligrams of caffeine, with about 100 to 200 milligrams of eltheane. Take them at the same time. They have similar absorption kinetics, so if you simultaneously take them, that works the best. You can easily find eltheane as a powder or a capsule. It dissolves directly into coffee and has minimal taste effects. So this combination is really safe. It's well studied and it's low risk at these doses. I do want to make it absolutely clear that eltheane doesn't remove caffeine's sleep disrupting effects. So you still need to keep caffeine intake early in the day, but if you're looking for that calm, sustained jitter-free cognitive boost from coffee adding eltheane really is a powerful scientifically validated tool. So in summary, coffee, when consumed correctly, is really a powerful tool backed by rigorous science for enhancing health span, extending lifespan and protecting against the deadliest diseases of aging, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. We now know that coffee actively influences the fundamental mechanisms of biological aging at this cellular level, shaping everything from our epigenetic age and DNA integrity to metabolism, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function. But to summarize some of the benefits fully, timing and preparation do matter. Early in the day consumption, maximize is circadian biology, optimizes sleep, metabolism, and overall health. Filtered coffee methods eliminate cholesterol raising compounds while preserving anti-oxidants that actively repair DNA and reduce inflammation. And while caffeine offers unique neuroprotective and cognitive benefits, even decaf coffee contributes powerful bioactive compounds that nourish our gut microbiome and also fight disease. In practical terms, the science suggests consuming about two to three cups of coffee daily, ideally filtered and primarily in the morning hours. You want to keep added of minimal to preserve the immediate cognitive and long-term metabolic benefits, and you also want to consider strategic supplements like eltheane to amplify caffeine's cognitive clarity without anxiety. Ultimately, coffee is an accessible evidence-based approach to improving our health at every level from cells and genes to cognition and physical performance. If used wisely, it's not just a beverage, it's really a scientifically supported intervention for longevity and well-being. I'm Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and I'll talk to you soon.

About 70% of the US population has inadequate vitamin D. There have been many different meta-analyses over the decades. We're dating back all the way to the 1960s, looking at vitamin D levels and all cause mortality. And it's pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all cause mortality. What are the low-hanging fruits that you can do right now to instantly reduce your risk of age-related disease? I'm Rhonda Patrick and that's the topic of today's podcast. Originally recorded for the Institute for Functional Medicine today's episode outlines a series of fundamental tactics you can start applying immediately. These straightforward strategies can have a powerful impact on nearly every tissue in the body. Enjoy this podcast episode previously recorded from the Institute for Functional Medicine's podcast, Pathways to Well-Being. Welcome to the show, Dr. Patrick. Well, thank you so much. I'm excited to be here today and discuss all the very important topics that you just basically mentioned. Well, I think this is really exciting. And there's a lot to unpack. So we'll just get right into it. And I thought it would be great first to start with kind of a general contextual overview of how lifestyle changes can impact healthy aging because I think it's so powerful that even bite-sized, approachable lifestyle changes can potentially improve our health and our wellbeing and even our cognitive and physical performance. So let's just dive right in. And in general, will you tell us some of your favorite go-to lifestyle based longevity tips? Well, I think it's important to consider low hanging fruit. So things that people, there's not a lot of resistance and barriers for people to start applying in their daily lives. And I think when it comes to some of the easiest things that people can do, it usually comes down to unfortunately taking a pill. And so I know you might be going, what are you talking about? Well, the micro-neutrient inadequacies is a widespread problem in United States and other developed countries as well. Where there's about 30 to 40 essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids that we have to get from our diet. And if we don't get them from our diet, we are going to be inadequate in them. And these essential micro-neutrients are doing very important things in our body from running our metabolism to making sure our enzymes, which are proteins inside of ourselves that are basically doing all the work, responsible for everything from pumping our blood to our immune function to neurotransmitter function. So basically everything, they require these micro-neutrients as co-factors. And it's definitely, I think, safe to say that diet food first approach and getting all your micro-neutrients from whole foods, eating diverse foods, is paramount. However, many people, for whatever reason, they will not do that. They're busy or they have a habit or there's other sorts of dysregulation, perhaps in satiety mechanisms. So getting some micro-neutrients, like some of the important ones from a supplement, and these are easy ones, vitamin D, vitamin D's and easy one. That's something that we usually make in our skin from the sun. And about 70% of the US population has inadequate vitamin D, and that's kind of defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter. If you're in the United States, if you're in Europe, that would you'd have to multiply that by 2.5. But 70% of the US population has levels below that. And there have been many different meta-analysis over the decade. So you know, dating back all the way to the 1960s, looking at vitamin D levels in all cause mortality, and it's pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all cause mortality, all cause mortality. Other words, people are less likely to die from non-accidental causes of death, whether that's cardiovascular disease. Although I would say cardiovascular disease is probably the weakest with respect to vitamin D. Cancer mortality's down, respiratory diseases down. There's a two of the really big ones. The big drivers with respect to lowering all cause mortality. But so taking of vitamin D supplement is one of the easiest things to do. Why it's for a deficiency, you know, so common, well, because we're inside, you know, our cubicles and our offices at our, you know, with our technological advances, computers, everything. We don't spend as much time outside, you know, doing agriculture, doing, you know, the sort of outdoors kind of jobs that, you know, that were common 100 years ago. So, so people are not making vitamin D from their skin. And on top of that, there are very, there are already factors that actually regulate whether or not we can make enough vitamin D in our skin. And that, you know, from everything from age, so a 70 year old person makes like literally 25% of what they made as their 20 year old self. So it's very inefficient as you get older skin color. So melanin, that pigment that basically acts as a natural sunscreen also is a, you know, filter for UVB radiation, which is actually what needs to basically penetrate through the skin to start vitamin D three synthesis in the skin. So because melanin is a, you know, is a natural sunscreen, sunscreen also does that. People wear a lot of sunscreen nowadays. So there's, there's many different reasons why people are not getting as much vitamin D in our modern day world. And vitamin D is one of the cheapest and easiest supplements to take. There have been studies that have basically tried to figure out like, how can you take a person who is deficient? So deficiency would be 20 nanograms from Miller less. And when you start to get less than 20 nanograms per milliliter, you start to go, you start to run the risk of, you know, bone problems and severe other types of severe problems immune dysfunction, for example, people that are deficient and supplement with about 4,000 I use per day can bring their self up to a sufficient level closer, you know, above 30 nanograms per mill, perhaps even closer to 40. And 4,000 I use per day is actually the tolerable upper intake set by the Institute of Medicine for vitamin D3. And I just want to mention, you know, vitamin D is unique among the vitamins because it's actually, it gets converted into a steroid hormone. So vitamin D3 goes to the to the liver. It's converted to a another metabolite called 25 hydroxy vitamin D. That's the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D. That's usually measured if you get a blood test. And then it goes to the kidneys where it's then converted into the steroid hormone. That's 125 hydroxy vitamin D. And what I mean by a steroid hormone, most people think about estrogen and testosterone, those are steroid hormones. Like imagine if 70% of men in the United States were deficient in testosterone, like they would be terrible. So, you know, vitamin D is basically very different because it basically can enter what's called the cell nucleus of a cell. And that is where all your DNA is. And it can basically recognize this little sequence of DNA. And it, it's basically, you know, binds to a receptor and, you know, it binds to your DNA. And turns genes on activates them and turns other genes off and deactivates them. And this is like coordinated fashion. And these are genes that are important from everything from brain function. So, serotonin is one. It's important for the synthesis of serotonin and the brain to immune function. And it's, it's why vitamin D plays such a critical role in helping prevent respiratory diseases. And so low hanging fruit there, vitamin D, easy one. Another one that's pretty, I think common in the United States, at least for example, is magnesium. And magnesium is an essential, essential mineral. About 50% of the U.S. population does not basically get adequate intake of magnesium. And the RDA for adequate intake was set at around, I would say, on average, it's a little different for males and females, but on average about 400 milligrams per day for an adult. And if you are a physically active adult, so let's say you exercise frequently, you are, you know, maybe using the sauna, you can excrete magnesium through sweat. And so, physically active adults actually require anywhere between 10 to 20% more than the RDA. So, you can imagine if people are already not even getting the RDA, the physically active people are even, you know, in worse shape, in some, some respects. And magnesium is an essential co-factor. It's a mineral that is important for the function of over 300 different enzymes in our body. Everything from enzymes that are important for repairing damage to our DNA. So DNA damage is something that's happening every day. It's happening right now as we're having this conversation. It's not something that you can look in the mirror and see, but it is in cities and with respect to basically it causes this low-level type of damage that accumulates over time and as we age, it can lead to dysfunctional cells. It can lead to potentially what are called oncogenic mutations that can lead to cancer. So repair enzymes do not work properly without magnesium. Also DNA synthesis. So we're making new cells. We're making new blood cells. We're making new immune cells. We're making new skin cells. Every time we make a new cell, we have to replicate all the DNA inside of those cells. And that requires enzymes called DNA polymerases. Those are basically need magnesium for those to work properly. So again, it's a very important process for our DNA and repairing the DNA. And making sure it doesn't get mutations from the get-go with DNA replication. And it's probably why there's so many of the study of studies that have found these are observational studies. Of course, all the caveats that come with observational studies, there's potentially other confounding factors. With that in mind, people with the highest magnesium levels have a 40% lower all-cosm mortality and a 50% lower cancer mortality compared to people with the lowest magnesium levels. There's another study that I think was specific to pink. Creeotic cancer. So for every 100mg decrease in magnesium intake, there was a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidents. So again, highlighting the important role, magnesium plays particularly with our DNA and with respect to making sure the integrity of our DNA, the genomic stability of our DNA is good. And that's very important for preventing cancer, which is an age-related disease. It's something that you want to try to do. Everything you can to prevent, of course, there are things outside of our control. However, there are things that are in our control. And I think an easy thing would be magnesium. So why is widespread deficiency common? Magnesium is found at the center of a chlorophyll molecule. chlorophyll is the molecule that gives plants their green color. So magnesium is high in dark leafy greens. Most people are not eating multiple servings of dark leafy greens daily. It's also pretty high in legumes. Almonds are another great source of magnesium, oats are great source of magnesium. So the bottom line is people aren't eating enough of their leafy greens. Supplemental magnesium is another possibility, but the dose of that is needs to be considered because magnesium at higher doses can cause adverse effects like GI problems. So what I like to do is try to get my magnesium from dietary sources. Like this morning, I had a smoothie with some cooked kale. I had some chard in it. I had frozen a couple of frozen strawberries and blueberries and avocado. So I was getting a magnesium dose with my breakfast, which was scrambled eggs. So having trying to find any way you can to get multiple servings of greens or almonds, oats are another great dietary source. But I also do a supplement of about 125 milligrams of magnesium. And I do magnesium glycinate. Most of the magnesium supplements are with respect. I would say the one that's not very bio-available is magnesium dioxide. But magnesium glycinate is a really good bio-availability. It has very good bio-availability. So does magnesium malator magnesium citrate. So with respect to supplementation with magnesium, it can be a way to kind of at least get you up to more of an RDA adequate level. Also, when I sawna, when I'm physically active, I also drink electrolytes after that. And that's another, so you can have an electrolyte drink that replaces some of the loss sodium and magnesium potassium, for example. So that's also another option when you're physically active. So that would be another example, low hanging fruit, with respect to important micronutrients. So there's another one. Omega-3 we can get into, but I probably will speak a lot about that. Maybe I'll skip to the exercise as well. Maybe we can go into depth about those. But exercise is probably the biggest and most important thing. Irrespective of anything else, I think being physically active, very clear, is the most important thing for healthy aging, for staving off dementia, for staving off cancer, for staving off cardiovascular disease, all the age-related diseases. You know, it does require a little bit more effort, and I would love to dive more into specifics on that. But I do feel like I need to give you a chance to talk, because I've already kind of gone on for a while. I would like to dive into the Omega-3 and some exercise more as well, though. If you have any questions that you wanted to kind of ask me about that. Yeah, that's awesome. I just so appreciate you centering this on these low-hanging fruits that are so accessible. Really approachable. And this is one of the ways that we can really support longevity is by optimizing our micro-nutrients status because of all of the relationships with all cause mortality that you talked about. Chronic infection, cardiovascular disease cancer. So I think that that's a super important place to start. As we're on the topic of personalized functional nutrition, will you talk to us a little bit, and this will probably lead into a discussion on Omega-3's. I'm hoping we can take some time and look at the food genetics relationship and talk about how that might play into healthy aging for any individual. Yeah, I think the, you know, so there there are a variety of we all have differences in our genes, and, you know, they're oftentimes just a change in one, what's called nucleotide, you know, a nucleotide change in the sequence of DNA. And this often referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism. So a SNIP we call it for short. But it's kind of what's, you know, differentiating between why some people have brown eyes or blue eyes or blonde hair or red hair. But in addition to those phenotypes and characteristics, there's also a variety of SNPs in genes that are involved in metabolizing micronutrients, like magnesium, vitamin D, Omega-3. But, you know, in addition to micronutrients, macronutrients as well. So people are very different in the way they respond to foods. I think we, in general, when I say we, the scientific community is really in its infancy and understanding the interaction between our genes and our environment. And, you know, so there are things that we can, there are certain, there are more, I think, certain SNPs, we know a little bit more about than others. But it's hard, you know, again, we're really at the infancy and understanding that interaction. It's a very complex interaction. But generally speaking, because I mentioned vitamin D, that is, you know, one that is, there's a variety of common SNPs that people do not convert the vitamin D 3 into the 25 hydroxy vitamin D very well, or they do not convert the 25 hydroxy vitamin D into the steroid hormone very well. I've actually seen blood work data from people that friends, even that had to supplement with a much, much higher dose. So I mentioned 4,000, I use being the tolerable upper intake that the RDA, or so that's instant medicine set. Well, I've seen people have to take, you know, between 20 to 30,000, I use a day to even just get a normal, like 30 or 40 nanogram per milliliter blood concentration of 25 hydroxy vitamin D, because they have a genetic polymorphism that makes them so inefficient at doing that. In fact, there's been what are called medelian randomization studies, and these are studies where people were scientists look at these SNPs, these genetic variations, that are typically involved in nutrition. They're involved in the metabolism of some, you know, vitamin D, or they're involved in some kind of environmental factor. And what scientists do is they say, we have all these people, we know some of these people are low-envitamin D because of a gene, not because they're not outside and physically active or not because they're not health, you know, conscience, conscientious, and supplementing, but it's their genes. And so it's kind of a way of randomizing people in a very, you know, unbiased way that's random and just based on their genes, right? So these medelian randomization studies have found that people with genetically low vitamin D levels, you know, have a higher all-cause mortality, they're like, you know, 25, they've got like a 25% higher mortality from respiratory disease. So it's really kind of, I would say, supporting and reinforcing the observational data showing that when you actually measure someone's low vitamin D levels, we respect whether they're genetics, you see the same thing. So it's, again, the genetics, the interaction between our genes and our diet, in its infancy, but really, I think the important thing here also is getting some blood work done. Like, unless you go and measure your vitamin D levels, you're not going to know how deficient or if you're deficient or insufficient, you are. You're not going to know how well a supplement is raising your levels, like, is it even doing anything? So measuring vitamin D levels before and after are very important. And the same goes for omega 3, you know, there's omega 3 is it's probably, I think, one of the most important, you know, nutrients that is, it's really overlooked. People just don't even really think about it. So omega 3, there's three types of these fatty acids. There's the, the type that you can find in plant sources. So that's alpha-linelic acid, ALA, and then there's the EPA, which is like, I co-sapentinoic acid, and then DHA. And those are the two marine sources that you'll find in in fish, but also you can find them in micro-algae, which is more of a plant-based source. There was a study that came out of Harvard, I think it was 2009, which identified the marine sources of omega 3 as basically one of the top six preventable causes of death. In other words, people are not eating enough seafood and fish. And because of that, it was, it was calculated that about, I think it was something like 84,000 deaths per year, where it attributed to not getting enough EPA and DHA from the diet. And this was really comparable to people that were eating trans fats. Everybody knows trans fats are bad. You walk into any grocery store. It's zero trans fats on every packaging thing you can see. It's very much in the public awareness that trans fats are bad. Well, trans fats were responsible for the same number of deaths as not getting EPA and DHA. So it was responsible for 82,000 deaths per year. Before I kind of go deeper into that, I mean, it's kind of just, but that makes you think about it. It's like, oh, wow. So the, the, the, the same number of deaths were attributable to eating trans fats as not eating enough EPA and DHA from marine sources, you know, fish, for example. And it kind of really makes you think about things because you don't walk into a supermarket and nothing says, oh, this isn't seafood. This isn't getting your EPA and DHA. This is processed. You know, but yet everything tells you about trans fats. And it was, you know, just as important, important to get those, you know, omega-3 fatty acids from marine sources. Now, I say marine sources because ALA, which is the, the common source of omega-3 found in plants, like flex seeds, walnuts, for example, that is actually considered the essential fatty acid because we can convert ALA into EPA and DHA. And so, you know, all the government agencies that comes up with these RDAs and, you know, all those standards that are set, basically it goes down to, oh, well, because we can make EPA and DHA from ALA, that's going to be the one that we focus on. The problem with that is that the conversion of ALA into EPA and then subsequently DHA is it's a very inefficient and there's a wide, subredgenetic differences with respect to that conversion. So, people, some people are great. They have a, they have a alteration in the dissaturase G, and that does the conversion of ALA into EPA and they do it quite well. I would say the majority of people have another version that are not so great at it. And to kind of add fuel to the fire, having too much of vegetable oils, omega-6 fatty acids, I don't want to demonize them so much, because like you can get, you need little LIA gas at, you need a rock and a donic acid. It's part of your cell membrane. It's important functions. Getting them from whole food sources, like walnuts is great. But the vegetable oils are very, very concentrated and a lot of cooking, if you eat out, if you buy processed foods, are usually cooked and processed with vegetable oils. That omega-6 when it's too high can compete with that enzyme that's required to convert ALA into EPA. And so, you may be getting an FALA, by the way, that's the other problem. People aren't even eating in Flaxseed and walnuts, they're not even getting an FALA, so there's so many layers to this. There's so many layers. But that conversion is very inefficient when there's a lot of omega-6. And on top of that, I would say the one saving grace there is that estrogen does dramatically increase that conversion. It makes it 20% better. And so, this is probably because DHA is so important for brain development and when a woman becomes pregnant, estrogen skyrocket. It's like 100 times higher than what it normally is. It's pretty apparent that nature has feared out a way to at least convert all that ALA as possible into EPA and DHA. Anyway, so that's where the genetics comes in. There's definitely a regulation there. But on top of that, I think the best way to get the EPA and DHA is from eating a dietary source and measuring what's called the omega-3 index. So the omega-3 index is measuring omega-3 fatty acid levels, the EPA and DHA, and there's other fatty acids as well. But in red blood cell membranes, and it's really important because most of the time when you go and get a omega-3 blood test, the plasma phospholipids are measured, which is better than nothing. But you're really looking more at your dietary intake in the last week or two versus red blood cells, which are 120 days before they turn over. It's a long term status of a omega-3. Kind of like the difference between looking at fasting blood glucose and your HBA1C. You could have had an intermittent fasting for that day and your fasting blood glucose looks great. But is that a snapshot of what your daily blood glucose levels always look like might not be right. So long-term status omega-3 index and there's been a variety of studies from Bill Harris. Bill Harris, he's the co-inventor of the omega-3 fatty acid test. I had him on my podcast about a year ago. I've actually joined the fatty acid research institute, which is a nonprofit institute studying a variety of the roles of fatty acids in human health. I've joined as a associate researcher, and so I'm doing some studies on omega-3 and brain health. But Bill is published a variety of studies looking at omega-3 index and all cosmortality, cardiovascular rate related mortality. So I would say when you get the omega-3 index measured, most people in the United States have an omega-3 index of less than 5%. And what Bill has shown from multiple studies is that people that have an omega-3 index of 8% have a 5 year increase life expectancy compared to those that have an omega-3 index of 4%. So 4% versus 8%. There's also evidence that it's related to cardiovascular related mortality as well. But also a very interesting piece of data that Bill published was looking at smokers and everybody knows smoking is terrible for your health. What can you do to accelerate the aging process? Smoking, cigarettes, tobacco, it's terrible. And this was so interesting. The omega-3 in smokers that had a high omega-3 index. So they were smoking, but they were also eating a lot of fish, supplementing with fish oil. They had an 8% omega-3 index. They had the same life expectancy as non-smokers with a low omega-3 index. In other words, smoking was like being deficient in omega-3. I was blown away by that. There's a beautiful graph in the paper. It's just kind of mind-blowing. So omega-3 is there's so many different roles that it plays in the body. It accumulates in cell membrane, plays an important role in the way transporters and receptors function, because all those things are embedded in the cell membrane. And so, for example, glucose transporters at the blood-brain barrier are altered. They're not functioning well when DHA is deficient. And that can cause less glucose to get into the brain. And that obviously leads to many problems. It's also the metabolites of EPA and DHA. It resolves inflammation in a very efficient and timely manner. These are the maricens, the protectens, the SPMs, the resolvins. These are playing a very important role in inflammation. And I think there has been now enough evidence that inflammation, chronic low-level inflammation is a driver of the aging process itself. In other words, not just driving, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia cancer, which it does. But just the process of aging. And so it's affecting all those things. And inflammation is a term that's used, which is kind of like the activation of the immune system is accelerating the aging process. And it's known as inflammation. There's neuro-inflammation. And there's been like these seven pillars of aging where you look at all these physiological processes that are happening, like genomic instability is one, protein, misfolding is another. And there's also this neuro-inflammation. The only thing that was really overlapping between brain aging and just aging itself was the inflammation. That was the most important thing that was accelerating everything in the brain and also aging in the body. So having Omega 3 is one of the easiest things that someone can do to improve their inflammatory process to improve the structure and function of their transporters and receptors. And I know you're going to ask me some research I'm most excited about. I'll give you a preview of that. I'm also excited about a new role of Omega 3 in muscle mass. And also sensitizing amino acids in skeletal muscle. So there's been some work from Chris McGlory who I had on my podcast just yesterday. He's actually shown that Omega 3 is playing a role in disuse atrophy and through a mechanism where it's actually, it's not inflammatory. It's not the you know, anti-inflammatory effect of Omega 3. It's actually doing something anabolic. It's that it's somehow affecting muscle protein synthesis. And he thinks it's actually sensitizing muscle to amino acids through some unknown mechanisms that are trying to figure out. So I think I'm pretty excited about that near research coming out. Muscle mass obviously is an important factor in aging as well. But I do think that you know, so when it comes to Omega 3, what do you do? I mean, obviously, you know, if you can eat fatty fish that's high in Omega 3, salmon, macarol, sardines, these are all pretty good sources of Omega 3 that are also low in contaminants like mercury PCBs. By the way, there have been now studies that have come out showing that even, though fish have, you know, these contaminants that the Omega 3 fatty acids protect against them and even during pregnancy. So there was this big push, you know, decades ago about pregnant women should avoid eating fish because of the mercury. I think that was a huge mistake, huge mistake. And I'm actually involved in a study looking at Omega 3 index in cord blood and neurodevelopmental outcomes. But there's been a couple of studies, you know, one, one, I think big one was in 2015, the American Journal Pediatric published, that that basically the Omega 3 fatty assets women eating fish, the Omega 3 fatty assets protected against any neurotoxicity. And in fact, you know, this children had, you know, better neural outcomes than women that avoided fish. There's also been studies looking at Omega 3 like fish intake and intelligence in, so, so, and, and, and, fish intake during pregnancy and intelligence, you know, at one year or seven years of life, I forgot all the, you know, the follow-up times. But it was shown that, you know, Omega 3 was correlated with improved intelligence. If the mothers were eating fish, and they were actually using mercury as a biomarker to, to basically validate their dietary recall. Because the, the women that we're taking in more, more Omega 3 had higher mercury. And guess what, the higher mercury was correlated with higher intelligence in the children, not because mercury is improving intelligence, but because the Omega 3 is. And the Omega 3, you know, the mercury doesn't, doesn't even matter if you have the Omega 3 there, it's, it's really protecting against any potential toxic effects of mercury. So, I know that was a bit of a tangent, but it's, it's, it's important because people are kind of scared of eating fish, and, you know, there are some fish that you should be scared of, like, sort fish, which is terribly high in mercury and not so high in Omega 3. But things like salmon, wild caught salmon is low in mercury, high in Omega 3. Also supplement supplementing is, is I think, a really important option. So, um, looking at the 4% Omega 3 index comparing it to the 8% I mentioned, the five year increase life expectancy, I think that, um, there's been some studies showing that 1.5 to 2 grams a day, supplemental Omega 3 can bring people from a 4% Omega 3 index to an 8% Omega 3 index. Now, keep keep in mind, you know, the FDA, people are prescribed 4 grams a day of either LaVaza or the CEPA, which is the purified EPA, and, and that's very safe. So, um, you know, this is, this is a, Omega 3, the way I like to think of it, is it's got the, it's got the safety profile of a nutrient, but it is pharmacologically active, and, you know, and so many people are not getting enough of it. I think something like 80% globally do not get enough EPA and DAJ, and like 95% of people in the US do not get enough. So, uh, very important, in respect to the way we're aging, um, you know, I think it's important for cardiovascular health, I think it's important for brain health, and throughout the lifespan from infancy to old age, important. So, that's sort of my, uh, my should be all on Omega 3. I think it's a very low hanging fruit and important thing that people can, can, um, take in. Well, thank you for doing some nutritional myth busting. I think you've made a compelling case that we should all be aware of our vitamin D status and our Omega index. I think our audience will not forgive me if I don't dive into this supplement piece for just a minute. I saw a debate raging on a functional medicine group yesterday about, um, whether or not Omega supplements are contaminated with things like PCBs to the same degree that the whole fish would be, and if we need to be concerned about environmental toxicity, in supplements, I would just love to hear your perspective. Um, yeah, my perspective again is, um, it is, there are, it's nice to get a quality supplement. And I think there's a few things that are important. One, I think triglyceride form. Uh, yeah, Lavasa and Lavasa and Visita are in aphilester form. Aphilester is not incorporated into cell membranes quite as readily. It's not as bio-evalable. It absolutely has to be taken with food, preferably with a higher fat meal. But, um, you know, some people, if they're doctor prescribes, it's going to take it. And that's compliance is an issue. So triglyceride form is more bio-evalable. It doesn't incorporate into cell membranes much better. And I think that's important. Two, I think, um, oxidation status. So it, so a, so a visual is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. So it is prone to oxidation. There are isolation protocols that can be done that can minimize that, that oxidation, such as doing it under liquid nitrogen, for example. And, um, there are third-party testing sites that will test Omega-3 oxidation status. And they also test PCBs, mercury, and everything. I think the best one that I use is called the International Fish Oil Standards website. It's IFOS. And there's a ton of different brands on there. If you go to their products sheet, you can click on the product and then they have batch numbers for all the different types of Omega-3 supplements that are out there. And then you can then look at the raw data. You can look at their oxidation status. You can look at how high the mercury and PCBs are, all those things. I would say the most important thing is concentration of EPA and DHA, triglyceride form. And then, you know, perhaps the oxidation status. I, I don't, I think because most of these fish oil supplements are purified. They're, they're run through a column. You are, they are purifying away a lot of these, uh, you know, toxins and stuff, um, that it's not as big of an issue. The most important thing though is the Omega-3 fatty acids protect against the, the potential negative effects. Like I said, in the developing fetus where there's so much more sensitive, so much more sensitive to the mercury, the PCBs and everything. The Omega-3 fatty acids are protecting. And that's the study I like to cite whenever I get that question about, but what about, but what about the toxins? But what about the toxins? It's like, you know, here's the thing. Focus on what we need to be getting. Like what are we, you know, if you focus on the toxins, the toxins, like you're not going to get any Omega-3, you're not going to be getting enough of it, you know, and so, um, and I think that is way more detrimental than any little amount of, you know, mercury or PCBs that are going to hitchhike in because the Omega-3s are so good at lowering inflammation. And that's kind of one of the major things that you're worried about with those things. I mean, it's, it's, to me, it's kind of like a levels thing, right? Where it's like, yeah, but you're getting so much more of that other thing that's going to negate, you know, the potential negative effects of the PCBs and mercury. So, iOS good, good source, um, lab doors and other ones, they don't, they don't, they kind of have a different, um, they like rank things and so most of the time they're sold out of the most top, top-ranked supplement. But you can go on iOS and find tons of other supplement brands, you know, and, and regionally. So, like, Canada, if you live in Canada, you'll find some better Canadian, in front of Canada or Europe or US. And so, I think that, um, go out there and find a supplement that makes you feel good. It's got a high level of EPA and DHA. It's got, you know, low oxidation, perhaps lower mercury and, um, you know, and don't, don't sweat this small stuff. Very practical advice to help us choose a supplement. I think with your insights and the resources that you've shared, we have a good idea of what micro nutrients we should focus on. So, I'd like to shift our attention to exercise. I know you're interested in talking about that as well. Before we do that, um, in your work, you explore the benefits of certain types of stress that might include exercise or fasting or hot and cold therapies. And I thought it would be a good time to introduce this concept of board-mesis. And I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a primer. What do you, what, what are we talking about when we refer to or mesis? Yes. Yeah, it's a really, you know, it's a term. I think it might have originated from some of the the plant phytochemicals. There was a book, boy, forgot the author of the book. But, um, it refers to exposure to a low level of something that at a very, very, very high level could be, you know, I don't want to necessarily say toxic, but toxic, it could be bad for you. You're exposing yourself to an, a sub, so for example, exercise, like everyone knows exercise is very beneficial. But if you were to just non-stop exercise 24 hours a day and keep doing that, like, you would collapse. It would be bad, right? So, so doing, so exposing yourself to a little bit of stress, basically we have all these genes in our bodies that are activated in response to that stress. And these are antioxidant genes. Their genes involved in inflammation. So, you know, anti-inflammatory genes. Their genes that are involved in clearing out damaged things. So, this is a top-agee. Their genes in repairing DNA. So, all these things get activated. And the activation of these genes out shines the little bit of stress that you sort of applied to activate them. And so, the net effect is beneficial. And throughout, you know, throughout our human evolution, I guess, we have been exposed to these intermittent types of stress, whether it is periods of food scarcity because we didn't have instant cart and couldn't just order our food and have it delivered to us. We had to go out and hunt it. And, you know, find it, gather, bind berries and, you know, vegetables and things. And so, food scarcity, there were periods of times when we were fasting. We were not getting food. And that activates a variety of stress response genes. A lot of times these are called stress response genes, such as atophyg genes, which are clearing out a lot of damaged stuff within a cell inside of a cell. And they're very robustly activated by fasting, but they're also activated by other things like heat stress. So, that's one form. Then there's the physical activity, right? That, that also, I mean, again, we humans used to be a lot more physically active when that was our life, right? We had to go and hunt and gather and we worked in the field, agriculture farming. I mean, just many much more stuff that we were doing by moving around. That is another form of intermittent stress. Lots of stress response genes are activated. When you, you know, engage in physical activity, you do activate inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 being one of the big ones. But the response to IL-6 is the anti-inflammatory response. So, IL-10 gets activated and it's more powerful. So, it stays active for longer. And so, the net effect is anti-inflammatory from the little bit of inflammation that you've generated by exercising. The other example is these plant phytochemicals. So, these are compounds that are found in a variety of plants. So, for a faint being one in cruciferous plants, there's, you know, the Resvera trials probably are very well known when that's found in the skin of some fruits like grapes, and blueberries. Terros still being another one found in the skin of blueberries. There's the the turmeric that that the curcumin found in that. And so, these are all phytochemicals that also activate stress response genes. They also activate genes that are active from things like physical activity or heat stress like heat shock proteins. So, a lot of overlap between it's the intermittent stress can activate a whole host of these things. Some of these stress response genes are more active by different types of it. So, like thermal stress, more robustly activates heat shock proteins than eating some broccoli does. But sulfur phyng does activate heat shock proteins. So, sulfur phyng is down in broccoli, broccoli sprouts. So, you'll get a lot of overlap between them. But the bottom line is that our genes were meant to be pushed. By intermittent types of stress. And we've lost that. We've lost that ability to push them. We're not the ability, but we've stopped doing it. And I think that it's had a detrimental effect on the way that we're aging our predisposition to age-related diseases as well. Because you want to clean up stuff, you want to keep pushing the antioxidant, the anti-inflammatory, the preventing the protein aggregation, the repairing the damage DNA. That stuff is important because all that stuff is happening every day, just from normal metabolism, normal immunobacactivation, normal going out in the sun and getting ionizing radiation. And then you add on top of that modern day living air pollution chemicals were exposed to compounding. And we have to turn those stress response genes on to not only age better, but to like just even age normally. So, it's very important to engage in these intermittent types of stress, whether that's exercising cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, going into hottubs in the sauna, not eating round the clock, having periods of a break. And also eating phytochemicals from plants. I think these are all very important. Well, I think as you said, we all know exercise is important, but when we look to healthy aging and longevity, are there types of exercise? We should be focusing on, I heard you mentioned resistance training, but there's so many options. Resistance training and high intensity interval training and a real big training, where should we focus our efforts? It's a good question, and I think that with respect to people, the people need to be physically active. Like, whatever it is, they're going to do and do it regularly, routinely, establish a routine, is, in my opinion, the most important thing. So, not concerning yourself so much with, oh, I need to be doing this zone two, or I need to be doing high intensity interval training. What you need to do is do what you know you will do. Like, that's the most important thing. But let's say you want to step up a level and you're already like, I'm committed, I absolutely love the way I feel after I exercise, but I want to be doing the best things and trying to do everything I can to maximize every type of benefit from my brain and for my muscle and for my heart that I can, right? So, is my, I'll say this. There's, there's been these interesting studies that are called the vigorous intensity lifestyle, what, vigorous intensity lifestyle, physical activity. So, Villpa. And there's these large studies where people have worn like these accelerometers, you know, some sort of smart fit bit or fill in the blank type of device that'll measure their movement. And it's been, it's been shown from these studies. So, the vigorous intensity, this is basically like, you know, not just walking. Okay, this is like, you're going, you're going to more of a, you know, maximum, like, a maximal heart rate or close to it. So, you're more like, you know, maybe 80, 80 percent, you know, estimated max heart rate. And doing something for anywhere, like, one minute to three minutes, three times a day. Okay, so this is like the quote unquote exercise snacks. This is like, okay, I'm at my desk. I'm, I'm working at my computer. I'm going to get up and I'm going to do one minute of burpees or I'm going to get up and I'm going to go sprint down the street and back or I'm going to do a hill sprint. Something that is so short, but intense. And then you just get back into whatever you're doing. So, it's not so disruptive. You don't have to have a gym membership. You don't have to go, you know, and getting your car and drive somewhere. You don't have to, like, think about it in carve out time in your day. You just do it. You just get up from your desk when you do it. So, this is one minute to three minutes, three times a day. Have shown that people that do this. Again, this is measured by actual data and empirical data. Have anywhere between a 30 to 40% lower all-cause mortality and cancer-related mortality. The vigorous intensity is a little bit different than, you know, some people like to go for long runs. They like to go for long bike rides. They're more of that, you know, moderate intensity type of exercise. And that's great, too. If that's what you're doing and that's what you love doing. There's tons of studies showing that being, you know, physically active, particularly if you're going on a longer run and you're, you know, engaging in 150 minutes of that normal moderate type of aerobic exercise per week that you're doing really good. Right? So, it's not that you have to go and do the vigorous intensity. Although, I do think there are added benefits on top of that. And those largely have to do with the brain. Because when you are when you're going, when you start to reach, you know, above when you're getting to the 80% you know, maximum heart rate, estimated maximum heart rate and you start to get a high, you can't generate energy from the, you know, the oxygen that you breathe in quick enough. And so you're mitochondria, which are the major source of energy generating organelles inside of yourselves can't, they require oxygen to make ATP, which is the energy I'm talking about. So, so you can't get that oxygen quick enough for them mitochondria to do it. And so, you're forced to make energy outside of the mitochondria and you make it by using, using up glucose. And so, the glucose then gets metabolized into lactate. And lactate is not a waste metabolite, like it was widely believed for many years. Like it's just waste metabolites. Not only a waste metabolite, it could potentially be harmful because it was thought to be, you know, causing muscle soreness, complete and other not true, not sense, not true. So, so lactate actually is a signaling molecule. It has been shown to activate brain drive neurotrophic factor at the blood brain barrier. It activates it. It also gets into other tissues, including the brain, through this MCT transporter. And it's used for neurotransmitter synthesis, nor up an effort and required, you know, uses lactate serotonin dopamine. It's used for energy instead of neurons. It's used is a very efficient source of energy. So, lactate can be used to make, you know, energy, it's converted inside the mitochondria and used as energy. And this is in the brain, this is in other tissues as well, like the gut, like it's really important for the gut. So, I think that there's a role of high intensity interval training or high, a vigorous types of exercise. I say high intensity interval training because it's hard to keep that level of activity up for more than an interval. I mean, it's extremely, you're pushing it all the way and then you like taper down, so I do think that the vigorous type of exercise has a special role in, I think brain health as well, but also I think cancer prevention is the big one too. I mean, a roe-big exercise is very important for cancer prevention. And specifically, I think that there's some interesting mechanisms where the intensity of exercise actually also seems to be important. So, there's a big, there's a circulating tumor cells. So, the circulating tumor cells, most the time are when someone has a primary tumor, so they basically have been diagnosed with cancer. And so at that point, the goal is, okay, well, how do we get rid of the cancer and prevent metastasis, right? We don't want the cancer to spread. Well, the circulating tumor cells escape the primary tumor site, they get into circulation, and then they go elsewhere and then establish camp there, right? So, the metastasis process. Well, exercise itself, there's something called shear force, the shear force, a blood flow going through the circulatory system. It self kills the circulating tumor cells. And it does it because these tumor cells have these metano receptors on their cell surface. And they're so sensitive to like movement. So, it's like a hurricane, it's like a hurricane, it's like a hurricane, just coming through and just wiping it out. And so, so that there's been studies showing that, the people that have been diagnosed with either colon cancer, breast cancer, when they engage in intense physical activity, aerobic exercise, they are less likely to have like their circulating tumor cells drop down. They're less likely to have cancer recurrence. I mean, dramatically in some cases, you're like, you're talking like 40%. And they're less likely to die from their cancer. So, cancer prevention, but also important role for cancer recurrence and cancer mortality for people that have already been diagnosed with cancer. I think that the big thing here, you know, there's been a lot of, what type of extra should I do? I think you should probably just, you know, do what you can, do what you're going to do, probably good to do both. Like, I do a lot of Tabadas. And so, I go between my all-outs and also like, you know, I mean, I mean, like a zone three, sometimes a zone two when I'm sort of tapering it down and like before I'm about to go back all out again. And I do that 10 or 15 minutes a day, five days a week. And then I also like to do resistance training. And that's another, you know, muscle mass and maintaining muscle mass, so important. And, you know, building up that muscle reserve earlier in life because, you know, you got to build it up, you got to build it up. And once you start to reach a certain age, it becomes very hard to gain muscle mass, although you can still gain strength. And so, you know, you you have a harder time gaining that mass, but you're losing it. And so, it's kind of like, the more you start with, the loss is aren't quite as big, right? So, I think resistance training is very important for that as well. All those things are important. And I think that when you have to find something that you can incorporate into your daily routine and that you will, you will do. And, you know, you want your heart rate to get up, you want to sweat, you want to be tired. Like, you want, like, you want to feel tired afterwards. And I think exercise, whatever way you can do it, where you are at least getting your heart rate up, and you are flush in the face, and you are, like, you know, when you're working out, you don't, you can't talk, right, to some degree. I think that's good. And there's been studies that have looked at, you know, I think exercise can forgive a lot of sins. And I'll say this, you know, I, during, when I was a young, you know, a new mother. My son was a newborn and all the way up and through the first year. I mean, there was, there was just so much disruption to my sleep. That, and there's nothing you can do about it. I mean, like, we all know how important sleep is for health, for brain function, for blood pressure, everything, right. But when you are a young, I can only speak as a mother. Like, I can't speak for being a father. I think, you know, the father's sleep is also disrupted somewhat too. Mothers, though, have to, they're breastfeeding. There's no, there's, you have to feed your baby. There's nothing you can do. And in a way, if you think about all the detrimental effects, it can be very discouraging. And you're like, I am, doing terrible things to myself. And there's nothing I can do about it. Well, I, I was wearing a continuous glucose monitor at the time. And my blood glucose, my fasting blood glucose levels were just through the roof. And it was crazy. You know, I was eating the same diet. And it wasn't until I got back into my, I was doing a lot of spin classes back then. And it wasn't until I got like on, on the peloton or the exercise bike, doing high intensity interval training that all of a sudden it normalized my, my blood glucose levels even with the interrupted sleep. And then I've went into the literature and found, you know, a study showing high intensity interval training can basically ameliorate the negative effects of sleep deprivation on blood glucose regulation. And, you know, so clearly scientific evidence of it. I had anecdotal evidence as well. But there's also was a pretty recent study looking at sleep and all cause mortality. There's lots of those out there. You'll find, of course, people with, you know, disrupted sleep, shorter, you know, much, much shorter sleep durations, heavy higher all cause mortality. However, this recent study also looked at physical and it was interesting because sleep, you know, quality and quantity, again, was associated. So, lower quantity was associated with higher all cause mortality, but only in people that were not physically active. And, other words, physical activity forgave the sleep disruption, the, the poor sleep. I think that if there's a message here, it is that the most important thing that you can do in your life is to sweat and get physically active. Like, there's nothing that is going to be better for you. No, no aging drug, nothing. Nothing's going to be better than than what exercise can do at the moment. And I think that that is, is the main message that like you just need to be, like if you care about aging, everything from skin is skin aging. Like, there was a study showing that people that are physically active are 20 to 50 percent less likely to have collagen breakdown and I mean, it was just amazing. Everything, brain health, cardiovascular health, you know, it's, it's just, it's, it's the most powerful, I would say, longevity drug you're going to get in my opinion. Ronda, I sell admire your passion for this topic and this conversation to it has made me feel so excited to see you present at our annual international conference. I wanted to thank you so much for sharing these real practical takeaways combined with the research briefs. We can't wait to see more and we really look forward to seeing you in Orlando, in June. I look forward to it as well. It's going to be a fun time.

So, glad to be here. I want to thank the organizers at A4M for inviting me to speak. I spoke at Longjewity Fest last December. It was amazing. So, I'm super pumped to be here today, talking all about metabolic health. And we're really going to focus on what I think are three major lifestyle factors that can play a pretty big role in metabolic health. So, we're going to be talking about, sorry, remember, it's a small working. All right. We'll be talking about high intensity interval training, which is a very time-efficient way to get your heart rate up to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose, homeostasis, glucose transport, mitochondrial function, and we're going to talk a little bit about exercise snacks that can be strategically timed and how that can play a profound role in glucose homeostasis. We're going to talk about circadian timed eating. So, why it's important to avoid late-night eating? What the effects of melatonin are on insulin, time-restricted eating, and circadian misalignment. And then we're going to jump into sleep and the profound metabolic effects of sleep restriction on metabolic health, as well as some behavioral changes that can be implemented to improve metabolic health. So, let's start with high intensity interval training. So, as I mentioned, this is a very time-efficient way to get your heart rate up and exercise. So, it involves very short bouts of intense exercise. One, we're talking about heart rate up at at least 75% max heart rate. Followed by periods of recovery, there's a lot of different protocols. We're going to discuss, but there have been lots of studies talking and showing that high intensity of all training can improve glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity. It also decreases fat mass and improves body composition, and enhances mitochondrial function. So, a meta-analysis of 50 different randomized controlled trials compared high intensity interval training to moderate intensity continuous exercise. So, this would be exercise that's at a lower intensity, the kind of intensity where you can have a conversation, but you may be still breathy, sometimes called zone two, and this is a longer duration type of exercise. So, high intensity interval training outperforms moderate intensity continuous exercise at decreasing insulin resistance. It also improves HBA1C levels. So, the long-term biomarker for elevated blood glucose levels. It leads to a decrease in body weight and also significantly lowers fasting blood glucose levels. Again, this is 50 different randomized controlled trials. And another systematic review of many different randomized controlled trials has found that again high intensity interval training outperforms, moderate intensity continuous exercise at improving cardiovascular fitness, improving diastolic and systolic blood pressure, improving HDL, triglycerides and fasting glucose, lowering oxidative stress, improving at a connectin and insulin sensitivity as well as beta cell function to produce insulin. It increases PGC1 alpha, which is a biomarker for mitochondrial biogenesis, which will be discussing in a little bit. And it also improves cardiac function, and this is all better than moderate intensity continuous exercise. So, it really provides an opportunity for people to have a time-efficient way of improving metabolic health. And part of that is because when you get your heart rate up high, when you are putting in the effort, you are, you're putting a strong stress on your mitochondria and your muscle. And your mitochondria are unable to produce energy quick enough to keep up with the demand. And so, your muscle cells shift to using glucose as a source of energy through glycolysis. And that ends up producing lactate, which was thought to be a bi product, a metabolic bi product. Well, decades and couple of decades ago, Dr. George Brooks at the University of California, and he can Berkeley was one of the pioneers to find that lactate generated from exercise is anything but a bi product. So, steady state lactate levels are less than one millimolar. When you crank up the intensity of exercise, you can go anywhere up to 15, 17 millimolar. And that lactate gets in circulation and it's consumed by other organs. It goes into the brain. It goes into the heart. It goes back into the muscle. It goes to the kidneys. It goes to the liver. And it's serving a very utilizeable source of energy. So, it lactate can be used, you know, and converted into a single co-ag used by energy by the mitochondria. But probably one of its most important roles is as a signaling molecule. It's a way for your muscle to communicate with other organs and other tissues. And one of its signaling roles is back in the muscle. It's increasing the translocation of glucose for transporters to the cell surface of the muscle, gluten for transporters. And so, lactate gets back into the muscle. It's basically telling the muscle hey, we're using a lot of glucose here for energy. So, we need to bring more glucose in and the way it does it is by increasing gluten for transporters at the muscle. And I mentioned lactate levels go up during this intense exercise. That's very transient. So, after about 20 minutes, when exercise stops, your lactate levels go back to baseline because all these other organs, including the muscle are consuming it so quickly. However, the increase in glucose for transporters stays elevated for up to 48 hours with the first 24 hours being the most robust. So, you're getting a long-term effect from that signaling from lactate back to the muscle to increase gluten for transporters. And that is why high-intensity and able training is so potent and powerful at improving glucose homeostasis. So, there was another meta analysis of 36 randomized control trials that were looking at optimal conditions of high-intensity training for improving body composition. And so, it's been identified that the duration of the hit workout, high-intensity, interval training workout eight weeks is optimal for improving body composition. The frequency is at least three sessions a week. And the intervals are 60 seconds of 60 seconds or less of the robust intense interval followed by about 90 seconds of recovery. And this leads to improvements in reducing fat mass, cycling and running was the best at doing that. Also improving percent body fat, so body fat reduction, and that was the best with running. And then increasing fat free mass, which includes muscle and the best at that was actually cycling. So, these are some of the optimal conditions for improving body composition with respect to high-intensity and able training protocols. We're going to talk about how high-intensity, even able training can regulate mitochondrial function. But before we talk about that, I think it's important to recognize that people with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes have been identified to have pretty profound dysregulated mitochondria. So, the mitochondria and skeletal muscle from people with type 2 diabetes and obesity have been found in multiple studies to aspire about 40 percent less than skeletal muscle cells from people that do not have type 2 diabetes or people that are lean. So, their mitochondria are dysfunctional and subsequent studies have also identified structural defects in the mitochondria. So, mitochondria from people with type 2 diabetes are fragmented. So, mitochondria are typically they form a very connected network, this sort of look like Rermachelle spaghetti. And that's a really beautiful network of mitochondria that are able to undergo respiration and do their functions quite robustly. When mitochondria become really fragmented, they are dysfunctional, they can't utilize or even produce energy very well and they're on their way to basically dying and causing cells to die. So, there's a very intricate connection between structure of mitochondria and the function of mitochondria. And that's important because vigorous exercise high intensity exercise has been shown to increase this repair process in mitochondria known as mitophagy. So, when exercise is intens enough, it increases the nutrient sensing protein, A and P kinase, A and P K, it activates it. And this causes the mitochondria to send the signal that they need to repair themselves. And so, mitochondria can be sort of dysfunctional or they can be really dysfunctional. So, mitophagy can clear away an entire dysfunctional mitochondria to be used or recycled or it can clear away pieces of a dysfunctional mitochondria. So, when that exercise, when you're doing that acute exercise, you're mitochondria, if you have a dysfunctional one, the mitophagy pathway gets activated and the mitochondria fizes off, it kind of goes to this mitochondrial fission process and that damage part of the mitochondria then goes and is recycled through the lysosome. And then what you have is a long-term effect of after doing, you know, routine high intensity exercise, you then have more healthy functional mitochondria because you're just getting rid of the damage part of the mitochondria. If the mitochondria is dysfunctional enough, you're going to get rid of the whole mitochondria. And by the way, the A and P kinase pathway, many of you are probably thinking, well, that's a nutrient sensing pathway. It's activated during periods of fasting and that is true. A and P kinase is activated during periods of fasting and fasting is a powerful signal for inducing autopogy and mitophagy. However, in this particular study, people that did this high intensity vigorous exercise for 30 minutes, it did not matter if they had basted for 16 hours or not. There was no difference in the mitophagy. So, in other words, the exercise itself was such a strong signal for activating mitophagy that it didn't matter if they had not basted for 16 hours, because it was so powerful. On top of the repair process, high intensity unitable training is one of the most robust exercise modalities that can increase mitochondrial biogenesis. So, the growth of new mitochondria, increasing mitochondrial volume. So, you're having this double whammy effect where you're getting repairing of the mitochondria getting rid of the unhealthy parts and then you're increasing the growth of new mitochondria. So, one of the reasons high intensity interval training is very good at increasing mitochondrial biogenesis compared to, let's say, moderate continuous exercise is because lactate that's generated from that vigorous exercise is a signaling molecule to activate the protein that very much regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, PGC1 alpha. So, again, lactate is playing that signaling role. It's generated by the muscle, it's taken back up by the muscle and then it's communicating with the muscle. It's saying, hey, we can't make energy fast enough because this exercise is so intense, we need more mitochondria to be able to do that. So, it's an adaptation to the vigorous intensity exercise and that adaptation is making more mitochondria, which is obviously very beneficial for not only people with titular diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, but also everybody. So, mitochondrial biogenesis improves energy efficiency in mitochondria and also is associated with other benefits like decreased atrophy and improved exercise endurance as well. So, there's a whole host of benefits with increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. So, a lot of the high intensity-advalt training protocols that were used in these systematic analysis and these meta-analyses were evidence-based hit protocols. So, Tabata is one that's used. That's a 22nd on 10 second off interval, 20 seconds at the highest intensity you can do. You're going all out and then you're resting for 10 seconds and that's repeated eight times for a total of a four minute workout. In some cases, the Tabata protocol was repeated twice. The wing gate hit protocols and other very commonly used one and that is a 30 second all out sprint followed by four minutes of active recovery where you're low intensity and then you do that four to six times. That's about a 20 minute or so workout. And then there's the conventional workout. It's the one minute on one minute off so you're going as intense as you can for one minute and then you have one minute of very light active recovery and then you repeat that 10 times. That's the 20 minute workout. It is hard but it's very, very effective at improving a variety of metabolic parameters. And then there's the clinical workout also known as the Norwegian 4 by 4 which I like to call it because the Norwegian ski team often uses this hit protocol for their training. It's a four minute interval where you're going as intense as you can for four minutes and then you have light recovery for three minutes. So you're going very, very light getting your heart rate down and that's repeated four times. So it's about a 25 minute workout. So let's just talk a little bit about exercise snacks which is a type of high intensity or well training workout. It involves doing something at vigorous intensity, actually you know, a vigorous intensity heart rate for one to two minutes and they're often called exercise snacks because you can just do them whenever throughout the day. And I think this is a very relevant because I just came across a study a couple of weeks ago that showed 10 body weight squats. Okay, 10 for every 45 minutes was more powerful at improving glucose homeostasis than a 30 minute walk. So I feel like that is it's just it kind of puts it in context because how easy is it to get up and do 10 body weight squats, right, every 45 minutes. I mean, it doesn't get easier than that. And there's also a reason to strategically time these exercise snacks either 30 minutes to an hour before a meal or 30 minutes to an hour at them after a meal. So the timing of these exercise snacks has been shown in several studies and people with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance to really improve their glucose regulation after a meal. So their post-prandial glucose regulation and their glucose disposal was improved. Again, because getting that high and says the exercise when you're generating some lactate, it's increasing gluten for transporters at the muscle and that is then causing glucose to come into the muscle. It's low in the burden of your pancreas to have to produce insulin and it's improving glucose homeostasis. So exercise snacks around meals is an easy way to improve post-prandial glucose regulation and glucose homeostasis. It's obviously very relevant for people with type 2 diabetes, but also I think for everyone. Exercise snacks has also been associated with decrease in all cause mortality. So there have been very large studies out of the UK by a big data where people are wearing accelerometers and they're part of the vigorous intensity, so vigorous intermittent lifestyle activity studies that have been done, will put their call. And what those studies have identified is that people that do want to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise. And these are things like just sprinting up the stairs rather than taking the escalator or walking up the stairs. And they do this, there's like a one to two minute high intensity burst and they do this three times a day. That's associated with a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality. 50% reduction. It's also associated with a 40% reduction in cancer related mortality and all cause mortality. So cancer, cardiovascular disease, these are all diseases that are associated with metabolic dysregulation. So implementing exercise snacks, I think, is one of the easiest ways to get, you know, get a little bit of exercise, get your heart rate up, get that lactate generated, increase your glucose transporters, but also just improve your mood to break up your sedentary time. So being sitting at your desk for a couple of hours is sedentary and being sedentary is an independent risk factor for certain diseases like cancer. So I mean, we've all been sitting here for an hour at least. I say we get up and we do a minute of body weight squats, body weight squats. All right, ready? Okay, I'm going to get this time we're going to do a whole minute. I'm saving you the high knees. All right, here we go. So we're going to do body weight squats. We're going to try to get the heart rate up and we're going to do it for one minute. Try to go low if you can. You want to feel the burn in your quad. I'm going to sideways there. Keep going. We're not even at 30 seconds yet. Okay, we're halfway. Are you guys getting your heart rate up or are you feeling it? Woo! 15 seconds left. Five, four, three, two, woo! All right! So a little out of breath feeling good. Increase the blood flow to the brain. But more importantly, glue four transporters. Okay, so we're going to shift gears and we're going to talk a little bit about circadian meal timing. Woo! All right. Okay, so as everybody here knows, I've asked circadian rhythm. We're all diurnal creatures here. More active during the day. Less active in the evening, right? Our metabolism is also on a circadian rhythm. We are more insulin sensitive earlier in the day and later in the evening less insulin sensitive. Part of that, so let me talk about a study that I think is pretty telling in terms of insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation throughout the day. So participants were given the same exact meals in the morning and the afternoon or in the evening. Okay, so same macro nutrient composition, same color, content, everything the same. And participants were much more insulin sensitive in their first meal, given in the morning, compared to their evening meal. And I think part of this has to do with circadian rhythm. And as we get later in the day, melatonin. So back in the like the early 2000s, about 2009, a lot of studies started coming out in the genetics world where the variation, a very a certain variation in the melatonin receptor 1B, was identified to be pretty high risk factor for developing type 2DBs. And for having basically insulin dysregulation, so people were not producing insulin correctly. And it was very perplexing to scientists at the time because melatonin was thought to be just this hormone that is produced by the epinial gland that is regulating our sleep. It's quiting down our brain, telling us it's time to get sleepy, right? It's making us tired. Well it turns out after more studies sort of to investigate this that we have melatonin receptors on our pancreas, on our pancreatic beta-ilots cells. And the melatonin receptors that 1B receptors are sensitive to melatonin. People with that gene variation had a hypersensitive receptor where little bits of melatonin were enough to really kind of activate it. And so it turns out melatonin is also quiting down our pancreas at night. And telling our pancreas, we don't have to produce so much insulin. It's nighttime. We're not going to be eating. And so there's a systemic effect of melatonin, not only on our brain, but also on our other organs that are important for metabolism. And I think this is a really good reason to think about when you're going to have your last meal. And why it is detrimental to engage in late night eating. So our body is naturally produce melatonin about three or so hours before our natural bedtime. So it's a good rule of thumb to make sure that you have finished your last meal, you've finished eating before that time. So before three hours before your natural bedtime, it's really just a good rule of thumb to kind of make sure you're done eating that. When you wake up in the morning, you're also still producing some melatonin for about the first hour. Now, bright light exposure can inhibit that so it can hasten the clearance of the melatonin. But also I think it's a good idea to wait about an hour after you first wake up before you start taking in your meal. So bright light exposure will talk about also it's very important for regulating our circadian rhythm and that's important for a sleep. But generally speaking, I think just aligning your meals with your circadian rhythm, it makes sense when you think about the role of melatonin, you know, in quite a down our brain and also our pancreas, it makes a lot of sense why you don't want to be eating late at night. So just as a, you know, I think an aside here, having glucose levels in the normal range, but on the high normal range, so high normal glucose was associated in UK bio bank data with higher incidence of atrophy in the hippocampus, the part of the brain involved in learning and memory. So people that just had higher than, they were on the high end of normal, had more atrophy in their hippocampus than people on the low end of normal. So this is in the absence of any clinical type today, babies, really sort of highlighting the importance of everyone considering their metabolic health, even if you don't have type to diabetes, even if you're not, you know, pre-diabetic. You just want to make sure that your glucose regulation is, you know, the best it can be. Circadian misalignment, now so many of you may have come from, like me, the West Coast, or perhaps Europe, and your out of sync with your circadian rhythm. So circadian misalignment refers to when your natural internal clock is out of sync based on a behavioral pattern. So this is very common with jet lag. It's very common in shift workers who are up in the night in the evening, working and eating. It's also very common in people with aratic sleep behaviors. So there's been studies done where people, participants are, they're circadian misaligned. So they're out of sync. So they're basically, they're, they're sleep and meals are shifted by about 12 hours. And when that happens, people have about a 6% increase in their glucose. They have, they make 22% more insulin. They have decreased leptin levels. So that's the hormone involved in being satiated. And their post-prandial glucose levels are in the pre-diabetic range. Only by shifting their circadian, you know, clock by 12 hours. So it has a profound effect being circadian misaligned. Exercise can help with that, especially high-intensity interval training. But also time restricted eating. So time restricted eating refers to eating all your food in a restricted window of time. Instead of just eating, add the rhythm right throughout the day. And typically time restricted eating is anywhere between six to 10 hours of an eating window and the rest is fasting. There's been a lot of work done by Dr. Sachin Panda on time restricted eating in shift workers. He's done some work on firefighters showing, you know, these firefighters that are up all night. If they eat their food in a time restricted eating window, you know, you know, the 8 hours, 10 hours, that it improves their metabolic biomarkers. So there's been a lot of meta-analysis done on time restricted eating and how it improves metabolic health. Now time restricted eating does not mean you have to reduce your calorie intake. But we're going to talk about in a minute, people that are naturally doing time restricted eating tend to do that because they're skipping snacks, so they're skipping their dessert, or they're skipping a meal. So when people do end up reducing their calorie intake along with time restricted eating, they end up losing weight and losing fat. But independent of calories, so if they do not change their calorie intake, but they are practicing time restricted eating, it can improve glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, it can lower blood pressure. And so there's a lot of metabolic parameters that are improved with just the time restricted eating. Now as I mentioned, people that do practice time restricted eating, so there's been multiple studies looking at even just a 10-hour window, which isn't even that restricted. People that are doing a 10-hour time restricted eating window, not a controlled trial, but just like you tell them to do it. They end up reducing on average about 200 calories a day. Again, because typically people are skipping snacks or meals. And so that does lead to weight loss, and it reduces weight size, body fat percentage, and also reduces visceral fat, which is the deep fat that surrounds your organs, that's secreting pro inflammatory cytokines and hormones, that play a role in type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, but also you know, emerging evidence indicates visceral fat plays a role in cancer as well. Time restricted eating also lowers blood pressure and improves lipid profiles and improves the HBA-1C glucose biomarker. Early time restricted eating, so this is typically people that end their last meal about 4pm, usually early time restricted eating is about a six-hour window, so it's a shorter eating window. People that do early time restricted eating without reducing their calorie intake, dramatically improved a variety of metabolic parameters. Insulin levels are improved, insulin sensitivity is improved, beta cells are more responsive to glucose. The improvements in blood pressure were so profound that they were equivalent to some anti-hypertensive treatments. So that was a big finding of that study, and then ex-oxidative stress levels were also improved, and this is early time restricted eating. There's been meta analysis of about 12 randomized controlled trials, looking at early time restricted eating. Again, this was defined at stopping your last meal at about 4pm, and then comparing it to later time restricted eating, so people that were stopping their meals, not at 4, but a little bit later. And all the eating windows were either 4, sorry, 4, 2, 10 hours. And early time restricted eating does have more profound effects on glucose regulation. Largely because, again, we're more insulin sensitive earlier, less insulin sensitive later, once the melatonin starts to kick in, again, it gets much worse. So early time restricted eating can improve fasting blood glucose levels, and insulin resistance more than later time restricted eating, but it also has a more profound effect on the blood pressure regulation. So lowering blood pressure, late time restricted eating can sort of maintain blood pressure, but it doesn't improve it like the early time restricted eating. And both early and late improved lipid profiles as well as fasting glucose and insulin resistance just early does it a little bit more robustly. So I think there's pretty strong evidence that if you are circadian, misaligned, jet lag, for example, if you're a shift worker, or just people that are wanting to sort of try to optimize their glucose homeyestasis much as possible, certainly people with metabolic dysfunction may benefit from time restricted eating along with the high intensity and we're trading in the 10 body weights costs every 45 minutes. Okay, so let's talk about the last topic I want to discuss this this morning, and it has to do with poor sleep in how most of us, I think, are aware when we don't get a good night sleep, we don't feel cognitively on game or mood is affected, we feel left-artgic, we don't have as much energy, but I'm not sure that most people realize the profound effect that even mild sleep restriction has on our metabolic health and glucose regulation. And this is extremely relevant because about one third of people in the United States do not meet the recommendations that which is 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night for sleep. And again, this is very relevant for jet lag, I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of relevance here for poor sleep. So mild sleep restriction, this is one to three fewer hours of sleep per night. So I mean one is not a lot doing that three nights in a row can increase fasting insulin levels, it can lead to higher insulin concentrations, elevated fasting glucose levels, and also decreases insulin sensitivity. Again, this is just getting one hour less of sleep on night for three nights. I mean how many of us probably even done that at this conference, right? I mean it's very easy and very applicable and it's having a profound effect on metabolism. Sleep debt is yet the cumulative effect of sleep restriction, right? So this is when you're having multiple days of this sleep restriction. So in this case it was four, sorry, three days of four hours less of sleep per night. That lets you 40 percent slower glucose clearance, 30 percent decrease in glucose effectiveness. So this is independent of insulin similar to diabetes and 30 percent lower insulin response. So this is really indicating early diabetes. And these are in healthy people. There's healthy people after three nights of having four hours less sleep a night. Very profound effect on metabolism. There's been large meta-analysis done on longitudinal studies looking at type-udide-beauty's risk and sleep duration. And it's been identified that the optimal range of sleep for the lowest type-udide-beauty's risk is seven to nine hours of sleep a night. So going below seven hours or above nine hours were both associated with increased risk or type-udide-be's. So the seven-hour threshold getting less than seven hours of sleep a night was associated with increases in fasting insulin, increases in glucose levels, homoir was elevated, higher HPA1C and then also this rule fat was increased as well. So again getting less than seven hours of sleep a night which a lot of people do routinely. And speaking of the elevated HPA1C, I think this is really important. Most of you probably realize this but when you are constantly having elevations in blood glucose levels, this leads to advanced vacation and products or ages as they're called. And then it's certainly a huge problem in people with type-udide diabetes because they are constantly having glucose dysregulation in their elevated blood glucose but generally speaking when you have the HPA1C high, you are talking about glucose reacting with lipids and proteins through the mailed reaction including collagen. And this is all inside of our blood vessels, our arteries, you know, our mitochondia, making you know surrounding our heart. When you have those advanced vacation and products forming, it stiffens that collagen. HPA1C levels turn over after about what? 120 days. Eucology is then there forever. So what happens is you have those advanced vacation and products. If it's in your blood vessels, it stiffens the blood vessels and this leads to hypertension, plays a big role in hypertension. When it's happening in the arteries and in the myocardium, this decreases cardiovascular compliance and it really plays a role in the stippening of your heart with age. And so these advanced vacation and products increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and hypertension. So having these elevations in your blood glucose levels and you know subsequently the HPA1C biomarker which biomarks that is so much more than just type-udide diabetes risk. It's cardiovascular health and it's really a cumulative effect that plays a role as we age. There are a variety of mechanisms that have been identified for how short sleep and mild sleep restriction can cause dysfunctional metabolism. So there's we're going to talk about decreased insulin signaling and adiposites. We're going to talk about lower beta cell sensitivity to glucose. We're going to talk about impaired glucose absorption and muscle liver and then changes in satiety hormones. So there's been some studies looking at sleep restriction. This is about four hours of sleep and night for four days. It decreased insulin signaling and adiposites by 30%. So I mean your adiposites are one of the major sinks aside from muscle for glucose disposal, right? Storing it as fat, you know, for energy. But a 30% reduction in cellular insulin signaling adiposites is I mean you're talking about these are in healthy people. This is like a healthy person immediately becoming obese or immediately becoming type-udiodetic after just four days, right? A sleep restriction. So it's very profound in terms of metabolic health. Sleep loss, so sleep it mild sleep loss even. It does promote an obiesogenic profile. And so a lot of work has been done out of Eve van Coucher's lab and she's looked a lot at these these hunger hormones, satiety hormones. So after two days of four hours less sleep, left-and-levels go down. So people are not feeling associated by their food because left-and-regulate satiation and their growland levels increase. So it's a double whammy. Grellon is the hunger hormone. It tells you your hungry. And so they're getting this continual hunger. So global hunger ratings go up, global appetite goes, you know, up. So people are not situated by their food and they're hungry throughout their day. And again, Eve van Coucher's work has shown that people eat more and they're consuming foods and have cravings for processed foods, highly refined sugars, salty foods, you know, processed fats and fatty foods. So they're eating up to 45% more of those processed unhealthy foods and their hunger ratings are 24% higher. So they're eating even more than they would if they were getting a good night's sleep. So I think it's pretty clear that sleep restriction, possibly does cause dysfunctional metabolism. And so the question is, can you fix your sleep and improve metabolic health? So there's a couple of evidence-based ways we're going to talk about improving sleep. Both of them involve good sleep hygiene. So good sleep hygiene is really the foundation of good sleep. And there's a variety of factors that are like a checklist of it and I didn't include all of them but some of the main ones here are using light smartly. So bright light exposure. First thing in the morning at least 30 minutes is one of the most important ways to reset your circadian rhythms so that you become sleepy at a normal time. Very, very important for resetting circadian rhythm and also important for stopping that melatonin production when you're first waking up. Also avoiding bright light blue light exposure in the evening after sunset. Blue light is what is inhibiting melatonin production in our eyes. It's through our eyes actually not in our eyes but it's inhibiting melanopsin which then is involved in the signaling of producing melatonin to make a sleepy. And so you want to avoid blue light either by having light dimmers or different color lights maybe red or orange. Also glasses you can wear to filter it out but also really realize that screens are full of bright light blue light as well. So you know turning down the screen maybe avoiding screens at night is another good idea. Also making sure your room is dark because there's been studies showing that even a little bit of ambient light coming in disrupt sleep. Managing temperatures important. So part of what melatonin is doing besides making you sleepy is it's lowering your core body temperature and this is part of the circadian rhythm. It's important for a good sleep. And so you want to make sure you're not sleeping in a really hot room. And there's many ways that you can obviously maintain your bedroom temperature. Optimizing meal timing is also important. So in addition to the importance of avoiding eating like three hours before your bedtime because of melatonin production, it also improves your sleep. So this has actually been some work by Dr. Sachin Panda at the Solken Studios as well. He's identified from large studies that he's done that people that stop eating three hours at least three hours before their bedtime sleep better. And that's also partially because you're not digesting. I mean digesting is a lot of it's an energy consuming process, right? That's happening why you sleep. So it makes sense that it would also disrupt sleep somewhat. Regular exercise. So again this is all these are all tied together. So the exercise is also a very powerful zeitgiver. So you know just routine exercise is also really important for resetting the circadian rhythm and helping you just get on that rhythm and go to bed at a normal time. And then monitoring caffeine intake caffeine shifts the circadian clock by 45 minutes. So if you're drinking a cup of coffee that's 45 minutes of a circadian shift. And then you have another cup of coffee that's 45 minutes of a circadian shift. Right? And so you're going to be going to bed hours later if you're drinking four cups of coffee, particularly if it's you know afternoon. Obviously there's a lot of individual variation between the way we metabolize caffeine. So yeah there's some individual variation but generally speaking it's still circadian rhythm by about close to an hour. So sleep extension is one of the evidence-based ways that's been shown to improve sleep and this involves really just adjusting your bed times to increase this sleep time. So either going to bed earlier or sleeping in both of those. It also involves a lot of consultations with sleep experts and then sleep hygiene recommendations like we just discussed. And so there's been meta-analysis looking at sleep extension in people that are short sleepers so they're getting fewer than seven hours of sleep per night. And when they undergo this type of behavioral change when they're doing engaged in sleep extension, for every hour additional that they're sleeping per night they improve their insulin sensitivity. Regardless of their bodyweight, they improve and normalize their hormones, left in and relevant. They have reduced appetite right. They're not getting so hungry. Their sugar intake goes down and their caloric reduction goes down and they lose weight. So all these things of course the sugar intake and reducing the calories all regulated by the the satiety hormones which again if you're increasing your sleep you can you can basically flip that switch to kind of help regulate them back and normalize them back. The other type of evidence-based way from proving sleep is a certain type of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, CBTIs is probably one of the most used well-known and effective ways to improve insomnia. It involves a variety of factors. I'm not going to go in depth on but stimulus control is a main one so that means the bed is only associated with sleep. So no watching TV in your bed, no scrolling on your phone, no doing anything screens on your bed. It bed is for sleeping only. So that's stimulus control. It involves sleep restriction which is a little ironic paradoxical but so that means if you're laying in your bed and you're tossing and turning in your up for an hour or two or three it means getting out of your bed and going into another room dark room like you're living your room couch and laying there and you do some relaxation techniques that are you learn about and then wait till you get sleepy and then go back into the bed. So again bed is for sleep only. It also involves implementing a variety of the sleep hygiene factors that we talked about, sleep education and again some relaxation techniques. So meta-analysis of CBTI have also been shown to improve metabolic health and people with insomnia including improved HBA1C, improved blood pressure, of course there's sleep quality and insomnia factors and all those things improve as well. So it's pretty clear that people that have course sleep that are in having insomnia that are short sleepers if they work on fixing their sleep they improve their metabolic health. But there are situations where it is challenging to sleep longer or stay, you know, to sleep in to do all these things because maybe you're a new parent and you have to wake up and your sleep will be compromised is absolutely nothing you can do because of it. There's other things as well, right? I mean jet lag, things like that. So there is another way to improve metabolic health even when you're not sleeping optimal and that takes us full circle back to the beginning of the talk with high intensity and a full training. So high intensity and a little training has showed to be a very robust way to improve metabolic health when you are sleep restricted. So there's been studies that have shown that high intensity and a full training if you do three sessions over five days of also being sleep restricted so sleeping four hours less than night you can still improve your circadian rhythm, you can still improve your glucose tolerance, you're mitochondrial function and biomarkers of mitochondrial function in mitochondrial biogenesis. And you know, I mean this is important because again the glucose regulation so you're doing that high intensity and a full training will part of the way that high intensity and a full training. I mean part of the way that sleep restriction in pairs glucose regulation is it makes your muscle less responsive to glucose and so what is high intensity and a full training doing is doing the exact opposite, right? It's increasing glute for transporters and it's bringing the glucose into your muscle so you're really countering some of that negative effect of poor sleep on on on your muscle. Even doing high intensity level training before you know you're going to be sleep restricted. So I got on my Peloton yesterday, I went hard right before I got on my flight from California, I knew I was going to lose some sleep because it's three hours ahead in Florida. Doing high intensity while training before you're going to be sleep restricted still mostly rescues the high blood glucose and acute insulin resistance that's caused by sleep restriction. So yet again just really important with respect to tools that we have our disposal to help mitigate some of the effects of chronic sleep loss or even acutely gloss both. And a lot of those protocols again are the ones we've discussed at Tabata, the wing gate, conventional one-minute on one-minute off and the Norwegian four by four hit protocol. A lot of hit protocols out there that people can do or you just do your exercise snacks as well. I mean that also has been shown to increase glucose, homeostasis as I mentioned, the 10 body weight squats. And I do want to mention one that study before we end on time and that is again there's a lot of data out there to be harvested from the UK bio bank data and there's been studies that have identified people that sleep fewer than seven hours or greater than nine hours of night. Or have a higher all cause mortality. However if those people are physically active and they're getting and they're meeting the guidelines for physical activity, 75 minutes a week of intense vigorous exercise or 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise, they do not have a higher all cause mortality. They do the same mortality risk as someone that's getting good sleep. Yet again exercise can forgive a lot of sins and there's no reason to not do a time-efficient type of high intensity and well-training workout. It's time-efficient and easy exercise snacks. I mean there's all the evidence there. We just have to implement it. Make it part of your hygiene. Like you brush your teeth every morning. You do your hit. So in conclusion I think there's three really powerful tools we have to improve our metabolic health. I talked about the vigorous intensity exercise high intensity and we're training, making it part of your personal hygiene. Also trying to eat your meals and accordance with your circadian rhythm, a good roll of thumb, stop eating three hours before bed because of that melatonin production. It's nice to have a pretty restricted time window, eight, ten hours and then also making sure we optimize our sleep and having a good sleep and that can be anything from the bright, you know, good sleep hygiene and all the things we talked about to people that have problems and doing things like CBTI or sleep extension and certainly back to the exercise again to help. And with that thank you so much for staying here listening to me talk for an hour. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the conference and thanks again.

We have to ask ourselves if we can call ourselves the greatest nation in the world. While 70% nearly three out of four adults are overweight or obese, while we spend about 18% of our GDP on healthcare, more than any other nation, and yet we rank 50 fifth in life expectancy. Our children are getting type UD's at unheard of rates. This is not just a health crisis, it is a cultural crisis. Obesity is not inevitable. It is not a fact of God. It is something that can be prevented. It is a choice that has been compounded by bad habits. Over time, it is reinforced by a culture that does not foster good decision making and self-discipline. And we have created a culture where these difficult truths have become personal attacks, where physicians are afraid to talk about a patient's weight because it's too taboo. If we can't have a conversation about obesity, how can we ever solve the obesity crisis? Obesity is associated with 13 different types of cancers. It takes between three to 10 years off of life expectancy. It damages DNA causes double-stranded breaks to DNA, which is the precursor to oncogenic mutations. And it fundamentally accelerates the aging process. And yet it is the principle difference between our nation and the longest live nations. We are overfed but undernourished. So about, I would say, 60% of daily total calories consumed by the average American come from ultra-process foods. These foods are caloric rich. They are nutrient poor. They do not increase the tiety. So people do not get associated. They continue to overeat the gain weight. They are cheaper than whole foods. So people are economically incentivized to eat unhealthy. And they activate the dopamine reward pathways in our brain causing addiction. So this trifecta of no citi, low cost, and addiction really kind of spiral us into this process of poor health outcomes and runaway health care cost. And over consumption of calories is actually not the only problem. We are also micronutrient deficient. So the food we eat is supposed to provide us with essential vitamins and minerals that run our entire metabolism. Omega-3. So about 80 to 90% of Americans have low omega-3 levels. We now know that low omega-3 levels have the same mortality risk as smoking. Vitamin D deficiency easily corrected. Vitamin D gets converted into a steroid hormone that basically runs about 5% of our protein encoding human genome. Everything from immune function to brain function to cancer, very important, easily corrected. Magnusium, about half the country, does not get enough magnesium from their diet. Magnusium is essential for over 300 enzymes in the body, including repairing damage to our DNA. DNA damage is happening every day. It's not something you can see in the mirror. It's not something that you're going to know about on a day-to-day basis, but it is what is promotes cancer. So decades later, it rears its ugly head. But the real problem is simpler. We actually need to start thinking about physical inactivity as a disease. We now know that it carries the same mortality risk as smoking, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Yet, when the average American reaches age 50, they lose about 10% of their peak muscle mass by the time they reach age 70, they're losing about 40% of their peak muscle mass. And this isn't just about looking strong. It's about physical independence. It's about survival. So higher muscle mass is associated with a 30% lower all-caused mortality. Grip strength is actually a better predictor of cardiovascular-related mortality. The number one killer in the United States, than high blood pressure, and yet nobody talks about it. And strength is also associated with a 42% lower dementia risk. And yet, we think of resistance training as an add-on, as a luxury. It is not. It's a fundamental pillar of aging. It increases muscle mass, muscle strength, and bone mineral density. So fractures are a death sentence between 20 to 60% of Americans that have a hip fracture die within a year. And yet, resistance training can lower fracturists by 30 to 40%. This is preventable. We have the information. We have the data. We need to take action. And resistance training, exercise, getting the right foods are the most important things that we can do to prevent disease and make a difference in our country. So thank you. Dr. Patrick, our healthcare system is broken. It's reactive, not preventative. How do we get more longevity, focus care, and domain-stream medicine, and what's standing in the way? Well, I think that the most important thing that we can do right now for longevity medicine is actually move more. And I think that the federal exercise guidelines are sort of out of date to be honest. We don't focus at all on resistance training. It says two days a week. What does that mean? I mean, to be honest, people might just start doing some bicep curls. And I mean, there's not information there. You need to give people specific information, actionable information. I think resistance training, okay, where you can do 15 minute, seven or eight, 15 minute workouts throughout the week. And that's as good as doing 3, 45 minute workouts in terms of gaining muscle mass and strength. So giving some more specifics in terms of types of exercise, also compound lifts. Like you want to basically make people be physically independent. So you don't want bicep curls. You want people to be doing squats, or you want them to be doing rows or dead lifts. Things that are multi-joint. I also think exercise snacks is a big one. So there's nothing in the guidelines about how people can get exercise benefits by doing these short bursts of physical activity. Tons of research coming out on this. I mean, we're talking at recent study just show that doing 10 body weight squats, every 45 minutes over a seven and a half hour work week was better at improving blood sugar regulation than a 30 minute walk. I mean, that's like two and a half minutes a day. There's also tons of evidence coming out on these unstructured exercise snacks. And that's also something that can be recommended. So these are the kind of things that you take the stairs instead of the elevator, or you walk briskly instead of taking a car to work, you know, to work. And there've been studies showing that people wearing these accelerometers are able to reduce their cancer mortality by 40 percent, their cardiovascular related mortality by 50 percent if they're doing nine minutes a day of these unstructured snacks, whether they're just basically taking advantage of every day, you know, situations to get physically active. It doesn't cost money to do body weight squats. It's that you don't have to have a gym membership. So I think that's one important way that I think information can be improved and more targeted. And I think that's one of the questions I have for, you know, Dr. Patrick, I mean, we've known about this for quite some time, right? I mean, the food pyramid was a marketing. There's nothing scientific about that. It was a marketing deal. We've gone to seed oils. Again, the problem we have is as a consumer is, again, you have all the books out there, you have all these different theories. Who do you believe? It's a very confusing thing. And unless you just go completely simple, all whole foods, no ultra-processed food, trying to approach it that way. But Dr. Patrick, just kind of comment on that. Well, I do think that going whole foods and trying to reduce your ultra-processed foods as much as possible is the way to go. And I think we have a lot more information now than we did, you know, 30, 40 years ago. We know that these ultra-processed foods are not causing satiety. That is, we know that they're you know, activating this addictive reward pathways in our brain. So I think that information is a little more in depth. But I also think that some of the information on like, why do we eat? Okay, if we have nutrition in primary and secondary school, definitely medical school, you're right. I mean, one class in nutrition, it's absurd, right? I mean, if we can start educating at an early age, children, why do they get from their food? Why do you want to eat leafy greens? Magnesium's there. What does magnesium do? What happens if you don't get magnesium? What is cancer? You know, there's even some data out of Japan. They have that program in Japan where they have in primary schools, nutrition education, and they've shown longitudinal studies that people that were, you know, educated with nutrition in childhood are much more likely to eat healthy nutritious later on life.

Over the course of nearly a hundred episodes of the film I've been in this podcast, I've had the privilege of interviewing some of the most prestigious researchers in the fields of exercise physiology, nutrition, human performance, and these conversations have really brought together some of the greatest minds and knowledge in the field of exercise physiology. I'm excited to introduce my special guest today, Brady Homer, who is a accomplished endurance athlete with an incredibly high BO2 Max. Brady and I set out together to work on a pretty ambitious project where we wanted to distill a lot of the cutting edge research that was discussed on the film I fitness podcast from these leading experts into a guide that not only was evidence-based but had actionable insights for people. It's called the How to Train, according to the experts guide. So I think the result is we have this really great roadmap that people can follow, looking for how to improve whatever the end goals that they're looking for, whether that is optimizing their cardiovascular fitness or their hypertrophy training or perhaps even body recomposition. So in this training guide we cover a lot of different aspects of exercise including training protocols to improve cardiovascular training protocols to delay heart aging and improve the cardiovascular structure of the heart. We also have a lot of information in there on how to train to improve metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism, glucose metabolism. And we also get into resistance training protocols whether you're interested in improving strength, bone mass, bone density, muscle hypertrophy, or losing fat at the same time while you're gaining muscle. So that would be body recomposition. And in addition we have some supplemental information in there on Sonneus, they're protein intake and other supplements like omega 3 and creatine. So a lot of really great information in this guide you can find that guide and download it for free and how to train guide.com. So that being said today's episode will serve as a companion to that guide. Brady and I will discuss a lot of the information you'll find in the free guide and we'll probably give some of our personal takeaways as well. Yeah, run. I think putting together this guide, it was incredible. I got to listen and re-listen to many of the interviews that you had with some of these world leaving experts and I personally learned a lot and had a lot of fun putting it together. So we're going to cover a lot of things today and I think what we're going to start with is aerobic exercise training kind of a very popular topic these days with people interested in how to improve their view to max and their cardiovascular health. I've interviewed experts in this area including Dr. Martin Gabala kind of an expert in high intensity interval training exercise physiology and Dr. Benjamin Levine who was a gave like a master class on just how to improve heart health. I found that episode very interesting. So we're going to start today with talking to people about how to improve their cardiovascular health, their view to max with aerobic exercise training. One of your also one of your areas of expertise. I agree that when Dr. Ben Levine came on the podcast while I was doing you know a lot of background information research on you know his work. So reading his publications and then after after the podcast episode I felt like I learned just a tremendous amount of information that had no idea about which is really like the cardiovascular structure and what role the heart structure of the heart plays and cardiovascular health. But I do think before we get started we should probably mention that it's important I think for people to identify what their goals are with respect to training. So are you someone that's interested in becoming an elite endurance athlete like yourself or are you interested in improving your health metrics. So maybe increasing your health span so to speak reducing your cardiovascular disease risk reducing your dementia risk reducing your risk of cancer all the while you know improving mental health improving muscle mass maintaining independence with with age. These are all things that are my personal goals and I do think that guide covers a lot of those bases. But again, you know some people might be training for different goals. But certainly I think that's you know in this guy there are a lot of protocols that we're going to provide and people can I think they mostly geared towards people improving their longevity their help span and optimizing health but you know if you're a performance oriented person and are looking to get stronger or compete whether that's in some type of resistance training competition or maybe you're on a faster five care 10k this guy has those types of things too. You know you call me an elite endurance athlete I'm kind of far from elite but I appreciate that sentiment. Brady is being a bit modest not only is he elite from a cardiovascular respiratory fitness standpoint if not strictly a competitive standpoint. He also has a master's in science a research background and is wicked smart. But you know I have performance goals obviously which are turn a fast marathon that's kind of these days what my primary goal has been and so you know I might train differently from somebody who just wants to get healthier or improve their health span if they're in middle age or older age or even younger people who are just kind of getting into exercise. So yeah it's important to define the goals and that will kind of determine how you want to train and even though my goal is to optimize to run a fast marathon you know given that it's not my full time job just to run fast and I have other goals like reducing my injury risk and. Just having a high level of vitality I also want to you know train for brain health like you run I think I find the benefits of exercise on my brain one of the kind of most salient benefits of exercise. But I also just want to be strong be able to to do things and you know maintain health. Layed into life so I can keep doing the things that I want to do so I think my the way I approach training is try to optimize for performance but. Not at the extent of sacrificing some of my you know other health metrics so I type I try to blend a little bit of the two. Well with the view to max of what 75 75 and 80 is you know I've tested a few times throughout my life and so it's somewhere in that range. I mean that's why I would say you're elite but I mean maybe an elite level of you to max but my my running times wouldn't be considered elite by most standards. Well, it's a big new car you risk your trade fitness I think that that would be a good place to start. It is something that we've covered quite a bit on the the podcast and. Dr. Ben Levine when I had him on the podcast really he was discussing just an eye opening study for me. But he was a part of it was a study that was done over the course of 30 years there was two separate studies and known as the Dallas bed rest red bed rest study. And the study involved first of all Dr. Leene's mentor, Jeremy Chilhu was studying a group of men. And looking at the effects of being sedentary on their cardiovascular risk. And other cardiovascular health parameters and when I say sedentary I mean full on sedentary there they were under they went underwent bed rest for three weeks. So with that study found was loan be hold when you're actually not moving for three weeks not even getting up to go to the bathroom. So I mean they were they had catheters this was extreme bed rest they really wanted to look and see what happened to cardio. And the last of their function, cardiovascular fitness after just not moving for three weeks of course loan be hold cardiovascular respiratory fitness declined not so surprising as well as a lot of the other parameters they measured. But what was really eye opening to me was you know fast forward 30 years Dr. Leene's now in. And they find those same group of men and they wanted to see what 30 years of aging had done to their cardiovascular fitness which does naturally decline with age. And what they found was that their cardiovascular respiratory fitness after 30 years of aging was no worse than their cardiovascular fitness after three weeks of bed rest three years ago. So essentially three weeks of bed rest is worse for your cardiovascular health for your cardiovascular fitness than 30 years of aging and when you put it like that it's like wow being sedentary is so detrimental on our cardiovascular health. So maybe you can Brady just kind of recap highlight talk about what cardiovascular respiratory fitness is how you measure it. I guess we'll get into some ways to improve it but I mean this is something that you you have a lot of experience in as well. I think people will be pretty familiar with the term cardiovascular respiratory fitness it's sometimes used interchangeably with the two max or your maximal oxygen consumption it's kind of a very popular biomarker these days with you know what you said. And we'll talk about later correlating with longevity and so on so cardiovascular fitness is sort of the exercise physiologist measure of a rubric fitness it's very popular as an endurance performance marker or that's traditionally how it was thought of. You know how I've got to have you two max is kind of standard among high level endurance athletes but essentially what it is is your bodies ability to take in oxygen take an air from the environment distributed to the rest of the body through your cardiovascular system. Get that oxygen into mitochondria and skeletal muscle and then utilize that oxygen for energy in the form of ATP. So it sort of represents your bodies integrative ability to take in distribute and utilize oxygen and again I think we'll talk about this later but I think that's why it's such a potent predictor of longevity it's because. It's not maybe just something like grip strength but it really represents you know your bodies physical function and your ability to produce ATP. It's measured during maximal exercise hence the term maximal oxygen consumption so one of the ways that it's typically measured say if you were in an exercise physiology study you would get on a treadmill you would run at progressively faster speeds until eventually you just couldn't go anymore so you would exercise until exhaustion. All the while having your gas exchange measured so you're going to be wearing a mask to measure your oxygen intake and that's able to you know measure the rate of oxygen utilization by your body and at the point of maximal exertion however much oxygen your body is utilizing that sure maximal oxygen your rate of oxygen consumption. It's not a fun test that's the main way to measure it and probably the gold standard way to measure it would be during an incremental exercise test to exhaustion but it can also be measured or estimated rather using things like the Cooper 12 minute test which essentially involves you just running kind of as far as you can in 12 minutes and there are online calculators where you can put your time into there to get an estimate you can also get an estimate of your view to max by if you have a smart watch or something like that a fitness tracker that will also allow you to. estimated and I say estimate because you know without direct measures of gas exchange you're not really able to definitively say what that is but it uses various things like your age sex weight and your physical fitness metrics to estimate that so. There's a kind of the three primary ways that that people can measure it um Dr Levine kind of talked about some of the flaws with estimating it using those equations versus you know obviously getting it directly measured into a lab but. Yeah, it's it's a performance marker obviously but it's also a health marker and I think Levine talked about how important it was not only for improving it but also to try maintain it throughout life span. It is something that I even the past I would say three two to three years I became it kind of came on my radar as. An important biomarker for longevity right there's a variety of biomarkers that can be looked at and you know as you mentioned even compared to something like grip strength. Cardi respiratory fitness seems to really shine in terms of being a good indicator of your overall health status when Levine was on the podcast after Levine was talking about you know takes a certain amount of. Oxygen like your cardiovascular respiratory fitness has to be a certain level just to sit down and have a conversation like we're having right. And if you're a sedentary person that really hasn't tried to improve their cardiovascular fitness like at all. As you get older because it does decline like even maintaining that just level of just having a conversation or maybe walking to the bathroom or walking to your car. You're so out of breath that's when you're really reaching this this level where you have to be concerned about falling off the cliff right when just normal everyday functioning is hard. But even above and beyond that there's been just numerous studies that have looked at the correlation of the two max so cryuress the preparedness and all cosmortality. One I've talked about and I talked about Levine as well was a published study in JAMA medical journal in 2018 where I think it was like. Participants that were involved in some they were that previous veterans and so they were sort of looked at according to their cardiovascular fitness and the people that were in the highest group. Had a five year increase life expectancy compared to people in the lowest cardiovascular fitness group which is pretty profound and you're talking about five years. But also even if you looked at the people in the very highest group and you compared them to people in the high normal so they were still like on the high normal end they're doing good. Like those those people in the highest group had a 20% lower all cosmortality so they were still doing better than the people that had a high normal cardiovascular fitness. But I think also it was really surprising to me in that study was that the people in that low cardiovascular fitness group had a mortality risk that was comparable or even worse than people with diseases that we know are clearly bad for your health like. I do that you beat these like heart disease hypertension even smokers so in other words again going back to this Dallas better rest study as well were being sedentary for three weeks was worse on your cardiovascular health than 30 years of aging. It really drives home that point that when you're sedentary and your cardiovascular fitness is falling you it is a disease being sedentary is is a disease and I do think that low cardiovascular respiratory fitness should be considered kind of like a disease marker as well a lot more can be said about the O2 max and cardiovascular respiratory fitness. I do you kind of mentioned a little bit about athletes being interested in the O2 max and improving your V2 max. Can you talk a little bit about why maybe athletes think about training explicitly for the O2 max or maybe what they don't. Yeah I think dancers that would be they sort of do and they don't I mean. I guess it would depend maybe or type of athletes we're talking about so I guess maybe we'll use endurance athletes maybe like such as myself as an example. Like you mentioned before I have a generally high view to max and while that's. I like to think about it is you know having a high view to max if you want to be an endurance athlete is sort of a free requisite to kind of get in the door you know you won't find someone in the Olympics or you know even at a sub elite level who probably doesn't have a view to max of 65 or above. I think one of this take it to get into the gate of oh if you want to be an endurance athlete you need to have a view to max of 65 or higher. But once you get kind of to those higher levels of elite athletes who all have that view to max of above 65 it doesn't do a very good job of predicting who's going to win the race. So if we line up at the start line and you say you don't have any idea of people's previous performance but you just have their view to max is the person with the highest view to max isn't always going to win. And that's because there are several other performance markers that are associated with doing well and say a race like how long you can run at a high percent of your view to max your lactate threshold your exercise economy. These are all things that you can improve independent of your view to max that can help improve your performance. So yes, well, I want to do view to max workouts as an endurance athlete and most endurance athletes will do in view to max type workouts every now and then but once a week in the form of high intensity intervals. So if you can also do workouts that are targeting you know getting better at running economy or training their lactate threshold. So you can get better without improving your view to max. I think that's important not just for athletes to know but just people who are generally interested in health. If you're training you don't see you know your view to maxing or watches and necessarily improving, well you can still get faster you can still get stronger improve your exercise performance while not improving your view to max. It's for that reason I think that athletes sometimes don't just think about explicitly training their view to max many elite athletes might not even know their view to max is because they don't care they just really care about how fast they're running. But then of course athlete should be concerned about increasing their view to max not only for the health reasons that you just mentioned you know it's associated with longevity which is great. You want to avoid that decline with age and maintain it as long as possible. Again, you know you can see significant improvements when you do improve your view to max which can be thought of as you're ceiling. You know if you move your ceiling up everything below that is going to improve. So the short answer to that would be yeah athletes look to improve their view to max among the highest people of the highest view to max is it might not be as much of a concern but people are all still interested. You know athletes and non athletes alike are interested in improving their view to max. Well you you alluded a little bit to you know you said high intensity of training and that's you know one way that you can improve the are two max and I think we're going to get it into an a minute talking about Dr Markabalas research. But I'm interested so let's say you know you want to improve your lactate clearance when that you mentioned like how like how what kind of training. How how how do you train differently than doing like high intensity of role training. How would you improve your lactating clearance more like yeah. You can certainly do that by using high intensity interval training. I mean you're producing a lot of lactate during high intensity interval training. So you're inherently going to help improve your lactate clearance capacity. Doing what would be called kind of steady state or threshold workouts is kind of one way to do that where you're you're exercising at that point where lactate levels are just above kind of the steady state. So you're working on you know where lactate production equals lactate clearance doing those type of what would be called lactate threshold workouts that seems to obviously be a good way to improve your lactate clearance capacity. And then there are others who would argue or say you know I think there's decent evidence to support that something like zone two training also improves your lactate clearance capacity. So you can do all different types of training and we're going to talk about low moderate and high intensity training and why all of those integrating all of those is important. So the main thing that I'm going to be doing like steady state type and high intensity interval training workouts. Well so high intensity of a train workouts like Dr. Martin Gballo is on the podcast and he's really an expert in high intensity interval training. And there's there are a lot of people that are interested in the time efficiency of it so high intensity interval training. And there's a lot of ways to define it. And Marty likes to talk about it being like when you're when you're doing it doing the interval that you you're doing vigorous exercise and that could be different for a lot of people depending on your your fitness level. But essentially it's your you're working harder than you can't really have a conversation when you're doing that interval. So you're going really hard most people are about 85, 80 to 85% at least maximum heart rate for the interval and then you know they have these periods of recovery and they go back to the. Working second part the interval again. What was really interesting to me with respect to improving car respiratory fitness when Marty came on the podcast he was talking about a meta analysis that had looked at a variety of different studies were people were meeting the requirements for moderate intensity exercise. So they were doing about 150 minutes a week of. What is called moderate intensity exercise so they're probably doing you know something more like a zone two whether or maybe even a little bit less than that but you know something like 60 to 80% their their max heart rate and about 40% of those individuals didn't see improvements in their cardiovascular fitness. And last. Some high intensity year will training or some more vigorous exercise was sort of added to the equation. So. Can you talk a little bit more about like you you mix in you know high intensity and we'll train into your workouts. But like why do you think there's this sort of non responder effect or. There's played multiple reasons for it but like what's the rationale for adding in more vigorous type of exercise or high intensity and we'll train into a workout to improve cardiovascular fitness. I think if you take a group of people who have never trained before kind of unfit people and just give them a lot of lower intensity or you know what people might refer to as own two training. Everybody is going to kind of improve because you have it's a new training stimulus you know you've never trained before. You add some exercise. Okay, well, obviously you're going to get better and you mentioned the concept of non responders which has kind of been around in like exercise physiology for a while and it essentially refers to. If people exercise training program there are some people who don't improve for some reason or another their view to max and I think there's kind of a debate on there where it might just be due to like an measurement air instead of actually a non response but like you just mentioned when you give those people high intensity interval training. Everybody responds. There's some kind of recent studies that show that very well you just increase their dose of exercise or their intensity or both and they improve their fitness. So they're just basically not doing enough and so that points to the fact that if you want to get better you need to add in some higher intensity interval training. Obviously you can increase the dose of your moderate intensity training to your volume but adding a greater stimulus. You know that seems to be the main benefit of doing high intensity training. You can't just do the same thing. You can't just do low intensity training all the time. You need to Emily mix it up for variety, but you need to give your body a greater stimulus if you want it to adapt and improve. And so Dr. Martin Gabala was talking a lot during your interview about the importance of doing that, doing hit probably at least once a week, elevating your heart rate. Just to get that additional stimulus to force your body to adapt, get stronger for your, you know, heart to get stronger and for your cardiovascular system to get better. Yeah, it's actually a doctor living also mentioned something similar where he was saying, you know, you have to continually stress your cardiovascular system to have the adaptation, and so if you keep doing the same thing without ever adding an additional stress or stimulus, then you're only going to stay the same. Maybe you're not really going to improve right. And so it does make sense from not aspect as well. Since we're talking about vigorous intensity and adding more of a, as a stressor and a more stronger stimulus, maybe you can recapture some of what Dr. Levine, Dr. Gabala talked about on the podcast when they were sort of different. The various trained zones, what these zones are because there is a lot of information out there on that, which is, can be quite confusing to people. It can be and some people will like to use zones for training. I think it's common and sort of the exercise with, you know, coaches who are coaching endurance athletes to use this five zone model. You know, our familiar with listening to podcast on fitness, they'll probably hear people reference five zones. They're obviously other zones to use, but yeah, Dr. Levine defined these sort of five training zones. And kind of before I go and define what these are and how people can use them to guide their training. I think it's he kind of defined them using three different metrics and that we're going to use to define each of the zones. Lactate levels are one way to do it, but we're not really going to discuss that because in reality, you know, most people are not going to be measuring their lactate levels. We clean monthly or even, you know, certainly not daily during exercise. And so it's kind of a move point to say, you know, zoom to exercises this lactate level. Most people don't really know what that is. And so there are other ways to measure intensities and use these zones. One way is just your rating of perceived exertion or RPE. And this is just a subjective measure of how hard you think you're exercising. And this is typically on a six to 20 scale. Now that might seem kind of weird for people like, oh, why is it not one to ten, one to ten's kind of typical. What people use like a hard as this scale, but it's called the board RPE scale and the six to 20 is essentially because the initially the theory behind that scale was that you were just at a zero to whatever your RPE was. And that will correspond to your heart rate. So say average person has the maximum heart rate of around 200 if I give you an RPE of 18, that means about heart rate's probably around 180, which is a fairly high intensity, whereas maybe my RPE right now is a six, maybe my heart rate's 60. That's like a resting heart rate. So that's kind of the idea behind that scale, so people kind of understand what that means and why we're doing six to 20 versus one to ten. Another way is to use the talk test and that's essentially just like, are you able to do a full conversation, barely get out words or not talk at all. That's kind of another way to kind of gauge zones. The next end of the final way to describe this zone is to be based on your percentage of your maximal heart rate. And a lot of people have heart rate monitors. So they're going to be able to measure their heart rate during exercise. So we're going to define zones using all three of those kind of metrics. So if we look at zone one, this is going to be a recovery intensity. This is pretty much easier you can go. It's not resting, but it's very, very light activity. So on the RPE scale, this is going to be anywhere from a six to an eight. It's going to be about 50 to 60% of your maximal heart rate. And if you're going to use the talk test to measure that intensity, it would be you could hold a full conversation. So what you were not doing right now, and just talking, having a podcast, you could basically do that if you were in zone one or recovery intensity because you're going on an easy walk or something like that. Zone two intensity people will hear about zone two training all the time. This is still kind of a low, a light to a moderate intensity exercise. So it's going to correspond to an RPE of about nine to 12, 60 to 70% of your maximal heart rate. And then the talk test again, you should be able to have a conversation in zone two. And someone we're listening to, they could probably tell you were exercising, but in general, you could hold pretty much a full conversation. And so these, you know, zone one zone two, those are going to be your light to moderate intensity exercises, in particular, you know, that zone two training good for kind of building your erobic base. Then there's zone three. This is kind of veering into the territory of high intensity and we'll training. It's thought of a lot as your threshold intensity or maybe steady state exercise. It's going to correspond to an RPE of 13 to 15 about 70 to 80% of your maximal heart rate. And then this is where talking gets a little bit difficult. So you could speak in broken sentences. Let's still not, you're not gaskin for air yet, but you can speak in broken sentences and that would be a good way to indicate kind of this zone during using the talk test. And then zone four. This is where you get in and out the high intensity training. So it's a 16 to 18 RPE. It's, you know, 80 to 95% of your maximal heart rate. And you could probably only speak one word or two at a time. Maybe if you were trying to gauge that zone based on the talk test. And then zone five. That's maximal exercise intensity. That's your VO2 max. It's as hard as you can go. So RPE 19 or 20. It's 95% of your maximal heart rate. And then you shouldn't be able to talk. So if you're doing, you know, tabata intervals or something like that. This is zone five. You shouldn't be able to talk at all during that exercise intensity. So those are the five zones. And I think what's cool about having all these different metrics to define the zones is that, you know, if people don't really want to train using heart rate or maybe they don't even have a heart rate monitor. They can use the talk test. They can use RPE or maybe a combination of all three of these. And they're pretty reliable. I mean, they've all of these have been kind of well evidence to correspond to the different zones. But I think what's nice is that people can use these to train and if it requires a lot of technical ability, a lot of experience. And so this is, I think, you know, in my mind the best way that people can think about kind of training intensities is using the zones as we define them here at least using those as a guide. I really like the talk test way of defining it because as you were sitting or talking about this, I was thinking about my, my whole exercise protocol and I'm like, okay, oh, yeah, that's actually when I thought was more zone two is really more zone three, what I'm doing here. With respect to heart rate monitors, do you, I know Levine mentioned there can be a lot of error with using some like a smartwatch. And is there more accuracy in using something like a chest strap, like a maybe a polar strap versus a smartwatch versus like the talk test. So let's say you don't have a chest strap. Should you be using a talk test or can you still use your smartwatch as it still, what's more accurate. Yeah, I think the accuracy of the smartwatch is is obviously there. They've been validated against EKG and things like that, but as Levine mentioned and as others have kind of drawn caution. They tend to get less accurate as the intensity of exercise increases. They're not perfect because you know it's getting your heart rate reading from a sensor on your wrist versus your chest. So I would encourage everybody to invest in heart rate chest, you know, a chest strap monitor. And that's not a hundred dollar investment. It's going to give you a lot more accurate data. Some people find them uncomfortable, but most of them now are pretty comfortable. And if you really want to train using heart rate, I would say invest in the chest strap, but you know, the or the watches aren't totally off and they can use as a good kind of reference as to where you are. But like I said, in my experience and I think these periods of others, the heart rate that you go, the higher the intensity goes kind of the less accurate that they get. If you want to use heart rate, great, it can be a good indicator, but the talk test is a very good, I think way to assess your exercise intensity, especially for people who are newer. So I think one of the not flaws with RPE, but one of the caveats is that you need a little bit of experience to really know where you're at, like how hard something is. I mean, if somebody has never actually gone to a maximal intensity and how do you know how do you know what a 20 out of 20 is if you've never really reached the point of volitional exhaustion. So if somebody is just beginning to exercise, they might be at 70% of their maximal intensity, but they might think that they're out of 20. So it takes time to learn kind of what your RPE is to be able to assess that accurately. So I would say, you know, if people are more experienced with exercise, then you could use something like RPE to kind of gauge your intensity. But those newer to exercise might actually have a lot of good feedback with the talk test. I even kind of use that. I mean, you know, it's, if you're running with a group of people and you can have a conversation, okay, well, we're probably in zone two. If I'm really struggling to like breathe, then I might be in zone three for even five. So I think it's a great way to use the talk test. Anybody can use it, but I think newer people might benefit more from that. And I think also what people can think about doing is using combination of all three, you know, you can use heart rate. You can use RPE. You can use the talk test. And maybe see if those, you know, correlate with one another during exercise. But use all those to kind of inform your exercise intensity. Exactly. I usually am not wearing. I do have a chest strap. I have a Polish chest strap. I have used it before, but I'm not typically wearing it when I'm doing a workout. And so I think using my, my, my, my, my Apple watch along with the talk test because they often have someone with me when I'm working out is like, okay, well, maybe, maybe it's not entirely accurate as I'm getting into my zone three, perhaps so and four. But I know I can't talk more than a word. So it's clearly like it's good to combine them both. So I want to, there's, there's a lot of interest in zone two training. I talked about zone two training with Dr. Martin Kabbala, a little bit with Dr. Benlebyn. And I want to ask you, maybe you can talk a little bit about what are the benefits of zone two training. Unique are there unique benefits of zone two training metabolically, um, cardiovascular health wise. And as you were explaining and defining some of these zones, I was thinking to myself, even, what's the real difference between zone two and what you would call zone three, right, this, this threshold type of training as well, right, so I'd love to hear. Yeah, the benefits of zone two training, I think are are kind of vast. I mean, a lot of people will talk about how some of the main benefits are going to be it's it really serves as foundation for building your early base. You know, it is good for maybe it may best just set back a little bit and kind of define what zone two is maybe based on the exercise physiology, just definition of it, which would be. It's kind of the intensity where you're maximizing your mitochondrial fat oxidation. It's a steady state exercise less so than a threshold like intensity. And so your lactate levels, it's tip you measure during lactate is kind of the accurate way to do it. So your lactate levels are steady. They're not increasing. Some will actually give like a lactate number being about two millimolar. I mean, I think there may be kind of some debate about that because I think as I've heard you talk about multiple times, you know, people will have different lactate levels. And so two millimolar might not represent a zone two intensity for everyone. I mean, my differ based on whether you're unfit or you're a fit athlete or something like that. So I think it's important though that you're at a steady, your lactate levels aren't continually rising during zone two training. E key, I think, and one of the main benefits for for the first time, too, is that you're improving your fat burning capacity, and only during exercise, but also your mitochondria's ability to oxidize fat as it energy source because that's the intensity at which the fat oxidation of mitochondria is is maximal. So if you don't do training, you know, elite athletes are doing a lot of it in particular just because their exercise volumes are so high. And so I think one of the, you know, areas of not disagreement, but kind of conflict is that people will say you need to do a lot of zone two training, you know, needs to make up a majority of your exercise training and a lot of what that those people are referring to, whether their coaches is that, you know, the elite athletes doing 20 to 30 hours a week. Well, obviously they do a lot of zone two training because they're exercising for 20 to 30 hours per week. You know, there are certainly benefits to that for building the aerobic base that allows you to do a high level of volume without burnout. There's a very low injury risk with zone two training because it's a lighter intensity. You're not overly stressing your autonomic nervous system or your cardiovascular system. And so it has these benefits of just allowing you to do a lot of low intensity volume to build, you know, what's called the aerobic base and improve your fat burning capacity and those seem to be the main benefits. And I think defining it though is important because zone two gets talked about a lot, but in reality, we just talked about different ways to define zone two based on the talk test based on RPE based on heart rate. When most people say that there's only doing zone two training, they really don't know if there's doing zone two training because you're not measuring lactate really without lactate or you're not measuring your fat oxidation rate in mitochondria. You don't really know if you're in a physiological zone two. It correlates with all of those other kind of subjective and objective measures that we talked about like heart rate, but to say that, you know, you're doing zone two training isn't necessarily accurate, unless you're, you know, actually have a accurate measure of lactate. There are certainly several benefits to zone two or what I like to just refer to as low to moderate intensity training. I think that's more accurate and certainly a more accurate way that people can refer to that type of training. Well, you mentioned a pretty daunting number here. You said 20 to 30 hours of exercise a week, which is far beyond what I myself do. I'm more in the 6 to 6 and a half hours a week. And so, you know, the question is, if you are not doing 20 to 30 hours that say you're doing maybe 5 or even less than that, you're getting like 2 and a half. This is where Dr. Gabala on the podcast was talking about high intensity interval training, being really time efficient and having many of the same benefits as even like a zone two type of training with respect to mitochondrial benefits, cardiovascular benefits. If not even better, if the same volume of exercise is performed, in other words, if you're doing 30 minutes of zone two and then a 30 minute high intensity interval training workout. That you're going to have even more improvements in cardiovascular fitness than you would zone two, you can have better improvements in even mitochondrial density, for example than you would. So, it's kind of interesting to look at the benefits of doing something like high intensity interval training. Now, you're not going to do 20 hours of hit. I mean, that's impostable, right? And like you were saying burn out and things like that are also an issue and you have to be able to space them out with recovery. But there are a lot of benefits to doing high intensity interval training, time efficiency, you get improvements in cardiovascular fitness. We talked about that with even people that were doing regular, you know, low to moderate intensity exercise for 150 minutes a week. They need to really stress their system a little bit more about them beyond that to get improvements not everyone but a large percentage of them did. And then there's also some brain benefits that are also really, I don't want to say uniquely associated with high intensity interval training or vigorous exercise. But also the benefits are associated with the lactate that you're producing which does come with increasing exercise intensity, right? So if people are time limited and they want to combine some some too training with hit, like can you combine them in one session, like can you I was talking about, you know, with you the other day, like sometimes they'll go for I'll do some my jog or I'll do like a zoom to work out and then I'll add in some intervals, right? Where I'm like going I'm going pretty hard for a certain amount of time and then I kind of go back to a slower pace where I can have a talk to us after my heart right? Come down a little bit. Yeah, it's um, it's interesting because I think certainly, you know, there was kind of this debate and like, oh, do you need to do separate? Do you need to keep your really easy days easy or can you combine it with zoom, zoom, four or zoom, five like high intensity interval training? I think it's a unique concept, especially for, you know, as we talk about the time efficiency of it. Maybe there are people who only have two to three days per week when they can engage in a robotic exercise and they want to do some moderate and some high intensity training on the same day. I mean, in reality, like when you do a high intensity interval training session, you're kind of doing a little bit of modern intensity because as I'm sure you structure your protocols run in like I structure my interval training workouts. I'm doing, you know, probably 20 to 30 minutes of warm up or more and a cool down, which is that a lighter intensity and then I'm doing the main session, which has some high intensity intervals, but you know, 50% of that session might actually be at a at a low intensity heart rate. But yeah, I think it's interesting to think about doing somebody wanted to do a 30 to 45 minute, say, just a zoom, too, as we'll call it, maybe low to moderate intensity run or a ride or maybe even a slow walk and then finish with some high intensity intervals. I think that's a great strategy that people can use if they want to get some high intensity training and some moderate intensity training. In the same session, that moderate intensity session beforehand might even serve as like a good warm up if you're doing 30 to 45, maybe even like 60 minutes to do that. And there don't seem to be detrimental, I guess, you're not rooting your zone to session by doing the hit at the end of it because you've already gained the benefits of doing your low to moderate intensity and then you're ending with the lactate elevating the heart rate elevating type of exercise. So you're getting the benefits of both and I think people could certainly structure their workout to do that to optimize kind of both those benefits. Incidentate and if they are, if they are time limited. I do love ending my run with a with a sprint. Yeah, I do that a lot too if sometimes if I don't have a structured interval workout during the week, which most weeks I do, I will throw in some very hard like sprints at the end of my run or maybe run like the last couple miles of a run like up tempo or something like that. You definitely feel better. So again, going back to like the brain benefits, I think it just makes you when you end with like your heart rate elevated. If it feels a lot better, you don't feel as stale. But you know, there might some physiological benefits there too. Yeah, well, going back to the book there are goals, you know, I did mention brain health and lowering dementia risk. I often also just a lot of my workouts are geared towards like brain health and not even just thinking about long term brain health and you know, delaying. You know, delaying dementia, delaying brain atrophy, delaying all those, you know, brain age with the disease, but also just mental health like how I feel and feeling good and it's clear to me like after I do a, you know, I hit either a hit or also a very long, if I do a much longer. More steady state sort of run. I also get a lot of really great feelings from that as well. I'm actually structuring the amount of, let's say, low to moderate intensity or zone two. I know we're not measuring lactate directly, but let's call it that. First is your high intensity interval training. A lot of people out there, you'll see on a lot of platforms, people say 80, 20, 80% of your exercise workout should be like low to moderate 20% should be high intensity. While I talked a little bit about this, the distribution, the weekly training volume, you know, how, how someone who is not like yourself, you know, endurance athlete. Do they need to follow this 80, 20 rule or how should that distribution does that distribution change? It definitely should. I think Dr. Gambala kind of made that clear in the conversation with you. It's interesting because when I, you know, I'm interested in this as myself as I, you know, not only looked at my own training, but out to prescribed training and talk about like training for people on the internet, but the origins of kind of the 80 or 20 are interesting and it was basically just looking at the training logs of elite athletes and seeing what they do. When you broke it down basically by intensity 80% of their sessions tended to be in this low or zone twoish intensity and then 20% of the sessions appear to be in the higher intensity training. And the important thing I think to note was that it's, it's not necessarily based on time, but rather sessions per week. So say you're doing five training sessions per week. One of those, if you're doing falling to 80, 20, one of those would be high intensity, four of those would be moderate intensity. So it's a number of days versus the total amount of time spent, which kind of makes it easier, I think, for people to think about versus seeing a sitting down and calculating how much time you spent in each of the heart reasons, which is kind of difficult not many people are going to do that. So yeah, I think that the 80, 20 breakdown, it works great if you're doing maybe eight hours or more kind of a aerobic exercise per week, but when you were discussing with Martin Gamala, he seemed to be pretty convinced as am I that, you know, if once your exercise volume starts decreasing kind of below maybe, you know, five to six hours per week or getting a little bit below that, you can probably afford to skew that a little more in favor of high intensity training then. So maybe you're doing something like a 70, 30 or a 60, 40, I mean, you know, most people probably shouldn't do more than two high intensity interval training sessions per week. But again, that's really depend on like, how long are your high intensity training sessions? I mean, you know, you and I were talking when creating this guy and you're talking about how, you know, you might do three high intensity sessions per week, but they're only, and I say only, but 10 minutes long. So sure, you're doing hit three times per week, but they're very short. They're kind of for the brain boost that you get and it doesn't seem to be unsustainable because you've been doing it for long. So obviously that's anecdotal, but yeah, I think if you're doing less if you're doing one to four maybe hours per week, you should be less concerned with how I'm omissating 80% of my training time doing zone two. You could probably do a little bit more high intensity and in fact, you might need to do more high intensity based on things like citations from Dr. Ben Levine on studies where. If you want to get the same benefits of doing eight to 10 hours of moderate intensity, you need to do the one to four hours need to be a higher intensity to equate basically your your training volume. So I think if people are are a little bit time limited and still want to gain the benefits of maybe doing a little bit more moderate intensity training volume, you can certainly do a little bit more hit. So maybe that looks like again, say somebody's doing five training sessions per week, but they're doing you know one to five hours total maybe two of those sessions can be high intensity versus be one. I don't see an issue with that again, I think everybody should based on your training history and your experience, you know, you don't want to burn out or risk injury, but if your volume is low, I think you can afford to fit a little bit more high intensity training in there. And a lot of the evidence kind of would suggest that, I mean, granted most of them are pretty short duration, but there are plenty of studies and exercise science where you take previously unfit people or people who aren't engaging in a lot of exercise and for eight to 12 weeks, you know, they're doing maybe two of the Norwegian 4 by 4 training sessions per week. Sometimes even three sessions per week. Now, do I think that's advisable, probably not, maybe it's not sustainable, but it's clear that they can do it, that they can do a couple of these training sessions per week without getting injured and they received massive benefits from that. Yeah, maybe we should let's just segue into some of the high intensity interval training protocols that are evidence based in terms of improving cardiovascular fitness, for example. And a lot of these protocols are also also improved other parameters which we're going to get into as well, like mitochondrial density as well as other metabolic benefits, but the Norwegian 4 by 4. So this is one of this is probably one of the, it's very well studied protocol where Dr. Levine talked about it, Dr. Kbala talked about it. People are doing four different intervals. So they're doing for for four minutes. They are exercising typically on a stationary bike, perhaps a rowing machine. You could put, you could do it on a treadmill as well. But a lot of the protocols were on the on a bike. And you're doing for, for the four minute interval, you're, you're going at an intensity that you can maintain for that entire four minutes. That's pretty hard. So it's, it's pretty pretty much a sustainable, hard intensity for four minutes. So obviously not going to be maximum, but you're going as hard as you can for, and it's hard as you can sustain for that four minutes. And then you follow that by a three minute recovery period, which is very light, right? You want your heart rate to come down, you want to clear your lactate, and then you go back into the four minute interval. So that's a four by four, you're doing it four times. That's very good protocols to improve cardiovascular fitness. There's a variety of other protocols out there, Dr. Kbala mentioned. So there's the one minute on one minute off and you do that ten times. So that the ten, the ten minute workout, well, it's actually 20 minutes, but ten minutes of more high intensity. I'm training. Where again, for that entire minute, you're going as hard as you can sustain for that minute, right? It's not going to be all out, but it's as much as as hard as you can go and sustain that for a minute. And then you rest and recover for a minute at a very, very low intensity exercise. And then there's things like even to bodice. So to bodice, it would be a 20 second on ten second off. You do that eight times. The 20 seconds you're really going as hard as you can because I mean, 20 seconds is it's not long, although it seems long when you're going as hard as you can. It actually seems quite long. And the recovery interval seemed to short. They're very, very, very. And seeing longer than 20 in the recovery is like over before you know it exactly. And there's a variety of other protocols out there as well, but we were talking a lot about even just adding adding a little like higher intensity. Work out at the end of a run. Do you do the intervals necessarily have to be 85% of your max heart rate. I think I think for most people, it probably, no, doesn't matter. You shouldn't focus on heart rate. It's just if you're going hard and your heart rate is elevated above the modern intensity. If you find it all that high intensity and we'll training and use that to say that was my one hit session for a week. I think again, I mean heart rate training. I'm not sure how many people actually use it. I know in any study that you use an exercise physiology study. Go have measures of heart rate because yeah, you have physiologist on the side measuring your heart rate during exercise. But I mean, I can't tell you the last time I really looked at my heart rate or what percent of my heart rate I was at during exercise. I'm typically just basically getting off of our PE and I'm looking at my heart rate after the fact. So I think that you can pick an interval workout. If you want to do the 4 by 4, if you want to do the 10 by 1, or if you want to do Tabata. One looking at your heart rate with the entire time is going to be distracting. You know, focus on the workout. So I think going out hard intensity like you said. I didn't think that you think seems sustainable for 4 minutes and doing that. I mean, once you get more familiar with the exercise, you may then be able to know that. Oh, if I'm going at, you know, however many watts, maybe 120 watts. And this is kind of my 85 percent max heart rate. You can use that to kind of guide your training. But in general, I mean, again, I think most people aren't going to be looking at their heart rate the entire time. So we're talking about what your heart rate should be at. But it's just just go out of heart intensity. And for most people, that's going to be enough to get the benefits of high intensity and training, which I think is important because a lot of the time we get caught up in. Oh, what's my heart rate? And if you're going hard, you know whether you're going harder or not. And that can be fine. I think for most people to train. Right. And again, going back to what we were talking about earlier and what Dr. Levine and the Kabbalah were mentioning about just mixing it up and giving that little extra stress stressor so that you get those adaptations. Right. You don't want to keep doing the same things. Sometimes even just doing something a little bit harder in your, you know, normal sort of low to moderate intensity workout is beneficial. Right. Definitely. And I think, you know, with with the training, I think there are some people who would like to do. I want to just do the Norwegian 4x4 every week. It's easy. I know what to do. I'm kind of familiar with it. But I think to avoid not only avoid kind of like stagnation or maybe just getting bored of like the workout, but to stress your system in different ways. We just mentioned three protocols. Obviously, there's only only protocols. They're not necessarily the best, but just do different length of intervals every week. And I think that can be fun. You know, there's something that I try to do on my own training. So maybe somebody picks the 4x4. This week, you're going to do 4x4 and next week, you're doing 10x1 and next week, you do a Tabata. So then you have three different lengths. You know, you're doing the four minutes, which seem particularly good for improving like the O2 max. There's like two to four minute range for intervals. You're doing the 10x1 again, which is, you know, one minute long. And then you're doing the 20 seconds, which is your super kind of your sprint interval training as maybe the doctoric a ball of might refer to it. So mixing those things up. I think can not only be enjoyable, but then you're hitting really all these bodies, all the bodies like energetic systems, which can be fun as well. Yeah, for sure, mixing it up. That's something I do as well. Although I do have wonderful coaches that work with me and they're very great at mixing up my routine. And it's very nice. But if it's just me left in my own device, I usually get on my Peloton and I'll do it to Bata. And it's the same, almost the same exact class that I have been doing for years. But, you know, sometimes where this creature's a habit, you know, and it's easy to kind of go back to the thing that you know. So this, I think, is a good transition point. So we talked a lot about improving cardiovascular fitness and the benefits of that and the different types of training to help improve cardiovascular fitness based on a lot of what the experts have talked about. And the podcast and their research. I want to remind people that they can find all of that information along with a variety of protocols for improving cardiovascular fitness. In our how to train guide according to the experts and you can download that right now at how to train guide.com. We are going to move on to the next section, which is very interesting as well. And it's also related to cardiovascular health. But it really is an area that is kind of neglected in a way. And I would say in popular media with respect to cardiovascular health. And that is the youthful structure of the heart and maintaining that youthful structure of the heart, which is really important for its function. It's important for preventing cardiovascular disease. It's even important for performance being able to have a good aerobic capacity as you as you are getting older. So Dr. Ben Levine is really I would consider him one of the world's leading experts in this area. And it was just a great privilege having him on the podcast. I just learned a tremendous amount of information. You know, I didn't even really know much about how the structure of the heart changes with age and until I was diving into his research and had him on the podcast. He was talking about how as we age, our heart becomes stiffer at around early middle age. This is like around I guess it was it's more like 35 to 50 years of age. Crazy thing about that is being early middle age. Your heart starts to get stiffer. It's stiffness. And that affects cardiac compliance. It affects hypertension. And part of that reason that gets stiffer has to do with glucose regulation. And so when we're eating a variety of foods, particularly foods that are refined carbohydrates, refined sugars. And there's a elevation in our blood glucose levels that can be sustained for longer periods because perhaps there's a refined sugar or something that we're eating a lot. And maybe we're not exercising. That's the key. We're being said if we're sedentary. And that's where the glucose stays around in your bachelor's system. And it reacts with proteins, including collagen, which is lining our blood vessels that's lining it to our lining our myocardium, our paracardium, right? This is where our heart is. And that collagen when it reacts to glucose and the mailer reaction becomes it causes the protein, the collagen to become stiffer. And so that affects the stiffness of our our bachelor's system of our heart and all sort of blood vessels. And we start to get into late middle age. This would be like 50 to 65. In addition to our heart getting stiffer, our heart drinks. So it attributes. And so our heart is getting smaller and it's getting stiffer. And these sorts of structural changes are affecting our cardiovascular health and our cardiovascular performance, right? Dr. LeBena's done a whole lot of research. Lots of different studies trying to identify how much exercise, what exercises doing to the structure of the heart for one and how much exercise is really needed to help really stay off a lot of those changes. Those structural changes with age. And he had one. One of the studies that he had done early on, which were were done in master's athletes. They are physically active every single day. And they're competing at a national level in many cases. So they're they're doing a lot of cardiovascular and aerobic exercise. They're hearts structurally. So we're talking about seniors. So these are people that are older. Their hearts looked like healthy 30 year olds. So 30 year olds that don't have any identifiable diseases like cardiovascular disease or type of diabetes or hypertension. And so that's pretty profound when you're talking about, you know, a 50 60 year old person's structure, at least looking very similar to what a healthy 30 year old would look. But we're not all going to be endurance athletes and master's athletes throughout our lives. So the next question is, well, what is the exercise dose that's really needed to get you most of the way there to have your to maintain that youthful cardiovascular structure? And that's where some of Dr. Levine's follow-ups studies have looked at some of that research. Maybe you can talk a little bit about that. Yeah, I think some of this might be kind of maybe not surprising to a lot of people, but I think it based on, you know, everything he said it seems like the dose appears to be maybe a little bit more hot, a little bit higher than a lot of people think it might be. And one of the things I think too to add of, you know, when you were talking about the changes that occur kind of across the lifespan. I think craziest statistics that Dr. Levine said was that after the age of 70, it became nearly impossible to reverse the structure of the heart. It's indicating that, you know, you basically need to do everything that you can before that age to improve the structure of your heart. Because after that it takes a pretty, you know, unnotesustainable, maybe level of exercise to kind of reverse some of those structural changes, which I found very informative in related to, you know, how to train with age. In the study that he was citing during your interview, yeah, he mentioned, you know, they did study an observational study where people self reported their levels of physical activity kind of throughout their life. And they bucketed them into different days of activity. So this was a necessarily, uh, studying the dose in hours or minutes per week, but they looked at people exercising one to two days per week, two to three days per week, three to four days per week, four to five, and then five to six or more days per week. And this was kind of a lifetime of physical activity. So how long do you have you exercised how many days do you exercise per week for for how long? And then they compared these levels of exercise to people who were sedentary who basically didn't exercise at all. And so what they found was that the people who exercised one to two days per week pretty much has a heart with the same structure as sedentary adults. So one to two days per week provided zero protection, basically against heart aging. When you moved up to two to three and then three to four days per week, those groups had some protection compared to the sedentary adults for their heart structure. So structure of their hearts were a little bit better than people who were sedentary. Before to five group, that's kind of when you experienced a significant level of cardiovascular protection with age. And then the five to six day per week exercises had nearly complete protection. But they were similar to the master's athletes. And so what the conclusion from that stay was from Dr. Levine was four or five days of exercise appears to be the optimal dose across the lifespan to prevent cardiovascular aging. Now again, this study didn't provide a number on how many hours or minutes per week. You should exercise, but let's assume these people were exercising for 30 minutes, maybe an hour per day when they were doing it. That puts you in the sweet spot of like maybe five to six hours per week of exercise. But that four to five days appears to be important. And so maybe you don't even think about how much time the people were spending in that, you know, doing exercise. But just the frequency of exercise. Make sure you're doing, and when we say exercise here, we're referring to a roe-bick train. In addition to resist is training, which will obviously dive deep into later. But this is just a roe-bick exercise. And again, that could be walking, that could be something that activity that raises your heart rate. But doing four to five days per week of that seems to be optimal for preserving cardiovascular structure. And I think the takeaway from that was really probably with 150 minutes per week that is cited as well with the minimum recommendation. It might not be enough if the goal was to kind of maintain cardiovascular structure throughout life. This, I'll tell you, this study was a bit surprising to me because probably for that reason, where you think that the 150 minutes a week or even just three days a week of a roe-bick exercise, I think you're doing really good. And I absolutely increased my frequency of a roe-bick exercise after hearing about this because I mean, I was like, oh wow, I need to be doing more. I can do more. I should do more, and now I have evidence of why I need to do more, right? But I do, it was a bit surprising, where it's like, okay, if you do, if four to five days a week of a roe-bick exercise, and you're really, you're not quite at the master's athlete level in terms of your heart structure, but you're mostly there. And I do think four to five days a week is pretty sustainable for most people. It should, it should be. Yeah, it should be. And if it's not, you know, maybe you need to make it in your structure your life in such a way that it should be. You know, he had to, Ben, Dr. Levine had a great quote where he says, you know, exercise needs to be part of your personal hygiene. It's like rushing your teeth, you wake up, you know, it's not something that you think, oh, should I do this? It's, I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna do this because it's part of your personal hygiene. And so I think there's a lot of talk sometimes about, if we prescribe the recommendations for exercise too high, does that deter people from doing it? And maybe, but I mean, the reality is I think he presents compelling data that if we want to get serious about it and you're really serious about not aging cardiovascularly, like, you need to probably do more exercise. And so I think it's kind of a harsh reality, but just something for people to think about and how the structure they're training. It is a part of both of our professionals. I mean, when you wake up in the morning, what's the first thing you do? Do you, I mean, I'm not the first thing, but like, in terms of work versus exercise. Or is definitely exercise exercise? During coffee and exercise. Yeah, yeah. I just says the first thing I do, I mean, I brush my teeth and yeah, I eat a little bit, but, but I do before I work in most cases, I exercise. And that wasn't always the case for me. Even even dating back to when I was been, have been very interested in my health span and lifespan. It was like, okay, I'm working, you know, working out four days a week or no. Now it's, you know, six days. It is, it is every morning. And if I don't get to, if I take off an hour of what would be my work time, so be it because that's what's going to happen. I'm going to exercise. You just, you make the, you make the time for it. And I'm, you know, that has to be the case a lot. I think the paradox kind of is that a most people tend to exercise more when they're younger, which is kind of when you need less exercise. I think, as you get older, you probably need to do more exercise. And that's, I think, what the evidence that Dr. Levine presents would indicate to. But I also feel like as people get older, they might have a little bit more free time. Once you get into your 40s and 50s and 60s, you're reaching, you know, your kids are out of the house, you know, you're maybe still working a job. But once you get into retirement age, so maybe, you know, I think the way that maybe people think about exercising is that. Yeah, you want to do a lot in early life to kind of build up those reserves and you're muscle massing your early fitness and things like that. But you know, as you get older, think about exercising more as you maybe have more time to dedicate to it, because not only, you know, you need probably about a mountain in order to kind of maintain some of these changes. So it's again, I think a harsh, a harsh reality maybe. Well, let's talk a little bit about some of Dr. Levine's research on getting into that starting into that late middle age age 50. And this was a very. He calls it one of the most cited or looked viewed at, I guess viewed on the website in the journal circulation studies of all time and really so I think it's a preestowning study. It was a two year intervention trial where he took 50 year old him and his colleagues took 50 year olds that were otherwise healthy, but sedentary. I would argue that's not healthy if they're sedentary. It is as a disease, but they don't have any other identified diseases like cardiovascular disease or hypertension, for example. But they had been sedentary. And he put them on a two year exercise protocol, which maybe you can discuss in a minute, that was pretty intense. And they looked at the structure of their heart before starting this protocol and then two years after this exercise protocol, they looked at their hearts again and found that in many aspects like the cardiac compliance and a variety of different parameters that they looked at the size of the heart and the stiffness, right, the stretchiness of the heart. Many aspects had reversed in terms of their aging. In fact, it was comparable. Their hearts were comparable to looking more like 30 year olds. So they had essentially started this program and they had these 50 year old looking hearts and with respect to the size and the compliance. And then after this two year exercise protocol had reversed 20 years of cardiac aging, which is pretty astonishing and inspirational in many respects. So the protocol wasn't necessarily easy though. It wasn't at all. It wasn't easy. It was simple. And I think something that everybody can kind of work up to and use as kind of a framework for how to structure their training. So yeah, as you mentioned, this was a two year study, which again, like if anybody's familiar with exercise physiology research, like doing a two year exercise. During a two year exercise intervention is pretty incredible to get those participants to adhere to that regimen. I can't remember how many persistence were in that state right now, but I think it was somewhere around 200 maybe, but they had a pretty decent number of participants. But it involved the two year commitment and they didn't start them out right away doing everything that they were doing at the end, but they scaled up their exercise gradually throughout the two years. By year one, they were kind of reaching their peak exercise and then they maintained them for the second year. And so what this involved was eventually doing about five to six hours of aerobic exercise, or I guess it was total training for week was kind of five to six hours. And what that involved was one or more region for by four session. They actually at one point in the study just before the one year mark we're doing two Norwegian four by four interval training sessions per week. After the year they dropped it down to just one for the maintenance phase. So one Norwegian four by four interval training session per week. They did one session per week that was an hour or longer of their base pace, so we could refer to that as load of matter intensity exercise zone two training. But it was like a one hour longer base session and that could be just a bike around a walk, I like something like that. And then they did another 30 minute base pace session for week. So another zone two exercise training session per week. They also did a very light recovery day after all of their interval training sessions. So the day after their Norwegian four by four, they did a light active recovery day. And then they did two resistance training exercise sessions per week. So they were doing four aerobic training sessions, two resistance exercise training sessions for the protocol. And they scaled up to that. So this wasn't we're doing four by four or all at once, but they progressively added that for the first year by the end of the second year they were maintaining that. So they, you know, for two years did about five to six hours of exercise and like you mentioned they reverse their certain aspects of their cardiovascular structure by, you know, estimated 20 years, which is pretty astounding. And not an easy protocol, but certainly not something like a high level lead endurance athlete is doing. So it's something that everybody I think could do and these were people who were 50, 60 years old. Right, it's doable. And I'd be curious to know how many of those people continue to maintain that after the situation is over knowing they reverse their their heart aging and in some in terms of the structural aging of their heart by almost, you know, about 20 years. I feel like that would be very motivating for any 50 or 60 year old to go, wow, I should keep this up. This is like I want to, you know, I want to own it hard to stay like a 30 year old, right? I mean that yeah for me it would for sure. It would be cool to see a follow up study. It would also just be cool to see if they didn't say they didn't maintain that training. They just totally stopped how long goes benefit. It's kind of lasted. I think that would be interesting to and if I know Dr. Levine them have follow up studies on some of the exercise training, but it would be interesting to see for that one because I'm sure you may maintain some of those benefits for a few years, but the bed rest training study or just some of the studies on detraining, you see like kind of what you stop. It's a very steep slope down back to where you were. Right, especially with the fact that you're a car your restory fitness. Right. Yeah. Well, a lot of this research, so this intervention study, you know, we're talking about the master's athlete looking at identifying, you know, I called it the dose, but it really is in terms of frequency. How many days a week you have to work out to kind of help maintain that youthful carty extructure. Has led Dr. Levine to have what he calls his prescription for life with respect to exercise. He does add a little bit of resistance training into that prescription for life. Maybe we can talk a little bit about that and then talk about our own sort of our prescription for life like what our protocols are. He's prescription for life was honestly one of I think my favorite takeaways from that episode because it was something that I felt was reasonable for everybody. It's a lot more exercise than probably most people are doing, but not something that everyone couldn't work up to at some point. And so his prescription for life was very similar to kind of that two year training study that he cited. He cited this week's spot of four to five days per week of aerobic exercise or five to six hours per week of training. That seems to be kind of the sweet spot performing interval training once per week. And you know, while in that study they used the Norwegian 4x4, you know, you could do any type of intervals we just mentioned a few other protocols to 10 by one that to bought a but really just just do hide some type of high intensity interval training once per week. After every high intensity interval training session take a light recovery day, Levine definitely stress the importance of recovery not only just for from a muscular perspective and your, you know, your autonomic nervous system, but the cardiac and cardiovascular system also needs to recover. You know, when you stress it with a high heart rate, you do increase some markers that like cardiac damage and those also need time to recover. So if you're doing interval workout, the next day, you know, doing 30 or more, maybe minutes of very light activity. That's also kind of part of his prescription. His bit one hour or longer base pay session per week was definitely kind of a foundation of his prescription. And then the two or more resistance training session exercises per week, which you know, this is a very, very practical approach and I think most people could, you know, maybe you should just take this and paste it up on your wall and use that to guide your training every week. I think if those people did that, they would be certainly in a good place. Not only to, I think age better, but the way I see it, I mean, I look at Levine's prescription for life and it mirrors a lot of like what I do for my weekly training. I mean, the way I structure kind of. The way I structure kind of I training, I do, I have one long run for every single week. I do probably two easy zone two exercise sessions. I do one high intensity interval session and then I try strength training for a week. So I really follow Levine's prescription for life. I just kind of scale it up to me the volume that I'm in seeking for week. And so I'm sure you run it probably do something similar to that. Well, you're doing what's your total hours, would you? I would say on the tip of a week, I'm probably exercising like 14 to 16 hours. Most of its endurance. So I'll probably do 14 hours of endurance training and then, you know, getting in like one to two hours of strength training. I could probably view more towards the strength training, but again, you know, it's as you talked about really what I'm trying to optimize for at this point in my life. Yeah, well, I'm so I'm not clocking in quite as many hours. I'm doing more like six, six to six and a half hours a week, depending on on the week. So I end up doing more high intensity training and a little bit more. I would say that zone three is probably a big part of my training. So I do three days a week. I'm doing. It's sort of a combat is more like a cross at type of training where I'm doing combination of. I do strength well, two that days I do strength training for about 30 minutes each. So it's about an hour of strength training a week. And then I do some a little bit of a little bit of high perch training as well. And then followed by like a 15 minute high intensity interval training that includes some aerobic as well. So it'll be it'll be something like, I'll do like the rowing machine or the bike or jumping rope. And then I'll add in something like lighter weight squads or push ups or dips or lunges. And so it's like a combination of and that's for the remaining like 30 minutes. So that would be like an hour a week of that. And then I do another hour of something kind of similar but it includes a little bit more aerobic. So it's a combination of things as well where I'm also doing things as like lunges and I'm doing weights and I'm doing hypertrophy training. And not as much as strength training but then I'm combining it with a rowing machine. I'm doing assault bike. I'm doing a ski the skier or jumping rope. So so it's a very efficient way for me to get that strength training, my resistance training and also my some high intensity and we'll training in there. And in addition to that I'll do about an hour a week of I do some zone two into zone three runs probably more zone three ish where I'm not really talking. I mean, is very breathy of a talk right and then I'll do some sprinting towards the end end of that. And then one day a week so that's like this is all like that's twice a week I do that. And then on my lap on my sixth day which is typically a weekend I'll do hiking for like one and a half hours to two hour hike with my family and we're walking of course and it is hiking so we'll walk uphill but sometimes we do some sprints like and race each other and stuff in the middle of that but it's not like really super intense. I do consider it more of our recovery day because the walk is just very long and it's over an hour so it meets that box with what Dr. DeBeen said he should do something once a week that is at least an hour long he's in care what it is as long as it's fun and you enjoy it. I enjoy the hikes and you know he said you can even be walking and it can be a walk so that's kind of my my typical my weeks workout as well. I think what you said about enjoyment was kind of important to and something we sometimes don't talk about you know we're getting very technical about like how people should train but you have to find something he even stressed that that the hour long session you want to. It doesn't need to be a bike ride or a run it can be a hike it could be I think even said something like a dance you know if you go to a dance class and dancing for an hour or a few heart rate elevated you know that works maybe you're skiing so just something where you're doing. Cardiovascular type exercise for an hour or more because I think the key with his prescription was. It needs to be sustainable because that's literally the whole idea his prescription for life. You're this is something that you can do. Whether you're 30 years old or starting at 30 all the way up until you're 70 or 80 so I think that's important to have activities that you enjoy doing right for me also. Accountability is important so I do work with coaches of a really great coach that comes and works with me on my strength training and crossfit type of training. And then I go and work out with friends as well and there's again there's that fun group aspect going to a gym. Maybe it has classes I mean that's another way something that's going to keep you going back right so it does have to be sustainable. It has to be something that you enjoy. I don't necessarily enjoy strength training and we can talk a little bit more about this when we get into that that part I mean there's it's it's very hard and there's a lot of surprising aspects of it that I didn't quite expect after I really started engaging in that but. It helps to have have a coach or certainly even just going to a class right where where there is a coach it doesn't have to be a personal trainer. However, whatever it is that you have to side's best for you with with that said I would like to move on to some of the metabolic effects and adaptations that occur with aerobic exercise. So fundamental to metabolic health is mitochondrial health and mitochondria for most people who aren't aware of what these are they're a little tiny organelles that are inside of ourselves. Most of ourselves with the exception of red blood cells that are creating energy from the food that we eat carbohydrates fatty acids. They're very important for a variety of metabolic functions and everything from neurotransmitters synthesis brain function. To muscle function to cardiac function or mitochondria of the center everything. So you really want to do what you can to preserve and improve mitochondrial health. There's a lot of interest in improving mitochondrial health and what types of training protocols are best for improving mitochondrial health and when Dr Martin Cabala was on the podcast. I was asking him about high intensity and able training and how that compared to more of a zone to like continuous exercise type of training in terms of improving mitochondrial health. And he basically said that when the volume of exercise is kept the same that mitochondrial density so this is mitochondrial biogenesis which is the creation of a new mitochondria was actually better after high intensity interval training than more zone to load a moderate intensity type of training. So the volume of exercise was the same. Now again as we mentioned earlier, most of the time going to be doing a larger volume of exercise of a zone to type of training versus high intensity interval training. So it becomes a more time efficient way of getting some similar benefits, metabolic benefits and mitochondrial benefits as a zone to type of training would get. So with respect to mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial density also a process known as mitophogy. So this is the clearing away of damage to mitochondria as we age our mitochondria become damaged. We don't have a repair system for like we don't have a DNA repair system. We have DNA in our mitochondria, but we don't have the same types of repair systems as we do in our nuclear genome. So we have a mitochondria repair themselves through a variety of mechanisms. One of them is mitophogy where a portion of the mitochondria will be recycled or perhaps even the entire mitochondria if the entire mitochondria is damaged. It seems as though the more vigorous the exercise, the more intense the exercise, the increase the increase prevalence that you have of mitophogy happening. Again, it doesn't mean that zone 2 type of training isn't having that happen as well, but you probably just have a larger volume of that before you get there. So then there's this whole area of that burning and you would discuss this a little bit earlier and Dr. Gabala discuss this. Where what type of exercise is better for fat burning right well mitochondria are at the center of burning fat right so fatty acids are oxidized in the mitochondria. So you hear a lot about zone 2 training and how zone 2 training is really ideal for optimizing fat burning. Maybe you can talk a little bit about maybe recap a little bit about what Dr. Balvestang with respect to how high intensity interval training affects fat utilization and how that compares to perhaps a low to moderate intensity type of training like so and so training. I think there's no question that zone 2 training as we mentioned before during zone 2 training while you're actually exercising. Fat oxidation is maximize so you're burning more fat during zone 2 training. At least as a relative you know percentage of total contribution versus carbohydrates come here to like a higher intensity interval training. Well when you were talking with Dr. Marngabala and you asked him you know does the substrate that you are utilizing most during exercise kind of predict the adaptation in that and. His answer and what the literature would show is that fatty acid oxidation relies on you know you're mitochondrial content as well as your levels of this enzyme known as CPT or carnitine pulmothorl transferase which is the rate limiting enzyme forgetting fatty acids into the mitochondria where they can be oxidized to produce energy. So any exercise or you know the exercise that improves CPT enzyme levels and mitochondrial content the most is going to enhance your fat oxidation capacity the most. And the evidence is pretty clear based on what I've been reading in certain meta analyses that would show high intensity training compared to moderate or low intensity training. It increases mitochondrial content more it increases CPT enzyme levels and activity more so and it also leads to better fat oxidation capacity so even though you're not burning more fat during high intensity training. You're mitochondria are adapting in such a way to allow you to burn more fat or due to exercise training. So which is interesting and not to say that you don't need zone two but I think that it goes to show that. Maybe you know if your goal is to become a better fat burner that high intensity interval training might actually be you know when to volume matched just as good if not a little bit better than moderate intensity training. And it all comes back to the mitochondria hit is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and all of these mitochondrial enzymes as is known to but hit might be a little bit better if all you matched again. It's always key to kind of note that. Right it comes down to that adaptation right when you're when you're pushing beyond the capacity of your your your body's ability to bring nutrients and oxygen to the mitochondria to be oxidized for energy. And you start going into that you know zone three zone four where you're using glucose and producing lactate is a bioproduct there you're at up your your body is going oh I need to increase I need to increase my mitochondrial density so that I can start using my mitochondria raise an adaptation it's a response to that stressor. And I think the other thing that people often think about is always like this black and white thinking right there's this bin and that bin as to use lane or indoctralline norton's analogy. Where people think if you're doing high intensity and you know we're training you're just your just burning glucose and and producing lactate and that's just not the case in fact the majority of the time. Even when you're doing a high intensity and we're training workout you're doing both right you're not just burning I mean unless someone's doing like an all out wing gate which I don't know many people that have done that I certainly have been ever done one. But you're not really going to be just only burning glucose right there's there's a gray area so you're also still using your mitochondria to some degree as well. Totally yeah I think we yeah sometimes especially going back to when we were talking about zones people talk about zones as if they're these very neat buckets well on the zone two now and then over get a little bit harder right like flip across this threshold and zone two and then in zone three but it's more of a spectrum versus a. Black and white jumping into these different buckets of zones or what we're using as a fuel source during exercise yet's definitely more like a spectrum than a threshold that you crossing your using one of the other. Why do people's why why why is there a. You can see it circulating around on on social media and the blogosphere podcasts. If you're if you're doing zone two training you're going to be a better fat burner like I'm doing you asked someone why I'm doing so I'm doing zone two training because I want to be a better quote unquote fat burner. What does that even mean is that even true. And I've also seen studies where it seems as though doing more high intensity interval training more vigorous exercise people end up burning more fat. After the exercise you know if they're doing that type of exercise versus low to moderate intensity training. I think for yeah for something like weight loss or body composition you know if. I think diet is probably the biggest leverage can pull for that and people say oh exercise is not great for weight loss, but you know there's a contribution of exercise to weight loss and. Your high intensity training yeah there does seem to be you know you're burning a lot of fat during exercise there's this quote unquote after burn effect that I know Dr Martin Gavala talked about where you know maybe. Several hours after exercise you kind of have this higher cool work burn to this higher fat burn so. If you're interested in you know improving body composition you know you kind of want to be you got a better fat burner and burn more fat during exercise to help you improve your body composition. You know what it means to become a better fat burner is is kind of nuanced and maybe not as understood but I think this idea one is of metabolic flexibility and so people may have heard this term before but it essentially refers to the fact that. Let's say you're in between meals or you're fasting overnight and you wake up in the morning like mental flexibility just reflects your ability to. You know when glucose is low or glycogen stores a low kind of switch over to using fatty acids or oxidizing fat for energy so you can use both fuel sources kind of interchangeably and use them well because you have like the cellular and metabolic machinery to do that. But what it also means from a kind of performance and athletic perspective is that you're able to use fat as a fuel source at an increasingly higher intensity so. Most people maybe aware that once you start exercising more at a higher and higher intensity you use more carbohydrate or more glucose as energy source compared to fat so. If you read like a classic exercise physiology textbook there's always this graph where exercise intensity is on the x axis and you go from zero which is resting to a hundred maximal intensity exercise and then the y axis is another zero to a hundred percent and that's your contribution of glucose and fat to your energy and so at rest you're using almost a hundred percent maybe fat and as you increase your exercise intensity. Fat oxidation goes down carbohydrate and oxidation goes up and then kind of in the middle somewhere about sixty seventy percent of your maximum heart rate that's where you know getting fifty percent contribution from carbohydrate. Fifty percent from fat and so essentially if you are a better fat burner those are shifted a little bit so the slope of those lines is kind of reduced whereas. You know maybe before your max fat oxidation occurred at sixty percent of your maximal exercise intensity. Well now if I become a better fat burner when I'm at eighty percent of my maximal exercise intensity that's where my maximal fat oxidation occurs. So you're using more fat at a higher exercise intensity that is kind of from a performance or an athletic exercise perspective what it means to become a better fat burner. And you can do that by doing fasted exercise you can do it by doing so and so doing high intensity interval training increasing your mitochondria. You know eating a keto diet is like the famous study where they looked at people who are literally eating a. Keto-genic diet and their max fat oxidation was at 85 percent of their exercise intensity which is kind of high. So that's essentially what it means what are the benefits I mean being a quote unquote glucose burner or a carb burner. You know when you use carb hydroid to kind of produce reactive oxygen species and maybe you know that may be helpful for limiting those kind of byproducts. For performance you know it can help you not have to fuel as much during exercise you know if you're body can use that you don't necessarily have to keep replenishing and keep your blood glucose high using. Exogenous kind of like drinks or gels or something like that that's kind of from an athletic or performance perspective. I think those are some of the main benefits and you know not everybody's goal is to become a better fat burner but there's need to be benefits both for health and longevity to doing so. Medabolic flexibility I mean there's definitely one cavity of benefits for that and to get that metabolic flexibility it sounds like you know. You don't necessarily have to be just as dumb to trainer like you can do. You're increasing your mitochondrial density there's a lot of different ways to get there in terms of aerobic exercise that doesn't have to necessarily just be zone two which is where. Some of that like you hear some people and they think I think there's a misconception where it's like oh I have to be. In the zone two where I'm only burning fatty acids and not shifting into that more intense zone where I'm burning glucose as well in order for me to become a fat burner and I don't know that that's necessarily the case. No I don't think so and you know like we just said because if you get better and healthier and you know more efficient mitochondria you're going to become a better fat burner and there are multiple ways to improve the health of your mitochondria. Right. Just zone two exercise right well shifting gears and talking a little bit about glucose regulation I mean this is also a very important area for. Cardi bachelor health I mentioned that glucose dysregulation if you're constantly having elevations in blood glucose levels. That can lead to the stifoning of your myocardium of your pericardium right these these have collagen and them and they react with glucose and that leads to a lower cardiac compliance essentially your heart is less stretchy. You want to have you want to maintain and improve your your glucose regulation throughout your life it's very important this is where my conversation with Dr. Martin Kvala was really. I think shed some light into the benefits of high intensity interval training on glucose regulation now there's no doubt that aerobic exercise improves glucose regulation like full stop like you're going to have improved glucose regulation if you are engaging in a rocic exercise. But if you're again comparing the volume of actually is being the same and comparing sort of a continuous lower to moderate intensity exercise with high intensity interval training or more vigorous type of exercise. There's you're going to have more improvements in glucose regulation with the higher intensity exercise and that someone has to do with the utilization of glucose which produces lactate as a byproduct it's not necessarily a byproduct we know it's not a byproduct and you're more it's an active metabolism. Active metabolite that is not only an energy source for mitochondria it's also a signaling molecule so in other words it's a way for your muscles to communicate with your muscles and porch proteins in your muscles. It's also a way for your muscles to communicate with other organs like the brain and the heart and the liver and your kidneys and so that lactate actually is a signaling molecule to the muscle cells and glucose transporters in the muscle. Then come up there it's called translocation they come up to the self surface of the muscle and they're open and primed and ready to take in a lot of glucose and lactates really key in that process. So if you're producing lactate by having a more intense workout you're going to have more gluten for transporters that are. Translocating up to the muscle cell surface where they're ready to take in the glucose so high intensity able training is definitely a good way to improve glucose regulation. But the lactate isn't the only reason for that right yeah so you know lactate obviously pretty important in that mechanism that you just reference but also contraction and then of itself is just so interesting in that. It also causes this glue forward transporters to translocate to the cell membrane where they can suck up more glucose into the muscle and so what high intensity interval training does that makes it more potent for doing that is it engages a larger amount of muscle mass. So you mentioned it increases our utilization of glucose in the skeletal muscle so what kind of increases the sensitivity of the muscle to take up glucose because you're utilizing it larger amount of muscle mass larger amount of glucose transporters and more glucose taken up into the cell. So essentially you know that's another reason I think why high intensity training and resistance training to like we'll talk about later but are great for glucose regulation maybe much more so particularly compared to zone two training. You're talking about engaging the the the muscles um there's a study that was published. Oh gosh not a few months ago I mean it wasn't it is less than a year ago that it compared doing 10 body weight squats to 30 minutes so the 10 body weight squats over the span of in eight hour work day basically so you're doing it every 45 minutes so every 45 minutes just you do 10 body weight squats over eight hours and now is compared to a 30 minute continuous walk. And the body weight squats were more potent at improving glucose clearance than the continuous walk again probably because lactase being produced and you're engaging like you're talking about the muscles are being engaged more robustly than perhaps a walk would do. But also Dr. Dvala talked about walking and continuous walking versus interval walking as well. Yeah, and I think that the study that he was citing shows that just intensity matters but also kind of just interval kind of the interval pattern could be interesting for like a regularly and glucose. So yeah, he mentioned the study where they basically just did two groups of walking where one walked at the continuous intensity of 65% and the other group alternated intensities of 75% and 60%. So not even high intensity interval training they just did interval walking is what he called it and they experienced much better improvements in it was 24 hour 24 hour glucose regulation and cardiometabolic risk factors. I think in things like waste or conference there be a my as well as like their HP and once he all those things improve better with interval walking compared to just moderate intensity walking. Even when they didn't do really high intensity so there seems to be maybe something unique about you know the study that you mentioned breaking up the activity throughout the day and then doing oscillating intervals even if it's just walking for glucose regulation. So something to think about for people if glucose regulation is one of their goals. Right, I like to do that again like I mentioned with my hikes you know will stop and we'll do some intervals and friends and. Of course, like throughout the day it's nice what we'll talk a little bit about exercise snacks, but that's another way to kind of break up the the sedentary part of your day. I want to shift gears and talk a little bit about I'll just talk briefly about brain health. Training for brain health we cover a little bit of this in this guide as well and Dr. Gabal and I talk a little bit about this is well in fact you just sent me a systematic analysis yesterday. I think that it that came out on high intensity interval training and and how it improves brain drive neurotrophic factor. So brain drive neurotrophic factor is a growth factor it's a neurotrophic factor it's produced in the body in the muscle that also on the brain. It plays a very important role for it helps the growth of neurons in certain parts of the brain like the substantiate negras for example the hippocampus and. It helps with the connections between neurons so that your synapses and your connections and your long term potential things that are forming long term memory or more solidified. So it's a neuroplasticity the ability of your brain to sort of adapt to the changing environment and a variety of other things that's doing your brain that's that's hugely beneficial for brain aging for cognition. So you really want to increase brain drive neurotrophic factor in the brain there's been a variety of exercise protocols high intensity exercise protocols visit vigorous exercise it seems as though the more vigorous the intensity the exercise. More robust the brain drive neurotrophic factor affect and again this comes down to lactate as well as other mechanisms lactates one mechanism because lactate has been shown to cross over to the blood brain barrier in the brain activate brain drive neurotrophic factor so it's it's one of the ways your muscle communicates with the brain until the brain you know you're stress in your muscles you're also stressing your your brain at the same time and so it's a way it's a response and adaptation. So the way your body is is adapting and going okay I need to make sure I can handle this stress let's make more brain drive neurotrophic factor so that I can handle that stress even the 10 minute you know high intensity interval training workout has been shown to improve cognition I often like to do. 10 minute to bought a before I do something that I need to be sharp I focused on like a podcast for example because it's a 10 minute workout I mean you have 10 minutes and you can do it and I often feel really good after that so. We do we do cover some of that in the training guide as well I think I think that the bottom line with with protocols to improve brain drive brain drive neurotrophic factor. Is intensity and also volume so you know even if you're doing if you're doing a 20 minute workout and you want to be at least like 80% your max heart rate for this 20 minutes more like a zone three ish kind of workout right. I think I think a lot of people will probably just know that to be true anecdotally I certainly know that if I do a longer low to moderate intensity exercise like 60 to 90 minutes. I feel good afterwards you know my mind feels clear but it's nothing like when I do high intensity interval session where you sometimes feel like your brain is just like on fire so I think a lot of people have the same experience where. Just low kind of steady state exercise yet feels good but it really doesn't provide I think the cognitive improvement benefits acutely that's. I know that's something you talk about a ton and just how you structure your own hip protocols to really correspond with your. Either your cognitive work that you're doing because you really do you just feel clear you feel sharp after you feel energized so really do think there's like nothing I can't. To improve brain health and obviously long term brain health through exercise training but just to use it acutely as well just as like this kind of stimulant almost. I deliberately structure those short ten minute hit workouts around times like this like a podcast I'm going to do or presentation I'm going to give and I'm in a hotel and it's like I got to do my ten minute high intensity workout often go to the gym and get on the the bike and do do something. Kind of as a good I think this is a good segue into these sort of exercise snacks and some people would consider a ten minute workout even on the longer end of an exercise snack. So exercise snacks are they can be structured or unstructured and I talked about this with Dr Martin Gabala a lot he's been involved in a lot of studies involving the unstructured type of exercise snacks but the structure type of exercise snack is something where you're getting your heart rate really high at least 80% of your max heart rate right. You're getting more into that in that vigorous intensity zone and it could be anywhere from one minute to nine minutes perhaps ten minutes where you're you're doing intervals right if you're doing a ten minutes not like the entire ten minutes you're in that but you're you're doing intervals. But if you're doing a one minute or two minute or three minute workout then you can you can you can be in a pretty high high 85% max heart rate zone right. So some examples would be something like body weight squats or you do high knees or burpees or jumping jacks for some people lunges right something where you're you're engaging multiple muscle groups and you're also just getting your heart rate up as well. So those would be the structure types of exercise snacks. There's also the unstructured type where people just throughout their their daily activities that they're doing will engage in an exercise snack. So these are called vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity or villa and this is typically someone who let's say their offices on the third or fourth floor of the building. And they sprint is you know the sprint up this year they go fast up the stairs maybe not technically sprint because a coach would be like no way and you're right you know way but but they're going fast enough not just walking they're they're going fast their heart rates getting up and they do that multiple times a day. Or they walk and instead of just walking they're really briskly walking they're going really fast right and there's other examples of this sort of unstructured type of you know house cleaning some times right people are like going around back in being in their kind of fast like you know I've seen that being the case as well. So there's a lot of tests of unstructured exercise that can be done and there's a variety of benefits that are associated with this sort of these exercise snacks and if you with Dr. Gabala. When he came on the podcast he was talking a lot about these villa studies where. Researchers give people that are engaging in this type of unstructured exercise and accelerometer so this is measuring their their heart rate and they're able to see their heart rate and also like I guess the distance as well but it's also measuring the heart rate and they're seeing how high their heart rate goes and then they've looked at. A variety of outcomes all cause mortality cardiovascular related mortality cancer related mortality and what these publications which Dr. Gabala has been a part of have shown is that. People that are engaging in this type of villpa exercise this unstructured exercise for. One to two minutes three times a day so you're getting up to the nine minute a day range. They have a 50% reduction in all cause mortality cardiovascular related mortality and a 40% reduction in cancer related mortality and these are even these are benefits that are even found in people that identify as non exerciseer. So in other words they don't consider themselves they don't go to the gym they're not doing tennis or dance class or whatever they they consider themselves like not doing physical activity. So I think that that that day that really kind of drives home that even these small sort of burst of physical activity can be beneficial for health. Then there's also a lot of psychological benefits that Dr. Gabala talked about as well. With the exercise snacks it obviously I think that psychologically you know knowing that you have to just exercise for one to two minutes at a time it feels easier and so one of their I think goals with these exercise snacks and doing these actual studies was. One of the barriers to exercise for some people is all I have to exercise for 30 to 40 minutes at a time I don't really want to. To do that now people should probably learn to do that but you know for people who may not comply with that it feels psychological easier than long workout and they don't really require any special equipment. If you're doing them throughout the day where you're working at a job you don't even have to change your clothes and so it just removes that psychological barrier that I have to get dressed and go to the gym and exercise for 30 minutes at a time. With exercise snacks you're doing it for one to five minutes and then it's over and you just do it a few times per day. So psychologically they feel easier these consistent small efforts also appear to enhance adherence and so when they conduct these studies they find that adherence is pretty high as compared to maybe some of the exercise training studies where. People don't necessarily do all the exercise that they're prescribed especially if it's supposed to be at home and it's you know it doesn't require them coming into the lab. So those are kind of two of the psychological benefits and I think there's can be leveraged by again maybe non exercises but also people who exercise. But there are a lot of physiological benefits to the exercise snacks as well. I mean there are multiple studies by doctor Gamal in calling showing people improve their view to max just by doing these exercise snacks. Four to five times per day for a few times per week. They can improve cardiovascular metabolic health so they can improve their blood pressure reduce their fasting blood glucose improve their HPA1C. So measures the body composition glucose regulation all of these can improve with exercise snacks which is profound. I think one thing to note I think is that these people were previously untrained so I don't think you could take somebody who's exercising at a level of maybe what you and I are doing right and do exercise snacks and you're going to see. Huge health benefits especially like VO2 max but I certainly think that they can be additive so if you are exercising and you add these exercise snacks you can receive additional health benefits but you might not see a you know 50% improving your view to max by doing exercise snacks. But studies have shown that and so I think they can be very potent and doing that as well. In showing that it doesn't require a large time investment just to see a fitness improvement. And then I think one of the other benefits is that they break up sedentary time throughout the day. So we know that being sedentary sitting for say 30 to 60 minutes or longer or maybe 3 hours at a time is not good for cardiovascular metabolic health. So breaking up your sedentary time as much as possible is good and so physically psychologically just put the cognitive benefits to using these exercise snacks intermittently throughout the day can improve physical health. By reducing sedentary time and keeping more focus by reducing your kind of the cognitive maybe slump that you get after you sit for 3 hours or so at a time. It also helps with the mid day slumpiness like where you're feeling kind of sleepy and I cannot drink caffeine afternoon like for me it affects me and I'll be up to late in the evening. So I will get up and do some body weight squats usually it's body weight squats sometimes I'll do some push ups or something but something that just gets my heart right up and blood flowing and what do you know I feel better right I'm ready I'm more focused ready to get back to work as well. And the other thing that's really good with the exercise snacks is to time them around meals and there's also been some evidence on this published looking mostly people with metabolic dysfunction like type of ABD. Metabolic syndrome and how even doing something timed around a meal and it doesn't have to be long it can be a short again you're doing you're doing some body weight squats or burpees or jumping jacks whatever it improves glucose regulation right and so it's something that you can I typically will do it if I'm. I'm going out to dinner certainly when I'm on vacation and I don't eat the way I usually eat and my my usual discipline type of diet where I'll say okay we're in Italy and we're having gelato guess what I'm like next the gelato station and I'm doing body weight so I mean it's something that can be used as a tool for. Like you that you mentioned improving cardiovascular metabolic health and also timing it around times when maybe you're cheating a little bit more as well sure and also you know can be used to kind of if you feel like you don't have enough time with your main training sessions during the week to kind of meet that minimum recommended levels of physical activity. I think to exercise snacks again can be additive so it can be used to kind of bring your total exercise volume during the week up to meet those activity levels or sneak in maybe extra exercise if you don't find you have the timer miss a training session or maybe there's a day where you just don't have the time to dedicate to an actual training session on the new exercise next today and that could be a suitable alternative very good point yeah and also that psychologically feels good right like I'm checking that box right. I do exercise snacks during the day even though I'm training a lot just again mostly like for the psychological benefits it's all do like some kettlebell swings and push up simple ups you know they might help me build a little bit of strength but. Definitely get that cognitive boost. All right so I think that wraps up our. section on aerobic exercise training we really covered a lot of ground here this is all covered in our how to train according to the experts guide. Along with a variety of protocols more detailed information again you can find that at how to train guide dot com we're going to move on to resistance training this is another. area. Very important for longevity and also an area that I've actually focused a lot more on in the last year. I you know it really happened after I started having experts in this this field of muscle protein synthesis muscle muscular health. professors like doctors to it the love doctor Brad shown field even experts like doctor Ling Norton as well having them on the podcast and just hearing about all the important. aspects of maintaining strength maintaining mass with age. really was eye opening for me and so I became. I dedicated a lot more effort and time into resistance training over the last year. Really some of the statistics that doctor Stewart had. Called out on the podcast for kind of scary you know first of all he was he mentioned that your peak muscle mass occurs. between the age of 20 and 30 for me was quite a while ago I mean you're you're reaching that point but that's that's your peak and then after that peak about you start to decline on average. About 8% per decade so this age related to climb in muscle mass is often referred to as sarcopenia and there's a lot of. elements that can contribute to that which I will not get into but so 8% per decade and then as you reach the age of 70 that goes up to 15% per decade and then strength actually declines even quicker than muscle mass. So strength declines annually for men about three to four percent per year and then for women it's about 2.5 to 3% your strength decreases per year on average. Now if you're engaging in resistance training strength training then you're. skewing that right in a positive way you're not going to be declining as much and that's that's kind of the goal one of the goals of resistance training but it's also very important for maintaining. functional independence so your muscle mass your muscle strength these are very important for as you're aging to have functional independence to make sure you're lowering your risk of a fracture. fall that that's also very important as well as when you're doing the resistance training a lot of the exercises that are engaging. You know multiple muscle groups are also improving bone density as well right and that's another aspect that's very beneficial with respect to resistance training. But there's also another part of the equation that's muscle power muscle power yeah we recently covered this one of our newsletters but researchers have kind of proposed this new term called power. Pina as like a nod to sarcopina so power Pina being the age-related loss of muscle power and so muscle power as opposed to muscle strength and muscle mass is you know your ability to generate force quickly so standing up out of a chair or you know lifting something heavy with a high velocity that's this is all kind of examples of muscle power and why that's important is because you know like strength obviously but. It's important for predicting your functional independence and essential for activities of daily living essentially you know especially as you get older and so one of the ways to measure it is using just like a simple sit to stand test on a chair but like how quickly can you do that so how quickly can you sit down and rise from a chair. We even we in the study that we covered that's how the assessed muscle power and showed that it was correlated with actually longevity which is pretty interesting so what's unique about muscle power is that it seems to decline. Earlier start to clang earlier and then as it clines more rapidly than muscle mass or muscle strength so obviously you know how much muscle you have in your strength. All of these things are kind of interrelated but muscle power seems to be a more a more sensitive indicator and maybe a more robust indicator of. Functional outcomes with age and so muscle power is just as important you can obviously train for it as we'll talk about how to train for hypertrophy and strength. Similar you know with resistance training you need to resist this train to improve muscle power but yeah this is another idea that hasn't been as necessarily well cited as the declines and muscle mass and strength but it might actually decline to a greater degree than either. Yeah it's not something that's talked about as much either right so yeah we're going to cover a lot of aspects of resistance training. Including training for strength and hypertrophy body composition as well but I want to start with with when I had Dr. Lane Norton on the podcast he had some really good general principles that people can follow. For resistance training most people can follow these general principles and I thought they were really. They were just really it was really good information that was just I think accessible and applicable for a lot of people. I did too and it's because they were you know very non-technical kind of just advice on how to think about training in general we're applying the service resistance training but can it be applied to you know any types of training so. He mentioned the first one was consistency the most effective training regimen is the one that you're going to follow if you have a coach who prescribes the training regimen to you. That is too hard or that leads to injure that you don't enjoy. You know you're not going to be consistent and executing it and you need consistency in order to see long-term progress so his first one was consistency that's obviously important. Progressive overload is the second one. This is kind of a fundamental aspect of all exercise training and what progressive overload just means is increasing your dose your load your volume your intensity however you want to define it. Of exercise over time so with resistance training week after week, month after month, year after year you want to continually stress your muscle by lifting heavier weight in order to cause that muscle to grow either stronger or bigger or both however you want to do that. So progressive overload a key aspect of thinking about resistance training. The third one is going to be recovery sometimes a cliche but you actually get stronger when you aren't exercising not when you are so you need to do the training but you also need to allow your body. To recover and so laying stress the importance of recovery. That includes you know both just decreasing your training or doing light intensity training or no training at all doing some light active recovery versus just laying on the couch all day. That's not necessarily the ideal for way to recover and then you know focusing on sleep focusing on eating. focusing on your protein intake but obviously just eating enough to sustain your training and to rebuild the muscle so it can get stronger. And then the final one was mindset and execution. Focus on execution rather than being perfect. I mean you know we in this world of health and fitness dare I say biohacking. But like to focus on the very specifics of things like gotta get the sets perfectly right or the weight perfectly right. Obviously those can be important but what the main thing is is executing it week after week doing the training and not focusing on. You are at the perfect heart rate or the perfect lactate level or lifting you know this perfect amount of way down to the point one kilogram. Just execute week after week and that will lead to consistent gains. So yeah again I think all of the principles that laying provided when you know you're talking to them during your interview were great and everybody should just keep those you know in the back of their minds when they're thinking about training in addition to you know structuring their training which we will talk about how to do spares in. Yeah it's for me you know I like I mentioned I've really engaged on this journey in the last year of really be being committed to my resistance training and all of these principles that that laying discussed I am following. So the consistency for me really involved having a coach and a group of friends that I work out with as well we do resistance training together and both of those for me. Help tremendously with consistency now. Other people might be different some people I mean I think generally speaking accountability does help with consistent consistency so having a coach or a class you go to or some friends that you work out with. Retainingly like you have this this day per week you guys are doing this workout together really helps with the with consistency. Progressive the progressive overload so working with a coach this is obvious probably why I'm I mean able to buy learned right how important so how important it was. Where it's like I don't just. Right out the bat go and like I'm doing a bad school back squat with 80 pounds I'm working my way up there and in many cases you can consider that like a warm up but you know I start with just bodyweight squats and then I just do the bar. And then we progressively load the way right and so that's also a really important aspect as well as recovery and we're going to talk a little about recovery even between stats and also recovery days. What's interesting is now I've been doing so much of the strength training resistance training that my recovery days are my zone two runs which I never would have thought of as recovery days back when I was only just doing running or running in my peloton. But but it's kind of funny. It has sometimes you you call that our recovery but it really you know you're engaging in exercise you're just letting. You're not it's not so hard on your muscles right. I also also find that doing doing runs seems to help with the soreness big time. It definitely does you know increasing that blood flow so I think it's you know you basically are doing a form of like active recovery and that's why I think if you do a strength training and you. You know or hard run even in lay-round of the couch all day the next day you just feel so or you feel stiff you don't feel good. So yeah, I think there's only two training sessions are kind of having a dual benefit there. Increasing your fitness, but then they're also providing some good recovery for from your resistance. From your resistance training session right. And then mindset another one that's a that's a big one and for me. Sometimes I just do it like especially when I'm doing strength training when I if I know what how heavy I got. You know like what was my what was my one rep max so the max amount of weight that I could live for just one rep. What did I get to last time or what was my reps and reserve like what was that what was I for that I don't think about those things. I'm just I'm just doing it and it really helps to not be a perfectionist because that can get that can really get in your mind and kind of stress you out. Yeah, I think the stress and that's another thing when I am under a lot of stress. I kind of just do something a little bit lighter, you know not not quite as intense. I think it can be counterproductive to train if you're overly psychological, psychologically stressed. I mean, when you were talking with Lane, I think you talked about, you know, there are several studies showing like psychological stress that increases your injury risk. Your training sessions going to not going to be compromised. I mean, I know exercise, you know, for myself and many other people can be stressed relieving. But if there's something majorly stressful and it's going to either compromise your training or increase your injury risk, then you should probably just maybe take a recovery day or take an easy day if you had something. More intense planned. So yeah, my insight is definitely important in structuring your training. I think it becomes more important when you're lifting heavy like for strength training. So let's talk about strength training. We're training for talking about strength and even bone density bone mass as well because there's a lot of overlap there. And Dr. Brad shown, felt came on the podcast and really did, was so knowledgeable in this area and talked quite a bit about strength training and how to like the best types of exercises for strength training. And I think one of the take-homes here was the multi joint exercises. These are the compound type of exercises. They're engaging multiple muscle groups and joints simultaneously. Really are the best type of exercise for improving strength and ultimately they're more time efficient as well. So these are exercises like squats or deadlips or lunges, rows of any type of variation presses overhead presses. All the variety of types of presses that you can do. These are the multi joint compound types of exercises. They're essentially improving function. It's functional training. It's also again going to improve bone density more because you're putting more force and you're putting more of the force and stressing your your your bones more with those types of exercises. And that causes the adaptation of bone remodeling. So you're going to have improvements in bone mineral density and bone mass as well. So a lot of the overlap between those multi joint exercises. When it comes to strength itself, so I guess I should contrast that to the single joint exercises which are more like bicep curls, tricep kickbacks. What are some other ones? Some single joint exercises. I think yeah bicep curls, tricep extensions, leg extension. That's all those, yeah all those things. Anything where you're just doing a single joint kind of explains itself. Well when you're so strength training in general is mostly where you're lifting heavier and doing the lower volume. Right? So I think Dr. Showanfeld mentioned when you're doing strength training, you're going to get up to about an 85 percent or more of your one rep max, which is again is the maximum amount of weight you can lift for one rep. And that's strength training. And so oftentimes you are going to do fewer reps than you would if you were not strength training and you're going to require a longer recovery. So Dr. Showanfeld mentioned between two to five minutes, depending on the weight that you're lifting, depending on how you feel. So I know for me personally with my strength training, yesterday I was doing strength training with backs, I did backsquads and I got up, I got up to 85 percent of my one rep max. So that's where I ended at that weight. Sometimes I go to an actual where I just do one rep, but I was doing 85 percent of my one rep max and I did five reps. And I would rest about three minutes between that. Typically I rest between two to three minutes between between my sets. And every person sort of different and fuel lifting heavier, you're going to require more rest and it's really important. And I've learned this where my cardio respiratory system feels ready to go pretty quickly after I finished my set. And I have to weigh and go away to minute. If I start to engage again, I'm not going to get the five in because my muscles haven't had enough pattern to recover. You Dr. Showanfeld, I think that was one of the main things he stressed with strength training was there might be that temptation to rest maybe one to two minutes or really cut the rest interval just to get to the next set. Because it does make the exercise quote unquote harder because you're reducing your rest period. And like you said, if you're in a decent, you know, you have a decent level of aerobic fitness, I think that your heart rate will come down quickly after performing that exercise. So maybe you know psychologically cardiovascularly, you might feel like, oh, I'm ready to do the next set. But your diet literally needs time to replenish the fossil creatine stores in order to produce the ATP to do that next set. Your nervous system needs time to rest. And so that's why you know, Dr. Showanfeld recommended rest up to anywhere from two to five minutes again, based on how much weight you're lifting. You know, if you're doing failure on each set, you might need to do longer. If you're doing one to three reps in a research, might need to take a little bit shorter rest. But two to three minutes is probably the minimum and you were up to five and you really emphasized, just don't rush the rest period, especially when training for strength because your goal on each of those sets is to lift the maximum amount of weight that you can. You don't want to, it's not just about fatiguing the muscle. It's, you know, you have to be ready to, you know, if you lift 95% of your one-ret max on, you know, this set, you want to be able to do that then exit. You need adequate recovery to be able to do that, particularly if your goal is to improve strength or even muscle power as well, can be similar. Right. You mentioned the central nervous system and that rusting being important to for that your central nervous system to recover. And I'll say that for me, it's been one of the most surprising aspects of strength training in particular is how stressful it is on my central nervous system. Lifting heavy is scary to me. And I don't know, I mean, I'm sure as I become stronger, it won't be as scary because I'm more experienced. Now, I've been doing strength training now for, I would say, 11 months. So I started last February. So almost a year. And of course, I've been making my progressively getting to where I am now. But it's hard mentally on me. And I find that it's physically hard, too, for sure. But I find that, I mean, just that moment before I'm about to lift, like do a clean or, you know, squat down or deadlift or whatever it is, I'm anxious, you know, and it's very stressful for me. In fact, one of the very surprising benefits to strength training for me was the effect on my ability to handle stress throughout the day. Because I do exercise, you know, it's pretty much what I do before I, I eat and, you know, take care of my family and stuff. But then I exercise. I'm doing my strength training before I work. And I have found that doing the hardest thing for me mentally in the day, first thing in the morning, makes everything else a lot easier. And I was very surprising for me because, you know, I do a lot of stuff that's hard. And, um, boy, but again, that barbell and, and do in that clean or, you know, lifting that that really heavy weight, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's important again to let your central nervous system rest as well. And that is also going back to what we were talking about with, um, Lane, not be, you, if you're, if you're under a very stressed state, it's probably not the time to, to try to do your, your personal PR on lifting weights. So he meant, he and mentioned that. He says, you know, if he's has something planned for the day where he's trying to go like really maximal, like either lift a failure or set like a PR in the squat or deadlift or something and he's like stressed and he won't do it because yeah, you have to be, not only is going to raise your injury risk, but, you know, you're probably not going to be able to perform that activity because your nervous system just isn't in the state that's primed to do that. I know Lane has like posted videos and help those videos on social media where he's preparing for a lift and you see I'll psychologically amped up that he gets before doing that and like that's what you got to do because part of it, yeah, you need to be strong to lift the weight, but it's like your nervous system is contributing a lot to lifting the weight during training and trying to set like a PR attempt. So it's one of the aspects I think that of training that kind of goes, it's less talked about, but it's certainly important. I think I need to get some more loud, amping music on when I'm straight training because I don't have any on well I'm doing my strength and I'm wondering if that'll help me a little bit with being a little more mentally prepared for it. It might, or maybe some of those, the smelling salts that the lifters you. So talking about failure, that's another area that both Dr. Show and Falad and Dr. Ling Norton have discussed on the podcast in terms of, do you have to go to failure to improve your muscle strength or even mass? For a lot of, I would say a long time, a lot of people thought that going to failure was really the ultimate necessary thing to really get those gains in strength. And in fact, it seems as though at least according to a lot of the published research that have come out, Dr. Show and Falad talked about, that it's actually not necessarily, it's not necessary and also may even potentially be problematic in some cases, particularly if you're doing like a multi-joint type of exercise because you can increase your injury risk and also, as you mentioned, like, if you're going to failure, then you kind of like, if you're going to do, you can't really do another next set without, like, you're going to affect your performance. So, what were some other things that Dr. Noron and Dr. Rocheau and Falad mentioned with perspective that you're? If you're yet trained to failure, it doesn't appear to be necessary to optimize strength or hypertrophy. It appears at least pretty equal to training with a couple reps and reserve and we'll talk about what that means in a second. But so, yeah, trained to failure, it doesn't appear to be necessary. I think if you're going to train to failure, Dr. Show and Falad seem to recommend doing machine-based exercises versus on free weights because the injury risk and the risk of an accident happening is lower. If you're on a machine, you know, you can't drop weight on yourself early if you're using a machine. So, going to failure on machine-based exercises seems to be fine and on maybe the single joint exercises too, so if you're doing something like a bicep curl, okay, you can do to failure on that. But maybe not going to failure on a bicep curl back squat or something like that. Those were kind of his recommendations there. So, but in regards to then, if you're not training to failure, what should you do to kind of optimize strength, both lean and Dr. Show and Falad use this concept of reps in reserve. And so, essentially, what a reps in reserve means is you're lifting to the point of how many repetitions are you away from complete failure? So, if you are three reps in reserve, that means I do one, you know, another repetition of exercise and oh, if I did three more of these, I would fail. But I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop with three repetitions in reserve. And training with one to three reps in reserve appears to be just as good as training to failure if your goal is to maximize strength or muscle hypertrophy. So, people can kind of use that to guide your training. If you're doing one to three reps in reserve, that is a good kind of range to stop in terms of if you don't want to train to failure. One of the cool great recommendations I think from Lange Norton was that everybody trained to failure at least once. You know, maybe every training block trained to failure at least once. Because unless you train to failure, similar to like what we talked about with video to max, if you never go to failure, you don't really know what failure feels like. So, train to failure once. And then you can prescribe your training based on the reps in reserve because you sort of know what it feels like when your body really has, it doesn't have another repetition left in it. So, if you recommend the training failure at least once, but then, you know, you don't need to train to failure every time you train because one, yes, it compromises your recovery for your next session increases your injury risk, all those things. And obviously, people are free to train to failure, but it doesn't appear to be optimal or necessary to improve your strength, their hyper-trophy. What about, so when people, when you're engaging in a lot of compound lifts in particular, deadlift squats, your heart rate gets very elevated. I mean, your your your your push in like high intensity training workouts for sure. And there are some people that only strength training, only to resistance training. And they think because their heart rates getting really elevated, they're they're filling that cardiovascular aerobic exercise been because their heart rates getting elevated. But Dr. Levine came on the podcast and said, that not that really wasn't the case. Definitely not the case. So, strength training cannot be your form of cardio. I think is the too long didn't read version of that. So, yes, while it is true that your heart rate will increase when you do strength training. If you continue to strength training in compared to aerobic exercise training for one, you don't get the same improvement. So, if you do, you know, if you look at all the benefits of aerobic exercise training, that include like improvements in endothelial function, cardiovascular structure, like we talked about blood pressure, you don't get those same benefits from resistance exercise training. So, that is kind of one reason why you should do both. Why endurance runners should strength training, why strength training people should do a lot of endurance exercise training. And even Levine said, you know, he consults with NFL players football players and he recommends that everybody do some aerobic exercise training. And the reason for that, that was interesting and it's kind of rooted in, you know, the mechanisms of why heart rate increases during endurance exercise versus aerobic exercise. So, during aerobic exercise, your heart rate increases because there is an elevated metabolic demand in the muscle. And therefore, your cardiac output needs to increase to deliver more blood flow to the muscles. And that means your heart rate in your stroke volume, both increase. During strength training, though, the drive for the increase in heart rate is mainly from the autonomic nervous system. So, it's a central, driven by central command. So, if you think about, you know, if you just are here in Dr. Levine use the example where you're just clinching your fist as hard as possible or like grasping something, maybe, well, your heart rate is going to increase, but that's just due to a drive from your central nervous system. So, versus a metabolic demand increasing in the muscle or like the drive for increased blood flow during aerobic exercise. So, your heart rate increases for different reasons during strength training compared to aerobic exercise. And you don't get the cardiac adaptations from strength training that you do from aerobic exercise. So, they're not the same, they're not comparable. Yes, heart rate increases during strength training, but it is not a form of, quote, unquote, cardio or endurance aerobic exercise. It was fascinating to me to hear Dr. Levine's explanation of that and for that, basically why your heart rate elevates so much when you're doing a strength training. And especially given my anecdote, right, or I was just talking about how surprised it was how much my central nervous system was involved in strength training. I wonder if there's some connection there as well. I just had, you know, I had no idea that it was like there's so it's mentally taxing on my brain. Strength training is very much uses a lot of my, my central nervous system is very active, I guess, is the way to put it. But let's shift gears and talk a little bit about hypertrophy training, right? So, this is, there's a lot of overlap with strength training here and Dr. Shownfield on the podcast was talking about, you know, hypertrophy training. So, these are, this is the type of training that people are interested in with the goal of increasing their muscle size, their muscle mass, right? hypertrophy muscle hipperrophy. And essentially, the biggest difference that he was mentioning is the weight, right? So, you're not lifting as heavy and you're increasing the volume, right? So, you're lifting lighter and you're increasing the volume. So, typically, I mentioned with strength training people getting up to about 85% of their 1 rep max with hypertrophy training, it's more like 60 to 80% of your 1 rep max. And so, you're doing more reps rather than doing like, you know, up to 5 reps for what you'd be doing with strength training during like 6 to 10 or 12 reps. And so, this is, this is a, I would say like one of the biggest, like general principles that Dr. Shownfield talked about in the podcast with respect to training for muscle hypertrophy. Resting is also a little bit lower, like you don't have, it's not as shorter, you don't have to rest quite as long because it's not, you're not lifting as heavy. So, you're resting for 1 to maybe 2 minutes between your sets versus 2 to 5 minutes. So, that's also, it seems like a big difference. And then when it comes to like exercise selection, Dr. Shownfield mentioned, I mean, it really depends on what your interest it in, right? So, you're always, it seems best to do these multi-joint exercises, so you're doing deadlifts, you're doing squats, you're doing presses, rows, because not only are you getting gains and muscle hypertrophy, strength, you're also getting functional, you know, you're improving your functional, your function, your muscular function, and power, a lot of powers and things like squats or lunges or things that are causing you to use muscle, muscular power. Although you can get some of that with bicep curls as well. But people are, some, some guys are interested in their bigger biceps. And so, doing focusing on bicep curls obviously would be something that they'd be interested in. For myself, I do a lot of compound exercises with, you know, some bicep curls and tricep kickbacks and stuff as well. But the majority of my training is definitely compound exercises. Yeah, I think with regard to order and exercise selection, I mean, you think somebody like Dr. Brad Shownfield would be very hyper focused on, you need to pick the perfect order and the perfect exercise to optimize hypertrophy and, you know, him being an experienced lifter and bi-builder, physique competitor himself. But he really seemed unconcerned with it. And, you know, when he was really talking about it, it goes, I think this goes back to focusing on execution rather than perfection. He just says, the muscles that you want to get bigger, train those first, and then train the muscles that you aren't as concerned about growing afterwards. And same thing with exercise selection. There are lots of exercises that could target the muscles that you might want to grow bigger. So whether you choose a squad or a deadlift or a leg extension, you know, it might not matter. Just make sure to, if you want your legs to grow, then do like exercises and make sure you're getting the quality sets and reps and time under tension for those muscle groups. And really don't just get focused on the kind of nuances, maybe. Obviously, there are people who are interested in that. But when thinking about what exercises to do, what order do them in, it seemed pretty straightforward. Just focus on what you want to get larger, do those exercises first and then kind of everything then comes after. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. I like that. You know, like it's not, it's not a very complicated concept to understand. There are lots of different types of exercises and people can choose the ones that they enjoy the most and that are going to obviously, you know, help them grow, but also reduce their injury risk of using machines versus free weights. He didn't seem to be concerned with that either. And even cited some meta-analysi showing, you know, can you is a hypertrophy better with machines or free weights? Seems to be equal. So I think that goes to show that you can do their multiple paths to hypertrophy and you can choose whether you prefer to do through weights or machines. Doesn't seem to not much. I think the one question I wish I'd asked him back then when I wasn't engaged in so much of resistance training was yes, hypertrophy, but, you know, functional independence, right? Like reducing fall risk being able to get in and out of a chair. I wonder how much of that you're going to get with machines versus doing Olympic lifting or like a squat, deadlift, things like that with a barbell. And I don't know, I think I maybe talked a little bit about this with Lane and I don't, I think he said you might get a little bit more bang for your buck with using like a barbell or doing, you know, a squat with a barbell versus like a, is it a hack squat? But at the end of the day, if you are increasing your muscle strength in your muscle mass, you're definitely going to be reducing your fall risk as well. So yeah, exactly. I think it makes a little bit of sense if you really are focused on the, quote, quote, functional training to do, you know, maybe more stuff with free weights that moving natural movements, but like you said, if you're getting stronger, if it's on or even if it's on a machine, then you're getting stronger and that's going to help you within functional independence activities. Yeah, you need to do what you like. Which are going to be consistent with, I mean, that's like paramount, right? The most important thing. Training for body composition. So Dr. Showenfell, Dr. Ling Norton, both of them talked quite a bit about training for body composition on a podcast. And so a lot of people are interested in losing fat and simultaneously gaining muscle. So body recomposition. And Dr. Showenfell talked about, and this is a common thing with weight loss in general. So when people are on a weight loss diet, which most the time involves caloric restriction to some degree, they end up losing some muscle mass, right? It's not just fat that's being lost. And he started a study that even up to 30% of the weight that's lost can come from muscle or lean body mass. So I think that's important to consider because if you're not engaging in some form of resistance training, then you are at a higher risk for losing muscle, even though you may be losing fat. And so I think there's a variety of take-home's here that we're talked about on the podcast in terms of like the best sort of template to follow with respect to body recomposition. So obviously engaging in resistance training. Number one, right? Yeah. Engaging in resistance training. If you're losing weight and you don't resist trained, you're going to lose lean body mass. So engaging in resistance training ideally through times per week. If your goal was body recomposition, which means you either want to maintain your lean mass or increase it, probably. You need to engage in resistance training through times, for probably you can lift pretty heavy, probably with a focus on more hypertrophy, based training versus strength-based training. So that was obviously there one recommendation and it was above all else. It's like resistance training. So second of all though is if you do want to lose a little bit of fat, you'll probably will have to eat in a caloric deficit. And you don't want it to be too drastic though because I think similar to not engaging in resistance training, if you drastically cut calories too much while you're trying to attain body recomposition, you risk losing more lean mass. So you want kind of a more conservative weight loss approach, maybe a one to two pounds a week. And to do that, Dr. Show and Feld recommended eating 10 to 20 percent below your maintenance calories. That was kind of his recommendation there. Maybe you're increasing your exercise more so your deficit might be a little a little bit less, but it might not call you to actually need to eat less because you're exercising more. So the 10 to 20 percent kind of reduction in calories. And then protein intake was a super large focus of all of their recommendations. They emphasized eating you know anywhere from 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be one gram per pound or even more. You know if your goal is to gain muscle. And that is key because eating protein a higher protein diet tends to have a few benefits. So not only the lean mass maintenance benefits that come with protein, but it also has a thermogenic effect. So protein you know when you eat a higher protein diet, it kind of calls you to body to increase its calorie burn for digestive purposes, which may lead to a slightly greater calorie deficit. And then satiety as well, laying talked a lot of it about this, eating higher protein diet may help with satiety to help you kind of eat less throughout the day. Again, some people don't have to go of weight loss so that might not be a concern. But if you're if you're eating for body recovery, composition and are aiming for that flight calorie deficit, all of those things tend to help improve that. So those were kind of some of their core recommendations for body recomposition. And I think the key takeaway was that it is possible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. It's going to depend on your baseline body composition. You know, if you're already 10% body fat and you know it might be a little bit harder to do body recomp. But if you have some weight to lose, our new order resistance training, this can certainly be accomplished. It doesn't require doing one, you know, losing a lot of weight and then building up a lot of muscle. You could do both at the same time. I think the other thing that Lane had mentioned is that, you know, most people don't even really know how many calories they're eating in a day, which is so true. You know, so you kind of have to be able to track that at least for a couple of days and get an average to know how much to cut out. Right. And then again, if you want to like, if you're going to increase them on a protein, you know, making sure it's not really fatty protein either. Right. Like, this is where something like protein powder comes in, it's very handy because you can increase that protein without a lot of calories, right, as well. Right. Sleep too was one of the things Lane also mentioned. He started a study showing that if you don't get enough sleep, it actually will hamper your gains in lean mass loss and it can make a kind of body fat loss a little bit more stubborn. So harder. So if you're not sleeping enough, while you're training, you're not going to gain as much lean masses you could and you're not going to lose as much fat as you could. So focusing on that recovery aspect, that aspect of sleep, stress management, all of those things would be important as well and not just for body recomposition, but you know, that's was one of the key principles. Yeah, sleep is important for brain health. Your immune system, I mean, just cardiovascular health, everything. Hopefully people are aware of that. By now, it's their not. I think another aspect that a lot of people are interested in and certainly myself is time efficient protocols for resistance training. And this is certainly like we were talking about time efficient protocols for aerobic exercise and high intensity and we're training you being at the top of the list there. Dr. Sheoenfeld has actually published a couple of studies on time efficiency and how to be efficient with your resistance training workout. He talked about it on podcast. I really liked a few of the principles that he had covered going back again to multi-joint exercises. They are the most time efficient. You are going to be training multiple muscle groups at once. So squats, deadlifts, lunges, rose presses. Those are really great types of exercises to do if you are pressed for time. And then he also talked about using supersets and drop sets. And so this is something I also use in my workout. Super sets are typically when you are engaging back to back different exercises that are working different muscle groups without any rest. And so you're doing back to back one. So for example, you're doing bicep curls and then you, after your bicep curls, you go straight into tricep kickbacks, then you go into lateral raises or frontal raises and you go back to then you hammer curls and then you go back to the some sort of tricep kick and you're doing them like back to back. So those are the supersets and you really get fatigued. And it is a very time efficient whether you can get a really good workout in 10 minutes. Doing 10 minutes, nonstop, just switching switching from muscle group to muscle group during these super sets as well. And then drop sets is another type of training that involves basically, I do a lot of drop sets on the tail end of my strength training. So it involves like reducing the load and then performing another set, you increase the volume. You reduce the load and increase the volume and then you perform another set back to back. So let's say you did a squat workout, strength training squat workout. You then drop the weight way down, you're at like 60% of your one rep max and then you do 10 of those rest for a minute and then 10 again. So that would be an example of drop sets. And that's also and there's a lot of different ways you can do drop sets. I just talked about the way I do it. Dr. Sean fell talked about a variety of other ways to do it. We also cover that in the guide as well. But I do think that's another really time efficient way to involve engage in resistance training. And then you can combine a lot of different types of training, right? So you can do your strength training and then do some hypertrophy training within that same exercise session. You can avoid a lot of warming up. In fact, the warm-up rather than like stretching for like doing all these stretches where you're like, I don't know is this really that important? Maybe you can stretch for like three minutes, four minutes or whatever or less. And then you're warming up is actually just like progressively loading. Right? So you're like, I said, you do body weight squats or you do your squat with the barbell and then you get to your weight. You're like the much more productive way to warm-up because you're actually warming up your muscles. Yeah, just do the exercise that you're going to perform but either unweighted or you know with a very lightweight. If you're going to do a bench press, your warm-up could just be just doing the bar for 15, 20 sets, 20 reps or whatever. Um, ing-in fact, static stretching has compared to dynamic stretching actually because there's to have no performance benefit if anything is detrimental. So standing there and doing, you know, your little arm exercises that's actually hurting your performance. So just like unweight the bar and do some reps. If you're mimicking to exercise, you're going to do it's a dynamic hormone about better for you to be much better for sure. Was there any other time efficient protocols that were important? Yeah, I think Dr. Showingfeld did cite a study on these sort of micro resistance training workouts where people performed 15 minutes of resistance training six to eight times per week versus say doing the same resistance training, same volume, same exercises, three to four times a week for say, you know, 30 to 40 minutes. They achieved the same level of strength and high-pricut, yeah, I can't remember what was exactly measured in that study, but so you can kind of do these micro workouts. So maybe you have a small window to exercise every single day of the week, not much time, but you could just do 15 minutes of resistance exercise. Okay, well, delegate out your different kind of exercises, maybe do just bench press one day and leg extension one day and, you know, every day do something. It seems, maybe that's not the most efficient, but some people with that fits into your schedule, it seems to produce kind of a similar level of strength and gains to three or four like longer duration sessions. So that could be another time efficient way and you could also do cardio or cardio and strength training or high-intensity interval training on the same day. So, you know, again, you might be even more warmed up if you do a 60-minute zone two session and then go to the gym and get your strength training in or do your Norwegian 4x4 and do some strength training afterwards. I think depending on your goal, might determine the order of those, so if you really are focused on aerobic training and then strength training a second, so someone like me, I'm going to do my long run and then I'm going to do strength training versus the other way around because that strength training is going to get in the way of the quality of my run if I do it beforehand. Whereas some people who strength focus might want to do strength training and then end with cardio because their goal is strength, not the endurance exercise session. So, I think that should probably determine your order, but doing those on the same day could be time efficient. As for the whole like interference effect, people sometimes get worried about like, oh, it is doing aerobic exercise on the strength training gig and to compromise my gains due to the molecular interference of the different signals that govern like endurance, adaptations and strength. That whole thing has been kind of dismissed. There's not any really such thing. It only occurs if you're obviously compromising the quality of your sessions by doing them both on the same day. But yeah, combining cardio and strength, this can definitely be compatible and with it to be time efficient with your exercise. I think if anything, Dr. Schroenfeld talked about, there might even be a benefit you combining because the increased blood flow to muscle, you're getting more nutrients there, you're getting more oxygen. So it actually proves recovery time it decreases the amount of time you need to recover. So you might even get some benefits there as well. So the micro sets is it's funny that I forgot that one because my husband does, so he does a lot of that type of resistance training work. He does a lot of micro sets throughout the week and it really does depend on someone's schedule and what suits them best as well. But it's nice to have all these options. And I think it is kind of is a good segue into the minimum amount of time required in quotes to basically get some strength and hypertrophy benefits. And I think Dr. Schroenfeld talked a little bit about this as well. Yeah, two times per week, 30 minutes at a time seems to be compatible with maintaining or even building strength. He cited multiple studies and even recently they have published a couple showing that just engaging in resistance training, two times per week, 30 minutes. That seems to be probably the bare minimum if you want to maintain or increase your muscle strength. And then obviously you can work out from there based on kind of what your goals are. But I think three times per week is probably optimal. And then really if you're someone wanting to build a lot of strength through your performance oriented athlete doing four to five days per week. But yeah, I think it's great to hear especially for someone like me who doesn't do a ton of strength training and needs to do more that you can really do a lot in two sessions per week. But obviously that means during those two sessions if you're just going to do them. You don't be on your phone a ton of the time you probably want to do supersets. You probably want to do some drop sets to kind of make the most of that. But two, two times per week, 30 minutes at a time seems to be enough. So if people are really concerned with that time efficiency you can accomplish a lot in that. And then you also mentioned the micro dosing of the milk. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be two, 30 minute sessions. You can do that. The more sessions of like 10 or 15 minutes sessions that you're doing multiple times as long as the total time is the same. Yes, exactly. So again, all of this is in our Hadetrain Guide. You can find all these protocols and information down below that copy Hadetrain Guide.com. We're going to move on to the last section that is covered in our guide. And this really sort of supplemental to the exercise protocols. We're going to cover a lot of supplemental protocols like deliberate heat exposure. For example, using a sauna, some nutrition, protein, intake, and then also some supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and creatine. So starting with deliberate heat exposure, drawing from some of the leading experts in this area of sauna research, Dr. Yari Laukenen being one of the world's experts on how this sauna is affecting cardiovascular health. I've had them on the podcast many years ago. And he is published just numerous studies on how this sauna affects cardiovascular rate fitness, how it's affecting blood pressure, cardiac compliance, arterial compliance, just a lot of different cardiovascular health parameters. And his research has shown in a couple different ways. So there's been observational data showing people that exercise and use the sauna have a lower all-cosm mortality than people that exercise and don't use the sauna. But he's also done some interventional studies where he's taken two groups of people and put them on an exercise protocol, aerobic exercise on a stationary bike. And then only half of that group then went into a sauna after the exercise and he measured cardiovascular risk pre-fitness and found that people that use the sauna in addition to aerobic exercise improve their cardiovascular risk pre-fitness even more than people that only did the exercise. And there were other cardiovascular metabolic parameters that were also improved. cholesterol was improved blood pressure was improved more as well. So it seems as though adding the sauna in addition to an exercise routine is another way to improve some cardiovascular metabolic endpoints and also cardiovascular risk pre-fitness. There's also some endurance benefits as well. Something that I've talked about before and the podcast in fact you Brady use the sauna in your exercise protocol. I do and a lot of the ask to do with some of the research that you've talked about in that Dr. Lauken and his published. So I informed kind of my strategy based on this not only the study show that you can improve your view to max additionally by using the sauna but it also improves your exercise performance not only in the heat, which kind of of a sense here's in the sauna you're becoming more heat acclimated but it also improves your performance just in normal weather or not hot weather I guess is you would call it. So I integrate that in my training not only just do I like the sauna for the cardiovascular benefits in the brain benefits. Now after reading these studies kind of hearing you talk about it I think you know it makes sense to use it. So about three times for week two to three times per week I'll try to get into the sauna immediately or within five to ten minutes of finishing one of my runs. So all you know do my run from the gym I don't have a sauna at home but I have one at the gym that I use and I'll finish my run I'll get right into the sauna for another 20 to 30 minutes. Those seems to be the protocols used in many of the studies they do typically a 20 minute sauna bath afterwards. So I'll get right in there try to keep it so that my heart rate is like staying a little bit elevated from the end of the run into the sauna. So I think of it as a way to sort of extend that cardio session a little bit um that endurance training session because when you're in the sauna you know my heart rate might not be as high as it was when I was running 130-40-50 beats per minute but it'll be 110 maybe at the end of the sauna. So I use that as a strategy again one because it feels good and I just like it but to to gain maybe some additional benefits to that endurance exercise training session. I do the same I get in the sauna after both aerobic exercise training as well as doing my strength training resistance training exercise you know and a lot of the the data that Dr. Lalkmanan as published has been observational data looking at people that are routinely using this sauna and the effects of that on cardiovascular related mortality all cause mortality and it seems as though like the minimum effect of dose to get some benefits it's really two times a week of sun use. If you get up to four times a week then you're really getting maximum benefits of 47 times a week people are getting reductions up to 50% in their cardiovascular related mortality 40% related to reductions in their all cause mortality and this sauna doesn't have to be so hot. I mean this isn't like the 200 and something degree temperatures that you often hear people cite that they're using. In fact I think that's a little bit too hot. I mean these people are using a hundred on average 175 degrees Fahrenheit often there is a little bit of a humidity you know 30 up to 30% humidity as well but they're in there for about 20 minutes and so I find it it is nice to get in get into the sauna after a workout and extend that sort of aerobic exercise mimicking capacity a little bit further. Another area that using to liberate heat exposure could be beneficial is combining it with resistance training or even using it during perhaps an injury when you're not able to workout and I would say a lot of this evidence is preliminary and more needs to be done but going off the preliminary evidence and just knowing that there's benefits for cardiovascular health as well. Why wouldn't you? There has been at least some preliminary evidence in one small study that people that got in this sauna after the resistance training protocol increased signaling molecules that are involved and a ball exceedingly molecules that are involved in muscle hypertrophy there's also been another trial in humans that underwent I mean it was experiments that are done where they mobilized a muscle for a period of time and they look at atrophy after that right? Disuse atrophy is what it's called and it seems as though heat exposure at least at the local level in this in this regard for the study people that had the heat exposure were about almost 40% less likely to lose their they lost 40% less of their muscle mass which is quite a bit so a lot of potential reasons there heat shock proteins have been shown to be activated a lot of disuse atrophy studies done in animal models with heat exposure and then you're getting a variety of endocrine effects as well growth hormone is elevated when you get in the sauna and that can have aspects for recovery as well so there's a lot of reasons to to combine deliberate heat exposure with also resistance training workout and I would say that is not the case for deliberate cold exposure yeah and in fact I think a lot of the evidence would suggest the opposite lately where getting in cold immediately after resistance exercise in particular seems to blunt some of the hypertropic event of it benefits there's a lot of press about those studies now where it's like of away the cold after your resist is training workout so yeah it makes sense to really embrace the heat not only for recovery but for the inabolic potential the endurance exercise benefits I think you know the the animal like potential is interesting because you know I don't know if again if there are any studies out there showing greater hypertrophy after using heat but like you said with the heat shock protein all the mechanisms kind of make sense and so there was recently like a review paper that just came out that will need to probably read and maybe write about on that because I think it's heat is becoming kind of embraced and yeah again the cold maybe not something to do around your resistance exercise sessions right and I and Dr Luke Van Lune who was a guest on the podcast as well had done some he has done some research on that in fact showed that doing deliberate cold exposure like a cold bath immediately after resistance training workout does blunt hypertrophy I mean so that's yeah muscle muscle proteins synthesis all goes down if you get in the cold right afterwards so something to avoid probably kind of going back struggling back to the disused atrophy you know that's something that's obviously very relevant for people if they're injured or perhaps they're traveling somewhere and they don't have the same they're not they're working their muscles out the same way that they usually do and so there's a there's a there's a there's a case to to be made you know where it's like okay well I'm not going to be engaging my muscles as much and you're kind of like you don't use it you lose it right and this is where a supplement that I'm I'm quite fond of for a variety of reasons Omega 3 fatty acids seem to be beneficial so Dr Chris McGlorie came on the podcast and talked about some of his research using high dose Omega 3's was about five grams a day which is a little bit higher than what is prescribed for some people for different cardio metabolic reasons was able to prevent or cut disused atrophy almost by 50% in in this case it was in women so Omega 3 fatty acids might be another sort of tool for recovery right I'm used during perhaps illness injury I think they should be used every day there's a lot of benefits cardiovascular benefits as well anti inflammatory benefits again going down to the recovery and Omega 3 fatty acids being beneficial for inflammation for for someone like yourself it might even more useful right where you're really running you're running what 20 or 20 hours a week almost there's a lot of stress on your muscles and a lot of inflammatory cytokines and molecules that are generated during that kind of trading and you know the heart too I think it was maybe something that you had posted but I think there was a study showing Omega 3 fatty acids could prevent some of the cardiac injury biomarkers after endurance starting or after downhill running so yeah I look at some of those studies and I mean I do take Omega 3 myself I think I take two grams per day so maybe I need to out my dose to three to five grams per day based on some of this research here but yeah I think cardiac stuff too you know I think makes sense to take that for recovery purposes for sure yeah I think it was a three grams a day in a decrease the trope and in levels that that are which is a marker of your cardiac stress okay so we we're we're also going to kind of transition to some of the nutritional aspects of this guide starting with protein which is probably like I guess the most important when it comes to muscle mass muscle hypertrophy anything in all things muscle doctor Stuart Phillips was on the podcast Dr Brad shown fellow talked quite a bit about protein intake doctor Luke Van Loone Dr Langnor and quite a few experts have been on talking about the importance of protein intake how the RDA for protein which is 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight does not appear to be enough for maintaining muscle mass particularly if you are engaging in resistance training in fact Stuart Phillips was a author on a study that was a meta analysis of multiple randomized controlled trials that found that people that on average were taking in about 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight and we're engaged in a resistance training protocol if they up that to about 1.6 grams per kilogram they had a 27% increase in muscle mass and a 10% increase in muscle strength compared to people that were resistance training but only during the 1.2 grams per kilogram body weight so a protein intake so I think that's a pretty easy lever we can pull in terms of increasing our muscle mass and strength with not as much effort right takes a lot of effort to lift weights but to increase your protein intake isn't quite much effort yeah but I think something to note there too is that while they all while you know Stuart Phillips and Brad Joemfeld and you know every basically all the experts who we put evidence for into the sky they recommended these protein intakes quoted that it was very important but all of them really emphasized that nothing kind of compares to the resistance training so yeah protein intake is important but if you're not resistance training you're kind of really missing out on that aspect so I think protein intake can be seen as kind of necessary but not sufficient for muscle growth you know you can't just even more protein and get bigger you know you gotta do the training but so but it is certainly important and I think totally protein intake was one of the things that stood out as that is the most important factor when it comes to if people have questions about how much or when do I eat it or how much or how do I distribute it totally protein intake that seems to be the most important thing so just making sure you're getting enough during the day but two things that you know we're also talked about we're regarding protein distribution so in that refers to you know timing and distribution I guess is how we could phrase it so when teach your protein particularly maybe with regards to exercise and then how to distribute it throughout the day regarding timing there's this concept known as the anabolic window and this was kind of an earlier idea where it was once thought that you know after you ended your resistance training session you need to consume protein immediately afterwards otherwise you would sacrifice your gain so if you didn't protein within 30 minutes after finishing resistance training then you were leaving gains on the table you weren't going to grow as strong you weren't going to grow as big doctor Brad showed and felt I really liked what he said about that he refers to it more as an anabolic barn door so it's just a lot larger than you know the 30 minutes that was kind of once thought you know you don't need to eat immediately after your train now that's not to say that you can't I mean in fact I think if you have the opportunity to you should it makes sense to eat as quickly after your exercise sessions possible because your your muscles are more sensitive to amino acids at that point so yes eat a meal have some protein immediately after resistance training if you can if you have the way to do three hours it's probably you're still going to be okay in fact there was just a recent study that came out that showed delaying protein intake versus immediately after they both lead dissimilar gains and hypertrophy and strength so you know if as long as you're getting enough throughout the day you don't need to be that concerned with the timing it right around exercise so that seemed to be one of the key takeaways and people you may not need to be as stressed about that when they're thinking about their protein timing and then protein distribution was another thing that Luke Van Lune discussed a lot in terms of what is optimal so is it optimal you know if you want to eat two meals per day with two very large doses of protein is that worse or better than consuming three to four evenly spaced meals throughout the day based on you know muscle protein synthesis data that Luke Van Lune cited it seems to be optimal to eat three to four protein-containing meals containing you know 25 to 30 grams or more throughout the day evenly spaced um that's for optimizing muscle protein synthesis does it if you're to be better for muscle gain maybe not but it in theory kind of would produce greater gains due to the greater muscle protein synthesis response but he also said that you know if you're just a two meal per day person or even a one meal per day person you know if you want to eat a hundred grams or protein at once that can be digested absorbed use for muscle protein synthesis they published a kind of popular study recently showing that but it certainly doesn't seem to be ideal so if regarding protein distribution evenly distributed protein during the day appears to be optimal secondary obviously to to getting enough protein throughout the day yeah it this this all this information and more I recently covered in an episode on the science of protein um for those of you that haven't checked it out make sure you check it out if you're interested in protein and the effects of protein on aging, muscle mass, strength all all things considered definitely check that out I kind of want to move lastly to the the last sort of aspect in our in the training guide and that has to with creatine supplementation and Dr. Stuart Phillips and also Dr. Lane Norton both mentioned creatine as one of their top tier supplements that they take lots and lots of evidence on safety and efficacy I take it you take it maybe you can talk a little bit about you know just summarize briefly for people what are some of the benefits of creatine supplementation how people should start dose you know some of the best practices I think creatine I feel like it's probably like one of the most popular or supplements these days and everybody is taking it or if they're not they probably should be due to the the evidence that's coming out so yeah creatine um it you know it's something that we get from the diet but that you can supplement with it to get more regarding you know how much you should take I think that currently the recommendations and you know based on what Dr. Stuart Phillips and Llanorton and other said taking five to ten grams per day appears to be the optimal dose if you're a bit larger you could maybe you know take 10 to 15 but even five grams per day after a while will probably saturate your muscle creatine stores especially if you're consuming a lot of meat which does contain creatine too so you're getting some from your diet and supplementing so it regards to how to dose uh there was one thought that you had to do this loading dose when you started supplementing so you take 20 grams per day for a week and then you go down to a maintenance dose of five to ten grams per day indefinitely that right the loading dose isn't necessarily recommended anymore it's pretty much just start taking five to ten grams per day tomorrow and never stop it so the loading does doesn't appear to be optimal unless for some reason you need to get your muscle creatine stores up you know in the next few days thinking you need to take a loading dose but for most people that doesn't appear to be important so it's pretty easy supplement to take it it doesn't matter what time of day you take it because it doesn't have the acute benefits so just find a time during the day when it works it makes sense to take it take five to ten grams and just continue to take it it seems to have benefits for muscle performance and building strength obviously that's kind of well we're the main benefits are probably most evidence and it was thought of as being like this body building strength supplement which it obviously is so it allows you to train harder which then allows you to build more strength and muscle mass but I think there's a lot of evidence coming out that it might be good for older adults to take for muscle strength as well for endurance athletes it probably makes sense for them to take it and then there's a lot of stuff coming out about creatine in the brain for you know during sleep deprivation so just a lot of evidence that it's good to take their period of you very few side effects it's very safe and all of the myths I think Stu was talking about some of the myths regarding hair loss or kidney health and laying even said some of those and none of those really appear to be valid um creatine is well studied and so it's something that most people can combat if it from and it's again pretty pretty simple to take it's just by creatine model hydrate take five to ten grams per day and just continue to take it after about a month or so that's kind of when the benefits might start to appear because that's when your muscle stores are saturated. I take about five grams a day. Yeah as do I take five grams per day I have a bit experimenting with taking ten grams per day on the weekend for no reason I run longer on those days so I just am like oh maybe for recovery purposes just take ten grams it's just something I'm trying but yeah usually on five grams per day. I thought about experimenting with ten grams of this you just there I mean it's hard to sometimes notice differences subtle differences like that especially when you're taking so many other things and doing so many other things right but I've also thought about kind of increasing the dose just to see like oh can I lift a little bit heavier is it? Is it gonna affect affect my ass strength as well? Yeah it might be worth trying out. I think one more thing about creatine to notice that like I think people are concerned Stu Phillips mentioned he doesn't take it all the time and that if he goes on vacation he might just like not take it because it's not important it doesn't appear that after you stop taking it your stores will still say saturated for about like one or two weeks so like if you go on vacation or and forget your creatine then just like eat more steak maybe on vacation and supplement when you come back. Yeah that's good to know yeah I've definitely not taking it on vacation before especially because my my containers like this big of it. The TSA also might think it's like they might be get a little bit skeptical due to how it looks. I know I know I often wonder that some pimps on I'm allocating like powders and stuff I'm like oh is this gonna get my bag flat? That is to say all of this wonderful information, real useful practical information protocols everything can be found in the how to train according to the experts guide you can pause now download that at how to train guide.com wonderful training guide that Brady was a big part and working on. Thank you so much Brady for sitting down first of all for working on the guide and for sitting down with me to discuss it. I do want to plug your your book you have VO2 Maxest Centrals you also have a sub-steck page you can tell people about and you're a very active on Twitter X. I follow you there you post a lot of really great stuff on exercise physiology so maybe you can tell people where to to follow you up on on those platforms. Yeah thanks Rhonda. So view to Maxest Centrals is just the book that I self-published you can get it on Amazon and sub-steck I write kind of like a weekly newsletter based on you know studies and health exercise nutrition kind of whatever I find interesting that week it's physiologically speaking I kind of put some of a difficult name but people should be able to find that and then on X I am just a B underscore Homer HOL M.E.R. so people can find me on there it's where I'm most active and posting a lot about you know topic similar to what we talked about today. Awesome all right well thank you so much Brady. Yes thanks Rhonda this is great. Thanks so much for listening to today's episode nearly 80% of you watching right now are not subscribed. In my YouTube videos I emphasize excellence and as a result I don't release episodes all that often. So please subscribe and click the bell to get notified when we release a new episode. I'll see you next time.

A big objective for metabolic health summit is really to bridge the gap from science to implementation. And as we were as we are organizers planning for this event, we had a short list of people who really have the proficiency, the knowledge, the skills, who transmit or translate science to the public. And high on that list was Dr. Rhonda Patrick. So, and around this time, Dr. Patrick Rhonda graciously invited me to be on her podcast, found my fitness podcast. So, she had actually came to our lab maybe about four or five years ago. And so, you know, I told my co-host, Angela and Victoria was like, well, I think I can answer on to Patrick. I didn't want to do it in an email. I don't think I did. So, I asked her in person. And he had, I'll have to say, she was very task-loaded during this time. So, I am extremely grateful that she took time out of her busy schedule with a lot of things going on in her life right now to join us at Metabolic Health Summit. And I'm going to give a short introduction. She has quite a long bio, but Dr. Patrick is a scientist and a health educator based in San Diego. She runs a popular website and podcast on YouTube channel called Found My Fitness. Her areas of focus include micro-nutrient deficiencies, the role of aging, and the role of genetics and epigenetics in health status. The benefits of exposing the body to hermetic stress such as sauna and heat stress is why I do the hot tub. At various forms of cold exposure, exercise and fasting. And also plant phytochemicals and the importance of mindfulness and stress reduction and sleep. So, really take in a holistic approach to metabolic health by health and general. Her work has been published in journals like experimental neurology, phasive, nature, cell biology, and trends in cell biology. Dr. Patrick's talk is titled, intestinal permeability and the bacterial link to aging brain barrier dysfunction and metabolic disorder. And with that, let's without further ado, let's invite our speaker to the stage. Thank you, Brian. Good evening, everyone. I'm so excited to be here. Thank you, Dom. Thank you to the organizers, Victoria Field, and Angela Poff as well. I'm so excited that this finally worked out. You guys have invited me a few times, so just so happy to be here tonight. I am discussing something I haven't, I'm excited actually because this really pressed me to there's some topics that I've been really interested in lately and diving into doing a lot of research literature reviews on. And so I was like, I need to push myself to learn more about this and what better way to do that than to present on it, right? So I'm going to be presenting on something a little bit new in terms of things that I've talked about generally speaking. I'm going to talk about the role of intestinal permeability. And today we're going to cover, we're going to cover how what intestinal permeability is and how it can lead to the release of a bacterial product called lipopolty saccharide or LPS, which is a type of endotoxin. It's present in the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria, the bacteria that are inside of our intestines. We're going to talk about how LPS, as it's called for short, bind to lipoprottynes and circulation and how this can play a role in atherosclerosis. We're going to talk about how LPS can compromise the blood-brain barrier and also how that plays a role in the development of neurodegenerate disease. We're going to talk about the role of LPS in the way we feel and our mood. And then finally we're going to get into what everyone's probably most interested in is what do we know about certain lifestyle factors that can regulate intestinal permeability. So let's start off by talking about what intestinal permeability is. So if you look sort of at a schematic of our intestinal lining, we have antarasides. These are gut epithelial cells. They are connected to each other by tight junctions. These are groups of proteins that are basically connecting our gut epithelial cells together so that they're forming a tight barrier. Basically it's one component of the gut barrier. Another component would be the use in secreted by our goblet cells in the gut. So intestinal permeability refers to most of what's understood with intestinal permeability has to do with the some disintegration or disassembly of tight junctions, which allows bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide, it allows bacteria, it allows food antigens to leak into circulation. So we're going to talk about what happens when LPS is able to leak into circulation. So what effect does LPS in circulation have on cardiovascular health? So lipoproteins, everyone here is familiar with what lipoproteins are, they're a mixture of lipids and proteins, they originate in the liver. Their main role is to transport triglycerides and other goodies, other lipids and cholesterol as well to other tissues. Mostly they're transporting triglycerides. Our tissues, ourselves, cannot make triglycerides. Most of ourselves can make their own cholesterol. So it's really important to have triglycerides being transported around because they're a really important source of energy. There are various shapes and sizes of lipoproteins from VLDL or very low density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein LDL to small dense LDL or small dense low density lipoprotein. And as these lipoproteins start to transport around our circulation and donate triglycerides for example to other tissues they be get, they get smaller in size and also they become more dense. Well LPS binds to lipoproteins, it actually binds to all of them and through a lipid lipid interaction. And it's actually thought that this is one of the protective mechanisms that our body has to prevent lipoprotein saccharide from causing for example sepsis. And we know that lipoproteins play a role in actually lowering LPS levels in our circulation. And this happens because the LPS is bound to for example the LDL molecule. So lipoproteins are recycled. They're they're they're recycled through the liver. There's a protein present on lipoproteins called APOB, APOB interacts with the LDL receptor in the liver and is absorbed taken up and that's how it's recycled. Well because LPS is attached to lipoproteins, the LPS also gets lowered or decreased in circulation. And this has been shown in a variety of mechanistic studies for example using statins which lower LDL through a variety of different mechanisms. One of many includes increasing the number of LDL receptors and therefore increasing the recycling of these lipoproteins and subsequently LPS has been shown to be lowered in circulation after statin use for example. So again this really seems to be a protective mechanism lipoproteins buying this lipoprotein saccharide to help prevent our bodies from having massive inflammation and based on undergoing sepsis. And so one of the ways that does that is by increasing lipoprotein production when basically when LPS levels become elevated. And then the lipoproteins then recycle the LPS through for the liver. But not all lipoproteins are getting recycled as most people here know. There are a variety sizes of lipoproteins we've now had increasing evidence that the smaller and denser LDL particles don't get taken up into the liver as well. And mechanisms have been worked out on this including because as the LDL particle gets smaller and size the apob protein that is interacting with the LDL receptor becomes somewhat obscured. And so when this apob is supposed to bind to the LDL receptor it's not binding as well and therefore it's not getting taken up and it's not being recycled as well. And subsequently that means that the LPS particle bound to the LDL is staying in circulation. So what consequence, what's the consequence of this? If we have a small dense LDL particle that's not getting recycled it's actually in circulation longer and there's been evidence that these small dense LDL particles will insert themselves into the arterial lining, the arterial wall. And of course the LPS is a signal to our immune cells, resident macrophages, since the LPS signal and it's like oh I've got to get rid of that bacteria because it's a threat. So it comes and tries to try to engulf through phase at Fego Saitoosis, what it thinks is a bacteria but which actually is a small dense LDL particle with an LPS bound to it through a lipid lipid interaction inserted into the arterial wall. And so it Fego Saitoosis that entire lipoprotein and you get the formation of what's called a foam cell sort of a soft plaque. And this is stuck in our arterial wall, the lining of our arteries and as it's sitting there for you know more and more time and undergoes more inflammatory and oxidative transformations which then causes the foam cell to become you know stiffer and more plaque like. So this is the beginning of atherosclerosis, there's been a variety of animal studies nicely documenting this as well with the small dense LDL particle and LPS and in fact even showing if you for example increase the production of muterate producing bacteria in the gut which can help prevent LPS leakage that can sort of reverse some of these effects. Quite interesting. So that's sort of one aspect of what LPS can do when it's in circulation to cardiovascular health. The next question is what about the brain? What effect can LPS in circulation have on brain health? So the blood brain barrier much like the gut barrier is made up of a series of endothelial cells that are bound to each other and held together through tight junctions again these proteins that group of proteins that are holding the endothelial cells together on the basement membrane side of the blood brain barrier we have a variety of different cell types sort of all interacting together parius sites and microglio cells which are the brains resident immune cell as well as astrosights and together they're making up the blood brain barrier. So LPS again originating from intestinal permeability can actually break down some of the tight junctions itself and it binds directly to receptors present on microglio cells these are called toll-like receptors I'm to like four receptors and we're going to talk a little bit about that in more detail in a moment but when that happens it actually shifts the microglio cells in the brain from a protective mode to an attack mode and so they kind of change their their phenotype and this sort of results in the astro astro sites moving away from the parasites and the basement membrane and so you end up getting then even further breakdown of the blood brain barrier becomes more permeable and this is sort of the beginning of this vicious cycle where then you know you sort of have a slow sort of insidious more permeability effect because more LPS and other inflammatory molecules and other things are getting into the brain and then it's you know changing the phenotype of our microglio cells for example and this sort of this vicious cycle of neuro inflammation so why should we care about you know blood brain barrier breakdown well the blood brain barrier is key for brain aging in fact nearly 50% of all dementia including Alzheimer's disease begin with the breakdown of the smallest vessels in the brain and in fact biomarkers of blood brain barrier breakdown proceed classical biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease like tau tangles and amoloid beta 42 aggregates LPS in circulation also affects the way we feel so healthy individuals that are injected with LPS experience symptoms of depression, depressive mood, feelings of social disconnection they also have elevations in inflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha, IL6 compared to people that are injected with a saline control there have been a variety of studies that have now sort of established causation with respect to the role of inflammation in in depression and basically in in the way we feel in our mood and there's been a variety of mechanisms that have been sort of delineated one of those has to do with the metabolism of triptophane so triptophane is an essential amino acid we get from our diet it is transported into the brain once it's in the brain it gets converted into serotonin which is an important neurotransmitter that regulates mood it regulates cognition it regulates impulse control long term planning it's important for a variety of cognitive functions well if there is a acute inflammation or even sort of low grade chronic inflammation this can shift the metabolism of triptophane such that triptophane is not transported into the brain rather it's converted into a metabolite called chenurine and chenurine has been shown to accumulate in the brains of people with depression also neurodegenerative disorders chenurine gets converted into a neurotoxin called quenolinic acid which also has been associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by polar disorders schizophrenia as well as neurodegenerative disorders I have exercise on here because exercise as most people here are familiar with is very it's it's been shown to be important for brain health or cognition for the way we feel and part of that is because it increases the transport of triptophane into the brain before any conversion into chenurine so it actually increases the transport of triptophane in the brain and also the conversion of triptophane into serotonin so it's sort of a summary of of this part of my talk is that intestinal permeability can lead to the leakage of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide LPS into circulation and we talked about cardiovascular health and atherosclerosis but it also affects the brain and it can generate inflammation and flammatory responses that can change triptophane metabolism change the way serotonin production is made but also it affects the blood brain barrier and and that can also affect the way our brain is aging so LPS in in in circulation is not a good thing and maintaining healthy gut barrier is important for both cardiovascular health and for brain health but there's other there's other mechanisms by which LPS can sort of wreak havoc on our health and this has to do with the binding of something that's a receptor on almost every single cell and our body it's called toll-like receptors we have these everywhere we have a monoramune cell so toll-like receptor for TLR4 LPS binds to these receptors and when he does on when it does this in immune cells of course there's lots you know lots of inflammatory responses that are generated but it also leads to what's called inflammation the aging of our immune system or our immune system because it becomes less robust at protecting us against pathogens as we age it also becomes better at making inflammatory cytokines and doing it in a sort of like you know shotgun approach you know where that it's kind of like there's a lot of collateral damage the toll-like receptors when they're when they interact with LPS on muscle tissue it's been shown to in paraglicose uptake into muscle tissue which of course would affect metabolism cause metabolic dysfunction on liver cells it's been shown to play a role in non alcoholic fatty liver disease and in the brain we talked about a few problems with the breakdown of blood brain barrier it's been shown to also lead to depression as well as neurodegenerative disease so let's talk about what happens when these toll-like receptors on immune cells are activated and inflammation inflammatory biomarkers are elevated so for example people that are this is a different study than I when when I mentioned previously this isn't even lower dose of LPS when people are given a low dose of LPS such that there's really no clinical symptoms no clinical endpoints that were noticeable the the individuals had a up to 100 fold increase in their inflammatory biomarkers so they had a 25 fold increase in TNF alpha a very powerful poro inflammatory cytokine and a 100 fold increase in IL-6 which is also a poro inflammatory cytokine they also had an increase in markers of insulin resistance homoir increase by 32% and markers of insulin sensitivity decreased by 21% so this is this is kind of evidence that even a low dose of LPS remember LPS originates from the gut can massively increase biomarkers of inflammation and you know the the levels of LPS we're talking about are chronically elevated and people that are overweight in obese so we're going to talk about that in a minute but inflammation itself has been shown to play a role in aging it's been shown to accelerate epigenetic aging clocks so these are epigenetic signatures that have been identified by Dr. Steve Horvath Dr. Morgan Levine and others to basically be able to biomark biological age there was a study that was done by Dr. Levine and colleagues where people who had head and net cancer that were undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatment combined their epigen they they had this treatment done and immediately after their treatment their epigenetic clocks accelerated by five years so that's like they had aged five years six months to a year later their most people's epigenetic age and clocks were turned back to base line return back to normal except for people who still had elevated inflammatory cytokines those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokines at the six month mark or one year mark after their treatment still had massively aged epigenetic agent clocks so chronic inflammation can accelerate epigenetic aging it's also been associated with accelerating aging itself in fact suppression of inflammation has been shown to be important for aging and the quality of life as well as cognition so this was a cohort large co-host study out of Japan where a variety of biomarkers were measured individuals that were elderly individuals that were centenarians that there were a hundred years old individuals that were semi super centenarians these are individuals that are 105 years old or in super centenarians who were a hundred and ten years old and a variety of biomarkers were measured everything from long term fasting like glucose levels so HBA1C to liver function to lipids to kidney function to telomerangeth immunosinescence to biomarkers of inflammation and the only bite and the only thing that was predictive of an individual basically living to the next stage was suppression of inflammation so low markers of inflammation and that was also the only thing that was predictive of cognition like being cognitive cognitively capable in older life as well so I think probably what most people are interested in now are okay well it seems as though it's really bad to have LPS in our circulation and it originates from our gut when our gut barrier is in some way shape or form compromised intestinal permeability occurs so let's talk about some lifestyle factors that are known to affect gut permeability or intestinal permeability since we've been talking about the brain and we've been talking about the role of LPS from originating from the gut on the brain it's a two-way road so the brain also affects the gut and I think that anyone in this room who's gone to graduate school or med school or any kind of higher education and has experienced the massive stress probably has felt some kind of gut symptoms I know I did I mean there was definitely like there's an association between being chronically stressed and having a GI problem and it took me a while to figure that out when I was in graduate school I didn't know what was wrong I thought maybe I had you know I BS or something and turned out it was actually stress so there's been some nice studies done in fact people giving a presentation a get release LPS into their circulation so in fact you probably measure my LPS right now I'm sure it'd be off this charts compared to yesterday when I was having fun with my family at Disneyland but a lot of the mechanisms have been worked out on this and in fact one of the stress hormones that is released when we are stressed is corticotropin releasing hormone and this binds to a type of immune cells that are present at the level of the gut called a mass cell there are receptors for corticotropin releasing hormone on mass cells and when so when that stress hormone binds to the mass cell the mass cell releases proteases which then degrade a bunch of proteins that make up the tight junctions that hold our intestinal gut you know membranes are our interocytes together and so this causes again this is a intestinal permeability this is what happens and that allows food antigens to leak in a circulation allows LPS to leak in disserculation it allows other things as well bacteria so this is this is how psychological stress in the form of a talker giving or financial stress or you know social relationships lots there's lots of different taking care of a sick family member there's lots of ways that a person can be stressed graduate school but it's it's kind of I think it's important to realize that managing our stress is really important for our you know our gut basically and for helping to prevent intestinal permeability probably not surprising what's called an obiecinogenic diet something that can lead to obesity this is a combination of high fat high sugar low fiber so you can feed people high fat high sugar low fiber diet and after about four weeks you know their LPS levels are increased by 71 percent I would argue that you could just do this and then one hour later measure that because there's something called post brandial endotoxemia which is the the release of as I mentioned LPS is a type of endotoxin so it's often you'll see in the literature the words interchange like a polysaccharide LPS or endotoxin so so food itself you know I mean when we eat meals there's post-prandial inflammation part of that post-prandial inflammation can be you know connected to LPS that is released not all of it but part of it so an obiecinogenic diet something that can make people you know get fat can also increase LPS levels obesity itself has been associated with higher circulating levels of biomarkers of intestinal permeability such as zonylon and we'll talk a little bit more about zonylon in a minute and so there's been this this sort of is it the chicken or the egg or what does it is at the obesity that causes LPS to be released you know from intestines and causes is basically causing intestinal permeability or is it the diet that's causing the obesity that's doing it and it turns out it's probably both there seems to be evidence of both of these things occurring and so then what you have again is one of those vicious cycles because you have the diet that's causing the obesity to you know that's basically wreaking havoc on your your your gut health and an LPS basically and then the obesity itself is also doing it and in fact weight loss can decrease markers of intestinal permeability so people that were were obese that that decrease their BMI by about seven were also able to decrease markers of intestinal permeability and there's a million reasons why we should you know lose weight if if you're if we're overweight or obese obesity in extreme cases very extreme cases can can have a massive effect on life span so extreme obesity this is a meta analysis of about 20 prospective studies found that extreme obesity a BMI between 40 and 45 is associated with a seven-year decrease in life expectancy more bit obesity this is the BMI between 55 and 60 is associated with a 14-year decrease in life expectancy so there's you know there's every reason to want to lose weight and particularly you know lose fat in this real fat and there's a lot of ways that that can happen I know a lot of great speakers at this event will discuss that but probably one of the easiest ways that Dr. Roe just mentioned a moment ago is caloric restriction and it's there's a lot of ways that you can get to caloric restriction you can counter calories and diet you can skip meals you can you know exercise and skip meals there's lots of ways to do it but I think that at the end of the day the reality is is that when you when you limit your food intake you can you can lose weight it's effective binge drinking is something that also has been identified to cause massive LPS release from the intestines probably a lot of people that already have underlying gut issues or more familiar with this because they've probably noticed when they drink alcohol they might start to have gut issues and and and so binge drinking this is this is for women about three to four drinks and for men like four to five so it's a lot I mean this is more relevant for a college audience you know to be honest but it's important to keep in mind right I mean you know binge drink drinking does increase LPS and they most of us are probably more interested what about moderate alcohol consumption what effect is that have and there's been associations with moderate alcohol consumption and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth so the bacteria in our gut mostly are localized to the distal end of our large intestine or our colon as it's called bacteria are not really supposed to be in the small intestine I mean this is where fats are absorbed it's where simple sugars are absorbed proteins so the complex carbohydrates are mostly broken down in the colon but when bacteria make their way into the intestines it can cause problems it can cause zonyl and release and we'll talk about why that's important for intestinal permeability in a minute but so there is some connection between moderate alcohol consumption and in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth I will say this I mean this is not a ton of literature on this and it's quite you know likely like like we all know observational studies there's a million factors I mean maybe it's a combination of people that already have some underlying gut issue or maybe it's a combination of people that are eating obeseogenic diet and drinking alcohol or there's stress and they're drinking alcohol you know maybe it's a two-hit hypothesis like we don't really know but it's something to keep in mind alcohol can be hard on the gut especially in combinations with other things that are hard on the gut like stress for example so let's talk a little bit more in detail about the zonyl in that I've mentioned a couple of times again looking at the intestinal gut barrier we have our entire sides that are connected together through tight junctions so gliatin is one of two proteins that is present in gluten so glutin is found in a variety of different types of whole grain sources gliatin bind to a receptor on the on the surface of our intestinal epithelial cells called the CXCR3 receptor and when that gliatin binds to that receptor it causes the release of a protein from our interacites or gut cells called zonylin and zonylin then binds to a series of other receptors present on the our epithelial cell surface when that happens this then causes tight junctions to his disassemble and when that when the disassembly of our tight junctions happens again that's intestinal permeability we can have things going from our gut into our circulation like LPS a lot of this work was pioneered by Dr. Alicia Ofissano at the University of Massachusetts Hospital it is thought that you know so people with celiac disease it's thought that gliatin is the major problem for them because of this this mechanism the the release of zonylin and therefore disassembly of the tight junctions which actually stayed disassembled for quite a long time and allow LPS to then go into circulation and do all the things that we just talked about with people that don't have celiac it's thought that it might be a more transient opening and closing so just to kind of play devil's advocate here what do you think okay well if gluten has gliatin and gliatin is gonna release zonylin and that's gonna disassemble my tight junctions even for 30 seconds like I don't want that right so I mean that's kind of what I'm thinking but again to play devil's advocate when you when you look at some of that observational data and people that are eating whole grains we see that people that are eating whole grains seem to have a lower all-caused mortality for for example compared to people that are not eating it now again as Dr. Robo point out nutritional observational studies are just I mean it's like a disaster for establishing causation and I think I mean I could just point out like ten things but you know with studies like this for one whole grains include a variety of gluten and non-glutin containing proteins the non-glutin ones wouldn't have gliatin so these are things like quinoa buckwheat oats millett you know barley at the other would be okay well then maybe people are eating whole grains are just eating less to respond if we're fine grains and in fact that is the case people are eating whole grains are eating less refined grains and so there's a million there's a million things that you can look at here but at the end of the day it's still it's still kind of makes you go and well maybe you know maybe I shouldn't freak out too much if I have a little bit of gluten and the same goes when you look at for biomarkers of inflammation people that eat whole grains have lower biomarkers of PAI1 and also of C-Ractive protein compared to people that are not eating it but again people that are eating these whole grains in fact if you look at the methods of this section it's all whole grains it's not just gluten containing ones so we know that whole grains are a good source of fermentable fiber for bacteria in the colon and fermentable fiber is then by many bacteria converted into buterate so buterate is a short chain fatty acid it is the major energy source for for colonic sites these are these are the the the the interocytes the gut epithelial cells that I was talking about they're producing about 70% of all the energy for for those cells and so so it there's also been a variety of studies that have shown for example if you if you give buterate to an animal it can prevent LPS leakage and it can prevent the formation of atherosclerosis and animal models that are predisposed to this for example so so buterate produced by bacteria in our gut is actually it's actually a good thing there are a lot of different dietary sources of buterate these better that don't include gluten so pectins for example or a type of fermentable fiber this is found in berries it's found in root vegetables it's found in citrus beta blue cans are really good source of fermentable fiber they're found in mushrooms oats and barley inulin is another source of fermentable fiber it's found in garlic onions and arduchokes and resistance starch is is another source and it's found in green bananas and cooked and then cooled potatoes so these are other dietary sources of fermentable fiber that are known to increase buterate or an also increase buterate producing bacteria in the gut but there's other lifestyle factors that can affect buterate as well so a mega-three fatty acid consumption is able to increase the concentration of buterate producing bacteria in the gut aerobic exercise training can increase the production of buterate producing bacteria in the gut independent of diet and time restricted eating it's also able to increase the production of different types of buterate producing bacteria in the gut because bacteria in our in our intestines are also on our circadian rhythm much like every cell in our body are on our reciprocating rhythm we'll hear a lot about that from doctor's such in panda in a couple of days but time restricted eating basically having the absence of food seeing our gut is important for for basically decreasing you know non-buterate types of producing bacteria and increasing buterate producing types of bacteria in the gut what about dietary fat so if you were to if you were to take this is the studies been done if you take 300 you know calories in the form of a glucose beverage or orange juice or cream heavy cream and you look at first inflammatory biomarkers after consumption of those 300 calories from those beverages or water there's no calories in water inflammatory biomarkers will be elevated in the glucose containing beverage and they'll be elevated in the heavy cream but not the orange juice only they have a cream increases LPS the glucose is not which is very interesting there there are meta analysis that have been done looking at fat and LPS and it seems as though fat can be hard on the gut particularly saturated fat without fiber now does that mean fat is bad no I think that we've established that quite nicely over the last couple of decades I think that if you look at the quality of evidence here you'll see a couple of things one that most of the fat torches used are processed oil they're coconut oil or palm oil and when you look at the high fat studies they're mostly given also with the biscuit or something that's refined carbohydrate and there's enough evidence out there to show that saturated fat in combination with refined carbohydrates seems to really be key for increasing LPS from the gut but I just kind of wanted to point this out because I think as we are kind of shifting there's a metabolic paradigm here where we're learning maybe fat and saturated fat isn't as bad as we thought that we shouldn't just throw everything out there there there are still things to consider and there's a lot of interacting in nuanced factors here and I think that looking at the effect of dietary fat on LPS leakage from the gut is one that we should probably explore more and explore it better so saturated fat and then and then polyunsaturated fat in the form of omega 3 has been shown to lower LPS leakage from the gut in the form of omega 6 like vegetable oil in humans if the vegetable oil is it is heated it increases LPS leakage from the gut but if it's not heated it doesn't seem to have any effect in humans in animal studies it omega 6 will increase LPS leakage from the gut but animal child when the pellets are made it's possible that the omega 6 is heated I mean there's just no telling I think the bottom line is also when you look at some of these studies when you have saturated fat with a fiber matrix the LPS response is blended so it kind of made me like I like cream in my coffee and I was kind of looking through all this literature and the one thing that I really seemed to see consistent was like when you just have fat like just fat like putting butter in your coffee your cream in your coffee like it does seem to be harsh on the gut and a variety of mechanisms have it worked out on that by elacids which are you know increased for the absorption and digestion of dietary fats are you know is one thing that's been shown to basically affect permeability and the fiber actually slows the absorption of the fat much like it does with glucose as well so I do think that I may reconsider putting so much cream in my coffee because that might be affecting my LPS but the other thing is a modified fats seem to be really bad for LPS liquid leakage so this is mean that a ketogenic diet is bad for our gut or is leaking LPS in circulation no there's no evidence of that and in fact there's such profound changes in metabolism when you're in ketosis that it's it's quite I think a good hypothesis that that you know any if there even was LPS leakage that maybe there would be a blunting of the inflammatory responses or in fact like I mentioned in a question to Dr. Row I'm very interested in the production of beta hydroxybeaterate during ketosis and how this may travel perhaps even to the intestines and affect colonist sites and energy metabolism in our gut cells that are helping maintain the gut bear and I would love for anyone to do some experiments on this because I think it's a really interesting and wide open feel that no one's looked into and I honestly if there's any graduate students looking for you know their dissertation hypothesis I think it would be really interesting to look at that so you can buy a mark intestinal permeability a variety of biomarkers in the literature I mentioned so in Yulena big one the lactose manatal ratio directly measures two non-metabolized sugar molecules that are able to permeate your intestinal mark amicosa this is something that a primary care physician can order for anyone I'm actually going to try to get this done now that have really been diving into this literature I'm going to try to do it after a couple of different types of meals that I eat and it seems as though one hour after a meal is when you really get the peak of an LPS response from food so I'm personally going to try this out this is all just me experimenting here so I'm not you know saying that this is going to really tell me much but this is used in the literature lactose-demanatory show is used as a biomarker for intestinal permeability I wanted to get into a mega three because it was quite clear that omega three in human studies and in animal studies seems to blunt the LPS the post-prandial in talks endotoxemia as it's called or the LPS response after a meal and there's been a variety of mechanisms that have been worked out to understand how this is and it seems as though there's there's a few things happening I mentioned already omega three increases buto rate producing bacteria buto rate producing bacteria help prevent intestinal permeability like that's been shown the other thing the other way is that omega three increases the production of something called intestinal alkaline phosphatase or iAP as it shown on the screen so if we're looking again at our our gut barrier what on quote we have our interacites connected by tight junctions the intestinal alkaline phosphatase it does a variety of things one it can it it basically degrades and destroys LPS itself it also changes the LPS producing bacteria in the gut so it seems to to decrease the LPS producing bacteria and then increase the the buto rate producing bacteria so this is another way that omega three may affect inflammation like through a totally different mechanism then all the other mechanisms that we already know about and omega three I just want to spend spend a moment talking about because it's so important and low omega three intake from seafood has been identified as one of the top six preventable causes of death this was this was a big study that was published a few years back out of harbored and omega three there's a variety there's three different sources of it so there's a plant source of it you can find in walnuts or flaxseeds or chia seeds this is alpha-linilitic acid or ALA and then there's omega three that is found in seafood so there's the microbiology but also the fish in all the you know the sea animals and sea creatures that are eating the microbiology accumulates in their and their adipose tissue so there's icosa pentate and you you know iac acid EPA and there's docosa hexate you know iac acid or dHA and so it was the omega three from seafood that was identified as being responsible so basically not getting enough omega three from seafood was that was identified leading to 84,000 deaths a year so 84,000 deaths a year were attributed to low omega three intake from seafood that was comparable to trans fats which was responsible for 82,000 deaths for year literally like the same and if you walk into any grocery store and you look on the shelves like everything's marketed no trans fat this is zero trans fat and everyone knows that trans fats are bad for health and so people it's in the public mind do not eat trans fats and yet omega three intake from seafood was identified to cause the same amount of deaths as trans fat but nobody's thinking about omega three you don't walk into a grocery store and see all the foods we don't have omega three or we do we have it from seafood we are seafood this is fish we have omega three it's really important and i think it's a i really like this because it the way i like to think about food is what we should be eating what do we need to what is the point of eating right we're supposed to be getting nutrients micro nutrients is your essential vitamins minerals fatty acids amino acids which was to be getting these from our food but we're not and instead of focusing focusing so much on what we shouldn't eat we should focus on what we should be eating and honestly when you do that like you don't eat the other stuff it's like well that doesn't contain what i need so i'm not going to eat it and i think it's just a simplified way of looking at diet and it really helps you can always focus on what not to eat and still be deficient in important vitamins and minerals and micronutrients so i really think it's an important way to eat um back to the omega three it's just it's really i think there to me there's overwhelming evidence now that omega three is really important for health so the omega three index this was identified by Dr. Bill Harris and his colleagues the clemenze bond shackie back in 2004 this is the omega three fatty acid level in a red blood cell membrane and it's it's a long term marker of your omega three status compared to something like not what 95% of people measure which is omega three in plasma phospholipids so red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over so they have quite long of a half life and so if you really want to know someone's omega three status you have to measure the right thing otherwise you could be bar marking what they had for dinner a couple of weeks ago and it's like oh i had fish couple of weeks ago and then all of a sudden they're they're marked as someone that's got high omega three so i think this is also a potential for a lot of confounding literature but on top of that again you just we we have to measure the right thing to like get good information right so a high omega three index has been associated with a 90% reduction in sudden cardiac death in the united states the omega three index is about 4% or lower when i say a high omega three index i mean 8% or more so high omega three index is also been associated with a five year increase in life expectancy so people with an omega three index of 8% or more have a five year increase in life expectancy compared to people with a omega three index of 4% or lower interestingly in Japan people have a five year increased life expectancy compared to united states and they also have an omega three index greater than 8% and i want to sort of end my talk with something that sort of blows my mind and i think you guys will find interesting as well and that is that low omega three index a low omega three index of 4% or less was comparable to actually to spew smoking so everyone knows that smoking is bad for health if you look at the red line the red curve here low omega three index and and a smoker had the lowest life expectancy the green the top the highest life expectancy was a high omega three index 8% or more an non smoker but if you look at the orange here that was a smoker with a high omega three had the same life expectancy as a non smoker with low omega three so again omega three seems to be extremely important for health so i'm gonna end my talk with that we talked a lot about intestinal permeability the role of intestinal permeability in cardiovascular health in in in our brain health we talked about the way we feel we talked about lifestyle factors that can regulate it and devils advocate stuff to think about as well and without all say thank you so much for listening and i hope you guys learned something interesting and enjoyable to make thank you so much Rhonda we're gonna open up the floor for questions and we have some questions coming in from the virtual platform so and many of them you you answered during as they're coming in you answered them and but one i think you may have answered but i didn't catch it is there a lab test for circulating lip of polysaccharide or LPS is there a commercially available lab test available that people can utilize to measure this is my mic do i need to stand by this or i'm good okay um so the the there is a lab test for circulating endotoxin and it's notoriously terrible because it's like false positives are so easy so i mentioned the lactolose to maniot manatal ratio that is a much i think more accurate biomarker of intestinal permeability which would i mean directly measuring LPS would be great but until we have a better sensitivity assay i think that it's it's prone to false positivity so i have a question just a button sorry for intestinal permeability we've connected with a group that are using peg 400 as one of the tests so no would like to get your opinion on that i you know i don't know much about that one so i'll say beyond the scope of my knowledge uh you yes have a question um if there's a role with non-steroidal in affecting intestinal permeability great question i don't know the answer i think that's a really interesting in fact there may be literature on it i just am not aware of next please add a couple of comments and a question uh the first to your area of question uh myself as a colleagues published a paper recently where we talked about in part alternative metabolic pathways and interacites and um you see based on the pre-clinical data that we have so far that MCT1 has expressed on the base of lateral membrane of interacites so they can take up ketones from circulation and actually the common pathway with buterate is acetoastylcoate before it goes into the mitochondria so they actually have converging metabolic pathways um so we think that ketones can be used to to fuel interacites um the the second thing what when you're talking about LPS i think what you're really talking about is he co-lion LPS because that's what's used experimentity and it's really good at developing information i do it in my lab i was doing it on Monday um however there's uh you know LPS on any type of granulicative bacterium and there's an increasing body of it's sure that says that actually LPS from various bacteria are directly communicating with the immune system they're immunomodulatory this is our gut talking to us and so just talking about LPS go you know increasing in the blood and that being bad i don't think is is really right um and pretty much everything that we do increases like vetting LPS so you go for a 30 minute jog and you'll increase in testle probitis you'll increase up P.S. and so where that the rubber ready meets the road is in metabolic disease because it's only when you're an insulin resistant that having elevated um LPS is an issue because being insulin resistant the first place increases safely it's an LPS but then you also have a scenario where things like transient increases in LPS like post-prandual endotoxinia you don't have the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of an incidence spike to counteract that and then you're also going to have things like a discord and like protein profile where you can have more small density L.D. L.L.L.L.P.S. is going to bind to and not be cleared so I wonder if we should be focusing less on L.P.S. because we're always going to have someone it's always going to go up intermittently and if we just actually do the things that we know work to improve insulin resistance then that's really going to solve this issue I think that you brought up some really interesting points I think for me the way like looking at the effect of the toll-like receptors and understanding toll-like receptor activation from L.P.S. and I think you know there with anything there's a hormetic stress kind of effect right like you can go exercise and have a little bit of intestinal permeability and it's a type of exercise when you have a whole host of beneficial adaptive responses that are going to counter that you're so your your net effect is going to be lower inflammation right even if toll-like receptors are being activated on immune cells and liver cells and muscle tissue and brain right you know in the microglia for example so I think there's a context is important and so it's not like the same as if you have someone who has you know a chronic low level of constant L.P.S. leakage but I do think that toll-like receptor and looking at the effect of toll-like receptor activation and the chronic insidious type of activation of it is kind of more what I'm you know I think that's kind of connecting them in the sense of the more sort of chronic low grade activation so yeah I think that I think that you brought up really really interesting points and thank you for telling me about about the bed I'd like to be here at do you have time we had time for two more questions maybe mine will be quick is there a reason why someone with intestinal permeability who we treat with a lot of the things that you said and feels better they're so quick often to come back into it versus some people seem to be like they just don't experience intestinal permeability no matter what they either do yeah I mean I think that even getting to the young gentleman's point you know you have a variety of factors that are affecting it and that's kind of why I mentioned with the saturated fat I mean you look in the literature and it's like yep saturated fat intestinal permeability but when you start to dive a little deeper it's like oh but the saturated fat was a certain type of this processed oil and maybe it's the pulmonary acid plus the you know refined carbohydrate or maybe it's the alcohol plus the stress or maybe it's like multiple things in combination with genetics getting to the you know personalized response I mean some people respond terribly to ketogenic diets and some people respond rate so I mean there's always individual variation there's a lot of you know there's a lot of contributing factors to health and so it is it's a hard to just say like there's one villain and there's one like you know what do you call a good guy or hero you

How long can humans live for? Dr. Rhonda Patrick here, and today we're going to talk about longevity. But today, instead of talking about average life expectancy, we're going to talk about maximum lifespan. Since the turn of the 20th century, maximum recorded age at death has risen from 110 to 122. A record held by John Calment of France, which still no one has surpassed since her death in 1997. But theoretically, what is the longest a human could live? Or is there even a limit at all? This question still sparks debate with most falling into three camps. First, that there's a fixed limit to human aging. An age that can never be surpassed, regardless of improvements in medicine and technology. Second, that there's an increasing but hard limit. In other words, an age that cannot be surpassed by someone today, but we could find ways to push higher with medicine and technology in the future. And lastly, that our lives are theoretically unlimited. If that were the case, then given enough time in people, we'd see increasingly older and older ages reached with no ceiling, even if it can still be extremely unlikely that people will reach a certain age. That's a potentially exciting idea. So what is the chance that we'll start to see more super centenarians? Those who reach age 110, or even someone exceeding Kalman's record anytime soon. While these three ideas are still debated, and there are studies showing evidence for each, let's take a look at a pair of recent studies that support the third one. The first study of this pair found that astonishingly, your chance of living for another year at age 110 is the same as at age 120. Let's take a look at how researchers use some clever math to figure this out. There's a big challenge when studying extreme old age, a very small data pool. For example, what are the odds someone makes it from age 110 to 111? There's not a lot of data, which means there's a lot of uncertainty. Going a step further, what if we want to determine the odds of something happening that's never happened before, like a person reaching the age of 130? In other words, we're interested in the very tail end of the survival curve. Age 110 and beyond, the super centenarian zone. Does the curve keep approaching zero without ever hitting it? Which would imply a theoretically unlimited lifespan, or does it eventually hit zero, indicating a hard limit? Since we don't have enough data to answer that question definitively, we have to use statistics to model the tail end. Specifically, something called extreme value theory. Extreme value theory is a branch of statistics used to study incredibly rare events, and it works by fitting a specific type of probability distribution to data points over a certain threshold. Take for example, a thousand year flood. A flood so big it only occurs every thousand years on average. Let's say you were trying to engineer a bridge to survive one of these freak flooding events. So you look back over your 300 years of water level data, but come up against a problem. That data is very unlikely to contain anything as large as a thousand year flood. You'd need about 4,000 years of data to have a 98% chance that it contains a thousand year flood. That's where extreme value theory comes into play. It helps engineers and scientists estimate the probability of events more extreme than any we've previously observed. Fluds, earthquakes, traffic jams, market crashes, and of course aging. In this case, it's applied to a number called the force of mortality. While the more commonly used age-specific probability of death describes the chance you'll die over a period of time, force of mortality uses calculus to describe someone's susceptibility to dying at any given moment. This is important because when studying extreme old age, we don't just want to know how the risk of dying changes each year, but also over the course of each year. Force of mortality is much more granular. It's value isn't really what's important for this study. Rather, the key is how it's changing. As adult age, we generally see the force of mortality and probability of death slowly increasing. If human lifespan was limited, we'd expect to see the force of mortality rise higher and higher, approaching infinity at the age limit, which would look something like this. But what researchers found was that instead, the force of mortality flattens out after age 110, looking like this. And that flat graph is the big finding here. While the force of mortality does increase in old age, this analysis finds that by age 110, your chance of surviving another year levels off at around 47%. Like flipping a coin every year. In other words, there doesn't seem to be an upper limit to how old someone could live, but the chances of your coin flip coming up heads every time start to get pretty slim before long. And interestingly, researchers didn't see any statistically significant differences between sex, genetic background, diet, or other lifestyle factors for 110 to 115-year-old's either. But there's a big caveat to this. Remember, the sample size, unsurprisingly, is very small. There were only 566 lifespans used for the model, and only nine of those reached their 115th birthdays. So we're making predictions about ages that very few people have ever lived to. Okay, so that answers one big question. But what about the likelihood that we'll see people surpass age 120, or even higher ages in the next century? The second study I want to talk about builds off the last one by running a forecast using the unlimited but short model, and taking population projections into account. Researchers projected forward to the year 2100, and found that the current maximum age record still held by John Kalman will almost certainly be broken by the end of this century. However, it seems unlikely that anyone will live beyond age 135 in that time. Over the next few decades, we should start to see whether this model continues to hold up as more data comes in. If the model is accurate, we'll begin to see more validated super centenarians that fit the model. However, this is just one model, and there are many others out there that show different results. While the research into maximum lifespan is fascinating from a theory point of view, you're probably more interested in how you yourself can reach a healthy old age. Many scientists are hard at work trying to increase the human lifespan and health span, which could also increase the number of people who reach super centenarians' status. To get there, one of the best bet seems to be on finding ways to reduce the burden of chronic inflammation, and identify lifestyle factors that improve metabolic health. Researchers have different ideas of where we should be focusing on our efforts, but there are some promising technologies on the horizon that may slow or even reverse some markers of aging. One I'm particularly excited about is interrupted cellular reprogramming. This technology utilizes the Yamunaka factors, for transcription factors that play a role during embryonic development. When the Yamunaka factors are added to adult cells, they can reset an adult cell to become a pluripone stem cell, and revert the cell to an embryonic light state. Interrupted cellular reprogramming, which has been demonstrated in mice, involves transiently pulsing these factors, so that rather than reversing to an embryonic state, this cells regenerate and seem to become younger. To sum up, there's a lot of exciting research right now into aging and maximum lifespan, and one possibility is that our lifespans may in fact be theoretically unlimited, even if practically short. But that said, we've really just scratched the surface of this topic, and other research has suggested that there could be a fixed limit. As time goes on, more data will mean we can continue to refine and improve these and other models. And in the meantime, researchers are continuing to focus on ways to not only reach greater ages, but also reach old age while maintaining health. I'm Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and I'll catch you next time.

Welcome back, everyone. I'm really excited to be sitting here with Dr. Morgan Levine, who is an assistant professor at Yale. Her research focuses on understanding the science of aging. She uses biomephorematics to quantify the aging process using something called epigenetic aging clocks, which we are going to talk about in great detail today. Her research really aims to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the aging process with the hope of potentially testing interventions, whether they're lifestyle or pharmacologic, that can perturb the aging process. And I say perturb, I mean, maybe slow. So she's also a principal investigator at Altost Labs, which is a new biotech company that also aims to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the aging process. Again, with the hope of possible having interventions that could slow aging. So, again, I'm super excited to be here. It's really great to meet you in person. I've been following your research over the years. You were a postdoctoral training in one of my favorite scientists, Dr. Steve Horbeth, his lab, and we've had him on the podcast, talking about epigenetic aging clocks. Before, so I was thinking to start this off, we could start talking about aging more as a concept. And maybe you can explain to people, how a differentiate between age as a number. So chronological aging versus biological aging, phenotypic aging, and functional aging. Yeah, so I think even in the field of aging, there isn't a good definition for what, where we're actually talking about when we're saying we're working on aging. I think most people in the public think of aging in terms of just chronological time. So whatever age or driver's license says or your passport, but really what we care about is the thing that we would call biological aging or even phenotypic or functional aging. And that is all the changes that your body undergo as a function of this time, usually. So aging in our society is a kind of a negative connotation, but it's not the years you've been alive. It's actually the problem. It's kind of how your body has changed over that time. And not everyone's body changes in the same degree or at the same pace. So that's the really important thing. Is can we figure out what's changed, how that's cano effect your risk of disease, your functioning ability, or any of these things? So as you mentioned, we can talk about this in terms of biological age. So we can measure it in terms of molecules and cells, how those have changed in your body. We talk about maybe phenotypic or functional, which I think is kind of how the stuff you can feel in seeing your body are you able to run a mile as quickly as you used to or get up a flight of stairs. And these are the things that people actually worry about losing over their life course. And it's really important to try and quantify these. So we can understand what drives these changes and potentially how you would slow that, or hopefully some people are interested in even reverse it. As you mentioned, people do think about chronologically age often. For me, when I think about aging, I often will think about functional aging. I think it's more personal for me. I'm worried about becoming demented or losing my cognitive function or as you said, I'm not able to walk as well. I'm just physically declining. But as a scientist, biological aging is much more interesting because it's more fundamental, would you agree? Yeah, and it's really where we think it all starts. So we kind of take a perspective of what we would consider these biological levels of organization. So you have all the molecules and atoms in your body that kind of feed into cells that make up tissues that make up whole-organ systems and then the whole organism. And we think the aging process all these changes are starting at these lower levels. So you have changes in molecules and cells. But we don't see that until you feel it at these higher levels until you feel weaker muscles or you're not thinking as well as you used to. And that's really once it's reached a certain level. But if we talk about understanding what's driving these and where to intervene, you have to do it at the lower levels. If you want to affect all those things that we see and feel every day. So there's some pretty well-defined hallmarks of aging. And as you know, these are things like genomic instability, telomere, shortening, cellular senescence might a conjure this function, epigenetic alterations, nutrient sensing problems or dysfunction, stem cell depletion. So there's quite a few of these hallmarks that are sort of accepted within most of the scientific community as the drive, to gather seem to drive the aging process in a way, as you mentioned at the molecular level, cellular level. I'm sort of curious what your thoughts are on what some of the major, what you think, some of the major drivers of aging are, caveats included, or why it's important to really understand what those drivers do the aging are. Yeah, I think there's a big push in the field to figure out what's causal in aging. What are the things that are changing that are really pushing this aging process in driving all the other changes? And I don't think we have a good idea about that. You know, what's actually causal verse just correlated that's just an outcome of aging that we can observe. In my lab, we're really interested in epigenetics. And that's mostly because I think of the epigenetic system as the operating system of a cell. So most of the cells in your body have essentially the same DNA, but what makes something a neuron or brain cell or a skin cell is the epigenetic program. So it gives a cell's the ability to respond to stress. It gives an almost their kind of physical form. And all of the things that they are supposed to do, the problem is that this program gets completely rewritten with aging. And we don't know exactly why, whether it's errors, or whether it's just the program kind of having glitches along the way. But we think that this then produces cells that are not adapting correctly to their environment or maybe doing things they shouldn't be doing. And potentially, this is something we think might cause aging, although there's still some debate on whether it's truly causal in the aging process. And I would say no one really knows yet what the true causes are. Can you, since your research really does focus on the epigenetic alterations, can you explain to people what epigenetic aging clocks are? Yep, generally speaking. And then maybe we can get into some of the differences between the first generation, epigenetic aging clocks or the earthquake clock, and then second generation, like Levine, or a few new age of the time. So we also call them Grim age. So, yep, absolutely. So there are a bunch of different types of epigenetic modifications, but the type that these clocks are based on is something called CPG methylation or DNA methylation. And really what that means is you can look across one strand of DNA, and we know we have ACG and T. But you have these regions which we call CPG sites. And that's where you basically just have a C right next to a G. And these tend to be located in specific regulatory regions of the genome. But what happens is the CPGs can become methylated. Some of them are supposed to be methylated from the beginning. But what we find with aging is that the ones that we expect to have methylation lose methylation with aging, and the ones that shouldn't have methylation gain methylation with aging. And the methylation in this is basically turning on our off different parts of your genome. So when you have methylation, we can essentially assume that part is repressed. So that wherever it is in the genome is not accessible, you're not expressing the genes in that region. First, when you remove the methylation, we consider this more an active region. So epigenetic clocks look across either hundreds or hundreds of thousands of these sites. And just say, does the pattern of whether you have methylation or not resemble someone of a given age typically? So we would say, oh, your pattern looks like someone who is 40 years old, even though maybe your 50 years old chronologically. And what we find is that kind of difference is biologically meaningful. What do you think the major advantages of using these epigenetic aging clocks are in terms of their use? Yeah. Yeah. So people have been really interested in this idea of quantifying biological aging or estimating biological aging. Because again, chronologically, just an imperfect proxy of this process that we're actually that we actually care about, that is why people get diseases when they get older, why people die when they get older. So if you can actually quantify the process as best as possible, it's better than chronologically age. But there's been some disagreement on the types of data, or the types of markers that you could use to do that. Some people think we should look at just clinical markers and those are useful. But for me, the exciting thing about epigenetic clocks and measuring DNA methylation for this is that you can use the exact same clock across almost any tissue type and almost any cell types. So I can compare aging in, again, skin to aging and brain, using the exact same measure. And I don't think there's any other type of biomarker that you could do that with. What about the differences in these clocks with respect to the original horde of clocking and you can see that you're about versus the one that you develop with your mentor or Steve Horbath with respect to phenotypcaging and the tip of age clock at grim age, like what are some of the major differences in those clocks in terms of their predictive power? Yep. So the original clocks were used. So when you develop these clocks or train these clocks, we use machine learning. So we're usually trying to predict something. So you take all your methylation dating, say, how can I predict whatever this is? And the original clocks use chronological age. So the idea is, can I look at methylation and predict someone's chronological age? And so, again, that's kind of this idea of the pattern of someone who's this age. But we know, again, chronological age is an imperfect proxy of this process for actually trying to quantify. So with the second generation clocks the one that we published in 2018 was the first example as we said, oh, can we come up with a better thing to try and kind of tune these measures to? So in that case, we used kind of normal lab tests that we combined into a measure that was predictive of mortality and then we trained a predictor of those lab tests. And similar thing was done with the grim age clock where they took these different proteins and they trained predictors of that and then trained the predictor of mortality. So we think that something that captures mortality or health span or kind of physiological decline is going to be a better thing to tune these clocks to than just chronological age. How do these epigenetic age and clocks more, I think, more specifically, the second generation ones that the pheno age one that you mentioned or the grim age, compare to measuring biological age to be some of these clinical biomarkers, so HB and one C, your cholesterol, lung function, like the classical things that people are measuring to measure biological age. And of course, I think a similar question would be also mortality risk as well. How do they compare in terms of their predicted power in the second generation? So if you're measuring the epigenetic clock in blood, I would actually say that they're on par with not the individual clinical lab tests. So they're going to be more predictive than if I just look at HB A1C or just like a cholesterol. But we can also combine these clinical tests into a single kind of risk measure, which is what we do with pheno age. And then I would say they're actually on par with that. The advantage of epigenetic clocks is, again, you can get a different measure for different tissues or cells in your body. So the blood test, these clinical tests, you'll get one measure, one biological age measure out of them. But for the epigenetic clocks, we can measure your skins, age, or if you had a biopsy, you can measure different organs age. So even though people usually just use a men's blood, they have a lot more potential just to compare kind of how different organs systems are aging. A kind of, that was kind of my next question a bit is that as you know, people are age-a-different rates, but even within an individual, their organs can be aging at different rates as well. And there's been work from Dr. Mike Snatter who we had on the podcast, not too long ago, who, and are here familiar with his work, showing that some people are metabolic ages, so they're liver and their kidneys, and they may age quicker. Some people are cardiac ages, whether they seem to be more risk for having heart problems, or there could be a immune ageer, so their immune system is, and they're more susceptible to pathogens and stuff with age. So if you were to measure like a blood sample from a person using, you know, with the epigenetic clocks pick up that, or is it more like a, is it measuring more of the system's level type of aging? So the current ones are not gonna capture more this multi-dimensionality in aging, and I'm a huge fan of Mike Snatter's work, and actually is kind of influencing some of the work that we're doing now. So what we're actually trying to do now is to build clocks that are proxying aging in different organ systems. So these aren't out yet, but the idea is that if you can build a clock that's going to essentially try and proxy what you're brain aging is, or you're liver aging, you're kidney aging, then you can have multiple kind of epigenetic age estimates and really understand more of the profile of a person. And so yeah, it's kind of getting back to this idea of age-year types. We both age at a different rate from each other, but also in a different way, right? So I might diverge more down this way and be more of a metabolic age or whatever it is, and someone else might be more of a new major, and understanding that is gonna give people both, potentially insight into what interventions might be, the most helpful for them, and also what they might be most at risk for. Right. Mortality risk is a big one that you see with what grim age, and even I think a few know age as well. How does that, like how well do they predict mortality risk and even disease specific mortality, like cancer mortality risk for you? And how do they compare to like a frailty risk, or a frailty index measurement, or something like that where you can also measure mortality risk? Yeah, so they're actually pretty powerful when it comes to mortality risk. And I would say right now, grim ages, the best in terms of predicting what we would consider all cause mortality. So basically, any mortality risk all combined together. Grim ages particularly good at cardiovascular risk mortality, which is why it does well at all cause mortality, because that's the biggest killer of people, at least in the United States. But I think in terms of predicting more specific types of mortality, someone might be more or less at risk for I think this is where you need more these systems measures. But there are pretty powerful at predicting kind of remaining life expectancy or all cause mortality. Of course they can't predict too, it's gonna get hit by a boss or whatever, but in terms of kind of population averages, are you more or less likely than someone else, with the same chronological age to have early mortality, they're actually pretty good at that? What about in the young people? So it's really fascinating because when I think about mortality risk, I think of like an older person going in doing a battery of test, getting all their blood worked on, and trying to do their grip strength, and breathing to do that, you know, and I think about, so I think about more of things that are being measured and aggregated together to come up with this fairly triviality index. But for someone who's younger, like in their 30s, like in they go and do all this stuff, like I don't know that it's really gonna be a good predictor of the mortality, and they're young, they've got pretty good lung function. You know what I mean? Is this where a grim age may shot? Like if you have a 30 year old or 25 year old, then they do their grim age, does it like accurately predict mortality rates? Yeah, so we don't have these really, really long follow-up studies, but at least the preliminary data seems that it's gonna be much better for young people, because exactly as you said, these functional things are gonna have what we consider either a floor ceiling effect. So for most people of below some certain age, they're all gonna perform well on it. They're not at a level where they're seeing dysfunctional decline, yet, which goes back to this idea of biological age, versus functional age. Whereas the epigenetic-clopture, meant to capture more of this biological molecular cellular aging that we think will eventually feed into that. So if you can say, oh, you're aging faster at a molecular level, then we'd expect, we'll also expect you down the road, probably to have these functional manifestations earlier, even if we can't see them yet. So I totally agree. In younger people, when these things haven't really emerged, this is kind of the only way to kind of proxy who might be heading in that direction. Totally. I mean, you can't look in the mirror and go, I've got more DNA damage today, like, you know, exactly not, like, but you could be. And lifestyle factors do you play a role and you could have someone who is in their, 30s and they're just sort of just living a hard life. Perhaps they wouldn't pick up on those sort of functional declines yet, but this is where something that is more measuring something biological, you know, at the molecular level, that is going to kind of open their eyes. So, but I kind of wanted to shift gears and talk a little bit about this epigenetic age acceleration. I mean, we've been sort of talking about how people age at different rates. I think you were a co-author on one of those, one of the studies, like a few years back, that was one of the big ones that came out where it was like, people aged at different rates and there was like 18 biomarkers that were looked at and I think it was P&A asked for something that came out. Oh yeah, the Bellscape paper, yes. Yes. And it was like, look at people are aging at different rates and you can even look at their faces and it correlates with their biological age more than their chronological age. So, to me, you know, clearly there's lifestyle factors and environmental factors that play role in the way you age. Can you explain to people what epigenetic age acceleration is and what some of the most robust biological environmental prop social causes of epigenetic age acceleration are? Yeah, so we usually use this term age acceleration to just mean kind of the discordance between your chronological age so that age you know that you are and your predicted age based on whether it's grim age or phenoage or any of these epigenetic clocks. And that, again, is we think it's biologically meaningful. So someone who's predicted much older than they are chronologically are people who are higher risk for disease or mortality. And so, you know, the next question is why are some people predicted older and other people are predicted younger? And a lot of people think I was just gin that. I, you know, maybe my family is just high risk. But actually, it seems to have very little impact on your epigenic age. So I think they estimate like 10, maybe at the upper most 20% impact. Your genes have that kind of impact on your epigenic age rate and actually probably the majority of it is environmental lifestyle. And when we look, again, these are not clinical trials looking at epidemiological data. So just saying, in the population, the people who are predicted to be older, people are predicted to be under what are their characteristics. We find things that are not surprising. So socioeconomic status is a big thing in terms of differences in epigenic age, but also behaviors, so smoking really accelerates your epigenic age. Generally, exercise will tend to decrease epigenic age, eating, we think, probably plant-based diet is going to decrease epigenetic age. And then, yeah, a lot of the things don't drink heavily, get good qualities, sleep, minimize stress, all the things that everyone's mother and grandmother told them to do in life. How does the male being a male affect epigenetic age? Because males live on average for years. Their life stands like four or so years short. So are there females, right? Yes, that reflected in it. Yeah, it is reflecting epigenic. So on average, not again, not across the board, but if you look at the distributions, females on average will have slower epigenic age than same age, same chronological. Similar question. Females undergo menopause when they reach like 50s or something like that. Plus or minus, I don't know how many years. But how does menopause affect epigenetic aging? Yeah, so this is actually a study I did while I was in Singapore of Athlab. So we looked at women who undergone menopause and how long since they had gone undergone menopause. And it seems to be that menopause is actually an epigenic aging accelerated event. So before menopause, women are doing pretty well. And then when they go through menopause, it seems to accelerate their epigenic age. And we didn't have the kind of data you would want where we'd have the same women pre-imposed. But we can even look at surgical menopause. And that seems to also show this kind of accelerated epigenic aging kind of manifestation. That kind of leads me into another question, which is does the changes in these methylation patterns that you and others are measuring? Does it, is it pretty stable over the lifespan or are they like, once you hit mid-life? Because there's functional aging that really starts to get you start to get mid-life and then it starts to go down. So does the epigenetic clock mirror that? Or is it pretty stable? So it's not stable, but it actually doesn't mirror what we think of in terms of functional aging. So if you think of a frailty index or even more cloudy risk, it increases exponentially after, let's say, age 30. The epigenic clock show a totally different pattern. It's still not linear, but actually most of the changes happened during development. So you have this huge increase in epigenic age between, we can even measure it in fetal samples. And then it kind of starts becoming more linear in study around age 20. And then interestingly, it actually slows down again in very late, so after let's say age 80. We don't know why these patterns look this way, but yeah, it's not perfectly stable across the life course. OK, this leads to a couple of other questions. That sort of came in my mind. One is then what about when people get disease dates? So they do get tetrodite babies. And we're in cardiovascular disease. Does that then being in that disease stay functional, decline, like state? Does that accelerate the aging clock? So I don't know if we actually know that, because we don't have very good, the problem with epigenic data right now is we don't have good kind of time course data. We're not following people longitudinally. There are very few studies that do this. There are more studies that are starting to. But I don't think we've reached the point to say, I can look at someone's epigenic aging pre-deseed state and then see what happens after they've developed some disease. But I would imagine that it would probably kind of snowball and mix accelerating. We do know not looking at epigenetics that once you get a disease, it's actually shorter time to each subsequent disease. So there does seem to be this kind of accelerating event in aging that occurs. Biobank data might be a good source. They do a lot of, you know, like they've got just tons and tons of samples that are, you know, because they have people come in for like routine. Yep. So we've talked to them. The problem is that the epigenic data is not super cheap. So you know, to do that many people, that many times. Yeah, they have to come up with quite a bit of funding to be able to be able to be able to be able to be. It would be interesting. Yeah, no. I'm all for this. The more the more data samples we can get, I think the better will be able to figure this all out. Right. You also mentioned that the most of the changes are happening during development. And this is also really interesting. Mostly. Steve, when Dr. Steve Horbat was on the podcast last time. And this kind of gets into the next section, which is like underlying mechanisms causing these changes in the epigenetic patterns. But he had mentioned that like he had developed at least, you know, back, maybe there's something new now, but back back then, a few years ago, there was a few clocks that he had used that could really beautifully measure gestational age. And which was interesting because measuring the aging process during gestation where you've got this really coordinated program that has very little background noise. You're not inflammatory processes aren't going off in all the damage. And the other stuff, I mean, it's just a very clean place to like measure aging. So, and then he's also, I think there's a pre-printed saw, pretty recently, where he had developed a universal aging clock. And then, now, yeah, like there was like, I don't know how many different mammalian samples that were used to generate the clock. And I don't understand everything since it's generating. But I just looked at, you know, skimmed it. And it was really talking about this universal clock was also really coordinated with development. And so, you're mentioning development. It kind of makes me, it poses the question. Like, do you think that the epigenetic aging could be a sort of develop, like a program, like a program that's regulating aging? Like is that a possibility? Yeah, I don't think it was a program designed, you know, some people would argue that is, you know, a program designed to drive aging because they think, you know, for species selection, you need things to age and die, so the species can range. I think it's a developmental program that just doesn't really get turned off, and maybe goes a little bit a rye. As all these other changes start to accumulate in our bodies. But yes, the epigenetic clocks are really tracking something very central to development, because most of these changes we can see during development and a lot of the genes that seem to be involved are these developmental genes. We're still, again, not sure what this means or what this program actually is, but it definitely is tied to development. But people would also argue that aging is very tied to development, so there are beautiful experiments and flies, where if you can extend kind of the developmental period, it extends the lifespan of these animals. And so development and aging aren't kind of two dichotomous things that we usually think of right that you're going through development, you hit age 20, maybe age 20 or 30 to when you're aging starts. But there's a lot of great work, even one of my colleagues at Harvard, the Dean Glattish, I was showing kind of when he thinks this ground zero when aging starts, which is according to him day eight of gestations. So there's in humans, in humans, yes. So when you said, in flies and fruit flies, there's a lot of people who are probably not. When they extend the development, can you explain that? What do you mean by that? Yeah, so I think in this case, actually, this study, I'm thinking they extended kind of the reproductive age of the flies so they can push flies to what we consider like a late for Kennedy so they can continue to develop a little bit longer and don't reproduce till slightly later. And how do they do that later? It was more like selection. So there's selecting for flies over generations that are going to be these later for Kennedy flies and they show that they also live longer and do they do genetic? Like is it a genetic? Yeah. Exactly. So there are a couple of things here that back to this, it's very interesting, the development thing. And another thing came to mind from the conversation I would Steve was he had mentioned, like if you take a cell that has not been immortalized in physical culture, and then you immortalize it with a component of telomerase term. And you essentially overcome cellular senescence, which is one of the hallmarks of age. Right, when a cell goes senescence, I mean, it's pretty much not. I mean, it's still metabolically active, but it's considered sort of the end. And these cells, if you continue culture in them, in tissue culture, and they're just epigenetic age, just keeps going, yeah, going and going. Yeah, we're actually doing this exact thing in my lab right now, where we use H-Turt to immortalize cells, and we are just seeing how long. Like there has to be some saturate. Like eventually, can it just continue to change forever? I think two people haven't looked at things like hella cells, which have just been changing. They've been evolving for decades. And at what point does the epigenic age kind of reach a saturation point? And again, I don't think we know. But yeah, definitely with these immortalized cells, with every time you pass it to them, they're at the epigenic age keeps, at least it seems to continue to increase over time. It's interesting. And sort of on the flip side of that would be, like you mentioned, the epigenetic age in clocks, biomarking, something else that's causing aging. And a study that you were a co-author on. I was kind of, as I was preparing for this podcast, I was thinking about it, and I was thinking, well, in my mind, I was like, well, what, how could you cause something like that would be massive damage to accelerate aging in soy? I googled chemotherapy, epigenetic clock, and like, paper, or co-author came up on it. I was like, oh, this is in Morgan's on it. So I was reading the paper. And these patients that had head and neck cancer, and they were getting treated for it, radio therapy, chemotherapy, they were treated, which causes massive damage, inflammation, these patients, their epigenetic age was measured before the treatment, after the treatment, and then six months later in a year later. And it was so interesting to me because they had aged, like, their epigenetic age had accelerated by 4.9 years right after the treatment. But then six months later, and a year later, their epigenetic age had to like normalize back to baseline. And a subanalysis then showed, actually, not only did the epigenetic age acceleration of almost five years, correlate with inflammatory biomarkers, but people that were that had extremely high biomarkers one year later did still experience the age acceleration. So I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on what that means, to me, I mean, to me, I look at that and I go, wow, inflammation is causing epigenetic age acceleration. You can see this graph, right? I mean, yeah. Yeah, I think definitely we measure aging in blood, way to think, you know, what is probably driving these signals that we see. And I would guess that avigenic age acceleration blood is mostly reflective of inflammation, unless again, you're developing a clock that's specifically tuned to some other thing. Although inflammation seems so, you know, vast and systemic it affects so many different things. But I don't think everything that epigenic clocks are capturing is inflammation, because again, when you look at immortalized cells, it's not because they're becoming more inflammatory every time you're pastaging them per se. But definitely, I think avigenic aging measured in blood is very much tied to inflammation, which again, is probably why it's highly predictive of a number of diseases, which we know inflammation can be a major driver of. Is that where the extrinsic and intrinsic aging clock, or exactly one of them considers the external factors in blood and one does anything, yeah, inflammation calculated in that are not really, is it sort of? Yeah, so these are two of the first generation clocks. So I think Steve kind of called them intrinsic extrinsic aging. I think he called the original Horvath Pan tissue clock was the intrinsic aging. It wasn't that tuned to differences in kind of cell turnover or inflammation. Whereas a clock, he that it was developed by HANUM at all, he kind of added these different kind of cell composition measures that actually ended up picking up inflammation a little bit better. But this was before these second generation clocks came into being. And then I think once they came into being, they're probably picking up inflammation a lot more than even the first generation clocks. And again, we can make these kind of systems clocks. And one of our systems is inflammation. And it is, we can show that it's highly, it's highly predictive of outcomes. It's definitely capturing things related to inflammation, but similarly, I can say we have data from individuals with COVID. And we can look at the inflammation measure. And we find that people with severe symptoms have much more accelerated inflammation at PGAC clock than people would basically asymptomatic or miles symptoms. It would be interesting to see when those symptoms resolve and how long it takes a person to let go back to more of their baseline. Yep, ever, hopefully. Yeah. But so that's definitely, are you guys going to continue looking at that? Yeah, I mean, we don't have the ability to track the same people over time, but I think this is an important thing. And I think this is important when people start to look at applications with the clocks for intervention testing, because you can do an intervention that's going to change kind of your blood cell composition. And it might be reflective of inflammation, but it could be this acute event, right? And whether that really means you change your aging, I think, is still needs to be kind of considered. Yeah, and that was the big eye opener for me when I read the study, I don't know a couple days ago, and it wasn't a new study, but it was like, oh, well, this change really dramatically, but then it wasn't like a permanent thing. Yeah. It was something that went back. And so, yeah, it's almost likely that you're staying with interventions. It's like, well, I mean, make sure you didn't get sick or like, you know, when sick, like, to early before, you know, measuring. And we can talk about that in a little bit later, but I kind of, to get sort of just back into the cause and effect of aging, and if the epigenetic clock changes are really causal, I mean, of course, you're obviously trying to figure that out. But even if it was, let's say, downstream of something, if it was biomarking aging, what, like the epigenetic changes that are happening with aging, you kind of mentioned this early, early in the podcast about how, you know, they're clustering in gene regulatory regions. And so they're changing the way genes are turned on or turned off. Like, is there like a feed forward loop in aging? Where it's like, okay, now these epigenetic changes are turning off genes that we want on to repair damage and they're turning on genes that are cellular synesis. You know, so it's like accelerating this feed forward loop. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely possible. I think it's, yeah, it's really hard to figure out causality here, right? Like, and it could be that, you know, I mean, my perspective is not there's a cause of aging, right? And you know, it's this thing and once you fix that, everything else will go away. I mean, so many things go wrong. And your system can change. It can diverge and so going back to kind of, my excited or saying, even if you bring that down to the molecular level, there's so many different ways that someone's system can kind of change over time. And I don't think it's like, you just need to, it's just this one thing that's going to then drive all of aging. And yeah, it, you know, our systems are responsive, right? So one thing changes something else is going to respond and that can be maladaptive, which would, you know, snowball things. So yeah, I think it's going to be hard to figure out like what's causal, what's correlative, but I would say even if it's not the, what some people might consider the central driver, as long as it's picking up things that are critical to aging and you can use that to track, aging or understand it a little bit better, I think it still has utility. I don't know if it needs to be kind of the central cause of aging for it to be useful. Right. Exactly, if you can, if you can track it and or use it for basic science, you know, to understand the processes better. But with some of these genes, like, I'm just curious, do they know, like, it has research shown, or research and other shown that, like, you know, we are seeing as the epigenetic clock ages, we are seeing more genes that are regulating like NFCAPB return on, you know, like, quantum or inflammation. So it's not necessarily the cause of aging, but it's helping accelerate it when you start, as you start to accumulate these epigenetic changes as they start to, yeah. Yeah, so the hard thing has actually been looking at the genes that these CPGs are assigned to or that they color, okay, with. And actually, that's been a little bit less clear because the methylation patterns are not as we might expect correlating with the expression patterns. And there's a number of reasons I could be, it's cause we're looking at lots of cells in the population. You need to look within an individual cell to actually get a C-Vis. It could be, you know, there are other epigenetic modifiers that could also be important in this. So it's not a one to one. But we can just look at general gene expression that epigenetic clocks are associated with, and, you know, it does seem, you can kind of find certain pathways as seem to be important. And some of these are inflammatory or other aging pathways that we'd kind of expect. But yeah, we still don't know exactly what the CPGs that are in these clocks are functionally doing. Even though we say, oh, I actually said it, in the beginning of this talk, when you have methylation, it's repressive, when you don't, it's active. But it seems like it's actually a lot more complicated. And one thing that I always come back to is I can make a clock out of a few hundred CPGs that are in specific genes. I can remove all of those genes and remake a new clock, and I can get the same clock from a totally different set of genes. I don't know what that means in terms of understanding the functionality of what we're trying to capture, but I think it just exists as not as simple as these 20 genes are turned on and these 20 genes are turned off. Right. A lot more to learn. Epigenetic age reversal. Mm-hmm. That's a big interest, of course. And I'm curious about your recent, like some of your thoughts on some of the, there's been some recent studies. So we were talking about programming, you're talking about, in a way, right, with the developmental program and epigenetic clock sort of really tracking that. Yeah. Well, being part of that in some way connected, we don't really, I don't exactly understand why. You know, if it's known, but I don't think anyone else. Okay, so some of this work with interrupted cellular reprogramming or the partial reprogramming that's called, a lot of that works coming from one Carlos Montes, where they can, maybe you can explain, like, what this is to people and how that affects epigenetic aging or what's known or not known. Yeah. So this really came out of work originally from Shinyo Yamunaka, who discovered what we call these Yamunaka factors, which are four transcription factors, we just call them OSKM, which when expressed, you can actually take a somatic, so an adult cell and convert it back into what looks like an embryonic stem cells. So we call these induced polyputin stem cells, and then you can use those to make a number of different types of cells, but the interesting thing and why aging researchers got really invested in this science is that not only are you making it embryonic like in terms of its stem cell properties, but the epigenetic clocks are seem to be almost completely reverse. And we've actually shown recently the not completely reverse, but you can take a skin cell that has an epigenic age of 40 and do this, it takes a few weeks to do and basically get back to an epigenic age of zero in those cells. And you keep it at the skin cell, it doesn't lose its identity. No, so it loses its identity in the universe. So this full, this is considered kind of this full epigenic reprogramming, and then what one kind of small montaine, others have done, is look at this idea of partial reprogramming. So can we push the cell back a little bit because actually what we find is that this age reversal happens first prior to the cell losing its identity. So can you do that part without pushing it all the way back or we consider up or down the landscape to this blurry potent stem cell? So can I just make an old skin cell a young skin cell, but it still is soon so. So that's the goal. And with some of the recent work, at least out of his lab, they're using a premature aging mass model, a perjury model and have shown, I know there's a new publication that haven't read just came out. Yeah, the older one, the first one, 2016 or something, cell paper, I remember, they showed in multiple different organs, it seemed to reverse some of the hallmarks of aging, and that organs were performing functionally a little bit younger than you would imagine, and at least in this premature aging mass model. And I think even health span of this mass model that's prematurely aging, it seemed to be improved. And what that means for humans that are not mice with premature aging syndromes was to be determined, but the epigenetic clock also was also reversed as well. Yeah, and I think the new publication which is done in more of a wild type, not a perjury or mice, now it's just that show kind of some reversal of the epigenic clock. And you can do this just cells in a dish. We can partially reprogram them and show reversal of epigenic clock and other functional improvements in the cells. So, to you, what does that mean? Like, that you could do that? Yeah. Now, I mean, I think this is the most fascinating thing. Again, I don't know in terms of translation, like actually making this with therapeutic, and I don't even think people were at the point that they were speculating. But yeah, I just think it's so amazing. I mean, even the original thing that you can take, a skin cell and turn it into an embryonic cell and just we always think of, this is one direction. Cell cells are going to only move what we consider this landscape in terms of their states. And they can only go from this state to that state. The idea that it can go back, I think, is amazing. And I think just understanding how that process works. And then the other thing we're really interested in is what are the features of this program cell? Does it truly look like a young cell? Or is it a totally different type of cell that in nature maybe we haven't even seen? And what does that mean for how it's going to function? And to respond? The questions I have on my mind are, okay, well, you take this, you know, 40-year-old skin cell, as you mentioned. And let's say you're going to completely reprogram it to a stem cell and your epigenetic age goes back. But like, what happens to all the damage in my to-country? Are they still there? Like, what about the pieces of DNA that, you know, is that stuff still there? Like, where does it go? I mean, it's a go-about if it does. The exciting thing is actually the mitochondria, it seems to also be kind of rejuvenated. I mean, I don't really like that term rejuvenated. But it seems to be kind of set back to a better functioning state, really. And again, it's not clear how all these things are linked to each other. I think the other question, though, is cells also build up, kind of these aggregates and other nasty kind of by-products, they accumulate what happens to them. I don't think I know that. But it's an important thing, I think, to figure out. So if the epigenetic clock lets, you know, because it's controlling gene expression, you know, it's like, well, maybe the nuclear and coded mitochondrial proteins, maybe everything's just bouncing back to how it was. And so you're making, you know, you're building better mitochondria, right? I mean, yeah, I have something called to argue that it starts with a mitochondria getting rejuvenated and then that's how everything else. But yeah, I think that's how it's about the marks of aging in mitochondrial dysfunction is what's first. I mean, or, as you mentioned, it's probably not just one thing. It's a combination of all these factors together combined where your proteins are misfolding and you're mitochondria dysfunctioning and your DNA damage is accumulating. And so, yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating area and the programming part, like, it's just, I was just curious what your thoughts are in terms of the basic science. What does that mean? To me, it goes back to again that program, like there's something going on. We don't quite understand, but it's something. Yeah, this comes back to this whole idea that I don't think what we see with aging is just random, stochastic damage or errors. I think we've always thought of aging is just a accumulation of errors. But it really might just be a program that kind of goes wrong and there's nothing evolutionarily that needs to prevent it from doing that because it doesn't benefit. You know, fitness to prevent that program from going wrong. But the idea that it can be reprogrammed again using the operating system kind of analogy that you can just take an, you know, operating system that's not doing well and do it update and take it back to this better state. And again, we need to figure out exactly what that means. But I think it's really exciting. It is. And it's certainly, like, there's no doubt that accumulation of damage does play a role in aging, but maybe it's not the cause of the only thing that it's maybe it's just the feed forward loop accelerating it. Yeah, it's right. Exactly. Because it's also interesting. Another really interesting area is the plasma exchange. I love, I love, like, you know, for you to kind of explain to people what some of this interesting research is in the aging field, plasma exchange, you can start back to, you know, the original peribidosis studies maybe. Yeah, great. Well, and actually, I think this relates exactly to what you just said is there is accumulation of damage and there are, you know, these things that are accumulating in our systems and it could just be the program responding to that damage in a way that, you know, it was set up to do. So this idea of peribiosis, I mean, this is what's century, really old, like people are doing this in like the early 20th century. Or basically, you can take two mice and connect to their circular-tory systems. It's not the pleasant procedure if you're one of the mice, but they'll do what's called heterochronic, where they take one young mouse and one old mouse and connect them and then just say, what happens to the aging? The young mouse is now having some influence from the old mouse and vice versa. And what we find is that the young mice has accelerated aging compared to one that's paired with another young mouse and the old mouse is somewhat rejuvenated compared to an old mouse compared to an old mouse. And then more recently, people said, okay, well, maybe you don't have to connect them, you can just do this whole plasma. Exchange method where you can put young plasma into an old mouse and it seems to, in some ways, again, rejuvenate them not to use that kind of snake oily term, but that's the best we have. And actually, we've been doing this with cells in a dish. So we can, we actually buy old, or serum from older individuals, versus younger individuals, and we can grow ourselves in these two different conditions. And we, again, can age even fetal cells using old serum versus the young serum seems to be not as problematic. Very interesting. I know some of the recent work out of arena comboys lab at UC Berkeley. What was interesting to me about her research or her recent research was that they were able to take this plasma and, you know, basically it was just they, they saline and albutimone, right? And then they took old mice and it was essentially diluting out their old plasma. Yeah. And it rejuvenated these mice, whereas they did it with the young mice and there's really no effect. Yeah. So it really indicates like there is, as you mentioned, there's something accumulating, at least in the bloodstream with age, that may in some way be accelerating the aging process. So what do you think the epigenetic age would do? Like if that was measure? Yeah. Is that going to be measured? Was it true? Yeah. So actually, so this is what we're doing in a cell. So actually, the conduits were the first ones who did this in vitro experiment as well. So that's how we knew that it would work. And now we're looking at the epigenetics of those cells and else of the RNA sake. And people have started to do this to in terms of the mice. I don't know if they've done it in terms of the just saline albumin exchange, but in the normal kind of pairbiosist context, it does change the epigenetic clock. And so the question, again, is the methylation patterns that we're capturing in the clock's gesture response to the accumulation of these kind of problematic factors? Because people always wondered, oh, is there something magical in young blood that's rejuvenating versus it just that's problematic things that are accumulating old blood? And it seems to be more of that. And yeah, the idea that you can just dilute it out and get the whole program kind of response and rejuvenates itself, I think, is really amazing. So it gets the main questions would be, at least if I remember from the convoy study, even the brain, because the epigenomeness or something, it was, I don't know how significant it was in terms of their measuring, whatever, whatever biomarkers they're measuring from what we're aging, it seemed to be better, even brain. The question would be for the epigenetics, is again, one of those things where with the cancer came with therapy experiment, there's just inflammation, there's something causing damage and it's a transient thing. Then you have to keep getting these plasma exchanges, which is sustainable, really. I don't know, at least I think it is. But is there something that does it long-term effect the other organs and stuff? Like is it something that's going to be a permanent thing? I think we don't know. Actually, I'm still in this from my husband, so I'll give him credit for it. He talks about, it's kind of the climate change in the body, right? So the cells are in a problematic climate and they're going to not behave the way that they should be. And then if you remove that, everything kind of gets better, but if it's not sustained, how quickly it's going to return. And I think we don't know that. My guess is it would be about as transient as the effect. And if you could dilute and that's maintained for a while, it would probably be maintained in terms of the cells kind of features and epigenetic measures. But yeah, if it returned really quickly, then I think it would be more transient. I'm sure people are trying to figure out is there a factor in the body? Yeah, people are not only using for a factor, but is it like, you're only as good as the sensitivity of your assay? And I always go back to this inflammation thing. Because there's a lot of data out there, right? And we have biomarkers for inflammation. I've gotten my high sensitivity, so you're at the protein density, 0.2. Does that mean I don't have inflammation going on? No. Infillation is happening right? Is happening all the time, setting up a day, every second, it just means that assay is only as sensitive to pick up, you know, about much inflammation. And so maybe we just haven't gotten the right tools yet to pick up even that. You know what I mean? So there's always the sensitivity question and the tools that you're, which is why you guys are developing these great tools to measure aging, quantify it. But to kind of shift into, you mentioned the exercise and we're talking about age reversal and kind of slowing. And like, so exercise is also associated with the slowing of epigenetic age. And then I think the other thing I kind of, you kind of eluded to for a moment was genetics. And I had a question here because you were saying genetics. It seems as though there's 10 to 20 percent you mentioned. Yeah, it's not pretty small. Pretty small in terms of epigenetic ageing. Like, yeah, but even in terms of lifespan, it's the same as the on par with that. So only a small percentage of the way you age is controlled by genetics. And now this is my caveat or my question. Yeah, yeah. Unless, what if you are a super centenarian or a semi-super centenarian? Like, there's obviously your an outlier. Right? Yeah. That's an outlier. But it exists and it's thought to be under genetic control, I think. Yeah, you know. Yeah, so they're probably not just randomly making it to that. So for most of us, our aging is going to be less under genetic control. But if you, there are definitely people who you might think when the genetic lottery. Right? So they're very unique and they have the perfect combination. It's probably not one gene. They just have the perfect combination of different gene variants. And that's somehow enables them to live much longer than the rest of us. It seems even despite having bad health behaviors. So these super centenarians don't necessarily smoke less or eat better or exercise more than people in the general public. But there's somehow able to overcome that and survive to extreme ages. And they probably are more, that's probably more under genetic control. But for most people, unless you have a string of grandparents that all survived to 110, you're probably not going to be able to rely on your genes to get you there. And actually, my PhD dissertation was on long-lived smokers and thinking, smoking decreases people's life expectancy by about 10 years. But you have these people who survived to 100 or beyond still smoking. And what is it about their genetics that allows them to overcome this? And what is it? I mean, the stuff that came up was major aging pathways like insulin IV, one pathway. But again, we haven't proven this out cause away. But yeah. Did you read that Japanese or super centenarian study that came out? I don't know if you knew that. I don't know if I knew. It was a study where they looked at, was that the men? Or they looked at Japanese? Yes, the men. And they looked at elderly. And then they looked at going from elderly to a centenarian from centenarian to a semi-super centenarian, which is 105. And then to a super centenarian, which is 110. And they looked at all a battery of biomarkers. I don't think epigenetic classes in there. But they looked at, like, telomer lanes, immunocynescence, all the blood work stuff, the metabolic and lipids and stuff. And then they looked at inflammatory biomarkers. And it was funny. It was interesting because the suppression of inflammation was the only thing that could predict going to the next. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Each group, or I don't know what it's called. But surviving to the next. Right. It was being able to, like, low inflammation, basically. So that was sort of interesting as well. And also it kind of goes back this. You mentioned the smoking. And of course, you know, a control there, typical pathways. It kind of brings to mind we recently had Dr. Bill Harris on the podcast. And he's a very, he's probably one of the world experts on omega-3 fatty acids. And he's just been decades of research. And he has all this interesting data. He does a lot of work using the ometic mega-3 index, which he codewoke, where they measure omega-3 and red blood cells. It's a long term marker for omega-3 rather than, like, what you have in it before. Yeah. And he's done all sorts of studies using framing ham data and has found that. So the typical American diet is they have about a 4% omega-3 index. And that's kind of low, especially if you compare it to other countries like Japan, where there are average omega-3 indexes, like 10% or low-high centers. And so much higher. Anyway, so he's these days with framing ham data and he stratified the people based on the omega-3 index. So low was, like, 4% lower than 4% and high was about 8%. And people with an 8% omega-3 index were had a five-year increased life expectancy compared to people with the 4% omega-3 index. Yeah. Interesting. But what was also really interesting from this data was he looked at smokers. And smokers have, as you imagine, had a much lower life expectancy. But smokers that took omega-3, that had high omega-3 indexes did not have that same low life expectancy. Yeah. But here's the really interesting thing. These are the smokers that took high omega-3, had the same life expectancy as the non-smokers with low omega-3. Oh, yeah. So in a way, low omega-3 was like, oh, yeah, for your life expectancy, right? I mean, yeah. It's kind of, to me, it was very interesting data. You should pair up with him. And I would be so interested to know the epigenetic age as it correlates with homing 3 index. I mean, yeah, depending on which samples in Framingham they do have methylation, are doing that shared. Okay. So, there was a really also really interesting study. This kind of gets into interventions as well. I kind of wanted to touch on that for a moment. There was an interesting study. And I don't know if I really have a question. But I also just like to see the ideas. The study was like, women, not were genetically predisposed. Breast cancer, they were given five grams a day of fish oil. So it was EPA, DHA, omega-3. The marine omega-3 fatty acids. And this was like six months treatment. And they had done some sort of methylation profiling, not epigenal talk about. Yeah. And profiling of their, PBMC, their peripheral blood, more nuclear cells. And there was like hypomethylation in, it was a TNF, TNF alpha or something like, one of the major controllers of inflammation where it was like decreasing, it was like decreasing a lot of the pro-inflammatory pathways. So, you know, at the level of methylation. I thought it was so interesting. Yeah. Not sure what's going on there. Because there's lots of ways omega-3 regulate inflammation. They suppress it, they resolve it. Yeah. And so, it was like, wow, they're changing methylation patterns. Like how is that happening? Yeah. Just sort of interesting potential research ideas there. Yeah. Now, I think there's a ton of things to start connecting. And, you know, you know, all these environmental things and just physiologically how are these things connected when you go up in this, how is that effect? These other things down stream. Yeah. I think as more and more data gets collected and we actually have good measures of all these different things we can start doing that. But, yeah. What do you think about some of the, there's so there's consumer-bailable epigenetic you know, reaching clocks out there. Like, what do your thoughts? I'll like, are they accurate? And of course, I know you're a advisor for a lithium, which makes one of them. So, yeah. Now, this is an important question. And I think, you know, the hard thing with epigenetic ages. Again, this is something people can't. You don't know the answer, right? So, you can take one of these tasks. And you get a number back and there's no way for the consumer to verify whether that's number one correct. I mean, if there is a correct answer or if it's even meaningful. And I think, basically, there are two things that I think are really important when you are talking about epigenetic tests being used by individuals or even clinically is comes back to the reliability of these tests. So what I mean by that is if I were to take the exact same tests twice on the same day, will I get the same answer? And unfortunately, what we found is actually if you use the original epigenetic clocks, you do not get the same. You get wildly different answers. They're actually highly unreliable and very noisy. So we've taken blood samples. You can split them. Like, the same sample run at twice. And you can get upwards of eight years difference in your epigenetic using traditional clocks. So actually, a few years earlier, and this actually came out from my work with Elisium because they saw this in their data first and then we went back and looked a bit more because I thought, oh, this is the end of the epigenic clocks. So this is what actually happening. There can't be useful for anything unless you have thousands of people. And so we actually developed a statistical method that completely removes all this technical noise and I won't go into the math for every ball on the podcast. But basically, we can get this down to you can split the sample. And now you're getting only about one year different at max. Most people are predicted exactly the same age on their T-Tests. And so what I would say, so Elisium, as you mentioned, I know longer-enativeizer of them because I'm doing other stuff with Elisium, but I was an advisor for them. They actually did care a lot about this reliability thing. It's something, this is why I was helping them to try and sort this out so at least for their Tests, they felt like if someone took it twice, they would get the same answer. You know, assuming your T-Tests were in a short period of time. But most Tests, I would say, on the market are using the old methods that are highly unreliable. I don't know that, but I would suggest to consumers to say, find out if there is data on the reliability of Tests. The second thing that's really important for our BGNTests is something that statisticians call construct validity, which is just this idea of biological ages, what we call latent. You can't see it, you can't truly measure it. Not CRP, where I can actually, I know I'm trying to measure something very specific. So it's, can we try and approximate something that's not really measurable? And then the way we evaluate how, if we did that well, is does it predict or track with things we would expect? So again, with that BGNTests, it should predict things like mortality risk after you adjust out the chronological age. So being higher, lower than your chronological age should be very predictive of mortality risk or disease risk. And people who are using these first generation clocks, though, one's trained to predict chronological age, are not as good at that. So yes, there's a lot of tests on the market, but I think it's really important to make sure you're using one's trained more like the second generation clocks, so things like Grimage or Fenoage, but again, using these methods that make them more kind of reliable and take up the noise. Are there that many, epigenetic clocks that are consumer-available now? Are there really? Actually don't know the number, but I constantly see different companies launching epigenetic testers, at least I would say probably close to 10 on the market. Wow. Yeah. Is the one that was developed by Alisean when you were advising for them? That was more for biological age. That was the answer. So it was similar to the Fenoage one, but with this additional statistical method that removes the technical noise. So that one is, we've shown, as predictive mortality of the on chronological age. And actually Alisean is licensing these systems measures, so I think they'll be putting those out to where you can get kind of approximation of aging in different systems and get your kind of a adio type. There was, my question's kind of got many layers to it, and it has to do with like if a person is trying to measure their epigenetic age and they want to do a lifestyle intervention and then measure it again. So there was a very, very small study, this published by a Gallaudet reach out to me, her name is Cara Fitzgerald. She and her colleagues had taken a small sample of people and they underwent like an extreme dietary change where they were eating a lot of leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, blueberries, but they also were eating animal meat, liver, organ meat, eggs, no refined sugar, meditation, exercise, probiotics, I mean it was a kitchen sink, it was a lot. And this was like a, I think it was pretty short treatment, like it wasn't like six months or anything. I can't remember if I was talking to my head maybe two months or something, that or three months, I don't know. Their epigenetic age according to the clock that you think it was maybe the original. And answer your original. So I guess you kind of answered the question, but it had reversed by like three years or something. So I guess the question is, can you really, can you track interventions accurately? Can you make assumptions based on it or what are your thoughts? Yeah, and I'm not saying this is a sweet valley about any study, but I mean the great thing about that study is they made their data public and we were actually able to go back in and show that their the entire effect was noise. So actually once you do the statistical method that removes the noise, there was actually no effect of the intervention. And of course, you know, these methods weren't available originally and they were using an original clock like they thought they should, but I think this shows us that we need to be a little bit careful how we interpret the results from these things. And the epigenetic clocks are powerful tools to kind of, I think they are good at giving you an idea of your health status. Same as if I go into my doctor's office for, you know, a kind of lab testing, doing metabolic panel or whatever. They can give you a good idea of your status. But when we think of how they're applied to interventions, I think we need to be careful that we don't take any change as at just face value. We need to really think about, you know, if I measure it again, was that sustained like things we talked about earlier. Because I would argue that we haven't proven that a change in the epigenetic clock is a change truly in your biological aging process. And like we said, you can have changes in kind of inflammatory markers that are acute and not truly capturing the aging process. But that'll change what you see in terms of your clocks. I think epigenetic clocks are really powerful for like a wake-up call. So if you, you know, a lot of young people are kind of going about to their life, we don't know like we said till you see these functional things start happening if we're doing well or not. And I think they can be used to kind of inform. And as we move forward and develop better, more sophisticated ones. And we look at actually linking changes in epigenetic aging to changes in other kind of health parameters. They will be good for kind of people testing interventions either personally or in clinical studies. But I think right now we're in the really early days. And we need to, these are really high potential tools, but we're not at the point yet where you can just, you know, take it and believe everything that you get back. Right. So you're better off also doing all the classical biomarker tests too and measure a lot of things. It's always good to have more data. What are it before we wrap this up? What are you most excited about two questions? What are you most excited about with respect to the aging field in general? Like what's being researched right now, what's coming out of the pipeline? And then what are you most excited about coming out of your lab? Yep. Or I guess they could be the same means. Or yeah. No. They're related. So the thing in the aging field again is this kind of transient or partial reprogramming thing. And just again, not necessarily for an intervention, but just figuring out what it is. To me it's just so magical that you can change the state of the cell. And what does that mean for the cell and does it now function better and do populations of cells work better together? And how does that happen? Can you figure out even better ways to do this? You know, we've used kind of the yamanocca factors, but there could be tons of other ways that you could actually change this. And just now knowing that that's possible. So that kind of basic science on the most excited about. And then in my lab, I'm just really excited to figure out what the epigenic clocks are. We have no idea. We apply these measures to a bunch of different things. We have no idea what drives these changes or functionally what they even mean. So why is your epigenic clock related to your mortality risk? Like what is the pathway that links those two things? And I think that'll keep us busy for a really long time. But something I'm excited to kind of start working on. Awesome. I like to ask this last question to a lot of podcasts, guess. And that is, you know, what lifestyle changes like do you incorporate the most into your life based on science? Yeah. I mean for me, there's kind of two things. Diet and exercise. I try to pay a lot of attention to. Exercise, I think, is such a simple thing that's so few. You know, everyone's waiting for the magic pill. I mean, if they could bottle the effects of exercise, it would be the biggest thing in aging research that you know exists. It's probably the most powerful tool we have to actually intervene in our aging process, or at least to slow it. Or they've even shown, you know, you can reverse diabetes through exercise or any of these things. Better than in the form. Yeah, I know. So again, exercise is amazing. It makes you feel good. So for me, trying to maintain an active lifestyle is much as possible. I have a, you know, I would say the desk, what's your favorite kind of exercise that you do? I mean, I like to do things that just are fun, so hiking or anything like that, or, you know, any of the classes, but probably, if I were thinking the most beneficial probably, things like hit is try to do that as much as I can. But, and then the other thing, it's just diet. I eat, I would say 90 to 95 percent plant-based. I do eat some fish. Try to keep kind of like a Japanese type diet, and then I do intermittent fasting where I don't eat until usually like one o'clock. Again, that I think we don't know for sure whether that's beneficial, but for now, just sticking to it's seeing kind of what happens. Yeah. We had Mark Matsun on the podcast, and he definitely convinced me that there are some benefits for sure in intermittent fasting with respect to, you know, keeping in ketosis in the metabolic sway. But, so did you see that paper that came out of Yale from Visha Vishvah's, yeah, that was so I didn't read the whole, like I didn't index read it. I just sort of, yeah, it's data. But, like there was a two-year caloric restriction. Yeah, that's from the calorie study. Yeah. And, phymic aging was like, slowed, which was kind of... Yeah, I think, you know, caloric sections, and it's like around for quite a while. I think the issue is most people can't actually sustain, right? Yeah. I mean, but you bring up a really good point. And like, there's been a lot. It's like the classical intervention that's been done in rodents. It's been done in non-human primates. Yeah. And it's been shown to, you know, it does improve health span of those animals and not humans. And in some cases, they really restrict, like 30%, like the 30% less calorie, or fewer calories. Whereas I think this study, the calorie restricts them was like 15 or 15. Yeah, so I think it's like 12 or 15. Yeah. I don't know what that translate. Like, we don't know if caloric restriction actually is how beneficial it is for humans. Yeah. And it always comes back to, again, that, like, well, overeating is not good. Yeah. You know, overeating is not good. We know that. And, you know, there's many ways that you can affect calories in calories out in one of them is exercise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so there's a lot of ways that you can sort of get to a similar, you know, and point where you're not just eating as many calories, right? Yeah. You have to be like, you're... And you certainly don't want to starve yourself. And that also it can be like calorie restriction, like you can, you know, there's a problem with muscle wasting and frailty within each. Yeah. Especially if you're getting older, right? Exactly. And getting a protein. So, yeah. Again, yeah. All these little nuances, especially when you start to translate the research. But, but epigenetic age was, I if I remember correctly, shown to be slowed in the rodent in... Oh, yeah. So, in my, in my, in my avijanic age is effective by calorie restriction. And substantial, it's slowed in the longer the animals are on it that kind of slower the increase in epigenetic age over time becomes. But again, I think, you know, how much of this is the absence of excess food. And there are studies and rodents showing that different genetic backgrounds have different responses. So, I'm actually do worse with caloric restriction. So, that amount of restriction, I think is probably going to be, you know, depend on you personally, not just preference, but, you know, some of your genetics. And the other thing that the reason I don't do caloric restriction personally is because there's studies, even in mice that if you stop it, you lose the benefit. And I can't imagine studying my entire life on caloric restriction to continue to get this benefit. So, I always say to people, do whichever, whatever you can stick to, right? You know, you don't have to be perfect in your diet or exercise. But as long as I think you have the knowledge of how things are affecting you can make, you know, an informed decision on this, this part's worth, like an extra, you know, potentially an extra four years of healthy life. Or maybe something else isn't worth it to you. And just having that kind of information and feedback, I think it's going to be critical, right? Yeah. And there's also the aspect of confounding it with time-rinsurited feeding in mice. I know we're talking to you. Yeah. Because talked about this so many times on our podcast, but like how the people, like post-docs and graduates who are feeding, these mice, they come like they're there for like eight hours, like they're not, you know. So, there's a component of these calorie restriction diets are actually like, that is the time-rinsurited treatment. How much is that? Yeah, yeah. That's not eating four, 16 hours. Yeah. That's when they did all it was since then. That's it. Right. Yeah. So anyways, awesome. We're going to really, that was a really interesting information. I know people are going to love it. I certainly was super excited to talk about, you know, all things aging with you and I will continue to follow your research. I'm excited that you'll be close to me so we can hang out time at something like that. Go exercise. Yeah. Totally. Go hiking. I love hiking. I'll show you all the great trails. So people that want to learn more about your research follow you. You're very active on Twitter. I follow you on Twitter. Yeah. Your Twitter handle is Dr. Morgan Levine. Sounds right. Yeah. And your Instagram. You're also on Instagram. I'm a doctor. Morgan Levine. Yeah. We have a new book coming out. It's available for pre-gorder right now. It'll be in May. Yeah. I think May third. It's there. Yeah. Okay. And it's called true age. Yes. So it's basically about all the stuff we talked about measuring what biological ages, how can we approximate it and potentially use that information to inform our lifestyle decisions? Awesome. Well, I look forward. I'm going to pre-order it. Anything else? Anything you'd like to say? No. Just thank you for having me. This is really fun. We'll see you so much more again. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Perfect. Bye. you

Hello friends, this episode has two amazing, amazing guests who need no introduction, Dr. Peter D. Amanda's and Tony Robbins. Neither of them really need an interest, so I'm going to keep it really, really brief. Dr. Peter D. Amanda's is a serial entrepreneur, founder of X-Pries which designs and operates global competitions to incentivize the development of technological breakthroughs that can accelerate humanity toward a better future. Tony Robbins is a serial entrepreneur. He's a number one New York Times bestselling author. He's a philanthropist and he's the nation's number one life and business strategist and both of them are somewhere tomorrow. I kind of wanted to kick this off because I'm personally curious. Peter, you're really well-known for being perhaps uniquely motivated in finding systems and organizational level approaches to creatively solving big problems, X-Pries being one such example. On the other hand, Tony, your work focuses more on the individual and in helping people solve their own internal problems, whatever they are for whatever's holding them back. So there's definitely some potential overlap here, but maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you both connected to form such a strong lasting friendship and collaboration over the years. Well, it's been friends for a long time, but this book came together with us together because I had an accident that they told was going to end my career. I was being an idiot chasing a 22-year-old professional snowboard or down a mountain and I couldn't make the moves that were making and it ended in disaster. I thought I literally wrote my neck. In the end, I taught my rotator cuff severely and the pain was 99 pains. This was nerve pain. I couldn't sleep. What do you do? You go to your doctors. I went to four doctors. All of them saying surgery surgery surgery. Well, what's the prognosis? Well, the honest with you, you may not be able to live to arm above your shoulder again. You could tear again four to six months of recovery. Assume about stem cells because I work some of the greatest athletes in history. Some of my criss-maternone where all there was supposed to be up for three months. It was two and a half weeks and he's back on because of stem cells. And so no, no, no, no, there are worthless. And then the final doctor looked me straight in the face and said, I want to show you something. Life as you know it is over. There's literally his words to me. And I said, you clearly didn't go to my communications tomorrow, but he showed me my spine and is that this is no laughing matter. He said, one good hit and he said, you won't be able to walk again. No more running, no more jumping, you know, no more snowboarding. That's for sure. And you know, if you're ready for a punch in the gut, you might have it. I didn't have it so well. I got to be honest for a few hours. And then my normal brain kicked in and said, there's got to be better solutions. So Peter and I have been different for years and partners in business. So I called the genius over here and said, listen, who's the best person on stem cells? I've heard good bat in between. And he said, you got to reach out to Bob and I went to share with him a little bit about that Peter. Yeah, sure. So like you said, Rhonda, I've been focused on large scale solutions. And for probably last 15, 20 years, it's been around how to use exponential technologies to solve the world's biggest problem. You know, AI, robotics, study, printing, synthetic biology, quantum computing, all of these areas. And I became enamored about eight years ago on the idea of using those exponential technologies focusing it on health and longevity. You know, as you get older, you know, space is taking a long time. I wanted to live as long as I can. And I met Bob hurray years ago, both these were both pilots he's passionate about space and became just fascinated by what Bob was doing. Bob had been one of the very first people ever to isolate stem cells from placenta. In fact, he said, you know, the placenta is the richest source of stem cells out there. And these are like, you know, day zero old stem cells. And I had helped him spin the company, a company called sailority out of cell gene where he was the head of sailor medicine. And we formed this company to have stem cells from the placenta being able to be used eventually for repairing the body. And so when Tony reached out, I said, Tony, listen, you've got to talk with Bob hurray. He's like the world's expert in stem cells. He's my go-to guy in this field. And stem cells are how you can rejuvenate the different systems and tissues of the body. So Tony back to you. Yeah, so a little light notes like saying, I want to learn about basketball, and because let me introduce my friend, LeBron J. I'm a chiro. So I talked to Bob and Bob said, listen, you know, using your own stem cells as a waste of time after 40 they dropped through the floor. He said, if you're doing an elbow or an ankle or something maybe, but he said, this is really extensive. You need 40 old stem cells. And I said, fetal tissue, I don't want to say, no, enough fetal tissue. And he explained, you know, the power of placenta and the power, obviously, of course, in any city. I'll tell you where to go. So you can always go back for surgery. So I went for it. And I did three days of treatment. I was just 20 minutes a day of an idea in a shot. And, you know, the first day I felt tired, the second day out of side of time response. I knew what it was. So I didn't scare me, but you're shaking, freezing, not 20, 25 minutes of that. And then my body had a very strong reaction. I went to sleep. And I woke up. No, it was my shoulder perfect. I had the MRI. I'm fully fine. I was almost five years ago, four and a half years ago. But for the first time in 14 years, I stood up with no pain in my spine. So it turned me into a obsessive one. I want to know everything about stem cells. What's the greatest breakthroughs in this area? And then when I began to find out, it's not just stem cells. There's this incredible revolution in regenerative and precision medicine. And then, you know, every two years, the Vatican, the Pope actually throws a conference to probably the biggest in the world, with doctors and all of the earth because he believes this is a breakthrough for humanity. And he wants the answers for humanity. And so Peter was going, and then also, and I got a call and they said, you know, we'd like you to be the cleanup speaker. And I said, wonderful. But I want to tend the whole thing. And so, you know, I tend to the conference and I met some of the greatest scientists alive and repented and rebuilding of medicine and regenerative medicine and precision medicine. I met patients more than a dozen that were sent home to die because the cancer was intreatable. But they found somebody like Dr. June with Cartesales. And here they were six years later, totally healthy. I met, you know, Jack Nicholas, one of the greatest golfers of all time. He couldn't stand for more than ten minutes. His pain was so severe. They were going to, you know, walk up there, you know, give him a spinal fusion, which I'm sure you know, doesn't usually work at least half the time. And if it does, give you limited mobility. He just themselves and stayed. And here he was 82 years old and how playing golf and tennis. So I just said, I want to do like what I did with money. I want to go to the very best. But instead of 50, you know, the Warren Buffett's the Ray Dahlia's Carl icons, let's find the top 150, Nobel Laureate scientist, medical doctors. Let's interview them and bring the very best on how to increase your energy and your strength and your vitality. But also, what's the best and diagnostics to prevent it? And what's the best if you're running into real challenges? And so that's how this was created. And I went to Peter and said, I want you to join me on this. You're genius. I went to Bob Wood Help me. And so the three of us worked on this project together. It's been a three year project. And by the way, we're donating 100% of the profits. As I did in my last three books, we're feeding 20 million meals for feeding America. I'm up to 850 million meals. I committed to a billion meals seven years ago. I'm a head of schedule. And the balance is going to be Alzheimer's cancer and heart disease research with some of the best researchers out there. So we've tried to create something that people could enter and use as much as little simple lifestyle changes. I think you and I talked about in the past to what are some of the most high tech solutions that are available. Awesome. We're going to dive into all that hopefully. And just to, you know, on the on the stem cell front and the placenta front, Peter and I were chatting about this, a little bit before off camera. But I I banked my my placenta in 2017 with life bank USA and you know, I this was mind blowing to me. You know, I didn't even know about the the source of, you know, the stem cells in the placenta being people here. The word stem cell. And you know, it's like, okay, stem cell. What is that? Is it, you know, it's a cell that, you know, has the capacity to replenish the different cell types within an organ. But there are stem cells that can form many different types of cells in different organs. And so you can have what's called a pluripontan stem cell, which can form a cell in your heart or your liver or your brain. And and the placenta is actually a rich source of that. And I didn't expect that. And I would say, and everybody listening, if you're pregnant or you someone you know is pregnant, it's something you should consider to bank the, not only the cord blood and the cord blood is the hemopletic stem cells. It's the stem cells that lead to red cells, white cells, you know, immune cells. But if you bank it in placenta, it's rich in these pluripontan stem cells. In fact, I think that the placenta is a three printer that manufacturers the baby, all of the cells that make up the baby come from that placenta. And the placenta is also rich in natural killer cells and T cells, all these immune cells. And what life bank USA does is the decelerize the placenta, saves those cells. And it's like saving, you know, for those of us who remember a boot disk from earliest computers, it's like saving the original software before it gets corrupted. And another thing is that the cells from the placenta haven't developed, they haven't been thiminized yet, they haven't developed a us versus them characteristics. So you can give placental cells to anybody, you know, because the placenta doesn't generate immune reaction against cells and you're don't generate immune reaction against placental cells. There's also, you know, one of the people that we met originally Peter and I both met at the Vatican became good friends with in the investors in his company, is a company that's called Biospice. And they're in the third stage of FDA trials right now. You know, but just so you're listeners know, phase one safety, of course, phase two is efficacy, phase three is efficacy at scale. So in the third phase, they think they'll get approval sometime to late fall or the beginning spring of next year. And literally they discovered the wind pathways with known about it's a signaling system that tells your system, okay, make this many stem cells for the brain, this many from the heart. And as you age, sometimes that signaling system becomes corrupted or less effective. But they figured out how to upregulate or downregulate, whether it's cancer, we want to downregulate growth or upregulate like you want to get osteoarthritis, you want to regrow tendons. And so the one they're getting approval for first is for osteoarthritis, it's a single injection. And in 11 months, you regrow all your tendons. But based on the book disc is was just described. They're like 16 year old tendons, even even 40, 50, 60, or seven years old. That's the world that we're entering to right now. So it's like there are things you can do today. There's things you can do in 12 to 36 months. And that's what this is focused on. Not 10, 20 years ago, what you can do right now to change your life. So Tony, you're all about applied health promoting habits. I know you're a big time fitness enthusiast, you're a cold plunger. What are some of your favorite lifestyle habits that you practice and are most excited about when it comes to living healthier? I'll tell you when I was least excited about, but it become excited about and I get Peter partially credit for this. But I'd also give Dr. Walker from the real scientists from UC Berkeley is kind of the sleep expert. My whole thing was all sleep on my diet. My wife loves eight hours of sleep. I was like four or five hours is more than enough. I got to live this life. And the way he convinced me, Dr. Walker, was he said, Tony, we didn't study. I think it'll convince you. 1.6 billion people. I said, Dr. Mark, you couldn't have coordinated that because I didn't have to. He said, it's called 70 countries that all have daylight savings time. And he said, here's what we found on alarming statistic. When we spring forward and we lose just one hour of sleep. In those 70 countries, over the next three days, heart attacks increase, like clockwork on average 24 percent. When we fall back and get just one more hour of sleep in all those countries, heart attacks drop 21 percent. He also does correlations to traffic accidents. I also showed me the man who who sleeps four to five hours tonight usually has testosterone levels of a person 10 years older than they are. I come at attention. He taught us and he taught all of us some really simple hacks that I now use. One of those is having a consistent time to fall sleep and wake up. And I got to be honest, that one is not perfect for me, by any stretch. The other is that I was working on the sleep chapter for the first time at 6.15, I'm going to be up at 9.30 in the morning. So I knew something was wrong. But now I really worked to get eight hours, which I've never done before. I wear a loop and I measure it. I use an eye mask. I keep the temperature about 65 degrees, which allows you to go deeper. And so I stay away from those blue lights that you know, you wear the little goggles if you want to kind of a rose color glasses. So your brain can go to sleep easily. So it's a really simple thing. But for me, I love cryotherapy. As you know, I love cold therapy. You are the one that got me into son as I obviously knew about son as in use them. But I had no idea the research had showed four to seven times a week could change completely the profile of having art attack or a stroke, changing a blood pressure. And so I'm now quite religious on both sides of the cold and the hot. I find that to be available. I also do hyperbaric oxygen. I'm a big believer in pulse electronic magnetic frequency PMF. I use that as a kind of a birocharger for my body. Because you know, I'm a birohacker. I got to get up and do 12 to 13 hours with 15 or 20,000 people on a stadium who won't sit for a three hour movie for four straight days or seven straight days in these days. I just finished a seminar with 800,000 people for six straight days. Now I'm got to do it through a screen and keep people like, you know, I've got a seminar coming up next week or two weeks and you have 25,000 people in 195 countries. And so we started here attending him. My friends and Australia started midnight and we go 12 and a half hours a day. So they started midnight and they finished like 130 may afternoon. My friends in the, let's say, lemon in five hours ahead of us. So they're starting there. You know, literally every time zone in the world, I got to hold them together. So the level of energy is demand is through the roof. And then of course, there's the understanding of how do you really impact those mitochondria through things like understanding NMM and AD and what the impact of that is, which I'm sure you know is quite powerful to say the least, especially after you turn 40 or 50 years old where that drops off the cliff. I want to ask Peter sort of similar question, but before I go, there's since you mentioned it, like, I mean, anyone that's seen you in action, weather live or virtual or on television, Tony, I mean, you've got incredible mental and physical stamina. Like what's the secret sauce? I mean, is it, is it, I mean, do you, are you disciplined with these, um, with your lifestyle factors? Or, you know, what, tell us. I'm extremely disciplined with my lifestyle factors, but some of them backfired. So I was a vegan for 12 years. And then, you know, when you're burning 11,300 calories, that's my average calorie burn. I have a group that works with Olympic athletes and they travel with me for three years. They tested me. They were 70,000 our device that measured everything. Heart rate variability. They took my saliva. They took my blood. But we're 11,300 calories on an average day on stage, 12 hour day. Actually, the device only lasts the nine hours. The battery died. I kept going in three hours. I jumped a thousand times, not to give an idea. And an average day, and they explained to me, I'm 282 pounds. Every time I come down, it's four times your body. So imagine a thousand pounds, times a thousand jumps, a million pounds of pressure in one day. If you saw my bone density, you always said, these are humans. These are Olympic athletes. This is something we've never seen. I have 99.9% higher bone density than anything they've ever measured to give you an idea. I have 15 pounds more of lean muscle mass than the average alignment. If I'm, if you're running with a friend, and you can't talk anymore, you're lucky to get us. It's about four. I'm at 18, and still speaking. So I went from being a vegan at one stage, because it's just burning so many calories to having fish. But the fish I chose in four to sound fish, sound fish with sword fishing tuna. And this one thing's Peter and I both teach people now. You've got to do a blood test around metals. Because undernone's to me, those are older fish. The younger fish, they have sore ball their mercury, plus my DNA did not in that way as well. Just the way I was operated. I got to zero on a zero to five scale. I was 123. The highest they've ever measured in the state of New York. The Florida, uh, helped the partner was notified by New York. They came out and investigated, talked to my staff. They thought my wife was trying to kill me because I have a life life, my four-dly venture as a policy. It was not true. It was the fish. So sometimes you're trying to be really disciplined. So I've been very disciplined. I'm very disciplined by body and my workouts. But I think there's also the psychological emotional part, which we do talk about last two chapters of the book. I think they're the most important pieces. Because you can do everything right with your body and your mind and your emotions can mess it all up. So we all know about Pasebo's obviously and most people don't know they actually really discovered in World War II. A doctor who is treating people ran out of morphine and as you know they go on a shock without that not to mention the pain. It was actually a nurse that changed the world. She handed him saline solution and said, oh we got some more morphine since he believed that he told these patients with total certainty. You'll be out of a pain in next minute or two and you're going to be fine. Well none of them went into shock. 90% of them were out of pain with no drugs. It was just and so when he came back to Harvard after World War II, he basically started the standard. We now have for a most old drug you're comparing to you know, a placebo. But what most put on no is you can make yourself sick or well. The first of all the size of the placebo, the size of your invention changes everything. A little pill certainly actually a big pill more and injection even more. But in the book we gave it also an example of the Vettins Administration for knee surgeries they decided to do a third of the surgeries as sham surgeries placebo surgeries. They just put a mark, sewed the person up and did nothing to the knee. A year later, the patients that had no treatment but thought they had had no pain, talked about how mobile they were compared to the ones that were. They don't even find it anymore. And it's more than that. I'm sure you know Harvard's done studies where they take someone and give them a real drug. Not a placebo, a barbituate. It's going to knock you on the ground to slow you down and they go, big giant drug pill. This is an infediment. You need to be prepared what's going to do for you. Two a man or woman or body speed up. So understanding the power of your mind to shift things and also your emotions to have the quality of your life to me is most important. So my injury comes from discipline and training and it's very intense. I do everything by acting. You could imagine. But it's also fulfillment. And I think successful not fulfillment is the biggest failure in life for anyone. And so for me it's a virtuous circle. I believe I made for this. I'm here to serve. It doesn't matter the hours I'll go into. We'll make this thing happen. And I pour so much into the people and that energy comes back. And so it becomes like a turbocharger. And so it gives me an enormous level of energy. And I'm doing things at 62 that I wasn't able to do when I was 29 to give in essence. And so a lot of that is some of these tools that we talk about. But you can't leave out the psychology and the emotion of your life as well. Peter, similar question. Tell me a little bit about the lived Peter, D. M. and his longevity routine. Do you have a protocol you follow? Do you have a comprehensive approach? I know you're a co-founder of human longevity. So I'm curious to know about your, your, yeah, I do. I do. And I value it more and more every year because I think the better care I take of myself, the more likely I am intercept all of the new biotech solutions that are coming our way. We can talk a little bit about a deal of longevity, a skate velocity, later, which is, which is an idea that we're going to be scientists, it's going to be extending our lives significantly. We have to get there. One of my missions, Rhonda is making 100 years old and you're 60 right? How do you add 30 or 40 health years on our lives? So for me, it's the fundamentals. Sleep. I'm religious about getting eight hours of sleep. We talked about that a little bit. Diet on a diet side. I have to the maximum degree possible. I'm not perfect, but gotten rid of sugar. It's like sugar equals poison. It's indoor inflammatory. It causes cardiac disease. It feeds cancer. There are so many reasons. And so minimizing sugar and focusing on whole plant. More of a Mediterranean diet for me, given my genetics exercise. Tony is probably a lot more on exercise, but I lift twice a week and I try to get 10,000 steps a day. I do some lighter exercise, but it's every day. It's keeping the body in motion. One of the things I do, Rhonda, that I think is so critically important, is every year I go for a digital upload. What does that mean? Most of us are optimistic about our body. We think we're fine. Nothing. Nothing. You're fine. Keep going. You don't want to go to the doctor. Don't know. But what we have built and full disclosure, 29 are co-founders of this company. We talk about it in the book because I think it's so important people to know about a company called called Fountain Life and similar company called Human One Jevity and Health Nucleus. Once a year I go and get digital upload. I happened to have done it yesterday. So I went to the facility in Naples, Florida. I did a full body MRI, brain MRI, brain basculature MRI, and those MRIs now are very low false positives. But I'm looking for any aneurysms, looking for cancers, and it turns out historically for people in my age group, 2% have a cancer. They don't know about. 2.5% have an aneurysm in about 14.4% have something that's found that you need to take action on. And so my goal is to find it at the very beginning at state zero. Something is going to find something eventually. And I'm going to say thank you. And I'm going to take action immediately, try and get it. Besides the full body MRI, which is looking for cancers, we do a gray liquid biopsy, which can find 50 different cancers in your bloodstream. It turns out as cancer cells are growing and dividing very rapidly. Some of the cells rupture and you get free-floating DNA in the bloodstream will grow, which is now part of a lumina, started by Jeff Hoover. We can tell his story. They were able to determine and find from a blood draw. Any number of 50 different cancer DNA sequences. And tell you, you've got cancer someplace in your body than the MRI can help you localize and find it. Then we do another thing called a clearly coronary CT. So the company is called clearly. It's a coronary CT as part of this felt-life procedure. And it's an extraordinary AI-driven CT CT that is looking for soft plaque. So you hear about a calcium score and people go, oh my god, I've got a thousand calcium score. Well, that's okay because a high calcium score means that the plaque in your coronary arteries have been calcified and are unlikely to rupture. What really is a concern is soft plaque. And you've seen people with a zero in calcium score having a heart attack where the plaque in the side of the coronary arteries can rupture and then go and block the coronary artery, starve it from oxygen, your heart oxygen, and give you a heart attack. But with this AI algorithm does, is it's able to find the soft plaque and then you're able to monitor it and able to stabilize it. And there's a whole set of meds that I take. Besides that, there's a dexascan, there's your genome, your gut biology, your all of your blood tests, 150 gigabytes of data. And so I do that every year. And I feel antsy until I get a done. And now, you know, there's an amazing sense of relief. So I do that. There's a whole bunch of supplements we can talk about though it's as well. But I mean, it's still the basics. All right, it's still very good. I'd love to amplify that for a second for you. So, you know, the National Cancer Society did a study of 100,000 people. And they found that if you get something at stage three or stage four, you have an 80% chance of dying. I like it. Like it's 20% chance of living or what to do. But their point is well made. It's really hard to turn around. If you get a stage one or two, you have an 80 to 99 point 9% chance of survival. And the problem is we have certain tests mammograms, colonoscopies. But the ones that usually get us are the ones that we're not able to find. So this grail test is life-changing this area. And again, the gentleman who created it, lost his wife to cancer because they found it too late. And most of the heroes in the book have something in common. They lost a husband, a wife, a son or a daughter, and it pushed them to find answers that were beyond the standards of care for 20 or 30 years. And I'm a CTA test, the clearly test. You know, one of our partners, you know, he built 12 possible as owns 12 hospitals. He's so tired to sit care. That's why he's part of where the stil pinies found in life centers. And he calls me as a very understated guide because we have this new breakthrough and he said we've got first access. And he said Tony, you know, understates everything. He's talking real gentle. He goes, I really think it's one of the greatest breakthroughs in cardiology in 10 years. So him saying that you listen. So he explained to me how it opens up the arteries and how you get this score and they can predict the heart attack five years in advance and show you what to do. So I was with my 80-year-old stepfather, it happened to be visiting. A great man built his own company, one-br company was always pretty strong in built. But, you know, got older and people around him saying you're 80, got to get your will, got to get things together. I could see these last two or three years, just the energy dropping. Again, psychology is not just physiology. And so I said, hey, Dad, I said, I'm going to go do this test. I explained it. I said, look, we're both at a stage of life where we probably have some soft plaques, but those jaws where they are and what to do to clear it up. I said, why don't you come, he said, all right. And my father does the test. And he's clear. I mean, he's like he has no soft plaques at all. Zero. And his entire mindset changed. I was better than I was five years ago. I was doing really great. But he literally had nothing. And then while we're there, you know, there's some brain and techniques that are amazing, we work some of the world class athletes. I've had it done. You know, when you enter yourself, connective tissue can harden up and you don't get the fluid. You're on the organization or the traps and nerve. I had an ankle that for 15, 16 years is bothering. You couldn't touch it without the nerve spiring off. And they go in and they use ultrasound and they show exactly what's going on. They open it with this fluid. You know, an often they'll use something, you know, that will help heal that process to me in which process they use. But now I had it done. It was two years ago. My ankle's perfect. So I said to them, my dad, what makes him feel all this, pain and not able to walk so well, you hit problem. So he now knows his heart's perfect. So I said, Dad, what do you like these guys look at you here? And you know what I did to my ankle? So they looked him found two locations where it was all being locked down, open it up with some of this fluid. He about a half hour later he's walking perfectly. I mean, smoothly, zero pain. So we get on the plane. He crosses arms and he goes, you know, he's we'll talk about living 110 on a 20, 25 by that because you know, 20, my heart's perfect. You know, I'm walking perfect. I could live another 20 years. I could live a 200. You only know my daughter for 22 years. He goes like another lifetime. It's completely changes psychology. So it's not just about, oh my God, I need to do this. It's like ignorance is poverty. It's just pain. ignorance can be death. And today there's some tools there that can change it all. And they're very fundamental. One more hormones, every woman, you know, especially women in their 30s or 40s knows about hormones because of menopause. But hormone replacement therapy, he just laid the point where there's a problem. And now there as you know, there's precision in hormone optimization therapy. And even for men like we had a gentleman come in and he's 36 pounds overweight, listless, frustrated with his life, working out, or nothing working, said, if we look at your hormones. Because oh yeah, they're you're there fine, they're just fine. We look up and do the hormone testing is test out something was like 225. Well, most doctors won't intervene until it's like 175. Most men don't feel alive. If they're not in a 7 800 900 range. So small changes life in three months, he loses 36 pounds. He feels 10 years younger, your life changes. So it isn't just about avoid disease. It's about optimization. It's about what do you do right now that can give you the quality of life that maybe you had earlier, or you may be never had because things weren't about. Let's shift gears and talk about more big picture. Let's talk about the aging process in general. And Peter, I know you have some interesting opinions on this. I do. Yeah, so I mean one of the questions to ask yourself is why do we age? I mean you've got the same genome when you're born as you're doing your 20 and 40 and 60 and 80 and you lift 100, same genome at 100, right? 3.2 billion letters from your mom, 3.2 billion letters from your dad. Why don't you look like you're looking for when you're in 20s? Well, it turns out it isn't your genes. It's which genes are on and which genes are off. It's the regulation of your genes, which we call the epigenome from the Greek word for above, you know, the regulation above the genome. And it's a challenge to understand this and really it's, you know, the breakthroughs the last decade. And Dr. David Sinclair, who wrote incredible book lifespan, talks about this. It doesn't, it does a great job there. But your epigenome, the analogy I use in the book is that your genes which are not your destiny, they are part of a destiny, but not your destiny. And genes are sort of the keys of a piano. And your epigenome is the piano player. Now it turns out that the control of your epigenome in part is handled by seven, sir two in genes, seven, sir two in enzymes. And those sir two in have two primary functions in life. Number one, they control your epigenome. They control which your genes are on and which your genes are off. The other thing it does, which is massively significant for your life, is they facilitate DNA repair. And so as we're getting older and we're exposed to radiation, you know, flying in airplanes or smoke or, you know, chemicals in the environment, and we start getting accumulating more and more DNA damage, your sir two ends are spending more more time repairing your DNA instead of controlling which genes are off. And there's just this constant struggle back and forth. And as you get older, because the function of DNA repair is so critical, they're basically, they're basically distracted from their epigenome. And then, you know, Tony talked about the this concept of an AD and AD is sort of a fuel in the cell that powers these sir two ends. And we can talk more detail here, but the an AD in your mitochondria and side to your cells, you know, is pretty good in your in your teen's, 20's and 30's, but then in your 40's, into your 50's, it falls off rapidly. So just when you need more active sir two ends as the DNA damage is increasing, the fuel supply of the sir two ends starts plummeting. And then all of a sudden, you're not able to, you know, control your epigenome and we get aging. We get aging significant way. And so that's just fundamental right now. And the question is how do you change it? How do you fix it? How do you up regulate the NAD in your cells? And how do you, you know, really focus sir two ends and give them the ability to focus on both the DNA repair and the epigenome control? And one of the pieces that NAD does that I'm sure you probably know is that also affects the mitochondria directly, the ability to build energy in the cell. And they need the, you know, the sir two ends need the NAD for fuel, but NAD needs NMM as I know as the precursor to make all that possible. Well, you can go get NMM, but with Dr. Sinclair, we studied six companies, we took their products see how much in NM, are you really getting? And there was none in any of the products somewhere $30 a month, some or $120 a month. But that's the lab guy said, I mean, these people just cheats a lot of it comes from China. And he said, well, they could be some do, but he said, it breaks down in 30 to 45 days. So about time somebody gets this product, it's usually inert. I said, that's insane. So David has come up with his own products, but he's also done something even more amazing. He's patting up with a group called Eating Rock. And this group, well, let me first tell you. And then if you take an old mouse, meaning like a 70 year old equivalent is a human is about a 24 month mouse, as I'm sure you know. And you put them on, you know, a running platform, they can go maximum 1,000 a quarter of a kilometer. But a young powerful mouse can be four times a much a full kilometer. Well, 14 days on NMN. And now the NAD gets in is the absorptions about 30 percent. And that's same animal that's equivalent of 70 year old animal, we're one two to three kilometers, two to three hundred percent more than the youngest youngest animals. But then the question you got to ask yourself is, well, my studies are nice, but do they really translate to humans? So eating rock put together a hundred of some of the people we all know, some of the greatest researchers out there. And unlike some of these other companies, they have really focused on developing a product. And the product was, okay, highly create an NMN that can sustain and be more observable. And they came up with a synthetic crystallized form. It's called MIB626. And I'm not going to answer the rest of the world, but it's now out as about two weeks ago, the daily mail talked about it. It got out. They've been working with our special forces for two years. They proved it safely. They made proven it's efficacy. And the FDA now doing a parallel study. But this commander got so excited that he let the bean spill. And he's, I can't tell you the specifics, because I'm an investor in the company, but I can't tell you what he said. So you know, he acknowledged the fact that what they saw happening when mice happened with a strongest manning women that we know. They don't have that much more to get better. They're so strong. But he said they're endurance exploded. They're muscle development from the same stimulus increase significantly. But the most powerful thing was cognition. Because when you're out there under stress and you're exhausted, you can keep your brain together. So that the studies have been doing now because I'm sure you know what COVID it goes into your mitochondria and basically steal some of the energy. That's part of the problem with fatigue. So there's a phase three trial going on right now for prevent COVID and for long-term COVID. There's one on kidneys because the impact has with COVID. And then they have these endurance ones. So their projection right now is they believe they'll get approval in the next 24 months. Perhaps it's early as 18, but more likely 24 months. It will not be a neutral cynical. It will be a sustained, crystallized form that you could get from your doctor. So imagine there's a natural substance in your body that is dropped by more than 50 percent. And now you can supplement it with something that has 300 percent absorption more than you would have had before. That now turns on and off the right genes, reduces inflammation the body. We all know the basis of it. And helps you might have a more energy while simultaneously helping those two ones to clean up your DNA damage all one time. So these are some of the things that there's things you can do right now like in an end. But those are things that are coming in the next 12 to 36 months that are truly life-changing. That's one of the most exciting. Well I look forward to seeing that data and it's interesting. There's I've had sort of mixed feelings with not mixed feelings. I mean, my excitement and held holding my excitement back a little bit. I had David David on the podcast a couple of years back when we talked about a lot of this research. And there was some evidence that taking either an amen or nicotine, my ribonucleotide, ribonucleotide, and our, you know, can increase any D levels in humans in the blood. But there was a study, I think it was the rabbiwitz lab, published that this was an animal that even really high doses of both of these precursors, NAD precursors, both NR and NMN were unable to raise NAD levels in other tissues as how to deliver. So muscle brain, for example, there's no change. And there's a lot of mechanisms involved in that. But like you know, I'm wondering if some of the effects you were talking about also maybe indirect from raising it in the blood, perhaps maybe that's signal- very possible. But they've just got the blood back two weeks ago, including what's in the muscles. And again, I can't reveal because I'm not at liberty to do that. But what I can tell you is they're very excited about what they've seen. It's greater response than they had hoped for. Awesome, super cool. In addition, in addition to the certumans, which are one very important and interesting piece to the aging puzzle, I know that you are aware of some of the technology and research that have come out of one Carlos Belmontez lab at the Solkins Institute, where he is shown that you can take a phenotype for a mouse, which is an accelerated aging phenotype. And add these four macarons, the yammonoc effectors, which for people listening these are four different transcription factors that were discovered by Dr. Shinya and Yamanaka, was it 2006 or I got the Nobel Prize. For figuring out that these transcription factors, if you add them to an adult cell, a cell that's perhaps a skin cell or a kidney cell, and you can completely reprogram that cell into a pluripotin stem cell that can become any type of cell, like we were talking about, you know, the percent of being a source of. And so it sort of reprograms that epigenome that Peter you were talking about into a clean slate and allows it to then become a new cell type. But what, you know, Juan Carlos Belmontez lab, and there's some others that have done this in vitro, but he was really the first to show this in an animal. It's called interrupted cellular reprogramming, where you don't, you don't want to make an adult cell lose its identity. You wanted to just, you know, basically wipe the program free, but still be the same cell, so you wanted to become a younger, so to speak. So he showed this proof of principal study that adding these yammonoc effectors, but pulsing them throughout the life of these animals that are having an accelerated aging phenotype, he could essentially reverse aging. And it was to me, I mean, I got chills when I went to the study, but it's like, this is it. This is what I've been looking for, you know. You know about doctors and Claire's work, or they're storing their mice's vision, we're using the three of the four yammonoc effectors. Yeah, that's a double above that. Yeah, that's true. The audience though. I was the cover of Science last in December of 2020, it was like, you know, landmark work, where instead of using all four yammonoc effectors, David took a mouse that had aged out. It'd become blind with glaucoma and lost it's side. And he gave it three of the four yammonoc effectors without one of them that causes the cause cancer. And Lone Behold, the visual system of the mice, became young again to the point where they regain their vision. And it's since been repeated in the cardiac system of mice. And you know, David, George's George Church, another Harvard genomicsist who you know, is now working on doing this in dogs. And when you ask David and George when they think these yammonoc ad transcription factors, effectively a gene therapy to create this youthfulness when we might see that in humans, you know, in early trials, it blows me away when they say it's going to be this decade. That is, that is amazing. Totally amazing. I have a sort of tangent question and I I'm just out of my own curiosity Peter, want to know your thoughts on this because I know, you know, you know, there's a company forming that's recruiting some of the top aging researchers and recruiting them out of academia. In some cases, they're luring them with with an academic, it doesn't pay scientists, glamourous salaries, unless, you know, they discover, you know, start a company about a company and get lucky, whatever. And so they're getting the, you know, this comes getting the biggest names and aging and putting them all together. And I'm super excited because one of the, you know, big areas they're going to explore is this interrupted cellular programming. I'm just interested what your thoughts are the pros of cons of. Well, I got excited about it. I got excited about it too. And I know, you know, you're a millionaire in Jeff Bezos who's who funded this and in a friend of mine Morgan Levine who is at Yale got sucked up into this and she's now a founding principal moving to where you are down in San Diego. So it's very cool. I mean, this is in the context of probably five to ten billion dollars a year going into age reversal longevity health span expanding research. Right. So that's out of his labs. We just saw Brian Armstrong co-founder of Coinbase, starting new company called new limits to go after this, you know, using gene therapy to extend the help human lifespan. We've seen the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and and the Crown Prince in Dubai co-fund something called evolution to billions of dollars where they're, it's a nonprofit, but they're investing in extending the healthy human lifespan. I mean, you know, Tony and I talk about this is that health is in you wealth and I don't think there's a bigger marketplace on the planet. Right. It's like you still can't take it with you and if you could spend your money to extend your lifespan, it's massively viable. Now the question I think you're asking is is that going to make people less hungry to do this? Having a fact checkbook. I remember we were talking about this before, you know, Google created Calico, which you know stands for California longevity company or something like that. And you know, invested billions of dollars, they hired Art Levinson, who is also a chairman of Apple and was the CEO of Genentech to run Calico. And you know, the question is, are we seeing revolutionary research and breakthroughs coming out or are these kinds of companies or do we need this to be in the commercial in the in the university world? I'm a libertarian capitalist. I always think companies are going to go faster and take more risk and do this stronger work. So my bent is to be more excited that less excited. But then again, you know, I'm also doing an age reversal exercise because I want to get as many labs and companies around the world competing to solve this problem because, you know, every day I'm getting older. Well, you know, Eden Rock, the reason I want to be as invested in them, they have a different approach. They have an incentivized approach for all of them. So it's all based on rewards of performance. It's not a fact check. And personally, I'd prefer that strategy. I think the competitive strategy I have in a pretty short result to be rewarded is very different than somebody getting comfortable and starting taking their time due to research about being tied to an outcome or a measurable result. So I'm really impressed with what I've seen come out of there. But I'm thrilled that everybody's doing it and I think Peter's expires as a great gift because you know, these people competing and to to you know, at least historically as we all know, that usually brings the greatest result. But listen, having this much capital, this many brilliant main minds, all being driven to try to resolve the riddle of aging, it looks really damn good for us. You know, you might want to come back to Peter. I don't know, mentioning, you know, escape velocity and what that really means in terms of time. Yeah. So it's interesting. There's a concept called longevity escape velocity run. I know you know this, but your viewers and listeners, I think it's important. Today, we're seeing this massive investment in biotech and health tech. And it's lengthening our lifespan, right? So 100 years ago, the average lifespan was, you know, under 40 today. It's in the upper 70s. Hopefully soon, it will be into 90s and hundreds. But on the average every year that you live, science extends your life by about a quarter of a year. So for every four years, you're adding an additional year. Well, there's a concept called longevity escape velocity that Reikerswell talks about. Rei wrote our opening intro for the book. And the concept is that there's going to be a point as science continues to advance that for every year you're alive, science is extending your life for greater than a year. And all of a sudden, it's a departure where you're living long enough to live forever. And so the question I asked Rei was, when do you expect we're going to see longevity escape velocity? And I was sort of shocked by his answer. He said, probably in about a dozen years. But then when I was even more excited about what was, I, you know, I said, Reis, you know, an optimist about technology. He's got 30 years of predictions that have an 86% accuracy rate. If you go in Google Reikerswell's prediction. So he's pretty good at predicting things. And I went on to George Church at Harvard Medical School, I was intervening him for this book. And I just threw it us in Joe George. You know, you talk about longevity escape velocity. When do you think we're going to hit it? And he said, probably within 15 years. And I'm like, you know, just blew my mind. That idea that if we're able to stay healthy enough to really be in reasonable shape 15 years from now, that we're going to intercept technologies that can add additional decades onto our life. And then by the way, drink those additional decades, science isn't stopping. It's accelerating. So you're going to intercept even more technologies that are added decades to your life. So this is a magical time to be alive. And as I tell everybody in my family and friends in this book, you know, just don't want to die from something stupid in the interim. Where do you're helmet when you're skiing, where you're seatbelt, do your uploads, fine cancer. We're going to have it, you know, at the very beginning. We've talked a lot about, you know, cellular rejuvenation about the Yammonocca factors, epigenetic, clocroversal sort of two ends. All these really exciting aspects and technologies in the field of aging. And it's really striking in some ways that the mechanism for some of these facets of biological age, they already seem to be here in us. And yet evolution seems to have mostly withheld it from us. Have you, have you given any thought Peter? Yeah. Yeah. For good, like, what up? Why? Why? You know, first of all, you have to realize that there are species of on this planet. You know, the Bohedwell lives 200 years old. You know, the Greenland shark can live 500 plus years old. I remember when I was in medical school, I was watching this TV show on Long Live Sea Life. And I was saying, well, if they could live like hundreds of years, why can't we? And I remember the moment in time, I said, it's either hardware, problem or software problem. And we're going to be able to fix it. Well, that time, I believe, is now, it's the next few decades. And it turns out that we were never engineered to lift past age 30. You know, we would go into puberty at age 12 or 13 before birth control. We'd be pregnant by age 13 or 14. And then by the time you were 27, 28, 29 years old, your baby was having a baby. And if you wanted to perpetuate the human species, the worst thing you could do was to eat the food that was going to go to your grandchildren because they died. And, you know, ultimately, we were not intended to live past age 30. We would die, give, you know, the food supplied to our next generation. And so none of the factors that we're seeing in terms of dysregulation, loss of optimization of our hormones, growth factors, all of these things. You know, we, we dysregulate after the age of 30, we see this plummeting of the stem cell population, you know, stem cell exhaustion the body, because it was never selected against. And what we're trying to do now by instead of, you know, Darwinism, this is evolution by human intelligence. We're trying to like, you know, change the clocks and change the factors and add them back in and get us back to optimal state of what we were like in our 20s and 30s. And we're doing it by supplementation. Soon we'll be doing it using gene therapies and CRISPR. But the idea that, you know, there's some magic limitation that we can't overcome, I don't believe it. I do believe we're going to be able to add many decades, perhaps centuries on to our life. And that brings up a different question, which is, most people do not have a full life living to age 65 or 70 in terms of fulfillment. And so the real question is what do you do when life is no longer scarce? Because scarcity does create some sense of value, right? I want to take advantage of what's here. And you know, there's an old twilight zone piece that actually recurs well, told me about decades ago. And it goes like does it, some man who dies and he goes to have any, of course, he's a gambler. So heaven is Vegas. And where is he find himself the top of the number one hotel? He's in the presidential suite. He opens up the drawers and the cupboards and everything he has brand new suits and jewelry puts it on. There's credit cards and cash. He goes down. He starts to gamble. And sure enough, he gambles playing 21, 21, 21, blackjack, blackjack. You wins continuously. Suddenly, there's a group of women around him. Now he goes and rolls the dice. He's playing crap. He wins. He wins. He wins. He wins. He's out of his mind. He goes home to that night. He's not alone. He's quite happy with the people that are joining him in the situation that you're joining him. He wakes up the next morning. He starts to whole thing all over again. After three weeks of doing this, he starts to get pissed. He gets angry. And at one point, you win. You win. You win. You win. And he says, I always win. And he says, I want to talk to that angel. I want to talk to that angel. And they bring this man who looks like Guylamardy and a taxi. He walks up and he says, sirs, they're a problem. He said, yes, he said, I'm constantly winning. I win every time. He said, listen, I wasn't that good a person. I don't like this. He said, I'm not supposed to be in heaven. And the angel said, who said you're an heaven. And the idea is that if we just got everything we wanted, if there was no limitation on everything, would we find the meaning? And I think that's the real going to be the next lesson for humanity. It's finding how we use this additional time and these additional resources or something greater than ourselves. Because what the fills people is not just hanging out and living. When you look at it, it's one primary emotion. It's progress. It's feeling like you're growing and because you're growing up, something to give. If you don't grow, it doesn't matter how much money you have, doesn't matter. And we build knowledge, you have many stars on your chart. It doesn't matter. You will not be fulfilled because what makes us a live is growing. You're looking at people who achieve a goal and they have one or two reactions. Oh my God, this is amazing for a moment. Is this all there is? Or a goal, whether I can't even believe I achieved this after all this in the thrill, but for how long? A year of happiness? Nine months, six months, three months, three weeks, three days, three hours, most people are somewhere between three hours and three months. Because we're not made to sit at the table of success too long. We get fat and we get bored. We need progress. We need to grow because when we grow, we have something to give. And that's what makes life meaningful. So in Peter and I were together and talking to all these experts who are doing a generous medicine and Peter, you know, what his passion says, how many want to live to be 120 years old? Two thirds of people did not raise their hands. Because in Peter was, I remember a press conference, I figured you predict this. I said, you can predict this because most people's idea of 120 is, you know, I lost my memory on a look so good and an ex so good, but it's like there has to be a deeper meaning and we have to be able to shift that. And I think that is the newest opportunity that humanity will have in the coming decades. You bring up a couple of what are you going to do, Tony, when you're like 150 or mean. I don't know. I got a 10 month old daughter. I got five kids and five grandkids. I got a 48 year old daughter. I got a 10 month old daughter. So I'm happy to hand a hundred and be vibrant and alive. I don't have to be old enough. But if I am trust me, there's always something to learn and grow. That's not something that's ever going to go away. Well, you brought up another really important point was the happiness and the fulfillment. You know, there was a P&A study published back in 2019 that found a direct association between happiness and longevity and people that had the highest levels of happiness lived the longest. They were more likely. And this was true for both men and women. They were born right. And optimist would go on her too. Optimist. Yes. That was the this was the study. Optimist. And I guess they're an optimism and happiness. And whether or not you're right about your optimism, just having that mindset is a positive indicator. People need a compelling future. Anyone can deal the tough today. If there's a compelling amount of energy and health, it makes it a lot easier. If you have a psychology, that's optimistic and makes you find a deeper or a greater meaning. This is one of the things we taught me. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. One of the things we taught about the book is, you know, if you're in pain, the last thing you want to do is add a decade to your life. Right. And it's really about giving yourself a life where you've got the vitality, your pain free. And if you have those two things, plus your cognition and your mobility, you know, everything is possible. Your next career. Right. Your next startup, your next moon shot, whatever it might be, but that's fundamental. You know, when I talk to people who are youthful, independent of their age, that's the characterization. They love life. They're excited to see what happens next. When people are in pain, you know, the idea of another decade of life is just miserable for them. Yeah. I mean, I think the pain definitely can and blunt some of that, you know, but there's also as Tony was mentioning that that learning aspect that drive that passion, that thing that you feel like you have a purpose in life, you know, and of course pain can, you know, play it can, it can, it can affect all of that, that is well, but, but there are people with a men's pain who live a very long life because they have a meaningful life. They have something live for it. There's any common denominator in my experience of people who have a great experience of life. There's gratitude as a base somewhere inside them, but it's also that they're living for something more than themselves because it doesn't take that much to meet your own needs. But if there's something you love more than yourself, your children, your family, your community, something you want to serve for humanity, there's just a different burst of energy and a liveness that seems to sustain people. That sense of purpose, I believe, is the single most important component because you do a lot of people don't take care of their body, but they're crippled up, but they still make things happen because they have that internal drive. And that's why the last two chapters of the book are how you ignite that, how you take control of that. It's a very important part. Peter, I want to just for a second, shift gears and ask you a question again out of my own curiosity. Anyone that knows anything about you knows, you're very passionate about human space travel. And you know, there have been a variety of studies that have sort of been on my radar over the years that have looked at astronauts that have gone on the international space station and then stayed there for six months through year and how they're being exposed to cosmic radiation and other types of solar things. And you know, essentially being in space is causing accelerated DNA damage. There's chromosomal instability. It's affecting the aging process. And so if there's any hope that humans not only are going to spend time on the international space station or in space, but have it other planets or, you know, get a point where we're traveling to other planets. We need to like get this aging thing figured out because, you know, that's going to be an important component. It is, you know, actually it's funny because space has always been one of my higher-purpose drivers for longevity. It's like I really want to go and live on the moon for a while ago and my asteroids want to go and build space coins. I truly do. It's like the nine-year-old in me, right, that was got its vitality and energy from that scientific documentary called Star Trek. The end of the day, those things are really happening in the next few decades. So I want to see them and participate in them and longevity, you know, the idea of longevity and health span is driven for me in part to see this future. Plus, I have two-teneral boys, which, you know, I want to see there in the next 50 years, 100 years. What gives me hope in this Ronda is another friend, Buzz Aldrin, who's now in 92 years old. Right, and the first Apollo 11 mission. He said numerous missions in the space. He's been outside of the Van Allen belts walking on the moon, you know, at least nine days outside the Van Allen belts going there, landing, coming back. So he's had a very high exposure radiation. And of course, we talked about earlier that what drives aging, not totally, but to a large degree, is this competition between the Sir Tuins repairing DNA as you get more and more damage over the years and controlling your epigenome. So DNA damage does cause aging of all tissues in the body. So yeah, we're going to have to deal with it. Maybe we're going to deal with it by getting decent shielding. Maybe we're going to deal with it by actually adding better radiation repair genes, and, you know, by genetically engineering, a new generation of humans versus just assuming we're going to keep what we've evolved here on this planet and take it to the stars. You guys mentioned this in your book, the gene therapy and probably one of the most, the best ones that we have available today is the CRISPR gene therapy. What do your thoughts? I mean, first of all, what's your favorite story? Chris success story for CRISPR in humans? Good night to Jack for one moment. I'm so sorry, but I have a live broadcast. I've got to go to. So I've got to sign off. So I'll leave you with Peter and I really enjoyed our time run. That as I always do. Likewise, thanks Tony. Thank you so much. See you, brother. Thank you. So to pick up on that, you know, CRISPR's extraordinary, right? This is the one the Nobel Prize in 2022 incredible women, Jennifer Dowdner, here from the UC California system, part of the Gladstone Institute. We, you know, the conversation on CRISPR, which is life-changing, is that we can use this technology to not treat disease, but cure diseases. So we're seeing CRISPR treatments and CRISPR cures for sickle selenemia, for thalosemia, which I think is extraordinary. We're seeing CRISPR now being used in a trial to cure someone who's got HIV, who's going to treat the infection, who's got AIDS. We just saw CRISPR being used to edit the PCS K9 enzyme in the liver. It's being done among these as not to meant to humans yet, but it's as the demonstrated ability to reduce your LDL levels by 60%, which means you're knocking out a lot of heart disease, both cardiovascular disease and stroke. We've seen CRISPR being used within injection in the back of the eye to cure a specific form of congenital blindness. I mean, I think we're going to see in the next decade at most 15 years, CRISPR being used to basically treat and get rid of in individuals almost every genetic disease. We're going to put genetic disease behind us. That's just incredible. What do you think about using CRISPR gene therapy for tuning up our longevity genes? I mean, the curing disease is one thing, right? I'm much more experimental. I think than most, it's funny, Tony and I both are experimental in our lives. We call each other our code, you know, chief guinea pigs. And I'm, you know, what I've been working to do is try and find the smartest positions I can bring them in sort of an advisory board. There are things today like solidic medicines, right, rapid-myosin and and, and bastin, of course, it in. There's other treatments like total plasma exchange that are being experimented with. One of my other favorite gene therapies to go back to that is some work that was done by Deepak Shiva Stava. We talk about him in the book he's the president of the Glasson Institute. And when you have a heart attack and your heart muscle dies because of a lack of oxygen, what grows back is a fibrotic tissue, fibroblast. And what Dr. Shia Stava has done is used gene therapy and I call it sort of cellular alchemy to go and convert those fibroblasts into myocytes. So if you have a heart that has a very poor injection fraction because it's not able to really contract and pump the heart out, be blood out because it's not enough myocytes cardiac muscle tissue there. The idea of going to the fibroblast tissue which is just connective tissue and then basically take them back to a level of pleuripotency and then convert them back to myocytes for me sounds, you know, magical. This is the kind of stuff that's going on that I think we're just at the beginning of it. Fascinating. You mentioned Plasma Extinge. What's the latest on that? I mean, I know I've been following the research a lot of it coming out of the Convoys lab at UC Berkeley, out of Harvard. I know Amy Wager has had done some work a while ago, but you know this idea of taking you know factors in the blood, either factors in young blood and helping you know to reverse aging in older blood or opposite, you know older blood has factors that can accelerate aging and so get rid of the factors. So yeah, I mean we talk about I was so in a different part of total Plasma Extinge but I'll go into what you're saying which is the early parabiosy experiments and this was done years ago and Bob Hary, who I mentioned earlier, did a lot of this early work as well. Amy Wager's lab, if you mentioned it at Harvard, just done a lot of the pioneering work. If you take the circulatory system of a young mouse and an old mouse, you put them together, the old mouse gets younger and the young mouse gets older and there was a great parody of this in that in the television series Silicon Valley, which I'm sure you've seen where the billionaire person has his blood boy who is you know 20 years old and they've exchanging blood. Well it's not that not that easy or safe or doable, but what Amy found in her lab was a certain factor called GDF-11 that goes down as you age and it appears that maybe there are factors that pull a GDF-11 out of circulation, maybe there are antibodies, maybe there are the factors. And if you give GDF-11 to older mice, it seems to have all the benefits that this blood exchange has, this young blood has. And so there is a company today spun out of Harvard that is called Oliven, that is actually developing GDF-11 and taking it into clinical trials against a number of different chronic diseases. And the idea that we can isolate that factor that makes the old mice young again and just give that factor by itself is fascinating. Exciting. Yeah. I mean, it's all of these things, right? It's not just one approach and again billions of dollars going in, the biggest marketplace in the world. And there's nothing more valuable than a person's health, the old saying which I love, the person who has their health as a thousand dreams and the man who a woman who does not has but one dream is so true. There's one other area I wanted to kind of talk to you about. I when I was skimming through your book, you know, you've been Tony's book, Life Force. There is the organ regeneration. And I really excited because Anthony, Dr. Anthony Atala, who my husband sort of months, a few months, he probably maybe a year, a year, a year, a year, a year ago. He sent me this YouTube link. You've got to see this guy, you've got to see what he's doing, you've got to get him on the podcast. This is amazing. And I watched this YouTube video and I was like, holy crap, this guy is like growing organs and like transplanting them into people like Nat, like he's been doing this for years. Do you talk a little bit about it for people that's having our hearts lit? Yeah, so Dr. Anthony Atala, who's brilliant researcher at Wake Forest, for over a decade has been using stem cells and basically differentiating those and building organs. Now there's simple organs. It's like the bladder. It's like a urethra. It's like an esophagus. They're mostly tubular or or containment. They're not complex organs. But he's been able to do this as well as basically creating skin that can be, you know, sort of create full dermis thickness and then use for transplantation. And that's amazing. But what we've featured in the book in addition to Dr. Atala's work are two incredible heroes. One of the things we always try to do is highlight the heroes. One of my, there are two people I'll mention it's Martine Rothblatt and Dean Cayman. Martine is extraordinary. I've known Martine for 40 years now and she's known early in her life for the creator of XM radio and serious radio. She was trained as a lawyer, was in the regulatory realm working on satellites. And when Martine was probably in her early 30s, her daughter, Genesis developed something called pulmonary fibrosis and Martine learns that this is a fatal disease and Genesis has, you know, a single digit years to live. Martine being the extraordinary entrepreneur and action taker that she is basically quits her job, takes all the capital from her company's going public and says, I'm going to cure my daughter's disease, which is, you know, an extraordinary moonshot vision. Well, Martine is zero background in biology and medicine. She starts with a high school biology book, Ghost of the Medical Library, starts researching pulmonary fibrosis. Every time she finds a work she doesn't understand, she looks it up, she looks at the references and she starts to build a body of knowledge. Eventually, she finds a potential drug in one of the farm companies. I don't think it's a member which one. And she goes in after many months of pleading and begging and getting advisors in is able to pry this drug out of the pharma. It's a orphan drug that no desire to go forward with it. And when she bought the rights to it, she got a little packet of white powder. Long story short, she took the drug through clinical trial. And ultimately, she was able to cure her daughter's disease, not cure her disease, but treat her disease to the point where she was able to survive longer. But then she said, I need a cure. I need to be able to create lungs for people with pulmonary fibrosis because just treating them with a drug along the way is not going to be sufficient. So she follows up on a number of approaches, including like Anthony Atala, 3D printing organs. But the one that's most amazing we talk about in the book is she partners with Craig Venter. On the notion that pig organs are the same size as human organs. A pig heart liver lung kidney is roughly the size for an adult men. And she said, what if we can humanize those pig organs? Change the surface antigens, go in there and get rid of the endogenous retrovirus. And so she said on this mission probably about six, seven years ago. And just recently demonstrated transplanting a modified pig heart into the first human recipient. And so this is the potential for an infinite supply of organs. The second hero is a guy named Dean Cayman who I love. He's one of the most brilliant scientists on the planet. Of course, Dean Cayman and Martin both know each other very well. Dean is most brilliant engineer in the planet. 1500 patents the creator of the robotic luke arm, the Segway, the insulin infusion pump. He about two years ago gets a contract from the government to build a machine that can manufacture any organ. Right. So I want you to imagine this. He gets about $150 million with a capital. He pulls together $150 or so partner organizations, universities, companies. And they set out on the vision and the notion that what if you could take induced pluripotent stem cells and IPS cells, right, converting your skin cells. We talked about earlier in the show, into induced pluripotent stem cells, put that in one end of the machine. The machine then expands the stem cell line, and then differentiates those stem cells into particular types of tissues, and then begins to 3D print an organ. And the idea is, well, what Dean has done already is actually go from these pluripotent stem cells to a bone ligament bone construct that can be used for knee or ankle replacement. And what he's working on next with Doris Taylor, who's with a dominant thinkerousness area, is to generate pediatric hearts to go from a pluripotent stem cell on one end, two and a half, three months later, a beating pediatric heart at the other end that can be then transplanted to a child who needs it. I mean, this is miraculous stuff. Absolutely exciting, miraculous story. I mean, I didn't read the whole chapter, so I was just kind of skimming through such super, super interesting stuff. What do you think, like, if all this stuff that we've been talking about hands out, we start to get these technologies and they're safe in humans and we can help extend their health span, extend their lifespan. How do you think, have you given any thoughts to how the incentives might be aligned between insurance companies, governments, health care to divide these types of longevity treatments once available? Yeah, I think that's a really important, one of the societal implications who gets it, is it only for the wealthy and so forth? So here's a stat. There was about six months ago a study done out of London School of Business, Harvard, and Oxford that said, adding just one year of healthy lifespan to every human on the planet is worth $38 trillion, the global economy, just one year of healthy lifespan. Add to that, the idea that today we're seeing the bleed to hire people is getting more difficult than ever before. The great resignation and so forth, we need people to be in the game longer. I was interviewing Elon Musk about nine months ago, we were announcing a $100 million carbon extraction exercise that he's funded to full gigatons of carbon out of atmosphere. And I asked the question which I thought was important to people to hear about, because I know his opinion on this, which I agree with, I said, are you concerned about overpopulation of the planet? And his answer was no, I'm concerned about the exact opposite, which is we're going to have a massive population drop-off that will probably peak at nine and a half billion over there about, so that we're very happy to climb you to the other side, because people are not having babies. Back 50 years ago, the average number of children per family was like 5.4 children per family. Today globally, it's at about 2.4 in the United States in Japan, in many parts of Europe, China were below the replacement level. So, and in the pandemic, it could even drop even more. So, ultimately, we're going to need people to stay in the game to keep provide the labor that plus robotics and AI. Now, the question is, is this going to be only available for the wealthy? Are these treatments? So, if I had to guess on what kind of a treatment is going to give us a a-dreversal kind of treatment? And this is, I'm working on a $101 million age reversal exprise right now. The primary funder for a shipwills in the founder of Lulemon wanted to be larger than Elon's prize, so it's 101 million versus 100 million, which is I love. I'm expecting it's probably going to be one by a gene therapy approach. Very similar to what what Davidson Clared did with rejuvenating the vision systems of mice. And so the question is, in volume, how much could a gene therapy cost? Because today, a gene therapy for rare diseases can be a half a million dollars to a couple million dollars. But it turns out that if you look at what Moderna and Pfizer did, effectively is a type of gene therapy. It's Microsoft-Malipid capsules with mRNA in them. And what we've seen is that if you do it at a high enough scale, the gene therapy gets down to 20 bucks. So that's the cost of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, which is not exactly gene therapy, but it's at the same complication level to gene therapy. It's funny because I've often thought about the silver lining of the pandemic, and to me one of the silver linings is that this whole field of the mRNA vaccines are, it's just being catapulted and so much research is going on. And this is the mRNA vaccines have been shown in many studies over the years. To treat things like muscular or dystrophy in animals, like you're basically improving the dystrophin protein. So this is more, again, it's kind of a type of gene therapy quote unquote, but it's really at the protein level. But that's fascinating because I haven't thought about that. Right. If you think about the scale that we realize when we're treating with these complex treatments at the billion-person scale, the cost for treatment gets minimously low. Right. It's the scaling of exponential technologies. I'll give you another example. Vaccines, which have had a mixed public opinion history, I think people have done a lot more respect for vaccines over the last two years. We're going to see these vaccines being used in a wide range of things, deaf on Bonsal as a friend, the CEO of Moderna, and talking to him about where he's going next. Besides stem cell exhaustion, one of the things that occurs as we get older is we have immunoxos. Our immune system, which is dealing with all of these viruses that you've gotten over the course of decades, starts to get exhausted because it's trying to suppress those viruses. And what happens is if your immune system isn't up to stuff, that's when cancer is the extent that you develop cancers. So one of the things Moderna wants to do is really go after all of the CMV and herpes and HIV and great vaccines against all these viruses to really knock them out of your system. One of the companies I had a chance to co-found and I serve as Vice-Chairman of a company called Vaccinity, what public earlier this year. I'm blown away by what the team is doing. What vaccinity we have our own COVID-19 vaccine, which figures cross will, will, I'm sure what I can say about it. But we besides vaccines against those infectious diseases, the vaccines we've been building are against endogenous proteins in the body. What we've done with this a multi-top peptide vaccine, what we're going to be able to do with this vaccine is train your immune system to go after targets in the body like beta-amaloid, we have a vaccine against Alzheimer's, a vaccine against Parkinson's, a vaccine against migraine. I take today, I have hyperclistorymia. I take a monoclonal antibody called RAPATHA that this antibody is manufactured in a VAT in New York. I get an injector in every two weeks on inject about five mls of this these antibodies into my leg. And those antibodies go to my liver and they block a protein called PCSK9, which is the protein that produces LDL, the bad type of cholesterol in your bloodstream. And this repath that reduces my cholesterol, my LDL levels by a half, and it's great. Fantastic shape when I'm taking that. The problem is it costs me like $14,000 a year for this, and it's not a first line of defense. It's a last line of defense. Everyone's on stent instead, which other own problems. So what we've been working on at VACCINITY is we're just entering the beginning of trials. Now is a vaccine against the PCSK9 protein. So instead of me buying these monoclonal antibodies that are manufactured very expensively someplace else, what if instead I get myself a vaccine that trains my immune system to manufacture the same exact antibodies against PCSK9. Instead of doing the injection every two weeks, it's twice a year. And instead of $14,000 bucks, if it's a hundred bucks, right? Now all of a sudden, we can vaccinate people against heart disease against stroke and cardiovascular disease because they're not don't have the build up in their arteries. And then it becomes massively preventative. And so this is the future of healthcare where today healthcare is about treating chronic disease and just keep the hit in this state of your body, the state of disrepair. And the future is going to be no, we're going to use CRISPR and gene therapy to cure one injection and your cured or vaccinate you. So you never develop the disease in the long run. And that's the potential that we talk about. So in life worse, it goes from everything from the basics of sleep, food, exercise, you know, two liters of water a day, minimum to the extreme of gene therapies and CRISPR and vaccines. And it's just an extraordinary time to be alive. I'm the vaccine-y stuff is super cool and exciting. Thank you so much for sharing all that. And it's funny. I'm not a medical doctor and I certainly can't give any medical advice, but I've reviewed a lot of the literature on statins versus this, this these PS 3K9 inhibitors. And it's just to me. I'm like, oh, why is this not the first line of defense? And I mean, first exactly. And it's like, oh, it's price. That's what it is. It's cost. And it's really unfortunate. It's really unfortunate. So that would be pretty, a pretty big breakthrough if you guys were able to do that. I don't know how far along you are. I'm not, but I have great hope and expectations. It's not a matter of if it's going to be a matter of one. And for Parkinson's, are you, is it Alpha Sonuclean or what? It's exactly Alpha Sonuclean. It's exactly where we're targeting. And so we're entering phase two in that Alpha Alzheimer's entering phase three Parkinson's entering phase two. It's backed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation as well. How's it looking? How's Parkinson's? Is it looking promising? Great. We just, we just opened our phase two trial now. So, you know, fingers crossed the data from phase one is fantastic. You know, the thing we talk about in the book is it's not like there's only one approach to each of these chronic diseases. There's doesn't. And you know, I remember when the pandemic first hit us and you remember this as well. And everybody's just scared out of their minds. It's like, oh my god, this is crazy. What's going to happen? You know, you couldn't go find masks in a place or even just, you know, sanitizer. It was insane, right? There's early days. And people were getting more and more scared and it was a pandemic of fear. And what, what folks didn't realize was that this was a clarion call and it mobilized tens of millions, hundreds of millions of scientists and engineers, positions, nurses, researchers around the world to attack this thing. And we did it in record speed, right? You know, the sequence gets emailed over from Wuhan to our labs. I know from talking the stuff on there was a vaccine designed within 24 hours. And then within a year, manufacturing is ramped up. And, you know, everybody's getting their, their emergency use authorization. And all of a sudden, we're beginning the vaccinated the world can times faster than ever before. And so this kind of speed is possible. And I think we're going to start to see this against cancer and dementia and cardiovascular disease. And then, you know, it's like, what do you want to do with the extra decade or two? Right. Well, I think this is a great place to end this episode. Thank you so much, Peter, for coming on. Antoni, as well. As you mentioned, the book is Lifeforce. You're on Twitter. Yeah, at Peter at Peter, DMN this on Twitter and Instagram. And I put out a couple of blogs a week on this on these topics. Just go to DMN this dot com. Also, one other thing I'll just mention, something I, I, I, I created for myself because it's so difficult to keep up with all of this information. I built an AI engine that searches the world's news journal articles, tweets, magazine, newspapers, looking for breakthroughs in the health and longevity. And it screens it for validity. And then it generates a summary of the top 15 articles a day for me. And it's a short summary that I can read and click back in. I get this is I call it, it's longevity inside or dot org. It's free. Check it out. It makes me so optimistic about the future. Because just the stuff that I'm seeing every day just blows me away continuously. And then there's lots of resources at at lifeforce dot com as well. I'm going to check that out for sure. The, the longevity and the longevity and the longevity and the, and Tony's also on Twitter at Tony Robbins. He's on Instagram. Absolutely. And yes. All right. Thank you so much to you both. And hopefully we'll get together again soon. I look forward to it, Rona. Be well. Thank you.

It's really about the total amount of protein you're gonna get in the day. And then the next one would be even spacing and I'd say, yup, and then the next one would be sort of protein quality where we get into some of the more nuanced talk about protein. And then you can dial it down from there. Most people I talk to, I just say, do you go to the gym and they're like, yeah, I'm like how many times they're like, well, once or twice, this maybe you could go two or three times, that would probably be a much bigger benefit than I need to divide my protein three times across the day. So, biggest reduction in risk, bar none, is always going from nothing to doing something. Hi, everyone. I'm very honored to be sitting here today with our podcast guest, Dr. Stuart Phillips. Dr. Phillips is the director of the Physical Activity Center of Excellence at McMaster University on Ontario Canada. As we are going to learn today, he is his research and his lab has made pretty big contributions to our understanding of muscle proteins synthesis. And I'm pretty excited to dive into all that research. I've spent the last week reading, review articles, and studies. Yes, so I mean, now I feel like I've just learned a tremendous amount compared to what I knew last week. So, I mean, it's just, actually. So, I don't mean to mean to start off talking about muscle mass and why, you know, we hear a lot oftentimes physicians almost everyone knows about body mass and body fat percentages and BMIs and what's a healthy BMI and what's not. And, but muscle mass is also important. So, maybe we can talk about why. Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think when you step on a scale, everybody at least should realize that the sum of all of your body, so we'll be say compartments, is what you see on the scale. And most people can appreciate, obviously, they're worried about their body fat content. But a large part of what's registering on the scale is actually what we call lean mass or some of it is muscle mass. And then, obviously, your bone mass as well. So, I think most people would probably understand, we're about almost 70% by content water. And most of that water's inside ourselves and a lot of it's inside muscle mass. So, what we call muscle mass or lean mass is very hydrated tissue. Fat mass is actually not. And it's preservation muscle mass, at least as we get older, is critical for health. I think it's one of the things that's lost on a lot of people to say, well, that's great that you're maintaining your body weight, but if we don't maintain our muscle mass, it has some pretty deleterious consequences. And muscle mass correlates, I mean, specifically with mortality, right? I mean, inverse correlation. Absolutely. I mean, I think that the outward manifestation of muscle mass is obviously our ability to move around strength, getting up out of a chair, that sort of thing. And at some stage in our life, you're gonna have to be able to do these sort of rudimentary activities of daily living. And once you can't do them, then you need somebody to care for you. So, it's not surprising that there are, as you say, correlations between muscle mass and mortality. It's vitally important, Oregon, if you look at it that way. I think the frailty index, which is, there's a lot of measures that go into that, and frailty indexes, as you get older, at least, over 65, it's a pretty good predictor of mortality. And muscle mass is a important component of the, am I right? Absolutely, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think all of these definitions, you say frailty, I mean, the precursor would be sarcopeneo or loss of muscle mass as we age. All have a component of measuring, lean mass or muscle mass, and it's predictive of a downward decline, as we get older for sure. I've seen some studies that have also correlated, specifically lower body, I think strength of lower body with improved cognition. And I was wondering, just for me, I don't like why not upper body, why lower body? Like do you think there's, is there a potential, like people that are also doing cardio or getting some lower body strength? And do you have any idea? Yeah, I'm not sure I can answer the question, but it's interesting to note, you know, some of these correlations come up and the, you know, when it's a correlation, obviously it's association and people wanna know, you know, is it causative, right? And you still, you always kind of hedge your bets. And what I say to people, I said, I don't know, but it's not a bad goal to aim for it has stronger legs and be able to move around. And yeah, if it correlates with, you know, improved cognition and mental function is you age, you know, if that's a connection between the two, it's not a bad goal to aim for whether one causes the other, I can't say, but yeah, I'll take it if it's a, if it's a causative relationship for sure. What, what percent of muscle mass do humans lose, like per year and when does that start? Like, ancient sarcopenia? Yeah, this, this is the, you know, I would say, $64,000, although that wouldn't get you much these days, probably more question, I suppose. Most people will say that somewhere in your 30s or 40s, you're beginning to lose muscle mass. My own personal opinion is it's somewhere probably closer to about 56 or thereabouts, but that's personal. But something, you know, probably for most people that you can see in their 40s. And usually what we say on a population level, it's about a 1% loss of muscle mass per year, and about a 1 to 3% drop in strength or power. So the muscle mass decline is actually slower than we lose strength. And strength is, as I say, is the, I would manifestation of muscle, but it must speak then to the quality of the muscle you have and your brain's ability to be able to talk to muscle and get you to do things. So as much as we can do to try and slow that, that would be beneficial as we get into a older age. For sure. Yeah, and I definitely want to get into all that stuff, what, you know, how we can counter circumpini and loss of muscle mass. Do you, the building up of the muscle reserves, not like that's something I've heard you talk about, or you know, it's something that's, a common knowledge to some degree. What does that mean? And like, is it really important to do that before a certain age? And if you don't do that, can you still start later in life? Yeah, yeah, great question. I mean, I think the parallel, the most people are most familiar with, that we can sort of pick on and say, you know, women in particular are told that we can build bone mass up until probably about 30. Men, it's about the same. That when women head towards the menopausal transition, that they're definitely going to lose bone mass, you want to start at a higher level as possible. I mean, everybody after the menopausal transition loses bone, they're both the same rate. So you really would like to be on a higher plateau before you get there. I think the concept is entirely similar with muscle. The good news is that probably even past your 30s into your 40s, 60s, probably even into your 70s, we can still gain a little bit of muscle. We can definitely gain strength by concerted, resistance exercise usually. So you probably have a much bigger window to accumulate the muscle that you have, but it's the same concept. You'd like to go into older age when you're beginning to lose muscle at a higher level because then you're starting to decline from a higher plateau. So it's a similar concept. I don't know that we know exactly how much and when, but there were even studies in non-ogenarians, people in their 90s lifting weights, and they can get stronger. Now gaining muscle, not so much, but they get function back. So there's some adaptability left in the system, in a muscle sense that isn't there and with bones, for example. And at the end of the day, as you're mentioning, being able to get up out of your chair and like these sorts of important little, like everyday activities that we take for Gantama and you're younger, can make a difference when you're older and you fall and break a hip and then you kind of go into this downward spiral. So strength does make a difference with that, right? Like just having even if you're not gaining muscle muscle, being able to have the strength to do that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that that's maybe a little bit overstated with the importance of muscle mass, not that it's not important, but the function and the outcome, so the strength and the power is really the key point. Even something as simple as walking speed, or what we call normal gate speed. And the example I like to give is to say, you're standing in an intersection, the walk signal comes on. And there's a certain distance you've got across in a certain amount of time. So you need a certain gate speed. And if you're not that the motorist, hopefully, wouldn't stop. But you're under pressure to make it across an intersection, let's say. It's important. And we know fully that once you get to a certain level of strength, your gate speed drops, it becomes more difficult to do activities of daily living. And then you're looking at full time institutionalized care. Right, quality of life, down and it kind of goes back to that concept of improving health span, right? You know, basically being able to delay the onset of these age-related diseases, the diseases that hit us later in life, any possible way that we can, absolutely, and who don't necessarily live much, much longer. Yeah. In some cases, delaying those diseases, you might get a gear too, right? I mean, yeah. I think it's not tried to say, but everybody's like, well, what's exercise going to give you? When we do have, and again, it's observational data, of course, that once you hit that sort of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous, whichever, okay, that's the guidelines. And I think, you maintain your strength. And so make sure you do those two days of strength and exercise a week. We get on average when you look at, you know, population data about four extra years of life. So I think most people would take that. If that were a pill, you know, I wouldn't be sitting here, I'd be Skype and then from to heatier something. And most people obviously realize then that your health span that's associated with that as longer as well. So it's time in your life that's longer, but it's time in your life that is spent in good health. And for most people, that's a better quality of life. Absolutely. So let's talk about some of the major signals and inputs that regulate muscle proteins. And since this is, which, yes, we can talk about how much that correlates with muscle mass and strength. So you've published, I mean, let's first talk about recommended daily allowances for protein entanes. For adults in the United States and Canada, it's about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. Correct. And I don't know what people are actually consuming. Maybe you can shed some light onto that. What they're actually consuming. But also like what you're, I know you have thoughts because you publish them on whether or not it's scientifically sound that number specifically. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, one of the things that precursors are like to start off with, to say people say, you know, how is protein different than everything else that we eat and what does it do? And so I often explain to people that carbohydrates and fats, that's fuel. You put that in, and you burn it, or we store it. And unfortunately, we're really good at doing that. But protein is something that when you ingest it, your body has to use it. And it can't, there's not like a little sort of place that you can store away the building blocks of protein, which are amino acids, and kind of use them for later. Although your muscle is sort of a reservoir of that. So it does turn over a little bit. And then so when we think about it from a daily recommended intake, or what we call the recommended dietary allowance, it's the amount of protein that you need to ingest to replace all of the protein and amino acids that your body loses. And most of it is lost in urine as you read. And I say to people, I've stopped trying to fight too much against this because I would actually be happy if they just changed the name from recommended dietary allowance to minimal dietary intake. So first, I don't think it should be recommended because it's too low. And I think you should be allowed to eat more. So point eight, I think, is to me, that's the sort of bottom level by end. That's where you need to start and then build up from there. So most of the data that we have and it's not ours, there's lots of other people have contributed to this as well. Suggest that a minimum might be close to about 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. And athletes and even older people could probably benefit even from going up from that level up to 1.6. At a certain point, I don't think you can put too much protein back into the system and the system would hang on to it. So every species is evolved away of getting rid of extra protein, fish, it's ammonia, birds, it's uric acid, mammals, it's urea. So there's an upward limit. But most people, depending on what surveys you look at when they're younger and even middle-aged, are probably doing okay in terms of protein. So I'll put hand on hard to say, probably not a big issue. When you get a little older, people's appetite goes down. People tend to gravitate towards different ways of eating. And protein actually becomes a much smaller percentage of their diet. So at the time when I think you need more protein and you want to support muscle mass and lean mass as you age, most people's protein intake is actually going down to levels where it becomes limiting to the amount of muscle that they can hang on to. So that I think is an important distinction between, let's say, in the minimum and let's go into what we call a more optimal protein intake range. And I don't know where an at what age that begins, but I think it's an important consideration as most of us myself included transition towards, I'm looking at the rest of my life in thinking. I want to be in as best health as I can. And so I have to be a little bit more cognizant about the protein that I eat. What went into your determining 1.2 grams for a kilogram body weight? So you're saying most young adults are consuming that probably. And then also, I guess, talking about the audience. Like, are we talking about to people that are in a big, caloric excess? Well, they're probably already getting that protein, right? I mean, they're in a huge excess of getting more calories, they're probably getting more protein and everything else. But is it relevant for every age or maybe people that are really physically active? Like you said, go up a little more. So why 1.2? What was the science behind that? Yeah. So the original studies that led to the derivation of the recommended dietary allowance or what we call nitrogen balance. And as the name implies, it's measuring all the nitrogen or protein that goes into our body and collecting everything that comes out. So wonderful, delightful studies to do. Those studies, we've known for a long time, are problematic because of incomplete collection, overestimation, et cetera, of losses. So one of the things that we do know is that the closer you get to your requirement, your body actually gets much more efficient at utilizing protein. So and that's not really taken into account in the way people have modeled that data. So without going too deep into the weeds, let's just say that there are alternative approaches using stable isotopes that have consistently shown that people actually need when I say need to maintain the balance that we talk about higher intakes. And so that's the 1.2. So it's not that point eight really, does it for a lot of people. We need to come up to 1.2. And then from 1.2 in above, we're talking about optimal intakes. And I think the example, the one that people can maybe relate to a little bit is that up until probably about 20, 25 years ago, we aimed at a vitamin C and take the prevented scurvy. And that was good because who wants scurvy, right? But then we've done some science and not me, but obviously lots of other people to show that it takes above the vitamin C and take the prevented scurvy. We're actually associated with health benefits. And so we make that recommendation. We haven't done that for protein. We're still aiming at the prevention of deficiency as opposed to the optimization of processes that are important. And there's still a lot of people that push back against my viewpoints. And I'll take the heat. I think what hasn't been considered is this maintenance of muscle and mobility as we age that is in part driven by protein intake. I mean, the other half is we can't get away without talking about exercise, right? So that's the other side of the equation. Right. Well, let's talk a little bit about so the protein intake and you're like my people can push back. You know, they're definitely our animal studies that have looked at calorie restrictions and protein restriction and it's effect on how lab rodents live and healthy they live. And I think that as you and I have talked off camera, you know, there's a lot of different types of people that are in different life stages. We've got obese people, like sedentary that could probably benefit from caloric restriction. We've got young, healthy, acta physically active people that are probably needing more protein intake. We've got the older people that are battling with sarcopenia that probably need more protein intake. And then we have the whole fasting community. So I mean, it's like I've had a lot of fasting experts on the podcast that you know. And I think what a better job it needs to be done is basically just talking about the audience, talking about, OK, who are we speaking to here with this specific thing we're talking about? Because that's important. There's different people and different stages of life. And then I think also with some of the protein restriction as well, it's very similar. And I've listened to some other things that you've talked about with, you know, extrapolating data from lab animals, specifically on caloric restriction and dietary restriction, protein restriction too. Humans may be a little murky because of something called this disuse and disease that humans are so susceptible to. So can you talk a little bit about it? Because it makes so much sense. Yeah. I mean, the writer's statement, I think, and the disclaimer right at the start is to say, tremendous amount of respect for the science of the people that do the studies around caloric restriction, protein restriction, et cetera. Most of it is done, as you mentioned, in lab animals, mostly small rodents, so usually mice or rats sometimes. And I think one of the things that's important to point out is when we've compared primates head to head, so this is in caloric restriction, arguably the most robust model of survival, extending lifespan, the data is actually conflicting. It's only been done, obviously, in two different locations. And so if you were primate, you know, in one location, you did better than primates in the other, but the net result was it actually didn't extend lifespan. So that sort of makes you think, okay, maybe there's, it's not as clear cut as you might think. Obviously, small rodents, they're mammals, so the extrapolation to us is often done. Drug companies do it all the time, I understand. I think the thing that I focus on the most is around, there's a cage animal that lives in a very controlled environment. And food is, you know, there is no fluctuation in food. It's sort of held at here or here, because it's given or taken away from the animal. So, you know, choice is taken away from the animal, the human beings are notoriously, sometimes great, sometimes not so much at making. And, you know, these animals aren't exposed with a lot of the same stressors. So one of the concepts that we, and it was something in reading, a good friend of mine, Doug Patton Jones, who, you know, sadly passed away really early in his life, pointed out at these catabolic crises that we have. And for him, it meant a period of hospitalization. And during this event, the fact of treatment in hospital is you go into bed rest. And we've known for years that, you know, putting people in bed rest and you can ask any clinician, it's a bad situation. You're not using your muscles, everything, because you become instantly sedentary, obviously. And it would exacerbate a lot of other issues if you went into the bed rest with type 2 diabetes. You were overweight, you, et cetera, et cetera. So these events, you can appreciate bed rest in a catabolic crisis if you've got a hospital event, as yeah, that's gonna be bad. I get that. So we sort of said, well, dial it back a little bit. Maybe you get flu. And you're an older person, you get some respiratory distress. You go into hospital for a few days, you're on oxygen. But you're now you're fine to be released from the hospital, but you go home and convalesce for two weeks. So this is a disuse event relatively speaking, but you're okay, you sit around for two weeks. And we think as you get older, even those types of events are a disuse event that we think precipitates an issue. And I was fond of saying that, well, you know, this happens every year in, well, happens everywhere. Because people get to flu. And I said, but there's maybe uniquely, if not Canadian, but northern US phenomenon, that when it's freezing cold outside, you also is an older person, you don't go inside. You don't want to shovel your snow, you could slip, you could, you know, so, and clinicians would say, yeah, but how often does that happen? Then COVID comes along, and I said, happens a lot. So I feel a little bit of vindication. I said, this is a relevant model. And what happens is if you can imagine somebody, they're already going down because Sercopinius happening. When they have a disuse event, they've been the curb dramatically. So there's an accelerated rate of muscle loss. And what happens when you're younger, you go down, but you're able to bounce back up. At some point, and this is universally, I think, understood by clinicians, is that an older person that has that event like that is actually now on a different downward trajectory. So they've actually hopped, you know, they've accelerated the loss that they have with aging to a fairly large degree. The best, you know, way to explain it to people is to say, you put somebody up in space, because there's no gravity. That's effectively disuse, because you can't really generate any force with your muscles. And we know that, you know, six months or a year, spending up at the space station is about 10 to 15 years of skeletal and muscle aging. And it's tough to get back. In fact, most of those astronauts, I'd be willing to back, don't get much of that back when they come either down to Earth. So that's the price you pay for a little bit of weightlessness for about six months to a year. Wow. Yeah, that's incredible about the astronauts. But just speaking to what you were saying with the disuse and disease, again, it makes a lot of sense because laboratory ruins are not really exposed to that. They're in these little sterile environments, but you know, so, you know, I think, again, at the end of the day, just to kind of get this, I think, to make it clear to people listening here today. You know, I still do think there are benefits to different types of intermittent fats and for different people. And whether we're talking about some of that's obese and overweight, you know, having a form of caloric deficit, which can be achieved a lot of ways, including, probably the best. I mean, like exercise, if exercise is probably the cornerstone of health sprains, right? Absolutely. I think we agree there. Yeah. But also, like, there's different types of fasting. You know, there's a constant caloric restriction like we're just talking about, but there's also just not eating two to three hours before batch. And that's something I think most people can benefit from, honestly, because you're, you know, you're not as insulin sensitive later in the evening. And it's nice to have a period where you do have some rest. Yep. They adjust your nerve, everything. So, lots of types of fasting. And, you know, that all gets lost again when we just kind of talk about it and it's big umbrella kind of type of generalization. So, I think we're gonna talk a lot about protein here in muscle synthesis, but to be honest, I think people that are overweight and obese, they have to start there. Like, they have to like, lose the weight. And, you know, there's ways to do that exercise and caloric restriction both really effective. But getting back and speaking to the RDA for protein, it's funny because you mentioned the micro nutrients you mentioned vitamin C. And I did my post-doc with Bruce Aims and I studied micro nutrients. And so, you know, his whole, you know, his whole stick was RDAs or to prevent deficiency, you know, and that there's not adequate, you know, so like vitamin D. Yep. And that's great. So, I'm very familiar with that where it's like, well, look, yeah, who wants to, like, preventing scurvy is one thing, but like, you know, not having DNA damage, that's accumulating over time. That's kind of a condition, it's a cancer. Well, that's important. So maybe we should be thinking wrong- We'll be very concerned, right? Yeah. So it's kind of like the same concept. Exactly. With respect to the 1.2 grams of protein per day, you talk, let's talk a little bit more about like, specifics with people that are physically active. So you mentioned 1.6. Now, there was a study that I think it was a meta-analysis in your career. That you guys looked at resistance exercise in younger adults younger than 65, and adults older than 65. And they're protein intake. Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about like, you looked at lean body mass and what was found there? What were the major findings? Yeah. I mean, you know, so I think it's fair to say that our lab has contributed to maybe some of the overstatement of the importance of protein for a muscle mass and all, you know, throw my hands up and say, okay. Some early studies that we did, particularly, where we were measuring rates of muscle proteins synthesis, saw these enormous changes with protein, and everybody was like, see, it's important. And I'm like, absolutely. You begin to accumulate evidence. You begin to accumulate longer-term trials where people are fed high-urvices, lower protein intakes. And the data looks sort of promising, but the more trials you get, it's sort of the effect tends to come, become a little bit smaller, a nuance, let's say. So I think that it's important that 1.2 is still the basal level. That's the buy-in. I think 1.6 grams per kilo, so I know people like to talk and pound. So, you know, it's something around sort of 0.6 to 0.7 grams per pound. And those levels, after that, you can digest and eat lots more protein. Your body just can't use it. But if you're a physically active, younger person, we refer to protein turnover. And the concept, I think, that's easiest is to say, you're muscle or you're protein's in your body, you're like a brick wall. The amino acids are the bricks going in. Protein synthesis is the bricks going in to the wall. But at the other end, there's a process of bricks, bad bricks, damaged bricks, all worn out bricks being taken out of the wall. So we're turning protein over constantly. And if you're performing exercise, and you're going out, doesn't matter if you're running or lifting weights, then that protein turnover process is accelerated. So you have to put more bricks into the pool to replace the ones that are coming out. Sounds like a really inefficient process, but you can imagine if you did that every day to the walls around your house, they'd be in great shape. So it's a good thing. I think as you get older, what happens is that the bricks that are coming in aren't used as efficiently. But we're still pulling bricks out of the wall, and that sort of tips the balance in and we begin to lose muscle mass. If you go into bed rest, we tip that in the opposite direction in a really severe way. And most people have experienced, and we use this as an experimental model of period. You put a cast on your leg or your arm. You take the cast off, and then you look, and you say, where did my leg or my arm go? Well, that's local muscular atrophy. But when you're young, most people ask, well, why don't we do rehab for young kids if they fall out of a tree and break their arm? The answer is we don't have to, because kids just go back and keep doing, and playing, and that's their rehab. As we get older, we don't tend to do that. So we need active rehab. And I think that's then the period where you need to put more protein back into this system to try and restore that. It just becomes ridiculously difficult as you get older. So young people physically active, I'm an advocate for higher protein and takes. I would agree that most of them, if they're particularly eating to cover their energy needs and consuming a mixed diet, they're probably good. Middle aged people, and I'll be the first person to admit this, we're probably not the first. We don't have a lot of data. And people ask why, and I'll give you the simple explanation, we can conduct loss of studies on university campuses, academic research institutions on young college age people. There's lots of them around, willing participants in research. And we can conduct lots of research on people over the age of 65 as the meta-analysis sort of implies. The people in the middle, they're busy people. They've got kids, jobs, lots of things going on, and we say, hey, you got to come into the lab for a whole day, you got to do this, and then I can't do that. So they're not studied often. I think the assumption, and it's reasonable, one, is you can draw probably a line from young to older people, and the middle aged people would be in the middle. So the meta-analysis was essentially that, and then attempt to reconcile, you know, we've got all of these studies, what does protein do for lean body mass? And the answer is, if you're younger, and your resistance training, so you're lifting weights, you want to get a bit bigger, a bit stronger, 1.6 grams of protein per kilo per day, the type of intake that you need to consume, but the effect is small. So in other words, I like to put it practically, I say you get most of the benefit from just going to the gym, and then the protein effect is a thin layer on top. And it's the same story as you get a little bit older. The bad news, like a lot of things, although aging is great, you know, you're more wise, you know, everything else like that, but things slow down. And so the protein begins to add incrementally, sort of smaller amounts. And so it's a small nudge. You get a little bit of extra strength, you get a little bit of extra muscle, but it's really the lifting of the weights that is the big driver of all of the benefits and all of the gains. So, you know, simply put protein is, we talk about sufficient, and necessary for a little bit of extra strength, but it's a small, it's a thin slice on top of what lifting weights provides in terms of strength and muscle. It makes sense. So the 1.2 is kind of going back to that number. Yeah, you kind of need to start there, and then you can move up, but there's obviously, there's a ceiling. Yeah. And you know, we could obviously have a discussion about should it be 1.6 something right here, or if you're in a caloric deficit, and I'm like, yeah, you could probably stand to eat a little bit more, because you're in a calorie deficit, again, you're sort of tipping the scales in the favor of the breakdown side of things. That's just calorie deficits, or a catabolic stimuli, and it's catabolic for muscle too. So, yep, there are probably situations where we need a little bit more, but how long, how much that goes or really, let's call them fine details. What about is this also a fine detail? The protein timing, you know, there's, yeah, it's just probably one of the most common questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should I split my 1.2 grams into 3.4 grams per kilogram, or is there, is the stimulus? And we'll talk more about why proteins are stimulus for muscle, you know, math, but you know, does it have to be higher? Yeah. Great question. You know, again, I'm drawing as much from evidence as I can here in a little bit for my sort of own sense, so you know, take this with a grain of sand. I think the way your body is set up and your muscles in particular prefer to be fed regularly. So, pulse, you know, breakfast lunch dinner and a snack or whatever it is. And so when I'm talking to athletes who are the creme de la creme pro level and pick level, I get to talk to the money every now and again, and I always say, you know, you guys are clearly like, we've skimmed off everybody who is sort of a mere mortal like me. And now we've got these elite specimens and they probably should eat that way. Now I appreciate that sometimes training is difficult for them to do and everything else like that. But I think they can benefit from even distribution, whether it's a huge effect. I think for most mere mortals, it's not a big deal. I think if you're the top level athlete and you're probably looking to metal or, you know, win this or win that, then maybe some of those small differences that's the sort of the last little part that you need to turn the dial that is the margin of victory at the top level. So we talk about even spacing of protein. I think for most people, it's not that big a deal. There's also the timing with respect to exercise and I live through that craze. Not as big a deal as we once thought. So it's really about the total amount of protein you're gonna get in the day and then the next one would be, you know, even spacing and I'd say, yeah, and then the next one would be sort of protein quality where, you know, we get into some of the more nuanced talk about protein. And then you can dial it down from there. Most people I talk to, I just say, you know, do you go to the gym and they're like, yeah, yeah, I'm like how many times they're like, well, you know, once or twice is that maybe you could go two or three times, that would probably be a much bigger benefit than I need to divide my protein three times across the day. So good point. What about 65 years and older? Oh, yeah, yeah. I think this is where what we call a skewed protein and take in the traditional intake is lowest at breakfast, moderate lunch and then most of it at dinner. I think it's probably correct to say that that first, that breakfast time meal, you could really stand to push the protein and take a little bit higher. Most people say heart healthy breakfast, whole grains, that sort of thing. And so that's where they focus. When we've looked at intakes of older, particularly older women, they consume a ridiculously small amount of protein at breakfast. And I think they could handle, you know, some Greek yogurt. We take eggs off the dirty list and we say, it's okay to eat a egg. Good high quality, nutrient dense or subprotein. And then they say cholesterol. I'm like probably not as big a deal as you've been taught. And you're 85. I'm like, have an egg for goodness sake. Or glass of milk. And that's most people say, well, there's not much protein. And I say, you're right, but it's more than the six to eight grams, most of which comes from weak gluten, which is not a particularly high quality protein, that these older folks should probably aim for. And it doesn't necessarily, again, have to be enormous amounts. People say, what about protein supplements? I'm like, very convenient. If you can't do it with food, absolutely, I've probably used for it. But, you know, whatever suits your lifestyle. But I do think that older people, particularly, instead of having the skewed distribution, could stand to sort of have a more even distribution throughout the day. OK. And maybe we should talk about why protein is such a strong stimulus for increased muscle proteins that this is. What is it about protein, the essential amino acids? Yep. Yeah. So you said it. I mean, go back to the brick wall analogy. If that's muscle protein, it's made up of 20 different types of bricks, those are the 20 amino acids that we have. Nine of which are essential. We need to get them in our diet. And in particular, there are a group of what are called branch chain. amino acids that are three of the nine. And the most potent, if you like, of the three branch chains, is an amino acid called loosein. And the way I like to explain it to people is that it's kind of like the brick that when it arrives, it turns the process on. And I'm potentially doing that because I always like to remind people, it's like a dimmer switch. So it's not click on, click off. It's really like you're losing, comes along. And it begins, you see the lights begin to come on. And the lights obviously are the process of making new muscle proteins. So once you have sufficient loosein there, you can turn the switch up as bright as it can go. Once you put more loosein there, you can't go any higher. For older people, for reasons that we're beginning to unravel now, I think what happens is now the sensitivity of that dimmer switch, so the loosein comes and you sort of get this response. And a younger person, you might get that. And so we need more loosein or more branch chains or more essential amino acids, which translates into more. You need more protein to trigger the whole turning the protein synthetic process on. So it's a pretty nuanced level, I think, of understanding, but we're beginning to see on when we look at diets that people who consume higher quality proteins or sufficient lower quality proteins, which I'm sure will get to. It's really about the loosein that they consume, particularly for their muscle that's important. So I have a question about that, but before we get there, the higher quality, obviously, animal meat is higher in essential amino acids than plant proteins. And so can people that are on a plant protein diet then get sufficient amino acids to foster muscle protein synthesis? Great question. And this is one area. We've chatted a little bit before I came on to say that my understanding and even the studies that I've been involved with has changed. And so 20 years ago, and I first came to McMaster, I'm like, here's a fundamental trueism. Animal derived proteins are higher quality than plant derived proteins. Plant derived proteins have anti-intritional fiber is one fight-tates, lots of other things that can inhibit protein breakdown enzymes. And you know, you see, that's a big deal. It's going to lower the quality. You're not going to get as many amino, essentially amino acids. And that's true. But fast forward 20 years, we've now got processing methods that can lower or change the fiber content. We've got foods where we've isolated plant proteins, et cetera. So we've taken a lot of that out of the equation. And then everybody says, but the essential amino acid content is lower in plant proteins than is an animal. I don't know, like you're essentially your correct. The top of the list in the plant kingdom would obviously be soy. It's plant derived protein and probably that been the main stay of 20th and 21st century vegans or vegetarians. But now we're looking at a variety of plant-based protein sources that are, they are contrived. They're manufactured foods, but they're very high quality proteins. They're not something that people need to worry about. In terms of, I'm getting an inferior quote-unquote source of protein. So I think that the way you can make up for the difference is you either eat a little more over here in terms of protein. Or you go towards supplements or foods that actually have taken some of the antinutritional out or, and this has been something that we're keenly aware of and trying to study, is that a lot of the prep methods of plant proteins like beans and legumes, you cook them. And cooking actually liberates a lot of the proteins that makes them more bioavailable. And so reduces the antinutritional effects. So sproding, cooking, fermentation, all kinds of things that are commonly done with plant-based proteins, beans legumes. I think you're making the two proteins much more close in quality inside us than we once thought. And so I tend to worry less about protein quality than I once did. And I know that that probably upsets a lot of people because they're like, well, you used to say, and I was like, you're right, I used to say that, but the evidence is evolving. And even in our own hands, we've been surprised, actually, I've been surprised actually at how good plant proteins have been in stimulating muscle proteins, so this is. That's really good to know. And I'm going to ask you this because I know people listening are watching this are going to ask. And when you're talking about fiber, and the effect of fiber on being able to absorb proteins, you're talking about within a plant. You're not like talking about eating your plate of spinach with your steak. Yeah. And happening. Yeah, that's different. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the steak and the spinach still good mix. Great if you enjoy the eat that way. But now I'm talking about, and I mean, here's the other sort of knock on some of the studies that we use to make these generalisms. They're fed people are fed individual foods. And that's really not how we eat. We tend to, you know, you look at a plate, and it's got something like this. But when you do that, I think the point I'm making is the fiber that's intrinsic to the plant or the fruit or whatever it is, is inhibiting to some small degree your absorption of the protein that's there. But those effects, again, you cook a bean or a pea, and a lot of that goes away. So raw peas, and if you eat raw peas, OK. But if you cook the peas, there are a lot more digestible. And so a lot of the studies that we have to look at protein to just ability and the amino acid scores and there are lots of them. But I don't think her is big of a deal as we once thought. Yeah. Yeah. Talking about the loosing and going, kind of circling back to that. And I want to get into underlying causes of sarcopenia. But kind of before that we get there, that the loosing supplementation does come up in my mind. Sure. And probably in a lot of other people's minds, is like, can I supplement with loosing and not have to take in so much protein and have a similar effect on muscle protein synthesis? Yeah. Really great question. And we have done some studies where we haven't, well, if proof of principle, we supplemented people with loosing. And we did find that it improved the response. A little, the caveat statements. First of all, loosing is of all of the 20 amino acids. And I know everybody hasn't done this sort of thing. But loosing is it's extraordinarily bitter. So it doesn't taste great. So you need a bit of food science to take that edge off, I think. From my perspective, that would be sort of a last resort because it should always be a food for us to approach. And then maybe a supplement. And now you're bringing it down to the individual component. And you probably get a sense of this from some of the studies that we've seen with individually purified components of like a tomato. And it was, oh, it's like a peat. And that's really important. One actually, there's things in the whole tomato that the matrix and other things and lots of bioactive compound. We have no idea what they're doing. And probably it's tomato is better for you than just the like a peat alone. So that's my sort of ethos statement to say, loosing supplementation if you must. Biobuware, make sure it comes from a reputable company. The internet is rife with crummy supplements. And you just need to know where it's coming from. So usually look for third party testing. I tend to like domestic production. So North America, if you can. And then a lot of people say, what about branch chain supplements? And I'm like, you know, it's really interesting. Like they stuck around as a sports supplement for a long, long time. I think the message is fairly clear now that they're largely, I won't say, use less. But from useful to use less, they're a lot closer to the use less end. But it's only the loosing out of those three amino acids that's the important branch chain amino acids. So they work because of the loosing. So then people say, well, I'm on a high protein diet supplement with a way and I'm taking branch chains. There's a great Instagram meme where I see a guy in a pool. It's raining and he's drinking water. So it's sort of like that's where the branch chains are. I'm like, you're surrounded by good stuff. The branch chains are probably not a big deal. But for older people, we've done some work. And it's possible you're going to see products that are fortified with a little bit of extra loosing. Do you absorb loosing in free form? And it doesn't have to be a certain form. No. No, you absorb it in free form. In fact, it's really readily absorbed. The big barrier in all the studies we've ever done is how to mask it's taste. So you can imagine given it's taste profile, we mix it with some sort of citrus and legumi. Excuse me, citrus fruit flavor. And try and sort of blend that sharp bitter edge into like, oh, it's lemon. It's orange. It's grapefruity, something. And that tends to be a good mix. But I'm not a food scientist. Pineapple? Yeah, something like that. So you said fortified for older individuals, I say that are, as you mentioned, when you get older, your satiation, those hormones are all different. And then people don't eat as much. They're not hungry as much. And they certainly don't chew as well. I mean, all sorts of factors are absolutely. So if you can get someone who's having a hard time, there's just no way they're going to get point for grand-siproaching per kilogram by weight. The losing supplementation may help with that older person. Yeah, and we've shown that. And I think it's not just our work. Lots of other people, collaborators of mine, good friends of mine, have shown the same thing that if you take even a small protein dose and you add a little bit of extra lucing, you can make it look as if it's a bigger protein dose. And so our dimmer switch analogy is that, here's a small protein dose, and you get that response. Here's the small protein dose, with lucing, and now you go slightly greater than one. Is it a fortified grams? What was it? You know, the per meal lucing dose is probably somewhere in the range of sort of three to four grams for an older person, probably two to three for younger. And that's just because the younger person is really sensitive to the effects. But we can make a younger person when we put a brace on their leg and we get local atrophy, their atrophy muscle looks like an older person's response. So the disuse response we think is sort of, it's almost a model of a premature aging in terms of your muscle anyway. The difference is a young person does this and they just bounce back. An older person does this and now they're down here. So why, what can you talk a little bit about this as I've heard in your publications and in your others as well this anabolic resistance to climb? What? Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I don't think that you can discount inactivity with aging. Everything is, it gets older from earthworms all the way up to humans, we do less as we age. There's no question about that. We have done some studies where we've used step reduction like a abrupt step reduction as a model of sort of a abrupt set and tourism where we can make older people much more anabolicly resistant as a result of that. So clearly activity is a driver of it. At the same time, I think there's probably aspects to do with insulin resistance and it doesn't need to be over-ed insulin resistance to the degree that you have type 2 diabetes, but maybe you have what we call vascular insulin resistance. So what this means is that when you turn on insulin, you usually open up blood vessels to allow flow to happen. And what we think happens with aging is that response becomes just a little bit less sensitive. You're not insulin resistant from the perspective of blood sugar but from a protein perspective, we think that opening up local capillaries and allowing good blood flow in older people just isn't quite as sensitive. So again, people say, wow, what can I do? And the number one answer is to be as physically active as you can. And that maintains that vascular level of sensitivity as you get older. Ages are going to get you at some point. There's no question. But clearly, as you've said, the cornerstone is to maintain your physical activity levels. Be as active as possible. A robotic exercise, absolutely resistant, sex-recise. It's got to be there. And what about in terms of how many times a week resistance exercise? Because you hear about the, you mentioned the, there's to the 10,000 steps. People talk about the 10,000 steps. So I mean, what's there something people can think about and it's as age-dependent as that change. Yeah, yeah. It's a great question. I mean, the origins of 10,000 steps is also probably, people go, where does that come from? And you're like, that's a good question. I don't, I mean, it's a great round number. I think that's when you go back to the history of those little predominators, it was just, you know, that's a good number. It ends probably true, you know, the closer you get to around 67, 8,000, 9,000, 10, you start to see health benefits. So I'm not going to dismiss that. Resistance training, it's a little bit more difficult. The guide, most of the guidelines you look around the world, it's, there's a recommendation for two times a week of strengthening activities. My own feeling is that it should, it should be more than recommended. It should be a deriguer part of the guidelines, like 150 minutes. And I do think two days a week is sort of, that's the buy-in level. I mean, if somebody's doing nothing and they do one, big change, they do two, big change. I think three, you're a change for, I'm like, I don't know, you're probably starting to see the plateau. Five, I'm like, yes, if it's your thing, six, you go seven, you're mad, but go for it. And but it's a dose response, like a lot of things, right? 150 minutes is kind of where we tap out a lot of the benefits. And then you go from there to say double and 300 minutes. And you can squeeze a little bit more out of the cloth, but you've kind of got a lot of the benefits with the first 150. Let's say you're doing, so that's 150 minutes of strength. That's a row of a kick. Well, that's right. So then when you're talking about, let's say you're doing the two days a week versus the strength. What's the duration for each of those? Is it? Here's where we climb inside the really kind of nuance things, and it's sort of like, do we do free weights? We do machines, we do sets, we do reps, and everything. And this is actually, I think, one of the barriers for a lot of people is that the, most people, I say 10,000 steps, they're like, oh, walking. I can do that. And then you say, wait, lift, do. They're like, oh, I hate going to the gym, and you're like, okay, well, have you ever done a push-up? And they're like, yeah, but I hate push-ups. And most people hate push-ups because they were used as a form of punishment when you're a kid. At least that's my feeling. But you don't need a gym to do resistance workouts. You can do body weight workouts just about anywhere. You can do like an air squat up and down, and you don't need a weight. But sets reps for, my main point is getting to do that at least twice a week for, let's say, 30 to 45 minutes duration. There's a lot of benefit associated with that. I think three times, you can get a little bit more. But it's about making clear that the biggest reduction in risk, bar none, is always going from nothing to doing something. And not that we should aim at the smallest or the lowest bar or anything else like that. But as we mentioned, saying before, we've got on camera. These nudges of people that are really sedentary are population level. If we got everybody to walk for even 10 minutes a day, and then maybe they did push up, even if they can't do a floor, push up, let's say a wall, push up. And maybe when I had a walk outside, how good they would feel, mental health, physical health, and everything. And the population, in fact, would be pretty substantial. So I'm good if you're like me, and you like to go to the gym, and you like to lift some weights. I don't lift heavy weights anymore. I think that's sort of a diabolical pursuit, but if that's your saying, go for it. But I think it's more about getting to the gym, performing a workout with pretty high levels of effort, which is the, I stopped prescribing percentages of your maximum lift. I just say lift until you're pretty fatigued at the end, and you should do pretty well. And when you're lifting, or you're doing any type of resistance and or strength training, you are also causing muscle protein breakdown. Yeah, absolutely. But the mechanical force on the muscles are increasing protein synthesis. And what do you want to do? Yeah, no, that's great. Great explanation. Yeah, I mean, I think our wall analogy, again, is to say that actually exercise, physical exercise, and particularly some forms of weightlifting is a really potent one, turns up the rate at which we're pulling bricks out of the wall. You're creating damage. You're creating a stress on the muscle. Successful adaptation distress is that you're able to repair that damage and replace those damage proteins. And that's the synthesis side of things. And then clearly what we're aiming for is, so we have damage, and then we have synthesis. But now you've gone up a little bit, then we have damage synthesis. And over time, it's sort of down, up, down, up, but the trend is that you're getting better and better. The same with the robeck exercise. I mean, it's, you know, I'd say to people, like the exercise is great. But it's in recovery that we, that's where all the good stuff happens, because we, you know, as a result, we're a pair of any damage, recover from the stress, and hopefully you're recovered fully so that we're at the better starting point. Again, sometimes it's small changes, and then but over time, you know, people say, you know, when I first started, I was so tired, and I'm like, yeah, it's hard work. When you first get started, get past month one, month two, month three, month, you know, and then now you six months later, you're like, I'm so much stronger, I'm so, you know, et cetera, et cetera. It takes time and the stress is stress, you have to overcome it, but the benefits are massive. Does the recovery, I mean, is there certain, like if you're doing the strength training what's going to be 30 minutes, one day, like should you take, take the next day off matter, or can you like do what two days in a row, and then recover, is that just, again, these are the sorts of things, I think, you know, when you become more advanced, so now you're, I'm like, okay, I've got three days in the gym a week, I've got that down, no problem. And it becomes, you know, what more can I do to sort of maximize what I'm getting out of the workout that I'm doing? Most people split, say, a resistance workout, they'll do, they might pair exercises, or the most rudimentary one is sort of say, they're pushing exercises, so that above your head, they're pulling exercises, they're a bicep curl, and then they're leg exercises, so pushing, pulling legs, and you're working different muscle groups, and that's three days a week, it gives you, you know, the muscle has lots of time to recover. Some people do it really differently, the bodybuilding culture gets into, you know, individual body parts, so today is a bicep day, then next day is a tricep day, you know, Monday is usually always chest day, you're under the bar, doing a bench press, you work on your legs, you work on your lower legs, you work on your upper legs, you know, all of those are things that ways of splitting it up. I think, you know, my advice to most people is to say, you can probably break most exercises, resistance exercises down into some pretty basic ones. You know, there is a push from your back, that's a bench press, there's a shoulder press above your head. I'm not a big fan of isolation exercises, but, you know, squatting or leg press, if you don't want to squat, is really, you know, those are the three sort of, if you walk away and remember nothing, those are great exercises. You don't need to do too much more to be honest with you, but you branch out from there. I do think some people can handle a lot more. I know from my own experience when I was younger, I could do a heck of a lot more, and the recovery came a lot easier. Now, not so much, and the goals are different. My goal now is, you know, it has a 20 year horizon, 30 year horizon, so that's something I'm like, how long does it take you recover? I'm like, well, I don't know, I took a day off yesterday. I was okay. Disprotein helped with recovery. I mean, how much of a risk, for example, we talked about losing how much is like, you know, essential me know as to like that activate IGF1, playable and muscle repair? Yeah, a good question. I mean, I think as I said, you know, it's in recovery where all the good stuff happens. Like the workout is putting the stress on the muscle, and the bones, the joints, et cetera. And then the recovery part, the stress is removed, and it's like, okay, now it's repair time, recovery time, three hours, rehydrate, refuel repair. So you gotta get fluid back in if you've lost that. It's a primary one. You gotta get fuel back in, particularly if, you know, the next day you're gonna do another workout, the repair part, that's where the protein comes in. There's a lot of thoughts that the regenerative process also involves hormones going up and everything else. And I think for a large part, particularly when you're an adult, that's a non-issue, most of the restorative process and the recovery process is driven almost exclusively by macro nutrients. And so IGF1, I'm like, yeah, needs to be there, but it's not a stimulatory or an inhibitory hormone for repair recovery. Okay, let's talk a little bit about mechanisms. And because there was definitely some surprises and interesting findings when I was reading a lot of the literature and including predominantly yours. So what losing its major role in activating muscle proteins and this is through M-tour? Yes, through M-tour, very good. Okay, yeah, yeah. I mean, M-tour is one of these, it's a highly-conserved protein. It's sort of an integrative, nexus of all kinds of antibiotics, stimuli, including resistance exercise. So or any form of exercise, it's actually running through M-tour, losing goes through M-tour. It's dysregulation is involved in all kinds of processes, including cancer and lots of other things. So it has a really centrally important role and integrating all of those antibiotics signals. There are some thoughts now that there are actually two complexes of M-tour, one that's sensitive to nutrients, one that's actually more sensitive to exercise and one functions a little bit different than the other. But the ultimate culmination is that the downstream signals after you've stimulated M-tour are to turn on proteins synthesis and all of the regenerative or inabolic processes to repair or recover from any stress that's been exposed. So yeah, it's essentially important protein. We study it a lot. We're by no means experts in it. There are people that are far better at it than I am, so. Yeah, so inhibiting the one like M-tour one, which is the nutrient sensitive complex, or something like rap, amyus and fluid effect, muscle protein synthesis, but not because there's also M-tour two activity going on if a person is resistance training, maybe does it not as big of a deal or is it still does? Yeah, I think like I said, the benefits of the resistance training through probably through M-tour two are like this. You still get the protein synthetic response. With M-tour quannamine, that's where the thinner layer of the nutrient added stimulation goes on top of resistance training. So as you say, one sensitive to rap, amyus and the other one actually isn't. So the more we uncover with this, the more we realize we probably, 10 years ago, we thought we had it figured out, nah, we're not even close. And so now we're beginning to understand that mechanical stress from exercise is rooted through a different process, the nutrient stimulation of protein synthesis. So maybe that's the underpinning mechanism why a lot of people talk about restricting protein and not wanting to turn on the overly, or overly turn on the antibiotic side of things. And because uncontrolled growth and well, it's cell level, that's cancer. But as I pointed out to people, persist in exercise also activates M-tour on an almost chronic basis if you exercise every day. And now we're like, well, actually it's signaling through a different process. So maybe that's why it's beneficial and this one, if it's chronically turned up, it's not so good. Yeah, and it also goes back to some of the observational data we were talking about also a couple hours ago, whenever it was when you're looking at protein intake specifically animal protein versus plant protein and animal protein as you pointed out is higher in essential amino acids, including losing. And so you look at these all of cosmitalities and these cancer related mortalities and there is definitely conflicting data for sure. But there is an overall, like there's a lot of studies showing that there's a lower all-cosmortality in a lower cancer related mortality and people that consume plant proteins. However, when you start to look at the largest observational studies that have been done, those studies that have looked for any unhealthy lifestyle factors or I'm founding factors have found that, oh, actually people that have no unhealthy lifestyle factors. So there are not obese, not sedentary, not smoking, not excessively drinking alcohol. They have a similar all-cosmortality as a plant-eating person. Again, it goes down to that, okay, well, maybe if someone is obese and smoking or sedentary, before you start eating a lot of protein and doing and worrying about that, let's get rid of those unhealthy lifestyle factors. Let's get physically active, and lose some weight, some fat, and then things can fall into place. I couldn't agree more. I think in the broad checklist and people say, so what are you doing to H1? And I said, well, I'm trying to stay at a body weight that's not excessive. I weigh more now than I did when I was 13, 14, no kidding. I'm more than I did when I was 23, 24, but not much more. I'm physically active. I pay attention to what I eat 80% of the time and people say, well, what about the other 20%? I said, that's why I exercise. So I can indulge myself to 20% of the time. I don't need a vegan diet. I don't need a vegetarian diet, but I eat less meat, particularly red meat than I used to. I eat more fish. I don't need as many un-refined, or excuse me, refined, carbohydrates. I don't really have a sweet tooth, so I was kind of lucky in that way. So I don't feel compelled. I'm weak in the presence of chocolate. So, but maybe that's my one indulgence, but I don't smoke, never have. I don't drink as much as I used to. All of those things, and you're going check, check, check, check. And then people go, well, what about air-mitting fasting? And I'm like, you know what? And again, this is the analogy. I love this is to, you dip the water. You dip the cloth in the water. And the first ring is like you get a lot of water out. I'm like, that's maintaining your body weight. I'm like the second one is physical activity. The third one is watch what you eat. The fourth one is, and then you could add subtle nuance things more on that. But now you're, you know, it's only little drops that are coming out of the cloth. That's where I think a lot of the finer details, the vegan versus, you know, omnivorous diet. If you're judicious about how you plan, you're omnivorous diet, can make a difference. Yeah, if you're a smoker, that's a great thing to give up, because that's a bona fide of shortened lifespan, poor quality of life, et cetera. But I understand the power of addiction, and particularly if you started early, which is when most people take it up, man, it's a tough one to break. So, lose the weight physically active. I think what you said is pretty, pretty fair. Like the most important thing. Some products for them, and the little drops that can come out hormones. Yeah. Growth hormone, testosterone, I mean, getting to the sex hormones, um, yeah. I was quite surprised by, you know, some of the data coming out of your lab, that showed, maybe you can explain it, because you'll explain it better than I do. But, you know, looking at what effect, for example, growth hormone has on muscle proteins, and this is, yeah. So, this started to give you the origins or the genesis of this story. We were, I was early in my faculty appointment, and we were doing these studies, where we were infusing people with labeled amino acids to measure the rate of muscle protein synthesis. We were measuring these in cooperation, and these amino acids, and we had people exercising. These were mostly young men, freely admit that. We're making a push to do younger women, and older women, and a middle-aged women, perimenopausal women. So, stay tuned, it's coming. And we would send it in for publication, and they said you haven't measured, you know, testosterone growth hormone, and or insulin-like growth factor, and they go up after exercise, and they're driving this protein synthetic response. And my training is as a biochemist. I'm not a exercise physiometall, I was varsity athlete, so you know, the pairing the two seem logical to me. And I'd actually worked with, you know, some people that were pretty good with steroid biochemistry. And my understanding was that steroid hormones just to hospital, not sort of things, but it's lit across membranes, bound to receptor, receptor went into the nucleus, modified the expression of genes. And that takes a long time. That's not a transitory testosterone's up that do this, and 15 minutes later, it's back down. I'm growth hormone, the same thing. So, we thought, you know, we need to test this. We either need to show that those hormones are important, or they're not, and so that's why we don't think we need to measure them. And it's a journey that it's taken us, you know, 20 years probably about four PhD students, a couple of good postdocs. So it's been a good one, lots of people have chipped in. And we've tried very, very hard to show that those hormones have an antibiotic effect. And we've never been able to see it. And we've manipulated all kinds of experimental conditions, and we just don't see an impact. I think the most damning evidence against testosterone is a big driver of muscle protein synthesis, is to say, you know, if you take men and women, and agree, like men start out with more muscle mass than women, and you resistance train them. And this is a meta analysis now. Guy named Brandon Roberts did this one. And you resistance train them, relative to what they started with. Everybody goes up the same amount. Women get the same amount of muscle growth as men do, but they had less muscle to start with, because, you know, boys and girls are like this, puberty happens, boys become men, manish. And that's the testosterone surge. But after that, they just sort of, they follow each other. So the big T, not so important. Now, this is where people say, but steroids work, I'm like, absolutely. And so this is the normal, diuronal variation and testosterone. This is steroids. It's about two to three standard deviations away. And if the person is taking either early or is an injectable, it's up all the time. And whereas we're talking about transient fluctuations and hormones throughout the day, if you take men and they have diagnosed as a prostate cancer, they're often put on an Android and deprivation therapy. So they're taking from a normal testosterone state to a high-poco-natal state. And yeah, they lose muscle mass. They actually, it's almost a feminizing process for these guys, but it's good news for the prostate tumor, which is a reproductive hormone-driven tumor. And the dirty secret that we're trying to sort of, our lab and lots of others are trying to convince and talk to women, particularly around menopause, is it's not just bone that drops off. It's muscle too. And that's the loss of estrogen mediated stimulation of protein synthesis. So that's the sort of the testosterone story. And I think it's pretty much we can put that one to bed. Now, I will say this, there's a lot of people making a lot of noise and a lot of water about certain supplements that boost testosterone and do this, that and the other. And I just came from the American College of Sports Medicine meetings and listened to a great talk. Good friend of mine, Eric Ross, and said, this is a case of what's old as new. There have been in my 25-year career now McMaster, probably about two dozen testosterone boosting supplements that I've seen come and go. And then it seems like we just can't get rid of them. So there's another two or three hot ones out now. And I won't name them, but let's just say, I get DMs on Instagram, which one should I take? I'm like, save your money. Like it's what? Why bother? Like just get to the gym and lift. And that tends to upset a lot of people. I do think, however, if you go and you look back at, it was an interesting diet, an interesting diet. It was, I think it did this. It was a hormone precursor. I'm having trouble getting my tongue around here. It was plant-based hormones. It was, et cetera, et cetera. None of these, you know, fan you Greek. None of these things have worked. It's, again, look at the sum to a tality of the research. Not one study, not one person talking about this on an Instagram reel. I think you just need to step back. And you know, Phillips quote on quote three rules of supplements taken from a good mentor of mine, Ron Mawn. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If it's too good to be true, it's probably banned. Or you need a big prescription for it. There may be some exceptions. This rule number three, but they're very few. So the growth hormone story is another one. And the easiest way I sort of like to try and explain that to people is the lack of growth hormone when you're young. So high-pote classical high-pote toataryism leads to shorter stature, dwarfism. Those individuals have an amount of muscle mass that's directly proportional to their stature. If you have high-pote toataryism, your agiant, you just tall. You don't have excessive muscle mass. You have it directly proportional to your stature. So growth hormone is a stimulator of stature. You're height. So it's good for bones. It's actually really good for collagen and everybody goes collagen. Your bone is actually about 40% by composition, protein. It's not just a stick of chalk. There's a layer of collaginous protein around it. But this may be where collagen has achieved its sort of notoriety, particularly in the supplemental form for athletes. Is it stimulates collaginous tissue synthesis? And if you think about it, so you take to stoster home, your muscles get bigger. They probably get big enough that you can do ridiculous things in terms of lifting really heavy weights, but to the degree that you can tear your muscle right off of a tendon and it happens. And so where the growth hormone comes in, this is my own personal theory. It stimulates collaginous synthesis and so the tendon becomes stronger too. And laced throughout your muscle are collaginous proteins. So that's where growth hormone is beneficial. So we're in California. I'm vote the Victor Balco and say, you have to get the cream and you have to get the clear. And that's the steroid hormones and the growth hormone. You need both of them to be a big, strong guy. But both of those hormones are pro-anabolic and therefore pro-cancer hormones. Chronic elevations to those hormones mess with a lot of systems that we're only beginning to understand. So excessive testosterone or high levels, great driver of prostate growth, excessive growth hormone, a great driver of lots of different tissues. But it's lack and this is where you've had Dr. Longo on the show before. He shows in certain populations of dors, for example, who have a particular type of dwarfism and lack of growth hormone receptor, they don't get cancer. So do we really want to mess with that system as my question? And I think that us showing that they don't have a particularly huge role at least within the normal variation is a lot different than people coming out to the extremes down here. And if you're clinically low in those hormones, by all means. But for most guys, I'd stay away from that stuff. You have shown that angiogen receptor content increases with resistance training and is correlated with muscle proteins synthesis. I'm going to try to understand it quickly. What do you think then? Because the angiogen testosterone also increase angiogen receptors? So it probably does a little bit as a feed forward mechanism. But I think that there's a little bit of a feed back mechanism in the nature of which I'm not entirely sure. But you can only get so much angiogen receptor. But your entirely right, as I said, the testosterone or other steroid hormones estrogen as well, bind to receptors and those receptors turn on genes. And so the content of the receptors may be we think anyway. Another subshurellum the same thing. The rate limiting action of where the testosterone probably is having any action if it's having any action at all. And the same for estrogen. So. OK. So there could be some and maybe other metabolites that bind into the eye. Where we're scratching your surface with the big one and said there's lots of other downstream hormones that we're not looking at, for sure. Well, that makes a lot of sense with the extremes. Because I would, those were, you pretty much answered my questions, which were, you know, you give, you inject, you know, people with testosterone and muscle growth goes up. But it's super physiologic, dealing with both hormone, though, right? Yeah, absolutely. Super physiologic. Absolutely. So it's not just so much of the transient increase that you're getting from the exercise, but this constant, like where it's just elevated for like hours and hours and hours. And, you know, it's not like, like I said, the diurnal range is so ridiculously small as opposed to, you know, where steroids are or where growth hormone administration is, that the comparison of like normal changes, you know, I'm a high testosterone responder or I'm a low testosterone or I'm a high growth hormone, you know, et cetera. It's not the same as talking about somebody who's taking exogenous supplemental hormones. They're completely different paradigm. So you can't invoke this as proof of that, if you like. The deficiency end is interesting. And I can see the clinical case for treating high-poken adult men if they have low testosterone or kids with, you know, classic high-pupotourism to get them to a, probably not the statuary that they would have if they're completely normal. But certainly not short. Some people choose not to do it. Some people just say, no, that's, that's how I was born, that's the way it is. I can respect that, but at the same time, you could make a case. Where I differ with some of these sort of exogenous, they call themselves anti-aging clinics, is that the anti-aging that you get as a result of taking the hormone is maybe at the expense of over stimulation of anabolic or cell division cancer, et cetera, to the degree that it's doing you more harm than good. And I think unless it's closely managed, you need to be aware of that. Are you talking about like hormone replacement therapy? What about people that are doing hormone replacement therapy that are mimicking more what your physiologic levels would be? And that's the paradigm. So if this is the normal range of testosterone and most guys, they point out that it's quite right wide and it is. So you can be just this side of it or just this side of it and you're at the low end of normal and bringing you into the normal range, that's clinical treatment. And it's the same for women at menopause taking supplemental estrogen to bring themselves back to where they were premenopausily, I understand. But those are closely monitored clinical situations or bringing you, with growth hormone injections back to here. I think where the difference is, you know, the sort of all called the wild west of these anti-aging clinics where people just could take this and there's no monitoring of what happens or it's a physique driven process. And so, you know, older guys say, look at me now and I'm like, that's great. You look great. I hope there's nothing, you know, with your prostate or elsewhere that's growing, that's all. And that again comes down to our lifestyle on physical activity, you know, which as you said, you 20% you don't, you're eating, you're eating, you're bad stuff, you're, you're bad stuff. I indulged, you indulged. Yeah, yeah. A slice of cheesecake is okay. Right. Happed dog at a ball game is okay in my opinion, but you know, especially if you're a physically active person, you're not eating it for every meal every day. Right. I mean, so, you know, again, it comes down to, I think also, you know, back to some of the observational studies where, you know, if you are going to do hormone replacement therapy and like maybe there's a reason evolutionary speaking, like that our bodies start to make less of those growth factors and hormones as we each. Maybe because cancer incident is good up. And so if you're not taking care of the other factors that can lead to cancer, like, you know, like exercise, you know, it was one of the best known ways to lower risk. Absolutely. Many different cancers, including hormone hormones. Yes. You know, then you probably shouldn't be thinking about hormone replacement therapy and to figure out the physical activity part first, right? So, you know, for each other. But yeah, great. No, no, no, I think it's a really relevant point to say that as you say, the benefits of exercise never stop. I mean, it's almost embarrassing to talk about how good it is for you. You talked about cancer. Yeah, 13 to the 26 most common types of cancer or lower in people who have higher levels of leisure time, physical activity. And so that's not exercise. That's gardening. That's walking. That's like, you know, just the general day to day, you know, not yes, moving around yet, not sitting down all the time. So, you know, and we were talking before the show to say, I have a colleague, I give her a shout out Jen Heiss, just wrote a great book on the mental health benefits of exercise in, you know, 15, 20 years ago, if you said, well, you're going to, you can change the size of your hippocampus and your brain with exercise that have been like, right. You can. You get improvements in mood. You get improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and everything. You're almost of the magnitude similar to people, you know, taking pharmaceutical, you know, interventions for those things. So, it's just a win-win-win-win. If it's a pill, we have everybody who'll be on it. Absolutely. I kind of want to just, because it's a good transition into the sauna, the growth hormone type of test. You know, I've been a routine sauna user since about 2009. Yeah. I used to, I mean, I was used to go every day. All right. So, I was like, really, for me, it was like my grad school. You know, I just, I would go into the sauna before I go into the lab and it really seemed to help with my anxiety and help me. So, I started to read about it. It was something's going on here, right? And I came into this whole growth hormone literature. We're like, holy crap. You can do like two or three back-to-back sauna sessions, separated by, you know, five or ten minutes of cooling. And you could get up to like a 16-fold transient elevation in growth hormone. Yes. And so, at the time, I was thinking, oh, you know, because I had used it so much through periods of injury and when I usually lose muscle mass and it was very apparent to me, subjectively speaking, that I was not losing muscle mass. And so, at the time, you know, it's like, growth hormone. That's it because it's an animal hormone, of course. Yeah. You know, net proteins and this is will be increased. And turns out I was probably wrong about that part. So, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think the way to think about these hormones is that when we're kids and we're growing, you need growth hormone to grow. Your IGF1 is a pro-growth factor. Once you're finished, you're linear and sort of broad growth. These hormones are mostly, in the case of growth hormone, it's actually a fat mobilizing hormone. That's one of its great side effects if you're taking exogenous growth hormone. You notice you get leaner. It probably doesn't do much for your muscle. I do think that there's something to the heat exposure, probably outside of growth hormone, that at the local level, we're beginning to appreciate that the stress of the sauna. So, it is stress, what's a thermal stress? But, I mean, it sort of recreates, quote unquote, mimics some aspects of exercise. And we talked about hot yoga is one of these great sort of not only relaxing therapeutic, but you're physically active. You're stretching muscles, but you're doing in the heat. So, there's a big thermal stress and your cardiovascular system, absolutely is like, we're on the siege here. Heart rate goes up, everything else like that. But our muscles begin to turn on what we call heat shock proteins. So, these heat shock proteins, as the name implies, they were discovered when people applied local heating. And for a long time, they're like, I don't know what these proteins do, but what we understand now, that they shaper on, or they act as essentially, little proteins that bind to other proteins to prevent them from being what we call misfolded. And part of the stress response, and so, as the name implies, could be stressed due to exercise, could be stressed due to sickness, could be stressed, you know, you name it, is that more proteins are misfolded. So, and people, you know, what about misfolded proteins? And I said, well, you know, proteins are string of amino acids, and then it sort of bends in on itself, and then it does all kinds of things. And it twists into a shape that is, it's final shape for it to be useful. But sometimes, it doesn't do that, and it does something else. And let's say it just, it doesn't fold into the shape, it should be. And stress proteins help those proteins maintain and get into that appropriate folded structure. So, yes, I think you were getting benefits. I, you know, I don't know that the growth hormone was a big part of it, but definitely the, the heat shock protein response is, I think, and we were getting to see more and more that you can alleviate muscle atrophy, and even in some patient groups with various forms of muscular dystrophy that actually, you know, heating and exercise could have synergistic benefits. So, again, pulling away some of the, you know, the covers on this, it's a fascinating area. So, and the other part, and we, we talked about this too, you feel good afterwards. And as they said, at the top levels of athletic performance, like the feeling good part is, you can't undervalue that, even if the physiology goes, oh, there's nothing to it, and the athlete says, I feel good, right? And the physiology goes, oh, okay, well, you know, you scored three goals last night. So, look, who might get that, you know, I can't argue. Yeah, it's a feeling good as big. It is. I'm glad you brought up the heat shock proteins because that, to my credit, I did publish a review. All right. Where are you going? Talk to all about the heat shock proteins. For a little bit. For the preventing and, you know, muscle atrophy with, there's been animal studies that I had cited many, you know, many years ago, and they've been sort of redone in a sense in some local applied heat therapy studies where they're preventing, you know, atrophy from disused. Yes. And so, again, back to this elderly population. So, I've been able to get my mother in the sauna, in the sauna. Yeah. And, you know, there's only so much you can do with someone who has not spent their entire life in a very physical, physically active. Correct. And I find that it's easier to get her in the sauna. And so, I'm, I'm mimicking to some degree in a little bit of moderate aerobic exercise. Yeah. And then, hopefully, also getting some heat shock proteins to help with muscle atrophy, which she's battled, everyone, you know, as we're getting a little bit of battling. So, it's really nice to hear that you said that on the, on the field, depression. I'll send you my article. Sure, sure. There's a whole section because there's been a, a sham controlled trial looking at the effects of heat stress on majored pressive disorder. There's a sham control with them. Yeah. And basically, it had an under-depressant effect. And I'm working now. I'm collaborating with someone, I'm a small collaborator. I'm the biomarker person. Yeah. Dr. Ashley Mason, she's at UCSF, she's now running a large, more, a large, randomized control trial on this. And so, that's in the, in the works right now. But the thermal stress side of things, you wonder, you know, so here's exercise. There's thermal stress, but there's muscular activity. So you're talking, I'll call it passive thermal stress. I mean, they must cross over. And so, would it be surprising that, you know, one sort of mimics part of what the other does. And so, yeah. So I have a question for you because as I was reading some of your reviews, something that came up was, you know, looking into the causes of sarcopenia, the many causes. Yes. But even down to like looking at the molecular and the muscle tissue level, there was this degradation or a proteostasis. What? The, the, the basically proteostasis was messed up in type two. Was it type two muscle fibers? Yep. And I was wondering if the heat shock proteins in sauna may play a very specific role in countering that type of. So if you'd asked me that and here's where, you know, never stop learning begins, even three or four weeks ago, I would have to say, you know, I'm not really sure. I had the pleasure of attending the International Biochemistry of Exercise Conference in Toronto. So it was an easy one for me to get to just two weeks ago. And there was discussion about this sort of heating aspect of things and heat shock protein response in what it could do is in terms of a protective measure against atrophy and maybe it's important. And it was in the context of somebody who was talking about the benefits of exercise for people with various forms of dystrophy. But, you know, let's just say it's muscle loss and, you know, the heat shock protein response as in the role that I described as a shaperone protein. But also in other ways that we're probably not understanding as well, could be beneficial. And I definitely didn't want to dismiss that. I do think that there is enough evidence to be at least interested in raise your eye about, say, this is deserving of greater and deeper study. So again, okay, said, honestly, three or four weeks ago, I mean, like, I don't know, but I heard a great exchange between a former mentor of mine and a good friend who is an extraordinarily bright individual. And they both sort of nodded and thought, you know what, this is something that there's something going on. So I'm still learning. We're all still learning. So yeah, never say never. Yeah, I mean, if you ever want to, I got Dr. Deary Lackenon, he's an East up in Linn. He's a friend of mine. And he's got lots of samples and looking for collaborators always. So there's lots of possibilities there because I would love to sort of connect people and try to ask the right questions and see if we can answer them. And then that would be. It's an interesting one to answer because it seems that the heat shock response is something you can locally induce. It doesn't have to be as saunas. So you can heat one leg and not the other leg for an exam. So these are all these things that can pop in my mind and like how could we study that in the most efficiently possible? Do we need to put people in the saunas? That wouldn't be good. Right. Maybe we could do local heating and again, that the cardiovascular effects to do with that and opening up capillaries and so more profusion at them. I mean, there's all kinds of things that are suggested that there could be something going on there, yeah, for sure. Well, before we wrap this up, this has been a really very interesting talk. So I want to go back to your three. If it's too good to be true, probably is. There was the third one, which is their exceptions. And I want to, here's my jam. Go for it. Omega-3 and Vitamin D. I check. Okay. Okay. So my supplement shelf is small. I live a lot further north than you do. So we get less useful sunshine, definitely in the winter months. Vitamin D is, yeah, absolutely. So my question to you being a muscle expert. And me, I guess people would call me an enthusiast. I definitely try to follow the science, but there's widespread deficiency with Vitamin D. Correct. Yes. You know, across North America. Absolutely. And it is a steroid hormone that is doing similar things. Like testosterone in the sense where is binding a receptor going into the cell nucleus and regulating- Changing all kinds of genes, absolutely. Like 5% of the protein-incoding hemorrhage. Absolutely. So it's not just about bone homostasis back to the RDA, but with Omega-3. Yes. So I do read a lot of the literature. And I certainly don't always get things right. But I've seen more than one. I've seen probably a handful of studies now, looking at Omega-3 supplementation and muscle mass. Specifically, there's older women, usually in older populations, but it helping with, I think it may be helping prevent somebody atrophy or having with lean muscle mass. Is that a real thing? It's a real thing. And like in our hands, I had a postdoc, Chris McLory. He left the lab when he came. He has a faculty position now at Queens University. But when he came, he was an Omega-3 guy. And he said, we need to study more of this in human muscles. So we ran a trial. And we ran it actually, younger women. And then a bunch of people said, why don't you run it women? Nobody ever asked you that. Why don't you run it men, right? So we did it in younger women. For a number of reasons, there's not much research in younger women. And we did actually think that it might be more effective in women than men. For reasons, I don't fully understand as you mentioned older women there as well. We supplemented one group with very high dose omega-3 fatty acids. And we supplement the other group with sort of a coronoel placebo. And then we brazed one of their legs for our local, this use-attrophy model for two weeks. And the women on the Omega-3 supplement saw a really mild, disuse-attrophy response. And then returned to normal, much quicker than the other group who saw a much greater atrophic response and didn't get back to normal after two weeks. So we call it passive remobilization. You remove the brace. You don't actively rehab. You just go back, do all your normal things. So it's anti-catabolic for sure. That you can have a nutritional intervention that can affect disuse like that. That's a profound finding. So you can imagine with respect to our disuse, catabolic crisis model, lots more work to be done. That's more Chris's area. He left, I'm like, that's yours, man. What's the still doing it? You still doing it? I mean, here's the thing is that we have this aging population. And it is much easier. It is much as we want to get them to, first and foremost, can we get them to do any sort of resistance training, obviously. But that is struggle, especially for people that are much, much older, getting them to take a pill. Is one of the easiest things that you can do. And I think there's just been more and more evidence that there's a many benefits. And I have talked about a lot of this. But the anti-inflammatory resolving inflammation in so many different ways. I mean, there's the specialized mediating promediating molecules. There's the resolvements, the protectants, the maricens. I mean, it's doing, it isn't just prostaglandins. It's not just this one pathway. I mean, it's doing a lot of things. What role does inflammation, so inflammation? I know from reading your work inflammation in a disease state cancer or textured IBDs or things like this. And it can be catabolic, right? Absolutely. But about the low grade chronic inflammation that unhealthy. Yeah, I think the disclaimer is, we've learned a lot about how to make muscle more antibiotic in young individuals. And then we've extended that to healthy, older individuals. We don't have older individuals participating in our study if they're on and the list of medications is relatively long. So they're probably the healthiest of the older population. And so we're getting, we'd like to think that's a true effect of aging rather than some meds that they're taking. But let me just say that chronic low grade inflammation and what people call inflamaging is problematic. It's probably responsible for some of the antibiotic resistance we talked about. We think so dampening the inflammation beforehand could help you get more antibiotic in extreme situations. So ICU or cancer or particularly cancer caccia where people are swimming in inflammatory cytokines. And COVID gave us a little glimpse of this cytokine storm that some people experience. And the prognosis becomes very poor. So we think a lot of things nutritionally can combat muscle abuse. But if you have a patient that's on bed rest and an ICU and they're massively inflamed, you can throw a lot of things nutritionally at these people. And it's just dust in the wind. Nothing really happens. So the message is you've got to get inflammation under control before you're able to see the full and robust effect of a lot of the antibiotics stimuli that we're talking about. So it is an issue. And it's clearly something that people need to think about as they get older. I'm actually of the mind that the low dose aspirin that a lot of people are taking to sort of tamp down inflammation is probably a good thing. But then also the flip side is to say, there is some degree of inflammation that needs to happen. So if you keep chronically suppressing inflammatory responses in younger people, even, I don't think you get a full adaptation. So some inflammation, good, and necessary, chronic low grade inflammation, probably not good, definitely rampant inflammation in all kinds of clinical states. Yeah, that's really going to take the edge off of anything that you do both nutritionally and probably from an exercise perspective too. Yeah, that and what you said makes a lot of sense with obvious you do want an inflammatory response when you need it. I mean, you see pathogen. And that is also why I think omega-3 is one of the best ways to kind of lower the chronic inflammation because it has to do with resolving the... In so many ways, the resolving of the inflammation. It's almost if you're turning down the burner, right? You're just sort of, you know, it's taking the edge off of that. So no, I agree. Right. Yeah. And then my last supplement to ask you about creatine, on the hydrate is that, like, is that something, I mean, I mean, there's evidence that it seems to be beneficial for muscle growth, for brain health, but is there side effects? Is there worry? Like, is it what do your thoughts on it? Yeah, yeah. So again, short supplement shelf. That's on there for me. I don't take it all the time. I have periods where I'm doing a lot of work. I try and sort of ramp up the volume of work that I'm doing. And I will add creatine in at that time. Now, I know a lot of, I've got friends who will say, why aren't you taking it all the time? And I get it. Probably about 40 years old now. So a supplement's go. It came and stayed, which makes it one of the number three categories. It sounds to good to be true. It's effects are pretty mild on muscle, but they're there. They're potent. They last. Now the brain and the cognitive side of things is, you know, the evidence is growing in that area too. If there were a danger with it, you know, that it was having, there was a lot of talk about its damage in your kidneys. It's doing this. You shouldn't, you know, it's a Guantadino compound, et cetera, et cetera. We've got 40 years worth of data with people on the supplement now. And we're not seeing some sort of right wave of people who used it getting various forms of cancer, et cetera, et cetera, which you would expect 40 years is enough to see the effect. All the data reviewing it from a safety standpoint has given it two thumbs up. The adverse events are rare. Usually in combination because people are taking, not only that supplement, but several others. So, you know, pinning it on creatin' per se. It hasn't shown any creatin' so. It definitely gets an a grade from the effectiveness standpoint. I think it's good for younger and older people. I'm good with the health or the safety side of things, as well. I do think people, if they're gonna try it, should do it sort of gradually, used to be take these big loading doses. And I think most people now, give friend of mine, Mark Tornalpalski, neuromusketer physician, has all of his neuromusketer patients on it. So, I think that that's a fairly robust endorsement of what it can do for people with compromise muscle function. And he recommends that these people just start with a dose of about, you know, four to five grams of creatin' a day. What does he, what does he use in it, like exactly four? Well, I mean, all of these people have is one of their overriding symptoms no matter what they have, whether it's a mitochondrial myopathy or some sort of dystrophy condition is muscle weakness. So, people do get a little bit of a boost. It may not be, you know, something that you were eye to consider worthy, but if you're somebody who's close to that line where, you know, disability is here and ability is here, then creatin' could be what it is that pushes you over that line. So, he's, you know, I think, one, and again, you can go and read his papers. They're pretty robust studies done in all kinds of populations. And so, yeah, try it. See what you think. Most people tolerate it very well. You don't need a fancy brand of it. The stuff they sell at Costco or whatever is just as good as anything else. The monohydrate form is the one to aim for. Don't be fooled by creatin' insert your favorite derivative monohydrate is the one that's been most studied and so probably the one you want to go for for sure. And it's good to know. So, you don't actually have to be physically active to reap any benefits from it. And that was the question I had. I mean, again, thinking of parents and grandparents. Right. I mean, that's the issue with the ones that are not physically active. Or that, I mean, there's people that walk their dogs and stuff, which is good. That at least gives them some physical activity. But you don't have to be pumping iron and stuff to it. No, you don't. Because I always thought about it. I'm like, well, I'm not like a gym or a ads. Yeah, yeah, I need it. I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think the stuff now with creatin' that they're uncovering that makes me think maybe this should be part of my regular routine. Actually, it has less to do with the muscle. And more to do with the brain and the cognitive performance that it's come back several times now, improves. And you mentioned on the director of pace, it has a special place at my heart. And the truth is that you talk to people in pace. Our oldest participant is 104. So I consider him to be the icon of wisdom. And people talk about when they get older from a health standpoint. They want to be a burden. And that always when you unpack it is around, I don't want for somebody to have to take care of me because my physical capacity has gone down. All that my mental capacity has gone down. They all fear that. So it's dementia and then it's physical inability to do things. And so I say, well, you're here working on the physical ability and but you're working on the dementia too. And they say, well, what else can I do? I said, well, here's a list of sort of things. And by no means a dementia expert, but create and might be something that older people might want to talk about for sure. That's awesome. Really appreciate this conversation too. And I look forward to continuing to follow your research. You are quite active on Twitter. So can you tell people what your Twitter handle is? Is your handle? Yes. Yes. I'm Mac Kim Proff, Macy KNPR-OF, the same on Instagram. I'm much better on Twitter. I just must more comfortable with that rather than a picture of me doing something on Instagram. And I do have a Facebook page as well. It's smp.phd.p and that's a professional page. You can find me on Facebook. And I'm on LinkedIn as well. So awesome. Well, I follow you on Twitter. And there's your tweeting useful things so I encourage others to follow you as well. And again, thank you so much to our friends. My pleasure. Look forward to chatting with you again soon. Yeah.

Up to 95% of teens reported using at least one social media platform. The weight of evidence that early use of smartphone in tablets and their effects on social and neurological development is a public health concern that continues to build. So let's talk about it. New research from the global mind project indicates that delaying the age at which children first receive a portable electronic device such as a smartphone or a tablet can have a substantial impact on their adult mental health. Notably, this delay significantly improve their social self. So this is a composite measure that takes into account factors like self confidence and positive interaction abilities. On the flip side, providing a child with a smartphone or tablet at a younger age was correlated with heightened instances of suicidal ideation, aggression and feelings of detachment from reality. Its particularly intriguing is that these trends were more prominent in females and remain consistent across various geographical regions. Drawing from additional research, we know that excessive use of smartphones and engagement in social media can have detrimental effects on kids and teenagers. Young children aged two to five with an excessive amount of screen time defined as more than one hour per day with significantly associated with lower percentile ranks in cognition, language and social emotional skills. Increase screen time can also lead to sleep disturbances, decreased physical activity, and issues with social development. Sleep and exercise are cornerstones for developing brains. They are essential for cognitive growth and well-being. The conclusion from this new study is in some ways sobering, even if it's utterly unsurprising. I am personally enormously enriched by tech, but striking a balance and making sure it isn't at the expense of my mental health has been something that even as an adult requires continual reinforcement and restraint. That's even with an adult experience and a more developed capacity for executive function. This is a cognitive capacity that doesn't reach maturity until the early 20s. So here's my take home. I think armed with these new facts. Many of us should be at least asking the questions about when. How much and where tablets in smartphone devices fit in, especially for children and teenagers. Ultimately, we have to weigh the merits and the trade-offs of portable devices for ourselves, for our children individually. But it might mean holding out on that tablet until they're a little older, setting rules around it and certainly demonstrating our own self-discipline in their use. On a positive note, there's an increasing acknowledgement of the addictive nature of these devices and potential downsides to their usage. This realization opens up a whole spectrum of viable options for instance opting for a retro-style flip phone could be a thoughtful first choice for a child's first phone. Regardless of whether a use specifically resonate with these suggestions, what's crucial is sparking this dialogue. As our social awareness heightened, as consensus strengthens, we might ease the collective peer pressure pushing every kid to possess an iPhone at the earliest opportunity. A little bit of food for thought, love to hear what you all think and really hope this spur some beneficial conversation.

Welcome to the Family Fitness Podcast. I'm your host, Rhonda Patrick. Today we're diving deep into the science and practicality of incorporating vigorous intensity exercise into our lives. It's not just about living longer, it's about enriching the quality of life at essentially every stage and also influencing brain function. During vigorous exercise, our muscles essentially become mini biochemical labs synthesizing compounds like lactate and myocides. These aren't just muscle bound. They get into circulation. They travel to far-up tissues and they signal to them and they have a variety of benefits, including the synthesis of elements like brain-drive neurotrophic factor or BDNF, crucial for brain health and neuronal health. They also potentially initiate anti-cancer mechanisms. Not only are muscles little chemical producing factories, but they also act like sponges to soak up compounds that can be harmful to the brain, improving mental health and reducing neurodegenerative disease risk. We're going to dive deep into the realm of VO2 Max optimization. VO2 Max is not just about a measure of cardiovascular respiratory fitness, it's directly linked to longevity. Essentially, the higher your VO2 Max, the longer you're likely to live, and there doesn't seem to be an upper limit to the life-extending benefits of enhanced cardiovascular respiratory fitness, at least within your genetic potential. We'll get into the details of how to calibrate high intensity efforts with zone 2 training, methodologies for improving VO2 Max, with the spotlight on the Norwegian 4x4 protocol, and even touch on some straightforward tactics like assessing VO2 Max, so the pragmatic test, which is the 12 minute run test. Equally important, we'll navigate through the processes of myotophageen mitochondrial biogenesis. These are cornerstones for cellular rejuvenation, essentially reversing the aging process on a cellular level. There's a lot of questions to answer, what is vigorous exercise? What is high intensity exercise? What about zone 2 training? So let's start by covering what is not vigorous exercise. Zone 2 training is also sometimes known as aerobic-based training. It primarily targets aerobic energy systems and can be sustained for longer durations. We're talking an hour and more. Some experts define this type of training to be around 70 to 80% of maximum heart rate. Possibly lower for people that are unfit. It's also defined by the talk test, so you should be able to talk comfortably, but not sing. So you should be a little breathy when you're talking, but still able to talk comfortably. Zone 2 training involves exercising at a moderate intensity. It's a steady state type of lactate threshold training. Lactate threshold refers to the point at which the body begins to produce lactate at a faster rate than it can clear it away. So keep in mind there's a lot of individual variation in determining the lactate threshold because people can have different baseline lactate levels for one, which is typically around 0.9 to 1 millimolar generally speaking. People also have different rates of lactate production and clearance. And even at the same relative exercise intensity. So for example, trained athletes might have a higher lactate threshold in terms of both exercise intensity and lactate concentration compared to untrained individuals. Genetics also play a role. There are many great podcasts out there covering zone 2 training, including Peter T. as the drive with guest Dr. Enigo San Milion. Now let's talk about vigorous exercise. So generally speaking, vigorous exercise represents a level of exertion where exercise goes beyond the lactate threshold, which means lactate begins to accumulate in the muscles more rapidly. There are various intensities within vigorous exercise. So a level intensity referred to as the maximal steady state threshold. Sometimes called zone 3 is above the lactate threshold and it's challenging to hold a conversation and it's difficult to maintain this level of exercise for longer than 20 to 30 minutes. This level of intensity is somewhere between 80 to 85 percent max heart rate. However vigorous exercise also includes exercising at intensities higher than this. So a higher intensity training where there's significant amount of lactate accumulation and your close to your what's called anaerobic threshold, this is a level of intensity usually around 85 to 95 percent max heart rate and it's difficult to maintain for longer than a few minutes. Sometimes this type of training intensity is called zone 4 training. Then there's the all out near maximal intensity and this is sometimes called zone 5 training. These are shorter intervals and it's generally hard to maintain this level level of intensity for longer than one minute. So when we're talking about high intensity interval training, it involves alternating between periods of high intensity vigorous exercise in periods of lower intensity rest depending on the high intensity interval training or hit for short protocol. These can include intervals ranging from zone 3 to zone 5 followed by recovery periods. The idea that high intensity interval training is only anaerobic is a misconception. While high intensity interval training exercise does rely more heavily on anaerobic energy systems, it still requires significant aerobic metabolism. So hit can improve both aerobic and anaerobic fitness and it's my opinion that getting your heart rate to at least 80 percent max heart rate. So that being at least 80 percent is a really good place to be if you are targeting brain benefits and we'll dive a lot into that in a minute. But I want to start by talking about cardiovascular respiratory fitness, health span and longevity. So the O2 max is a measure of maximal oxygen uptake which reflects an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during exercise. It's considered one of the best indicators of cardiovascular respiratory fitness and it's associated with improved health span, increased lifespan, higher cardiovascular level as measured by VO2 max have been consistently leaked to reduced risk of mortality and longer lifespan. So in the podcast when I use the term VO2 max, just keep in mind that it's a measurement of cardiovascular respiratory fitness. The greatest longevity benefit that comes from improving your VO2 max is from people starting from a below average VO2 max and moving anywhere above average. So even going from a below normal VO2 max for your age group in gender to a low normal is associated with a 2.1 year increase in life expectancy. bumping that up going from a below normal to high normal VO2 max is associated with a 2.9 year increase in life expectancy and going even further to the upper limit of normal is associated with 4.9 year. So almost five year increase in life expectancy. On average each unit increase in VO2 max. So that's one milliliter per kilogram per minute is associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy. In another study involving only men for every 10 unit increase in VO2 max. So this would be then 10 mills per kilogram per minute. There was a 17% lower risk of death from cancer and a 11% lower all cause mortality. So dying for many different non accidental causes of death. Another study published in JAMA in 2018 found that there was no apparent upper limit to the benefit of cardiovascular respiratory fitness on mortality within normal ranges of human life expectancy of course. In fact the study reported that elite performers, these are people that performed in the top 2.3% on the fitness test, had an 80% reduction in mortality risk compared to the lowest performer. So they performed in the bottom 25% on the fitness test. And if you compare the elite performers to the high performers, so these folks did really well but they were just under the elite. They were between the top 25% and the top 2.3%. The elite performers had a 20% mortality risk decline compared to even those high performers. But going back to what I said earlier about just moving out of that low fitness group will give huge advantages to life expectancy. So people on the low fitness group had a five-fold higher risk of death than the elite performers. But what is also so interesting is that the risk of dying due to low fitness was similar or even bigger than risks associated with having heart disease, smoking or diabetes. So being fitter is really good for your health at every level of fitness and there's always room for improvement. So the question is, well how can we improve our B02 max? Lots of different training protocols zone. Two training for example, high intensity interval training, you know, vigorous intensity exercise, all improve cardiovascular respiratory fitness and can increase VO2 max. Hit has been shown to significantly improve VO2 max, even with shorter training durations. This is because hit recruits both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and increases the intensity of the workout resulting in greater cardiovascular stress and then adaptations. But this is important. There are individuals who engage in more moderate intensity, you know, steady state, zone 2 training that do not experience significant improvements in VO2 max. In fact, research is shown that approximately 40% of people do not see a measurable increase in their VO2 max. Even after engaging in guideline-based, moderate intensity exercise, which is about 2.5 hours of this type of exercise per week for several months. But when these, what are called non-responders, incorporated more vigorous intensity exercise, such as high intensity interval training, they do start to see improvements in VO2 max. So this suggests that adding higher intensity exercise to an exercise routine can help eliminate that non-response and also can lead to greater benefits in cardiovascular respiratory fitness. The reason for non-response to moderate intensity exercise, it's not completely understood, but the addition of vigorous intensity exercise is important for overall improvements in VO2 max. Engaging in more vigorous exercise seems to provide a stronger stimulus for physiological adaptations that lead to increased cardiovascular fitness. So again, I think these findings do highlight the importance of incorporating vigorous intensity exercise, particularly incorporating maybe a high intensity interval training into a training routine. And obviously for individuals who were time-pressed and can't dedicate several hours per week to doing a more type of zone two type of training, including shorter sessions of higher intensity exercise can still have significant improvements in VO2 max and overall health. So you might be wondering, how much time do I dedicate to my more vigorous type of exercise versus a more moderate intensity zone two type of training? And I really think that answered depends on a lot of factors, your individual goals, what you enjoy doing most, what you're going to do the most. I mean, all those things are important because at the end of the day establishing a habit, having an exercise routine that you're going to consistently do is what is most important. For endurance athletes, I mean, the answer is easy, right? You're already dedicating several hours a week to doing more zone two training and about 20% of that training is dedicated to shorter higher intensity workouts, more vigorous intensity workouts. And this is commonly known as the 80-20 rule. But remember, this is people that are doing extensive amounts of training anywhere between 10 to 30 hours a week. I think it's a common misconception to apply that 80-20 rule to like any committed exerciseer and any casual exerciseer who are doing well under less than 10 hours a week. As you think about someone who is a committed exerciseer, maybe work out three to five days a week, how much of that time should be spent doing vigorous intensity exercise. I would say for VO2 max and other adaptations we're going to discuss, including the brain, about half of that exercise training time, I think, should be spent in vigorous exercise. So again, you want to be at least 80% of your max heart rate or more, obviously, there's resistance training to incorporate as well into any training program. There's casual exerciseers, so people that work out maybe two to three times a week. They should probably spend more than half of their time doing more vigorous intensity exercise. I think this ensures you're pushing your limits and making sure that you're getting adaptations, fitness gains in a shorter period of time. There are a variety of VO2 max training protocols, so for people that are looking for that more vigorous exercise using, you know, using high intensity and able training to improve their VO2 max, the key here is longer intervals, so incorporating longer intervals, such as two, three, four, maybe even five minutes at the highest workload you can sustain for that time, and then performing four intervals with rest and recovery in between each of those. So this protocol may require maybe a 20 minute time commitment, but it can lead to significant improvements in VO2 max. There's a few examples of VO2 max training Dr. Martin Cabala who was a recent podcast guest gave a variety of examples of this, so there's three to five minute repeats at the highest sustainable intensity. We talked about you doing those three to five minute intervals that you can maintain and then you rest and recover and repeat those intervals for a total of 20 minutes. I think a popular variation of this is called the Norwegian 4x4 interval training protocol. So the intervals are four minutes long and you're aiming for about 85 to 95% of your max heart rate or the maximum level of intensity you can maintain for the entire four minutes. These intervals can be brutal, so the recovery period is three minutes long and the intensity is significantly lower, like light exercise, more like a zone one training exercise. You want to allow yourself recovery time, the clearance of lactate, you want your heart rate to come down significantly so that you can prepare for the next four minute interval. So these four minute intervals are repeated four times and again in between each interval is a three minute recovery. So that's the Norwegian 4x4 interval training. There's another type of VO2 max training protocol. It's the one minute on one minute off protocol. This is where you perform one minute of intervals at the highest intensity you can do for one minute and then it's followed by one minute recovery period and then you repeat this interval pattern 10 or maybe five times for about 25 minutes or so. And this protocol also is effective at improving VO2 max and it does provide a lot of flexibility in terms of time commitment. It's also not as you know, grueling in terms of like doing a four minute interval versus a one minute interval when minute intervals are a little bit less intense and less painful. Obviously it's important that you know these protocols are sort of templates. They vary a lot based on individual fitness goals. You know there's other protocols out there that can improve VO2 max. The key is like a longer interval longer than like a tabada like a 20 second interval and so you know probably about at least one minute at the highest sustainable intensity that you can do. I think the Norwegian 4x4 protocols probably one of the best out there. One of the best hit protocols out there for improving VO2 max. So how do you measure VO2 max? Without equipment found in exercise physiology lab it's obviously challenging. There are several sort of tests that have been developed and verified for getting an estimate of your VO2 max. So they don't directly measure maximum oxygen uptake but they predict your VO2 max based on the relationship between your exercise intensity and your oxygen consumption. They're sort of useful in determining whether or not you're improving VO2 max if you're testing a type of training protocol. So that there's a couple of really like I said validated tests that have been validated in scientific literature that can sort of be done. Probably one of the best ones is the 12 minute run or sometimes called walk test depending on your level of fitness. It's often also referred to as the Cooper test and it involves having the participant run or jog as far as possible in 12 minutes. So you're supposed to pace yourself evenly. You don't want to start too fast and the test should be conducted on a flat surface. So like a track field is the best you don't want to have hills and stuff because it's about you know the maximum amount of distance you can cover in 12 minutes and if you have hills and stuff that's going to lessen that it's going to be more challenging and you know the distance won't be quite as far. So you'll need a fitness device, something that can record your distance and Apple Watch or you know fit or something and depending on your fitness level you can walk or you can run or a combination. So the distance covered within that 12 minute period serves as the primary metric for evaluating VO2 max which is then estimated using a formula so it's distance and meters minus 504.9 and then divided by 44.73 and you can look this formula up just look up the Cooper test to find the formulas online. Again you know there's there's some other validated test but I think that's probably one of the best better ones out there. You'll need a device that can Apple Watch or some sort of other device that can measure your distance but there's also some of these devices and wearables do estimate VO2 max during exercise using heart rate and your motion data you know for best results you have to make sure all your personal information's in there like your age and your weight and gender you know that stuff but that's another you know possibility. I would say the 12 minute run or walk test is a more it's a better way to do it particularly if you're trying to do something like the 4 by 4 Norwegian hit protocol to measure VO2 max improvements you want to see if what you're doing is improving your your estimated VO2 max so I think the the 12 minute run test is a good way to do that. I want to sort of change gears for a minute and talk about something that I also think is pivotal and it's a unique role for vigorous exercise in playing a role in enhancing health span and it has to do with changes in heart structure so as we age the heart undergoes specific inevitable changes right related to the aging process so it tends to get smaller it gets stiffer and this can impact the heart's efficiency potentially reducing our exercise capacity elevating our risk for cardiac issues but there can be exercise interventions like consistent aerobic exercise with a high proportion of it being vigorous intensity that can actually combat some of these effects so there was a landmark study published from Ben LeBien's group and it was an intervention study and it showed that two years of vigorous exercise in 50 year olds was able to reverse the aging of their hearts by as much as 20 years effectively making their hearts look more like a 30 year old which in my opinion is simply astonishing you're taking a 50 year old heart and making it look like a 30 year old heart. Now the exercise protocol used in this this particular study it was a protocol that that gradually increased the exercise intensity and also frequency so again I mentioned it was a two year intervention by the end of the first six months participants were exercising about five to six hours a week with a large portion of training being in that maximal steady state intensity exercise which I referred to earlier in the podcast it's often sometimes called zone three it is a type of vigorous intensity exercise they also were incorporating more higher intensity exercise so they also did the Norwegian 4 by 4 B2 training B2 max training protocol I just referred to and they did that once a week and I just think it's like I said I simply astonishing that you know you take these 50 year olds and after two years of a more vigorous intensity exercise training protocol it essentially reversed the effects of aging in the heart okay so let's shift gears yet again and talk a little bit about metabolic adaptations and again this is where I think vigorous exercise really shines particularly high intensity interval training it improves glucose control insulin sensitivity more more efficiently and more importantly than even continuous you know moderate intensity workouts and you know I do think that of course both exercise you know training protocols can enhance muscle adaptations and glucose regulation hit really seems to to do it quicker and again more robustly whereas moderate intensity exercise kind of demands longer sessions for comparable outcomes so research has found that high intensity interval training can enhance the muscles ability to take up glucose and improve glucose transport capacity so during high intensity unit interval training I'm during vigorous exercise there's a demand you know a demand for rapid energy production and so the body relies both on aerobic so oxygen using an anaerobic non oxygen using metabolic pathways to generate this energy the anaerobic pathway can lead to the production of lactate especially when the intensity of exercise surpasses the point at which the oxygen intake can keep up with the energy demand and so this is sometimes often referred to as the lactate threshold as we talked about for a long time lactate was considered primarily as a waste product contributing to muscle fatigue and you know this is of course been completely reversed recent research has you know totally changes understanding lactate generated in muscle tissue is transported not only back in a muscle and into mitochondria to be used as an energy source but it also when it starts to accumulate at higher levels travels systemically into circulation and gets transported to other tissues like the heart the liver the brain where it's used for energy it's also used as a signaling molecule so this is known as the lactate shuttle and was pioneered by Dr. George Brooks who is really trained the field and he also happened to be my second podcast guest ever on on this podcast. Anyways lactate you know it I mentioned it acts as a signaling molecule in those tissues as well and you can think of a signaling molecule as a chemical messenger that is sending a message to other cells. One of those messages is the upregulation of glucose transport capacity so vigorous intensity exercise high intensity interval training when when that lactate production accumulates it stimulates the expression and activity of glucose transporters known on the muscle known as glute 4 and this is on the muscle cell membrane and so that lactate acts as a signaling molecule to increase the transport of glucose transporters on on the muscle cells and this then allows for more efficient uptake of glucose into the from the bloodstream into the muscle even at rest and so consequently then insulin sensitivity is also improved and blood glucose levels are better regulated there's been several studies that have demonstrated that hit can improve glucose uptake enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk of developing type to diabetes this may be due to the intense metabolic stress created during hit which leads to greater activation of glucose transporters and improve glucose clearance so as I mentioned both high intensity and role training continues moderate intensity exercise can also be effective at improving glucose transport capacity in the muscles hit promotes rapid increases in glucose transporters allowing for that efficient glucose uptake immunization whereas continuous moderate intensity exercise although it's less intense still does also enhance glucose transporca capacity it improves the overall fitness of muscles as well so you know again it's just a longer duration of exercise time to get there and with the lactate generation that happens with you know high intensity exercise you're getting that immediate signal from lactate to increase the glucose group for transporters and so it's a very rapid and robust adaptation that happens there's at our other metabolic adaptation so just just kind of talking about mitochondria mitochondria are very important and they play a lot of roles in the body but one of the most important ones is the production of energy in the form of ATP this is obviously very important for muscles but also hugely important for the brain the heart the liver pretty much every organ athletes are very interested in mitochondrial health because they want their muscles to efficiently and effectively produce energy when they're training but mitochondria are also very important the context of aging as we age our mitochondria become less efficient at producing energy and this poses a problem for physical activity but also just for normal functioning of our organs now that problem of mitochondria not producing enough energy can actually be overcome by increasing the mitochondrial volume or what's called mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise particularly vigorous exercise is one of the best ways to do that so one of the most powerful indicators of healthy mitochondria is the ability to generate new healthy young mitochondria called mitochondrial biogenesis vigorous intensity exercise like high intensity high intensity interval training I mentioned it's one of the most powerful stimulators of mitochondrial biogenesis this has to do with the metabolic stress that is induced from vigorous intensity exercise the lactate itself again lactate is a signaling molecule when you're producing greater amounts of lactate that actually activates one of the major pathways that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis it's called PGC1 alpha and again lactates acting as a signal to produce more of that PGC1 alpha so when we perform vigorous intensity exercise such as hit that lactate generated from the muscles it's shuttled into the mitochondria because exercise increases the the number of mitochondria per cell again mitochondrial biogenesis and the more lactate that's able then to be used as energy or to produce energy and this is important to know if you're wanting to understand the bigger picture of where metabolism and lactate utilization fit into human performance but it's also important to realize that athletes put around anywhere between like I said 10 20 30 hours of training in a week if they're endurance athletes and usually about 80 percent of that training is in you know the the the modern intensity zone to training world with the remaining 20 percent being vigorous intensity exercise like hit if they're if they're putting in 20 hours a week of you know the the of modern intensity training then they're doing anywhere but you know they're doing you know for anywhere between four to six hours a week of vigorous exercise like hit so just the portion of their vigorous exercise alone they are doing is more than what committed exerciseers are doing so the question is what's the best training protocol for a non-athlete someone that's perhaps a committed exerciseer who is interested in health and longevity again both high intensity interval training zone two training also moderate intensity training can increase mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle hit does it more rapidly it's a more potent stimulus again with with lactate being a signaling molecule on the other hand zone two training you know first which is you know doing a more moderate intensity exercise that's sustained for longer duration does lead to an increase in mitochondrial content I think the key here is the total volume of training so higher intensity higher intensity exercise is a smaller volume and it can result in more rapid larger increases in mitochondrial content while doing a more moderate intensity zone two training also does the same thing but it just requires larger exercise volume or duration your muscles ability to use fat as a fuel is also closely tied to how many active mitochondrial you have so in other words increasing mitochondrial content also determines the ability of muscles to be able to oxidize fat both high-intensiable training so vigorous exercise end zone two training increase the capacity for fat oxidation by increasing mitochondrial content now by enhancing the growth of new mitochondria you're increasing the activity of key enzymes involved in fat metabolism so one of those is the carnitine pometole transferase enzyme or the CPT enzyme both types of exercise training moderate and also vigorous intensity exercise do increase the CPT enzyme capacity as well and you know obviously that is directly related to the utilization of fat as a fuel source so I think the bottom line here is that you know mitochondrial biogenesis increasing mitochondrial volume is key for mitochondrial health it's key for improving fat oxidation as well and both high-intensiable training and a more moderate zone two type of training will get you increases in mitochondrial volume so another way that exercise improves mitochondrial health is through a process known as mitophagey or mitophagey as some people call it so mitophagey is a type of a topology which involves the selective removal of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria from the cell or within the cell this process really helps maintain mitochondrial quality control and overall cellular health so when you put stress on mitochondria through exercise the body triggers you know the elimination of damage mitochondria and the replacement of those mitochondria with new healthy ones through mitochondrial biogenesis there's not a lot of direct human research on the effects of different training types of different training types of um different exercise training on mitophagey but I know of at least one human study that is found particularly vigorous intensity a rubic exercise enhances markers of mitophagey it's likely that both both vigorous exercise high intensity and a well training and more moderate exercise training can stimulate this process with hit just getting you faster and you know the moderate intensity zone to requiring a larger training volume but overall you know both hit zone two can promote skeletal muscle adaptations including mitochondrial biogenesis that oxidation mitophagey this is a repeating theme of this podcast and also on the one that I did with Dr. Martin Gabala on high intensity double training I think the choice between the two really depends again on individual goals preferences the amount of time available for training and just what you love to do hit offers that time efficiency it potentially has the the ability to have rapid improvements and adaptations in mitochondrial content while moderate intensity zone two training can yield similar adaptations with a larger volume of moderate intensity exercise you know sustained for a longer duration but I do think that it's important to probably try to incorporate both types of exercise training for a more well rounded way to kind of cover all your bases um and for those that are committed exercises if you're putting in let's say anywhere between two to five hours of training a week it's it's my opinion that you know you you should probably be doing a lot of a lot of that training or half of that training should be vigorous intensity exercise not only because the VO two max improvements be spoke about earlier but also because of brain benefits so let's talk about the brain exercise intensity like high intensity interval training has been shown to have unique benefits for brain health um obviously all types of exercise are beneficial for the brain but high intensity exercise may have additional neuroprotective and cognitive benefits and one of the mechanisms that's thought to underlie this is you know the unique effects of you know vigorous intensity exercise or hit on the brain because of the lactate production so during high intensity exercise lactate is produced in large amounts as we've talked about um largely as a byproduct of the metabolic stress you're you're kind of pushing that anaerobic threshold and when you produce lactate it's getting into circulation and it can cross the blood brain barrier there are lactate transporters MCT transporters on the blood brain barrier and it can you know cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain where then acts as a signal and it triggers a variety of beneficial adaptations so let's talk about some of those first you know lactate can be used by neurons as a preferential energy source so it's it's actually energetically favorable it takes less energy for mitochondria's to to mitochondria to use lactate versus glucose so um in effect neurons are are used to using lactate because asteroids in the brain which are a supporting cell for neurons are most eclectic that means they're mostly using glucose as energy they're not using mitochondria and they're producing lactate as a byproduct so asteroids are turning out tons of lactate in the brain and that lactate is being taken up you know by neurons through the MCT transporters and used as energy so um there's actually even been studies showing that the brain is working harder during exercise much like the muscles are working harder your heart's working harder and it's been shown that lactate actually fuels the brain during exercise so that lactate that's being trans like um that's being transferred into circulation it's being just soaked up by the brain and it's fueling the brain brain activity during exercise now another benefit of neurons in the brain using lactate as an energy source instead of glucose is it's spares glucose it's freeing up glucose to be used by another biochemical pathway known as the pentose phosphate pathway and this pathway uses glucose to make precursors called NADPH that's needed for the production of one of the most powerful antioxidant systems in the brain called glutathione so the less glucose is being taken up by neurons to be used as energy the more it can be spared to be used in this pentose phosphate pathway to make glutathione and this has really important relevance not only for just you know normal brain aging right I mean if you're if you're able to use more of the lactate as energy in spare glucose and make more glutathione in the brain generally speaking that's going to be more beneficial for just normal brain aging but it has special relevance also for traumatic brain injury TBI because you know that when there's that you know bolus of damage that's been done that that traumatic brain injury then glutathione is needed the most but you're also needing you know glucose for neurons as well and so and it's it's also awful because you know astrocytes which are usually making lactate for the neurons also become damage during a TBI and so there's a lactate shortage for neurons and there's been a few studies showing that a few infusion when there's TBI patients with TBI that get infused with sodium lactate this actually improves TBI outcomes and this is you know measured by the the glass cow scores so you know generally speaking I think that this glucose sparing effect also you know there's some evidence again obviously direct evidence with TBI outcomes that's been shown to have you know improvements in TBI outcomes I'm proposing a mechanism here with glucose sparing with respect to lactate lactate again also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis animal studies have shown this in the brain and neurons as well we don't have direct human evidence of that but there's no reason to think that wouldn't be a conserved mechanism so I think you know we covered the importance of brain lactate energetically speaking it's energetically favorable right neurons preferentially they prefer to use it we talked about the glucose sparing but let's go back to the signaling molecule aspect as we talked about earlier and the muscles we talked about it increasing glut for transporters it's also a signaling molecule in the brain you know it's acting as a messenger it's a way for the muscles to communicate with the brain directly and when neurons in the brain are using more lactate they're releasing a variety of neurotransmitters they release more north and fern for example so to help the brain working better to have more focus and attention it also signals to the brain to make more brain drive neurotrophic factor BDNF and I mean this is a very powerful neurotrophic factor it promotes the survival the growth and the function of neurons it plays a crucial role in neuro plasticity so this is the ability of the brain to adapt to form new connections higher levels the BDNF have been linked to improve cognitive function enhanced memory protection against neuro to gender of diseases like Alzheimer's disease if you want to put this in a sensational words to explain it BDNF is the youth elixir for the brain and exercising muscles produce lactate to help you bathe your brain in it so that's a little a sort of simplistic and more sensational way of thinking about it but essentially that's what's happening when the lactates increasing BDNF in the brain lactate is also a messenger not only in the brain but at the blood brain barrier you know this is made up of tiny blood vessels we covered this in a podcast with Dr. Axel Montaine so lactate signals to increase another growth factor at the blood brain barrier called veg F and this is bascular and defyield growth factor this helps grow new tiny vessels it's called this is called angio genesis the growth of new tiny blood vessels it helps them grow at the blood brain barrier it also helps repair damage blood vessels I mean these are these are these are things that are you know important for preventing the breakdown of the blood brain barrier so essentially veg F is increasing the vascular density and breakdown of the blood brain barrier is a major cause of brain aging it's a major cause of neuro inflammation it contributes to the vicious cycle of neuro inflammation and there's also emerging evidence that now suggests breakdown of the blood brain barrier is one of the earliest signs of dementia so again another reason why vigorous intensity exercise through that just generation of a lot of lactate then getting to the brain get into the blood brain barrier has unique benefits on overall brain health it's important to know I guess this is you know there are benefits to high intensity exercise on the brain that are not just exclusive to lactate right so there's increased blood flow there's the improved cardiovascular fitness the release of neurotransmitters the release of endorphins you know all of these things contribute to the positive effects of physical activity on the brain but vigorous intensity exercise I do think has some unique and very robust effects on brain health because of that lactate and so I really wanted to kind of dive deep into that so that you guys understand that you know your muscles are being pushed to work extra hard and this is then now causing adaptations in the brain that are pretty substantial in addition to lactate exercise intensity also affects the muscles ability to produce other compounds known as myocines so these are molecules released from muscle cells that signal to non muscle tissues that the body is physically active you know so again it's similar to what we've been talking about with lactate myocines have anti inflammatory they have anti cancer effects they also participate in metabolic pathways involved in fat oxidation glucose uptake they play a role in you know again cancer biology as well so generally speaking the greater the intensity of exercise the greater the myocine release again it's one of those you're putting stress on the muscles and the muscles are then forced to adapt and one of the adaptations is releasing myocines again duration also matter so the harder and the longer the muscles work the greater the myocine release some myocines are a little more sensitive to exercise intensity so I'll six was is one probably one of the most well known myocines it was initially thought to be a pro inflammatory cytokine so cytokine that plays a role in instigating inflammation when it is produced from muscle it acts as a myocine so it does play a role in inflammation but when it's produced from muscle during exercise it's signaling to other tissues to have an anti inflammatory response and so you'll often find even larger production of anti inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 in response to IL-6 produced during exercise Irson is another myocine it's involved in cancer protection it's involved in bone health metabolism and more and then there's also another well known myocine known as oncoastatin M and that myocine sort of plays a little more prominent role in you know anti cancer effects the key here is I think that exercise intensity and or duration are really what increase myocine levels so you're going for a two or three mile run probably crank it up a little more intense right you want to be you know at least 85% your max heart rate so you're not going to be really talking during that run are you going on an eight mile run maybe duration is on your side right and intensity can go down a notch since we were just talking about cancer it keep in mind that any level of physical activity is better than none so a study investigating physical activity and breast cancer and colorectal cancer found women who were more physically active before being diagnosed with breast cancer had about a 23% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 23% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those who were less active those who were more active before being diagnosed with colorectal cancer had a 26% reduced risk of dying from any cause and about a 25% reduced risk of dying from colorectal cancer so being active after diagnosis had even stronger benefits for both cancer types so these women had a 48% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 28% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those that were less active after diagnosis and the individuals with colorectal cancer had a 42% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 39% reduced risk of dying from colorectal cancer again after being diagnosed with with cancer so I do want to talk a little bit about you know there's a lot of mechanisms by which exercise can you know dampen cancer metastasis can improve cancer outcomes but there's one specific mechanism that involves tumor cells escaping from the original tumor site and then traveling into circulation to other locations other organs and you know other tissues they sort of take camp there they grow and divide and they form a secondary tumor those cancer cells are called circulating tumor cells and that process I just described is often called cancer metastasis right those circulating tumor cells are in circulation for a period of time and these circulating tumor cells are very sensitive to the shearing forces of blood flow so when you exercise and blood flow increases those circulating tumor cells they actually they actually die and this happens in a dose dependent manner so the more intensity exercise the more sensitive they are to to cell death durations also a key right so I mean you're talking about increasing the shear forces both intensity and duration are key here and and so it's really just a matter of getting that blood flow up intensity duration and that has been shown to kill circulating tumor cells and again this is associated with more positive outcomes with respect to cancer survival not only we talked a lot about you know muscles being little chemical producing factories they're producing chemicals like lactate they're producing myocines but they also act like sponges to soak up compounds that can be harmful to the brain so skeletal muscle has the ability to take up a compound known as chineurinean and convert it into chineuric acid which is a non-toxic metabolite and it does this by increasing an enzyme on the muscle called chineurinean amino transferase so this essentially reduces the amount of chineurinean available to then be transformed into other harmful metabolites such as chineolitic acid in the brain so chineolitic acid is a neurotoxin that plays a role in depression it plays a role in schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease and so this is just one other mechanism by which you know exercise also seems to improve mental health it's also you know another way that again exercise intensity is important here that is what is increasing that you know that enzyme that chineurinean amino transferase on the muscle cells to then transport chineurinean into the muscle so that is not converted into the chineolitic acid so I just another mechanism that I kind of wanted to point out because again intensity plays a role here with those amino transferase transporters soaking up more of that chineurinean I want to shift gears and talk about short bursts of high intensity interval training so this is sometimes called exercise snacks exercise snacks are short bursts of vigorous intensity exercise that are incorporated throughout the day and they can have numerous benefits on metabolism overall health these exercise snacks can be as simple as doing some vigorous jumping jacks or vigorous air squats or high knees or burpees and they can be done in just a few minutes there might be some distinct metabolic benefits to exercise snacks particularly when timed around meals so performing these you know short bursts of exercise before or so directly before or after a meal is particularly effective in controlling blood sugar levels you know this this sort of thing can lead to a rapid uptake of glucose into the muscles again having to do with increasing those gluten-free transporters it helps to lower blood glucose levels more efficiently then staying sedentary post meals so timing exercise snacks around meals um really can help the body handle sugar influx better and it helps you know utilize glucose more effectively and reduces the demands on the pancreas to produce insulin so it's um particularly beneficial for people with both type one and type two diabetes in addition to the direct metabolic benefits exercise snacks can also combat sedentary behavior so many individuals even those who engage in regular exercise still spend a significant portion of their day sitting at their desk working being sedentary centri behavior has been shown to be a modest independent risk factor for certain types of cancer um and it can also increase the risk of premature death even among physically active individuals so by incorporating exercise snacks individuals can kind of break up those prolonged periods sedentary behavior and potentially further you know reduce their cancer risk and just have a a variety of health benefits so exercise snacks also can enhance cognitive function it's directly increasing blood flow to the brain you know again that that can also just have an immediate mood enhancement which affects motivation there's not a lot of direct evidence on exercise snacks in the brain but again of course methodologies can differ anywhere between one minute to 10 minutes but there at least is one study showing that 10 minutes of an exercise snack does improve cognitive function so what could be a good protocol to implement let's say during your sedentary time would be perhaps you know setting a timer and every couple of hours you get up and you do a couple of minutes of you know high intensity interval training and a very similar now there's something called vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity villpa it's it's somewhat similar to exercise snacks but it takes advantage of everyday sort of situations to get your heart rate up high and to do some high intensity exercise so for example instead of you have to take the stairs everyday to work once that of walking after stairs you sprint you're getting your heart rate high so these types of villpa's have been measured in large numbers of people so there's a variety of publications and studies that have been done measuring you know people's their their their villpa's that they're doing and you know just three to four minutes a day of this vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity has been shown to be associated with a 25 to 30% reduction in overall mortality risk when that villpa durations increased to about nine minutes a day it's associated with a 50% reduction in cardiovascular rate related mortality and a 40% reduction in cancer related mortality and these benefits extend even to individuals who identify themselves as non-exercisers in other words these are people that are not necessarily doing leisure time activity they're not going to the gym and not going on runs but they're still engaging in these villpa's so so even those people are getting mortality reductions and you know cancer mortality cardiovascular mortality reductions with villpa's so I think that you know that's also an important benefit to keep in mind so I hope you guys enjoyed this episode a deep dive into the science of why vigorous exercise is important it's important for improving cardiovascular respiratory fitness particularly people that don't respond to more moderate intensity exercise it's important for metabolic adaptations it's very powerful at increasing glucose intake into muscles it's also a very potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis allowing for mitochondrial adaptations improving not only mitochondrial volume but also fat oxidation capacity as well it's increasing my topology the clearance of damage mitochondria from muscle tissue and it seems to have really unique benefits for the brain and a lot of this does come down to lactate production the metabolic stress that's induced from vigorous intensity exercise produces more lactate this lactate is getting into circulation going to other tissues including the brain and not only is this allowing the brain to use an energetically favorable energy source so neurons are using lactate as energy it's allowing the sparing of glucose to be used to make precursors for a very powerful antioxidant glutathione in the brain it's also acting as a signaling molecule in the brain increasing brain drive neurotrophic factor this is hugely important for you know not saving off neuro degenerate disease and just improving cognitive function it's increasing veg f at the blood brain barrier you know saving off the breakdown of the blood brain barrier lactates also increasing myocines in the muscle that have all sorts of benefits so I think I think we covered a lot about the importance of vigorous exercise and also these the vigorous exercise can be done in in short exercise snacks as well and I think this is a really great way for schools and workplaces to incorporate some sort of physical activity to break up the sedentary time when people are sitting in their cubicles at their computer or sitting at their desk for prolonged periods because just those periods of being sedentary in and of itself is a risk factor for early mortality so again exercise snacks are a type of vigorous exercise that can be incorporated into everyday life as well as the the villpeas these are things where you're you taking advantage of every day situations like like sprinting up the stairs rather than than walking up them as well so I hope you guys enjoy this podcast and I'll talk to you soon as a companion to today's episode I've created a free evidence-based blueprint that you can download in this guide which

And how is it going to benefit you? Is it going to improve your training volume? Is it going to make you stronger? All the above. I'm one of the big proponents of taking a lot more than probably what's recommended. But when it comes to set two, three and four, that's where creatine really comes to the rescue. And they measured it for 21 hours, a sleep deprivation, and it really improved memory cognition, and it increased brain creatine content. Today I'm joined by Dr. Darren Kando, who is a leading researcher in the creatine field and muscle aging. He's published over 140 papers on nutrition and exercise performance. How it affects muscle, muscle health, muscle aging. Darren, I'm super excited to have you here today to have this conversation with you to go deep into the science of creatine. Yeah, no, thanks for having me. I'm really excited as well, absolutely. I've read several of your studies. A huge fan, a lot of really important and interesting research to talk about. OK. Maybe we can start. I'm sure it's more, it's more popular. I mean, a lot of people think about creatine in its role in exercise performance. However, there's been a lot of emerging research in other areas. Maybe you could give people just a quick snapshot. Yeah, like it's really evolved over the last 40 years. It's gone from athletes getting bigger, stronger, faster. And now we're looking at potential benefits on bone health, brain health, cardiovascular health, even in children and during pregnancy. So it's evolved from just the young male athlete to pretty much anybody on the planet is now considering creatine, either in their diet or supplementation. So for the next few hours, super excited to talk about all aspects of creatine and the evidence-based research behind it. Well, let's talk about the resistance training and improving performance, muscle health. I mean, why are people, why is it so popular? Well, because it works from a muscle performance perspective. So really, it basically increases the ability to produce ATP or maintain a during an exercise session. So for example, when you're doing squat or leg press or even running, you're doing muscle contractions and phosphocreating, which is what we're going to be talking about today from creating supplementation. It really maintains ATP or a denysing die triphosphate. So if you have more ATP longer, you can exercise at a higher capacity, a higher intensity. And at the lays, the utilization of other energy systems that might be a bit slower. So anybody involved in high-expulse of anaerobic type of sports weight lifting, high-intestinal training, for example, probably would experience some benefits from creating supplementation. And how is it going to benefit you? Is it going to improve your training volume? Is it going to make you stronger? All the above. So it definitely seems to increase training volume. So that's either the load by the reps by the set or exercise capacity from a cardiovascular perspective. It definitely, if you were to choose one thing why creatine has been so effective, it's improving muscle strength. You could also encompass that with endurance and power. It also improves lean body mass. So here's a big discrepancy that a lot of viewers might not know. When we measure lean body mass in the labs, we're technically measuring blood, connective tissue, soft tissue. So we're not directly measuring muscle mass. We need to do a lot more research on that. But in general, about 50% of the value of lean body mass we consider muscle. So it has some small favorable effects. There's been some studies with QCT as well as ultrasound. But you can get an increase in lean body mass, regional muscle thickness, muscle performance. But probably the area that most people don't realize is the recovery aspects. It really seems to have some anti-cathabolic effects, potentially anti-inflammatory effects. And that's interesting because it's from the of rolic community. For the longest time, we never thought creatine was for endurance or aerobic type athletes. And the best lines of evidence from a recovery aspect come from long duration of rolic exercise, a marathon, ultra marathon, triathlon. It seems to reduce cytokines. So those are markers of inflammation. So there's a whole gamut of mechanisms. There's about 10 what we consider anabolic factors. And then there's probably just as many as an anti-cathabolic effects. So it has a plethora of benefits, which I'm sure we'll talk more about in detail today. So to go back, you just gave it total information dump, which is awesome. Let's go back first to the explosive power you were talking about. It seems to really help benefit in that explosive power. Like you're talking about doing a squat. Yes. Or I don't know, maybe the first few seconds have an interval, something where you're going, using all that power. Yeah. Is it is creating benefiting, is that how it's benefiting, increasing the training volume, or is there something else that's happening? Yeah, in two ways. So it really seems to maximize either the recruitment or the ability of type two muscle fibers. And when we talk about aging on forcing, those are the ones we're losing as we get older. But it really seems to work in the second, third, and fourth set. So for example, if you were to do four sets of leg press, comparable to C-bo, you may not notice any difference in the first set. Because we think we have enough ATP or false of creating stores in our muscle. But when it comes to set two, three and four, that's where creating really comes to the rescue. The individual or group can do more repetitions. And then over time, they can actually do a greater volume. We think with weeks of training, if you're doing more volume, you can actually get greater physiological adaptations. So when we look at all the meta analysis, when you compare creating and weight training to creating placebo and weight training, there is a greater increase in lean body mass muscle size, as well as muscle performance. So creating, there is something there from a mechanistic standpoint to allow that. And we think muscle fiber recruitment, primarily type two muscle fibers is one of the main reasons. Does it affect the recovery time in between sets? That's one question. It does. It really speeds it up. So on average, if you were to totally wipe out your normal creating stores, it takes about three to five minutes for your mitochondria to recover that. However, creating really, really speeds up that recovery, which is great for the average person. They don't have a lot of time to work out. They can't wait around for three to five minutes in between a really intense set. So it really speeds up the recovery, not only does it speed up the recovery after every set, but in between contractions as well. So over time, the individual could probably have a really intense, great workout in less time, total, and get actually more favorable effects. And I think what this is really important, we're talking about here. And we're talking about squads, that these explosive types of power types of training. And this is a really important field because you often hear about people talking about the loss of muscle masses. As we age, you talked about losing type two types of muscle fibers more readily than the type one. So these are the types of muscle fibers involved in that explosive type of power type exercise. And people don't think about how power decreases within age, how strength decreases with age, and how that affects our quality of life, how to affect our physical independence, our fall risks. And so I think just focusing on this type of training, the creatine is the icing on the cake. But just focusing on doing these types of multi-joint compound types of lips, which is something I would say year. A good year now, a solid year of doing CrossFit type of training where I'm doing strength training, I'm doing resistance training, strength training, and high-intensive training, that's including the types of stuff that I'm used to doing, biking and rowing, but also adding in doing some drops that's with front squats with the bottom bell, and things like that. It's super important. So this philosophy or power train or a variety training. First, we got to get people to move, and then allowing them to give some type of benefit to their training program. So creatine is probably the one that will be number one when people select it, even probably more than caffeine nowadays from an exercise training capacity. So it should be considered. It can have a lot of substantial beneficial effects. And as we get older, after about the fourth decade, unfortunately, we set to lose these type two muscle fibers, and so exercise has to be foundational. And if anything else can be beneficial, protein, creatine, I'm all for it, and I think most people hopefully will be as well, yeah. So the improvements in the muscle strength, presumably are coming because you're increasing your training volume, right, or is there a direct effect on strength? Yeah, there's actually a neural physiological recruitment. So now creatine has been touted as a new neural transmitter. So this is quite interesting. It actually seems to release a lot of things from a neural muscular perspective. But the biggest thing is the ability to recruit not only type one, but these type two muscle fibers as well. And then, of course, if we're having greater muscle or motor unit recruitment, we can potentially lift longer, heavier ends, and over time get, sort of, more an increase in strength. The other big thing from a cellular perspective is that creatine causes calcium to come back in a little vesicle in our muscles. If you take in high school biology or university, this will be your nightmare. But I remember everybody talking with a circle plasma reticulum. And it's an area that just releases calcium to allow our muscles to contract and creatine speeds up the uptake of calcium. So some of the evidence of a Europe has shown that it increases relaxation time or the ability of the proteins in your muscle, the grab hold of each other to contract. So there's a cellular aspect there explaining why we think we get an increase in muscle performance. I say strength, but endurance and power are all lumped in there as well. So endurance is the ability to perform repetitions to fatigue or power moving object as fast as you can. They're all vitally important. We think strength is overall from a global perspective. Number one, it's probably the main reason a lot of older adults are placing long-term care facilities if they have a reduction in strength, they can't live independently. So that's why, again, resistance training or weight-bearing exercise, as you mentioned, CrossFit, whichever it is, foundational. From Canada, so showing the driveway in a winter counts because anything that's low against you is really beneficial to the body. I think people underestimate the benefits of moving. And then if anything can be taken in this form, it'd be very, very beneficial. You mentioned some of the anti-inflammatory effects of creatine, particularly in the context of more endurance type of training. People that are perhaps running marathons are just clocking in a lot of hours of running or cycling per week. Right. Is that? So I think that goes into some respect in the recovery sort of been. And I'm wondering if that also plays a role on recovering from doing your resistance training, strength training, like on a recovery day. So I mean, do you think a plays a role just broadly in recovery? Yeah, it does. Now, this is interesting. And I probably would have been the most surprised when we wrote the paper on this that we don't think traditional weight training, where you're doing a set, your resting may be a minute to two. It seems like it's not catabolic or intense enough. Now, most people will say, shake their heads, hey, when I'm in the GMI, I'm really putting a lot of effort in. I think from a mechanistic standpoint, when you're doing running or long distance, continuous muscle contractions, it causes this large catabolic effect to the body. So that really heightens the inflammatory response. Weight training is acute. 10 seconds of work, three minutes of rest. 10 seconds of work, three minutes of rest, for whichever it is. And we just don't see creatine having a lot of superior effects from a resistance training recovery aspect. Probably because the rest intervals for the average person are there, but from a long distance event, you're running hours, you're swimming, whichever it is, the best lines of the fence come from triathlon and marathon running, where the increase in these markers, called cytokines, where elevated, the creatine sort of attenuated that rise, could allow the individual to recover and get back on the track, or whichever it is quicker. But I've talked to some good colleagues in Canada, and it just seems like weight training is too intermittent. Now, when you mention CrossFit, that's different. I'm thinking of the three sets of 10. You move from machine to machine, you rest, you have a CrossFit or something that's really continuous, would probably fall in line here of the necessity for creatine. So that would be a very good study. The look at the effects of creatine on the recovery aspects of something like high-intentionable training or CrossFit, for example, our military type of training, that's really endurance and resistance training. So you just gave me another idea to run with, but it's logical, the more intense, the more demanding, I think that's where creatine's anti-inflammatory properties would come into play. So when people here, Catabolic, or they'll think of muscle breakdown. And certainly there's a big component to circumpena inflammation in circumpena, which is a related muscle breakdown. Is there a role for creatine in preventing the breakdown of muscle? There is, it's very mix. So we don't have a lot of data. First off, creatine doesn't directly increase protein synthesis, which might be a surprise for a lot of reviewers. It sort of works in a magical other way, which we can talk about. But from a muscle breakdown perspective, it seems to reduce something called loose-seen oxidation, primarily in young males. And that's an indicator of whole body breakdown. We've also shown in our lab it reduces three methyl histonein, which is another indicator of whole body breakdown. But nothing is directly shown in the muscle itself. And for some reason females don't experience this, we've looked at it in young and older females. We don't see the same effect. The only logical explanation is it could have something to do with progesterone or estrogen. We just don't know that. And from an anti-cathabolic effect, decreasing some of these tissue repair mechanisms. There's not a lot of research out there. But unfortunately, we're not seeing any evidence that creatine increases protein synthesis. So unlike protein, which it does, creatine seems to help increase muscle size in other ways, satellite cells, growth factors, things like that. But it does decrease protein breakdown primarily though in males. And we still don't know exactly why, but we think estrogen or the other sex hormones might be involved. Does creatine have a general anti-inflammatory effect in both males and females? It does in young and older individuals, but here's an important distinction. The more stress the body is, it seems to come to the rescue more. So if you're a young individual, adequate sleep, proper nutrition, you're probably not going to notice any anti-inflammatory effects. It's when the body is under, times of extensive exercise or trauma, hypoxia. I'm sure we'll talk about the brain's sleep deprivation. So whenever the body is more stressed or under more attack, that's when creatine seems to come to the rescue. And getting circling back to people that are supplementing with creatine and improves their training volume and improves their strength, why do people have to supplement with creatine? Well, they don't actually, so a little bit of clarity. So we naturally are producing creatine in two main areas in the liver and in the brain and on average, we're producing about one to two grams. Then we're also consuming in the diet anywhere between one to three grams or non-sovigens, not getting any dietary creatine. Those that are on a carnivore diet might be all the way up to about three grams. And we excrete through the urine, a protocol creatine in about two. So when you do the math, we're in a net surplus anywhere between one to two grams a day. And we know it's not essential because vegans can live a long, healthy, successful life. But we consider it conditionally essential because when we see all the evidence, I think there's over a thousand peer review papers. When we take in a little bit more, there is some substantial beneficial effects across the whole board, not just muscle, we're now looking at bone brain and the immune system. So from a perspective of vegan, who is not getting any almost amount of dietary creatine they're relying on their liver to make it. What's going on in the brain? You mentioned the brain makes creatine. Yeah, it's very interesting. So on average, vegans have substantially less muscle creatine compared to an omnivore carnivore diet. But an elegant study at a Brazil level four years ago, they use sort of an MRI for the brain. And they showed that vegans and omnivores had the same amount of brain creatine store. So that's really substantiating that the brain makes its own creatine. It probably makes enough for the non-stressed individual. But during times and metabolic stress, the question is, will vegans or omnivores need more? And it's likely that that's true. During development is the developing brain making its own creatine like... It is, yeah. It's like our liver is making its own creatine. It's usually an echcelerate rate for brain development, cognitive development. Again, our brain is small, but it uses 20% of our daily energy and of course, during development. That's when it's very, very precious as well, young. So creatine is mostly found in animal foods. Right, poultry fish. Yes. Non-inplants at all. Trace amounts. You'd have the entire orchard of whatever plant you're thinking. And same with Tham milk, you'd have to drink all the milk from a Jersey cow to get any significant amounts. So that's why it's unrealistic. So if we're having, if we're producing between, you know, one to two grams... That's bad. That's just in our liver. Correct. And that presumably, then, is being transported to muscle. That's the whole 95%. We can't forget about the bone and brain or the main areas, yeah. OK. Then, let's say, let's say you're getting, I think I was reading some enhanced, where on average people get younger adults, not older adults, get anywhere between one to two grams a day from their diet. Right. But older adults are getting on that lower and even not even necessarily at even at one gram. So older adults are getting even less. Yes. But then, you know, is there more to be consumed by the muscle or does it get spread around? Yeah, that's an excellent question. So the thought is as we get older, we have reduced fossil-creating stores in our body. So they might need more. And the hope is about 95% is housed in our, our skeletal muscle. But now with the emergence of the research, the rest is in bone and brain specifically. So the hope is if we take in more, our muscles will be full, which is great. But now, hopefully, we're going to have some trickling into our bone, which is even just as important. And I think most people would argue from the neck out. That's really important from a global perspective with all the neurological diseases, depression, anxiety. So I'm one of the big proponents of taking a lot more than probably what's recommended based on the evidence-based research to sort of disperse through the whole body, not just skeletal muscle. Well, let's talk a little bit about that. So in some of these, you know, the strength training resistance training studies, what's the common dose that's taken? And maybe we can talk a little bit about, I mean, there's the loading phase I've never done. So I actually take five grams a day. And although I might start taking more after this podcast. So I'd love to know what is the average dose that's taken to improve your strength training, your resistance training, your training volume. And then we can go from there. Yeah. So I mean, in 1992, Roger Harris came up with a seminal protocol where, as you just mentioned, this loading phase, it's the most viable, rapid way to really saturate your skeletal muscle. This has nothing to do with the bone or the brain. And so that's 20 grams a day for about seven days is usually what's recommended. A bit of new information, you only need to do that for two days and then your muscles are saturated. So the loading phase was designed for athletes to really rapidly sort of fill up the room, if you will, from a skeletal muscle perspective. After that, you can reduce it as little as two grams a day. So again, that's half a salmon steak. That would be half a chicken breast or whichever. So it's very viable. They call that the maintenance phase. The only problem with the loading phase is it's so rapid, it does cause water to enter a lot of ourselves and a lot of individuals do not like this potential net water retention or GI tract irritation. We don't usually use that in our labs for that reason, but for the athletes, the world championship coming up, the loading phase, followed by maintenance phase is a very viable, rapid way. A young female's hated because of that water retention and weight gain. The good news is you can take as little as two to three grams a day no loading phase and take that on a daily basis, probably for the rest of your life and that will definitely accumulate and fill up your muscles in about 30 days. We don't know if that low dose will get into the bone or brain on a long period of time. What we've done is look at a relative dose. So that means everybody has a certain weight. We put them on scale and we use 0.1 gram all the way up to 0.14 grams per kilogram. So for example, if you're 70 kilograms, you're taking seven grams a day all the way up to about nine grams a day. You can take that in one bowl of stoles or split it up into smaller doses just through it today. I wouldn't go any less than one gram. One gram doesn't seem to get in the blood is rapidly as we need. So that's something for your viewers if they're micro dosing, no less than one gram. But you can split it up two and a half grams, five grams, whichever you want. I take a lot more than that. Based on our new clinical data on 48 years of age, I know the effects of aging and from a bone and brain perspective. But really all this dosing came from muscle. And we have all these new areas. That's why I think the emergence of new dosing strategies is really come to light. I definitely want to get into some of these, potentially negative effects of the high high dose. But let's talk a little bit about your new emerging data on bone health, so you're talking about. So I mentioned five grams a day. And let me be before we get to that. How long is if I'm taking someone's taking five grams a day? And how long does it take to get your muscle stores saturated? And then let's say your resistance training. So you're working, let's say your resistance training and endurance training. I mean, you're working out five to six hours a week. I'm just talking about my schedule here. And then, and I'm doing five grams a day. And I'm just constantly saturating my stores, even though I'm pulling down from them as I'm working out, or how does that work? Because five is the average global recommendation. And that's a fantastic dose overall. We think to start, and especially from a muscle perspective. So it'll take you 21 days to fully saturate your skeletal muscles. So after that, you're going to have some being excrediting an neuron. Or let's pray here. Hopefully some is now being uptaken into your bone, because the muscles pulling on bone, your bone is a very metabolically active tissue, which no one actually sees in the mirror. And then hopefully some is trickling more into your brain. So the thought is, okay, five grams is very viable. Easily 21 days, your muscles will be full, taking five grams a day thereafter. Some would probably go in the form of creatinine, but hopefully, and we don't know this, maybe some is going into your bone, being used by your immune system, your GI track, your gut health, and your brain. So five is a great dose. I'd like it to be higher, just because of some of the new data to suggest every day we get out of bed, where they older, there's some good evidence to suggest bone needs a bit more. And of course the brain, we still don't know, but I have some lines of thinking about when we're really metabolically stressed. How much to take, but if you're taking five, rest assured, you're doing exceptionally well, yeah. Well, let's talk about bone. So one of the best things you can do for bone health is weight bearing exercise. These compound lifts, the things that we were talking about with improving your explosive power and your strength, right? Right. How is creatine adding to that? By two ways, a direct and indirect. So let's go with the boring direct. It sort of increases osteoblast cells. Either these are cells that sort of create or the formation of bone cells. So in rodents, osteoblast cells have been energized in the presence of creatine. So it was logical to think in humans, maybe our osteoblast cells, the cells that are responsible for increasing bone size and strength, might have more fuel, and these cells do use creatine just like our muscles do for fuel. And potentially increase bone density. And if that's true, we've just cured osteoporosis, basically. The other line of thinking, which is surprising, going back to this anti-cathabolic phenomenon, is the best lines of evidence with bone are from an anti-cathabolic perspective. It seems to resemble a bisphosphonate. So a lot of viewers are maybe taking a bisphosphonate to sort of preserves your skeleton. I know my mom is taking that as well. So creatine reduces something called the osteoclast activity or bone resorption. So for some reason, it really inhibits these osteoclasts from sort of chopping down our bone and increasing blood calcium levels when not needed. And then, of course, if it sort of increases osteoblasts potential, maybe the recycling of bone gets stronger. It's kind of like laying a foundation of a hose. The bricks are stronger. You're sort of putting the bricks together a little bit faster. And then, inclement weather is not chopping away the bricks or the cement. So that's how we theorize it was working. And there's been about 15 studies now showing that it has a lot of anti-resorpt of effects. So think of anti-cathabolic to the bone. We have not shown in a single study in an increased bone mineral density. So this is really crucial. We are not saying that creatine and weight training increases bone mineral density, but it's certainly decreases bone mineral density loss and really specifically around the hip region, which is crucially important for a lot of older adults when they fall if they land on their hip, they could be more susceptible to fracture. So there's a lot of anti-cathabolic effects. And we've just shown in a long-term clinical trial and improved bone strength. So picture a pen or pencil. You can't crack it as much there. I think weight training is the main driver when it comes to bone. The more muscle you have from an indirect perspective, there's more muscle pulling on bone. So that's very beneficial. Look at gymnasts. They have phenomenal bone mineral density and muscle mass there. There's a lot of potential there. It's not overwhelmingly convincing. I think his bone takes a long time to turn over, but this is interesting. The lowest dose ever been shown to be effective is eight grams of monohydrate a day. Now as we just talked about three to five grams it's great for muscle, but now you're getting into bone. What needs to happen is a dosing study could five grams over maybe two years be equivalent to eight grams over two years or even higher. And that is very expensive to do. But it's been in the back of my mind. I would just speculate that five grams over time will still benefit your skeleton, but you need such a large sample size to get these small effects rather from a dexer CT scan. And that's probably why we haven't seen it yet. But in all our clinical trials, eight grams, but the Brazilian group have looked at one to three grams for two straight years and not a single improvement. So weight training is there. And I think that's the big driver for many of the muscle bone perspectives. So you think just supplementing with creatine by itself, even if you're doing eight grams, isn't really going to necessarily affect your bone health if you're not doing any weight-bearing exercise. Even considering the preventing the breakdown, I mean, preventing the activation of these osteoclasts that are breaking down the bone. I would be very surprised. I think you need that mechanical loading from weight training or weight-bearing exercise and apply a metrics that cause the bone to turn over and then maybe creating doesn't increase the resort or it increases osteoblast a little bit more. The cool thing when osteoblasts it releases the cytokine called osteoporodegere, which acts as a decoy. And that's been shown in vitro studies there. So there is some cellular data, which is a bit surprising when it comes to the skeleton, not just imaging, but if I was to take eight grams, would I tell my parents to take eight grams and not work out if I did. I don't think they'd expect anything on the bone. The bone is really stubborn. It's just like our brain and creatine. It's rarely, really stubborn. I think the main force is the driver of weight training. What about someone who is, let's say, a post-menopausal woman who is experiencing some perhaps osteopinia? Yes. Do you think before trying some of these other standard of care treatments, like the bisphosphates, for example, you mentioned, doing the weight-bearing training and the creatine, perhaps eight grams or 10 grams, a day would be a good first line of defense to try before trying some of these other drugs that do have negative side effects? So if you're in line for a bisphosphate, there's no way that creatine or weight training will come close. So a drug effect will always be superior. The effects we're seeing even from a significant perspective with creatine are so small. We don't even get to a clinical perspective, but let's talk about weight training. I 100% agree. If I had to choose one for bone, it's weight training or plyometrics or anything that you feel to the body and then consider creatine in your treatment program. Creatine would never replace a pharmaceutical intervention from a bone perspective. And the effects were seen are so small, even over two years, at best it's preserving. Now, this begs the question, maybe the adults we chose were too healthy. None had diagnosed osteoporosis or osteopeenate or frailty. What if we took a population with severe osteoporosis? Maybe creatine could come to the rescue there. That's another thing. We're starting to hopefully get governmental funding for down the road, but a lot of young females, a lot of young males and of course older females, even postmenopausal. Their skeleton is still very beneficial and strong. They may not have incidents as osteopeenia or fracture risk. But until we do a study in diagnosed osteoporotic males and females, we just don't know if it's the disease or maybe they were just healthy enough. Well, prevention is obviously, I think, the key. If we can encourage people before they're experiencing massive breakdown of their bone or osteoporosis as osteopeenia to engage in resistance training and not the single joint exercise where you're making advice of bigger. I mean, you need to be doing these multi joint compound lifts, rows, you know, presses, anything that's multi joint. And then perhaps in combination with creatine if it's preserving bone, that does really suggest a preventative role. And that's 100% correct. Like the movement is gotta be there. And I think most people are aware or the benefits of exercise. And then if creatine or protein or whatever it is, your eating can give you a small beneficial effect. I'm all for it. And I think a lot of people would be there as well. So creatine definitely has the potential. It's gone as a lot of potential for a lot of things. But without protein, you know, those two need to be there. We don't think creatine can rescue a hypocloric diet, especially low and protein. But we just don't know. I argue that creatine falls in line with protein with his aging antibiotic resistance. As we get older, my guess is where we have lower creatine and some of our muscles as we get older, we need more. So now there's a young versus older stereotype, just like protein. Younger individuals may respond from 20 to 25 grams all the way up to older adults. So I think creatine is definitely a part of my day. And I try to promote the evidence-based research, especially from an older adult population. If anything, we can do the off-sacronic disease or getting chronic disease, that's beneficial. And we're starting really focusing young females, exercise is so important, adequate protein and then creatine is not just for males. We're seeing a plethora of benefits for young biological females, which is really important. It is. When you hear the word creatine, you think about the Jim Brow. I mean, it's like you take in the creatine and try to get their muscles bigger. And the reality is that women are also very sensitive. I mean, they're susceptible to losing muscle mass and strength, but bone is a big one. It is. And when we look at all the data, females get an improvement in muscle performance primarily strength. That's the population we've seen the best bone benefits. Now they were post-metapals, but reduction in bone mineral density, bone strength. And then we're seeing from a sports perspective, agility balance. So for the females watching, don't shy away from creatine is extremely potentially beneficial in combination with exercise. And if you're worried about weight gain or whichever do not do the loading phase, it's not needed. You can start as little as two to three grams a day. The vibe at up even. So I'll tell a lot of our clients or participants. You can take one and a half grams in the morning, wait till the evening to take one and a half grams. That really decreases the chance of water retention. But if you're eating, red meat or seafood, you're getting a little bit of amount. For the vegans watching, keep in mind you're not getting any. And that's why supplementation, third party tested they are vegan based, could be considered. I mean, it seems like it'd be very important for that population of people in particular. Yeah, we've done some really fascinating studies with vegans and vegetarians, and they respond exceptionally well, because we're doubling the amount of creatine, which is the high energy compound in our muscle. So those individuals can do more repetitions, higher volume, quicker recovery. So it really has favorable effects for male and female vegans and vegetarians. And again, those emphasizing a plant-based diet with everything going on in the world nowadays, a lot of people are looking to more plant-based diets for health reasons or whichever, and then they might need to consider a supplement. So usually we're not in the market of talking with supplements, but this one is the one that seems to come to mind where it might be difficult to get the amount needed in your diet from financial cost, after treatment animals, whatever your own habitual preference is. And if they're through party tested, it's the safest, most effective, organic aid out there right now. The safety profiles exceptional, especially at the dose, which is what we're talking about. When we talk about protein, we're talking hundreds of grams. At most, we're talking maybe 10, 20 grams for the athletes, which is basically two teaspoons in the run of a day. So it's not a lot, but there is a lot of evidence-based research behind it. Yeah, and let's definitely dive a little more into this supplementation, but I'm interested in the brain, and we've gone from the role of creatine. It seems to have multiple roles, anti-inflammatory, anti-cada ballac. Right. It's obviously important for producing ATP, regenerating the ATP. What about the brain? What's super exciting? Like this is such an emerging area. So from the neck up, I think the next 20 to 30 years will be focused almost entirely on this. So our liver produces creatine, and our brain actually, as unique, it also produces creatine. But the brain is very resistant. We have the blood-brain barrier for a really important reason. And the brain says, you know what? Circulation, we don't need creatine in the blood. We're making our own. So an individual getting adequately, no chronic disease, no metabolic disease, no neurodegenerative diseases, is producing adequate amounts of brain creatine. It could be as little as 1 to 3 grams. Now our brain is small from stature, but it uses 20% of our daily energy. And of course, as we all know, when you're really tired, sleep deprivation, running around chasing your children, most people that I know are really metabolically stressed, primarily from a cognition perspective. And that's where creatine seems to have the best lines of evidence. Sleep deprivation, highpoxia, eye jet lag. I was up at three o'clock this morning of flu down. So I'll be taking a really high dose today to hopefully offset the chance of inflammation or cognitive decline. So when we look at the totality of emerging evidence, it's split. Some studies don't see any effect. But the ones that do is in a population where they're either mentally fatigue, sleep deprivation, or during times of aging, and that's where memory comes into play. And the common denominator seems to be the more, that the brain is stressed, more creatine seems to come to the rescue. Same analogy from a muscle and bone perspective. So we can talk for hours just on the brain, and it's a very exciting area for sure. So the brain is stressed, so brain aging. Brain aging. Yeah, that's aging is a stress on the brain. It is. So supplementing with how much creatine can improve cognition in, let's say, older adults. Yeah, it's little is about five grams has been shown to have some potential, but this is interesting. I just, 20 minutes ago said that the loading phase wasn't needed for muscle. The best studies for the brain look at 20 grams a day for at least a week. So now you're in a conundrum. I'm looking at muscle bone and brain. And the theory here is that since the blood brain barrier is very resistant to creatine, and unfortunately, we have this really important glial cell called astrocytes, which are the biggest in our central nervous system. It's sort of acts as a filter from our blood into ourselves, and it really determine what gets in. It says, hey, foreign pathogens, no, you're not getting into the neuron or the cell. So unfortunately, they don't have the creatine transport or doorway. So that's why uptake into the brain is very blunted. So the thought is to get an improvement in brain creatine stores, you need longer duration of supplementation or higher dose issues. So the best lines of evidence using MRS have shown that higher 20 grams a day seem to be the most viable. There's been a single study looking at about four grams a day, but it took three months to accumulate in the brain. Unlike our muscle witch acts as like a vacuum, it sucks in all the creatine from our blood. Our brain says, no, no, no, I'm only going to take what's in our blood. I use supplementation when need be. So that's why sleep deprivation seems to have the best lines of evidence or mental fatiguing challenges. OK, so let's, if you're someone like myself who's been supplementing with five grams a day for a year. That's enough time for it to eventually accumulate into the brain. Presumably. Yeah, like that low dose remember, you need about two to three grams now. I'm not sure about your diet, but you're going to need that just to maintain your muscle. And then comes down to your genetics. What's more in jeopardy is that your bones or brain? So again, the 5% that's remaining to what the body's in your testies hurt a bone and brain. So for me, as a biological male, it's going to different areas compared to you as a biological female. But my hope is wait a minute. Let's go a bit higher. So we're sort of checking off all the boxes. My guess is five grams. You'd have a small increase in brain creatine content. But if you have a really non-stressful life, the brain says, no, go to the bone or we'll excrete it down the toilet. But if you're metabolically stressed, it's begging for more. I'd like you to be probably higher than five. But I think it'd be interesting to look at some pre-post MRS scans. And it's viable. It could be there. The study that did four grams was in long COVID. These individuals brain fog the T-cetics, things like that so the brain was really baiting for recovery. OK. So you just mentioned the best studies showing any improvement in. And when we're talking about improvement, we're talking about cognition. We're talking about memory memory. OK. You said 20 grams, right? Which definitely what I don't want the swelling part of that, which happens around 20 grams. So have their Ben studies looking at 10 grams. Is that like a sweet spot? The seminal study was out of Germany, and they did four or two versus four versus 10. And this is where I personally take at least 10. And they use MRS studies. And they only showed that at a time, double the percent increase in brain creatine content. But they also measured it in the gray matter, the white matter, and I believe the thalamus, and it all improved by about 10%. Now, it was a small sample size because they're running MRS's super expensive. Stultististically, it wasn't there. But the percent improvements were a lot higher. And when you look at all the other data, 10 grams seems to be a very viable dose. The not only check off the box, definitely for muscle. We're now checking off the box for brain. And now we're a sorry bone. And then we're also checking off the box for brain as well. So I personally take about 10 grams a day on average, but during times a metabolic stress, sleep deprivation or jet lag all increased at the 20. So today I will take 20 grams, because I flew down from Canada. I'll take 20 grams again tomorrow. But when I get back home, I'll decrease it back down to 10. If any has been an extra hit down the toilet, I'm totally fine with that. Creatine is very cost effective. But I want to make sure I'm maximizing all my abilities. And the immune system, especially in Canadian winters, is really heightened and activated. And I really have found in the last few years, I'm not getting food like symptoms. Hopefully that's from exercise or die, but who knows, maybe creatine is helping, because there is some anti-inflammatory effect. You went to another area that I definitely want to talk about. But before that, so 20 grams, then you're saying, acutely, when you're in this sleep deprived state, jet lag, let's say fill in the blank type of extreme stress. Is that immediate? So let's say you're like, you miss, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're up late. You're up late one night. You have something to do the next morning or the next day. You have to be on your game. If you take that 20 grams either at night, would you take it at night, before you go to sleep? Or in the morning, or does it matter? And will it have an effect immediately? Yeah, and I love learning. And this is just so 20 grams, let me be too low. It's surprisingly your viewers. So another study came out of Germany. They did a very elegant design with a crossover. And they gave 0.35 grams per kilogram. So even if you're only 70 kilograms, that's 25 grams in a bowl of stoves. And they measured it for 21 hours, a sleep deprivation. And it really improved memory cognition. And it increased brain creatin content. So that high adults, not only does it get into your plasma, or blood really quickly, probably in about three hours is peaking. When your brain is stressed, it's being taken in quite readily. So during times of metabolic stress, it seems to work. Now, the argument is, how do I know I'm going to be stressed tomorrow? How do I know I'm going to have a bad night sleep? You don't. So that's why I think taking a higher daily dose might be a safety. But the days are like, oh, I didn't sleep at all. And I have a big presentation later. Or it means a professor teaching four classes a term. I've really increased the amount. I would say I might be the most saturated person on the planet, because I've been taking creatin for decades. There's no reason to stop. We can talk about cycling or continuous. But I'm even taking more and hope that it's getting into my brain. Again, 20 years ago, it was just muscle. Then we've evolved into the bone and now we're getting into the brain. And I think a university students midterm week. It finally exames staying up all night, cramming. Maybe creating could really improve the ability to score better on tests. And when you look at the mental of fatiguing studies, that's when creatin seems to work. After you've done a whole bunch of fatiguing exercises, or taking creatin before, it really speeds up your ability to maintain memory and cognition. And we can talk about neural filament, things in the brain, or beating an affin. And that's some of the mechanisms primarily in rodent. So there is some mechanisms showing that creatin is decreasing oxidative stress, or really having some potential for neuronal health, which now you think of Alzheimer's dementia, neurogenophilesies. So super excited to see where this is going for the next 20 or 30 years, yeah. I wonder if there's any effect just because it's sort of a triaging of it's helping with the energy. And so it's like freeing up other energy, and if they're like other taking care of all of that, it's an oxidation. And that's like that. So the best overall segue. So it increases brain bio energetics. And one of the common numbers with depression or concussion is that they have reduced brain creatin stores and bio energetics compared to a healthy control on average. And so maybe creatin is bringing those values up, or even slightly more. And now the brain has more energy capacity to do and deal with all the daily stressors of society, yeah, absolutely. So TBI, I mean traumatic brain injury. The way I think of it is like real time brain aging. Yes. It's just it's like all of a sudden you just get a knocked your head and it's like accelerated aging. So what would be a protocol for someone that let's say they take a blow to the head, or they get hit with a ball, a soccer ball, or whatever the football, whatever sport that they're doing, would it be like they should be taking high dose immediately? Yeah. So I think now in the camp, and I think a lot of other researchers, and a lot of worse coming from here in the United States, but if you're in contact sports, creatin should be taken on a daily basis because unfortunately if you do get hit in the rodent model when, because you can't do this in humans, but when they've actually forced concussion in rodents taking creatin before and the recovery symptoms are really accelerated. And in the only single human study was in children, as soon as these people in Scotland got head trauma, they put them on 0.4 grams of creatin per kilogram. So about 20 grams of these just children, immediately, and over six months, these children that were taken creatin, had its substantial improvements in self care, and efficacy, no bloodbile markers were taken, but at least it showed the improvement in recovery. So instead of waiting till you get hit, why not take the preventative role? And that's why again, I think for me, and again, it's opinion, but we've seen some data to suggest that 10 grams might be a good viable dose, more or even a little bit less depending on why you're taking it. But I personally take it from a whole body perspective. I don't play any contact sports. Now, but who knows, I could go and skate, and fall and hit my head or skiing, or whichever, and maybe that would help accelerate recovery. I'm taking it, just for any chance to have some potential brain benefits, but the big areas it does increase the recovery aspects of concussion. So NFL NCAA, especially down here in United States, trillion dollar industry, I gotta believe these players are taking creatin in anticipation. I know the quarterback for the dolphins. I think he's had three concussions this year. So his brain is so compromised right now. Massive inflammation, hopefully his medical team is at least considering high dose with his other treatment program to get there, so yeah. And then should be taking it for the benefits on muscle, you know, in the middle of the, plus the power that those high intensity moments, you mentioned earlier about 0.1 grams per kilogram body weight. So how would you adjust, let's say, you know, you're taking 10 grams of creatine per day, and you're wanting the effects of the benefits of muscle, bone, brain as you are. However, I do not weigh as much as you do. So would you, is there a scalable amount per kilogram body weight? You think would be something that, or is it hard? That's an excellent question. And the answer would probably be no, because when we go on the scale, we don't consider the head, even when we do dexoscans as headless. So, you know, if I'm 80 kilograms, I'm taking about there's the sweet spot about, you know, nine to 10 grams a day, taking it from a weight perspective to the, correlate to the brain. It is almost impossible, because we need to measure the weight. And where it's a hard tissue, there's a little bit of soft, but it's usually hard tissue, I think overall body weight, very similar how people do protein, based on lean mass or a total body structure. So you can take creatine based on lean body mass, but it's very difficult. You would have to have some type of imaging apparatus, so we just usually recommend it on body mass, they hit all the aspect. That makes sense. And it really does seem like there's this sort of triaging where it's like, okay, the muscles consuming it. It's like the greedy one. And then whatever's left over, maybe the bone, but if the brain stress, it's funny how the body can figure that out, like the brain needs it. So, you know, there was another, there's some interesting research that you also publish kind of in the brain area is sleep, right? And I'd love for you to talk about that study. I thought it was so interesting. These resistance training females and you gave them creatine and it really seemed to help improve their sleep on training day. Yeah, it was colleagues at our University AutoHow and Brown and CJ Prush. And they looked at young, healthy individuals, biological females. And we gave a pretty high dose here, five grams plus we add a five grams of placebo, so 10 grams a day versus a 10 gram of placebo. And this was done for six weeks and they resistance trained with a total home gym for two days a week. And the interesting thing is total sleep duration on the days they trained was substantially higher. I think it was about almost an hour compared to placebo. And again, these are young University age students that were taking creatine about five grams a day. The nice thing is it also improved strength. There was no big fluctuations in weight gain which was very, very interesting. No adverse effects. Now, there was no mechanisms assessed but the logic was that on the days these individuals are training, maybe they put in more effort. So creating help recover the body a little bit more, allow that body to be in repair mechanism a little bit more and they slept more for about an hour on average more. We still don't know the exact reason but it is interesting that an improved sleep duration. And it's almost kind of the opposite of what we were just talking about. We were talking about if you're in this context where your jet lag just sleep deprived and you take the creatine and it kind of helps you get over that brain fog that like, you know, you're just not quite, you know, on your game. Yeah, it goes against most of the comments I get where when people take high dose creatine, some people say they feel like insomnia or intermittent sleep. And the theory there from a road model at a bell gym is that maybe the brain is recovering quicker that it doesn't need to sleep as long. So we still need a lot of work to do. We need to look at different stages of sleep. We'd really like to look at some blood biomarkers, indication of what's happening from an inflammation perspective. So there's a lot of work in that area to go, yeah. You know, the thing I was thinking about Darren was, I mean, when, so a denocene. Yes. Is there a role because I mean, it's downstream of ATP, right? So I'm wondering if there's any role, because a denocene is something that does make you sleepy. Yeah, yeah. I always think of caffeine, the adenosine, right, right. Yeah, no, it's possibly there. There's been a lot of speculation. They thought also glycine is implicated and we're glycine is involved in the, and they sent this as a creatine. So there's a lot there. I think we'll talk maybe about homocystine a little bit later in the method. So God, there's a lot of areas to look at. And I think we thought we knew everything about creatine and now it's taken on a new life that's own. And again, I'll have a job for maybe 20 or 30 more years looking at this. Oh, yeah. Before we continue, I just want to mention something important. If you're finding these episodes valuable, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the notification bell. It's the only way to ensure you'll be notified when a new episode goes live. Many people assume they'll be alerted automatically, but unless the bell is clicked, they won't be. We cover a lot of detailed evidence-based content here and I want to make sure that you don't miss any of it. Now, back to the episode. Well, let's go back to the brain and talk about another, so we talked about brain aging, traumatic brain injury, which is stress. We talked about lack of sleep. And things that's stressing the brain, like yes, neurodegenerative disease is a stressful thing on the brain as well. It would be interesting to see if creatine can help in that regard. Although, again, prevention is always better, right? If you can tell. We've looked at the totality of limited evidence and we're not seeing a lot of effects yet. There's benefits on young boys with muscular dystrophy, but that's a little bit different. But when we look at ALS, Parkinson's, Hunting's, multiple sclerosis, all those dimension Alzheimer's. We're not seeing a lot of problems. There's been a few small scale studies that show benefits. But when you look at a properly sample size, that study was a big one, five years in Germany. Didn't see any greater effects. So again, maybe the dose was too soon. When I look at the dose, they use a very small compared to now or a body of evidence suggesting higher dose, big sample size. And then, of course, what about the effects of the disease? Can creating really rescue the effects to give a significant effect? We don't know preventing would be the number one thing. But we're starting to do a study in Northern Iowa that look at the effects of creating now in individuals with cognitive decline. And I believe there's a study out of cans, that actually looking at people with diagnosed Alzheimer's. So super excited to see these results. If it can have any effect, even help one person, even regardless of a statistical effect, if it can have individual results, I think it's something we need to consider, yeah. OK, well, what I was going to get to was the other part of brain disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders. You have depression, anxiety. Those are also unfortunately very common nowadays, even in younger adults and adolescents. So there's been some interesting research with creating and depression. Yes, there has. It's an emerging area. Primarily, Utah is a great psychiatrist group there. And as a caveat, no studies ever look at the creatine without any depressive medications. So they're always as adjunct. So we're not saying creatine could ever replace anxiety or antidepressive medications. But in these populations, primarily females with clinical depression, it's really starting to have some speed up recovery and decrease some of the symptoms. The mechanisms are starting to emerge. It's starting to have a role primarily from rodents, and this is implicated in depression where they have reduced brain creatine stores. So maybe creatine supplementation can bring those levels up. There's potential to increase beating F. So that has been implicated there as well. And there's another thing called neurofilament, our light chain. It's an indication of neuronal damage. And one gram of creatine in your diet has been shown to reduce that. So there's potential there. But the overarching thing with antidepression is it increases brain bio energetics, as you mentioned. And decreases again. Here we go. Mudacontrial, health, decreases, reactivoxidative species. All these are implicated in all the brain and cognitive decline and primarily depression. So I'm really excited in that area. A big RCT needs to be done though, because it's always been added to either cognitive behavior therapy or SSRI for sure. And there's also a big inflammatory component and depression. There's the inflammation. In fact, there have been studies just in healthy, young individuals where they induce inflammation. So like LPS, it can cause depressive symptoms. Yeah, yeah. And 100%. So the anti-inflammatory role comes back there as well. So you'll start to hear these two words. Anti-cathabolic and anti-inflammatory, people think of Advill or Taule and all from an anti-inflammatory, but creating seems to work very similar in the cocks inhibitors as well. And but it seems to decrease cytokines. So it could be something there to consider you. Well, what's interesting is, you know, activated lymphocytes, T cells. Consume just enormous amounts of energy, and to basically become active and fight off pathogens. And so I'm wondering if creatine is taken up by, you know, these immune cells, and it may be helps in some way. I mean, you're saying it reduces cytokines. I mean, a lot of these T cells are, you know, producing cytokines to fight off things. But who knows if they have that energetic boost? Yes. How that could affect, you know, just, I would say like the broader, like not having this huge kind of war going on, right? Yeah, there's been some cellular data around the immune system cells around creatine, specifically around T cells, or macrophages. That's where the anti-cancer idea came in from creatine, specifically like I've regarding lymphoma, leukemia. So that's more in vitro. There's a lot of work needs to be done. But there's a lot of studies now looking at the anti-cancer potential of creatine, primarily from the anti, or the in heightened immune system response. I wonder if there's any, has anyone ever looked at, you know, creatine's role in helping prevent infectious, you know, disease or respiratory illness, fighting off pathogens, like just anecdotally, I supplement with glutamine, and create my five grams of, it's about 5.6 grams of glutamine I take a day with creatine, five grams of creatine. And it is made a insanely big difference in my susceptibility to respiratory illness, which I have a little seven year old who bring some, everything. Yeah, it's like a vector. And it's made a really big difference. And glutamine also is just, it's consumed by activated T cells, right, a lot of work on the use for cancer, yeah, and treatment, some of the symptoms, things like that. So it would be interesting to see if there's any effect of both of those, but even just looking at creatine as well. I know glutamine's been shown in endurance athletes, like we're very prone to respiratory illness, like these marathon runners, really like, they're really just getting to that catabolic state, right? Yeah, it's interesting because I was the first to do glutamine for your high dose in weight training, based on the premise that, you know, if I did have any kind of ballac effects or cancer, long duration, and that was my master's thesis, and we didn't see any effect. Probably going back to our initial start, where resources might not be stressful or catabolic, and in continuous duration compared to long duration, um, events, so that's very interesting. Are you familiar with any of that work up with all of the long distance runners in glutamine? There's like a few studies showing that these marathon and things stuff, they don't get as much as many respiratory illnesses if they're taking glutamine. Yeah, no, I'm very familiar. I had to do the whole literature search, and it was a higher dose, and they also looked at it for sepsis, but the immune system response T4 and T8, I don't think we're nearly as high, and that was from long duration, and a young healthy individual, they probably might not know to any effect, but again, that was the idea of the premise behind it, it was more of an anti-cathabolic, and why it didn't work for me, it was a non-essential amino acid, and of course, approaching synthesis, you need all the essential soul. It was a trimoman when none was doing my masters, but it worked in understanding it. Well, there's certainly doesn't seem to be any shortage of interesting things to study with creatine. It's like, you know, the field is exploding, so maybe someone out there will be looking at that at some point. Another really interesting area is the vascular health. And I mean, there's just like a, we were just chatting about a recent study coming out, indithelial cells, how transporters for creatine. They do right next to the astrocytes, which don't. So the endocidal cells at the blood-brain barrier, especially, but around all the smooth muscle, they do have the transporter. So that was one of the theories, my cornsby just put out a study in Eric Ross and just recently, in older adults, and that makes sense because you look in a population, that might get some benefits, and they show some very small favorable effects from creatine supplementation, either a week long or for up to four weeks, I believe. It was a loading phase, and then down to about five grams a day. So it has some favorable effects for endothel, I think was macro and micro-vascular function. So that might have potential down the row for cardiac rehab or individual with cardiovascular disease, or even subsets of that type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. So that's an area, the stay tuned for as well, it's emerging. And same with type 2 diabetes, there's potential there as well, potentially improving glucose disposal. Again, if there's more muscle activation, yeah, more glute four doorways, maybe more glute co-skate scenes. So the Brazilian group is leading the way there. So it's gone from just athletes to now looking at the health aspects for a lot of different conditions. And interesting chronic disease is come to the forefront, which is very exciting. I've also come across some other cardio metabolic health benefits, these are glucose, but also triglycerone. Yeah. It was cholesterol in there too. Can you talk about that? Is that maybe some mixed data? Yeah. Sure, if everything is, it's showing the same. Rolling mixed, some show decrease in triglycerides, LDL. And then others don't see the effect. And again, I think it comes back when you look those studies with the population. If they're compromised, as we get older, it's probably going to be more of a effect. And then the question is, was it dietary change that did it or was it the creatine itself? So that's one of the big issues when we give a creatine supplement, if you don't consider what they're already consuming, or now they've initiated exercise, compared to a triple seabull. There is potential. The mechanism seemed to be from a triglyceride perspective. It seems to increase energy expenditure. Some thermal genic potentially affect that might explain why creatine decreases body fat in individuals 18 and above, but from the cholesterol perspective, we don't really know the mechanism there. And that's an area I'm sure that'll be exploding down the road. So creatine decreases body fat in combination with resistance training, and compared to resistance training alone. Correct. Now small, though 1% or about 0.5 kilograms, there's some potential mechanisms there, but the thought is maybe increase in lean tissue mass, increase energy expenditure. So a lot of people are very cautious. They don't want to take creatine because they think is going to increase fat mass. What the research is suggesting is increasing lean body mass, potentially decreasing fat mass. So the reason the number on the scale barely changes after you do an intervention. Going back to this loading phase and this higher dose, I mean, when I say higher, 20 grams, all these studies doing that, I mean, barring the brain stuff, is it really just to kind of get their store saturated quickly because the study is not going to wait 30 days. So it's really, all these other people trying to do this loading stuff, just kind of following the studies, but really they don't have to do that. Unless they like tomorrow, when I hit the gym, and have that split the power benefit. Yeah, if you need a really quick effect, like rehabilitation from an injury, ACL surgery, something where you need to rehabilitate the muscle quickly or you're an athlete, the loading phase to me is not needed from a muscle perspective. Now, because we've talked about bone and brain might need a bit more. So now maybe the new daily loading phase is maybe five, 10 grams a day or a little bit more, but that athlete 20 grams a day for seven days followed by the maintenance, that is only ever been shown to have beneficial effects to muscle. There's been a few studies that have looked at it now from a brain, but again, that's from a different perspective. You just brought up a point that I was thinking of in that is surgery and like, or injury. How does that's a stressful situation? We're talking about really creating shining in that background of some sort of stress, whether it's training or sleep deprivation, but also you can have something like an injury or a surgery where you're planning a stressful event. Yeah, it's multifactorial. The studies that have looked at it from a rehabilitation perspective, creating seeing the increased sink of a mild genetic transcription factor. So what are born in your audience? These are little guys that sort of tell DNA to sort of increase proteins in a quicker way. So these mild genetic regulatory factors went out during real rehabilitation. And then we did a study when we got individuals to put on a cast volunteer and creating to maintain strength. Going back to the mechanism, it probably has to do that reduction in protein breakdown or the anti-cathabolic anti-inflammatory effect. Again, we don't think it has anything from a synthetic perspective because creating doesn't. But it has been shown increased satellite cells, which are native for recovery and rehabilitation. Crow factors, IGF1, and decreases mild statin. The one that increases protein breakdown. So all of these factors come into play. It's like the caramel secret. There's a whole bunch of things that go into that chocolate bar. Creatines seems to work in a very variety of ways. And then again, on the other side, it's certainly been shown to decrease reactive oxidative species. So it seems to have more of a preservation to the cell effect. But from an entry perspective, it seems to speed up recovery. Do we know what it speed up recovery if you took a before surgery? The jury's out on that. We'd have to do ACL surgery or studies on that long term clinical trials. We see a bit of promise and osteoarthritis, but not a lot of other ones. And it's because basically the studies haven't been done yet. And what are the dos on some of those? These are usually the loading phase with a slight maintenance phase. Or if they're looking at it from a cellular perspective, it's usually just the loading phase seven days pre-posts. They'll do biopsies or cellular data. So the 20 gram a day loading phase and then the maintenance phase being about five times five. OK. And if someone's already taking, let's say, five or 10 grams a day, and then they're going to have a surgery, do they still need to do the loading or should they discontinue on? I would just do that. Or even slightly a bit more, because when the tissue is under trauma, you get height and inflammation, reactive oxidative species are stress, and then protein breakdown. So maybe could help speed up your ability to recover quicker. We don't know any of the effects of creatinine cross education, where if someone has a mobilize limb and they train the opposite limb, we don't think there's any effect. It's a great study to do. And that could have huge applications for professional athletes or individuals that have our waiting for ACL surgery. Instead of sitting around all day, go to the gym and train the healthy limb, and maybe creatin can potentially increase more drive there. It's a study I've always wanted to do. We just haven't done it yet. OK. So it sounds like, in most cases, the creatine plus the training, which is in training or endurance training, is the key, but in some situations when there's just a mass of a amount of stress you know, perhaps an injury or surgery or sleep deprivation, and creatine can shine on its own. Is that correct? Yeah, there's actually a small body of research in healthy individuals, young and old that say, creatine without exercise actually improves muscle performance. So those, I think, of disuse, bed rest, a mobilization, a sedentary individuals, maybe they have functional mobility issues, or people that don't know or have access to weight training. Creatine by itself has been shown to improve muscle performance, improve strength and endurance. There are ability to perform repetitions to fatigue, primarily in older adults, but there's been studies in younger individuals, and that's sort of where creatine research blossomed. All the initial studies were very acute, seven days, the loading phase, and then we saw improvements over time on muscle performance. And that's sort of paved the way to lifelong interventions, which include exercises, the main thing, yeah, for sure. Yeah, exercise is definitely the most important thing, but I know I'm gonna ask you to speculate a little bit here, but let's say you do have an older adult who is sedentary, and just getting up out of a chair is hard. It's challenging. It can be challenging. Do you think that even supplementing with creatine in that regard, maybe help them a little bit? Two meta-nals has been performed. Both in Canada, we were fortunate to do one of two Phillips, I know it's been a guess I think for you. And we've done two meta-nals as in then, when you look at creatine in older adults with resistance training though, it did improve tasks of functionality, sit the stand. So getting out of the bed, off the toilet, getting out of a chair. Again, that was with exercise, without exercise, nothing has been there. So I would love to say yes, but again, the movement of exercise, but the nice thing is for those willing to do, is it resistance bands, anything that you feel mechanical stress, creatine will give you a slightly greater benefit, but for those that are in jeopardy of chronic disease, I think you should consider it, absolutely. So another question to mind, you're talking about where creatine transporters are, where it's synthesized, you mentioned, it's created in the liver and the brain, but you mentioned it goes to the testies. There's a little bit down to the testies. So any organ that only has the enzymes to make it, so since it's made in the liver and brain, it'll be dispersed to other areas. So the interesting thing is the area that it's created, it goes through circulation to different transporters. So male fertility has become a big issue, and there was a thought that all creatines since sperm relides, a phlegialla solace, since sperm relying for movement, on creatine so much, maybe a down regulating, sperm production, and my good colleague on a Norway surgery doc, who's one of the world's best-screating researchers, has looked at this in many forms, and not showing any effect of anything, it improves the vitality and mobility of sperm. Second of huge implications for male fertility. Yeah, it's an area that you probably would never think of, but it's an area that has shown some evidence-based research beyond it, yeah. And that's, that was gonna be my question. Well, is it affecting fertility? Yeah, it's going into the testing. It's like having rooms, it's so again, that could have applications for individual trying to start a family or male fertility issues. We don't see any down regulation. There's a thought of taking in supplementation, maybe that'll give your brain and liver a bit of a break, and there's evidence to suggest that, maybe if you're taking creatine on a daily basis, those organs don't need to make as much, because you're offsetting that. But again, when you stop supplementation, it goes back to baseline, or it doesn't disrupt any of that. And the good thing is, from a fertility perspective, there's no evidence to suggest to downregulates a sperm motility health. We can talk about hair follicle loss, and thinning the same idea, if the viewers were looking at me, but that was the same idea, maybe creatine was causing baldness, so maybe it must be doing the same thing to sperm. It must be killing off the cell, and we just don't see any of that research. Well, good, yeah, let's get into those methods. But before we get into those, I kind of wanted to, we've talked a lot about adults, much about older adults, the effects of creatine on many different tissues, and those populations. But at the start of this, podcast, you said something that caught my attention, and that was you said children and pregnancy. And I'm a mother of a seven year old, who's quite active, you know, place soccer in tennis, and I will often wondered, can children take creatine, I mean, obviously, weight adjusted, but is there any evidence in children? Has anyone looked at children? Besides the TBI study. Yeah, no, there has chart, chart, gursicin, and you know, I go at the male clinic here in the United States, or the two most profound research in that area. And they've looked at study after study in children, young children adolescents, and there's no adverse effects on why would there be? If our body doesn't like it, we just excretin it. There's a big push right now in some states trying to ban creatine in younger individuals, and they're just not looking at the evidence-based research. So overall, there's no adverse effects. We still need to do a little bit of blood work, but it improves health, agility, coordination, muscle mass, there's no reason. And so that's why I'm one of the big proponents. I argue, including the fetus, why someone couldn't take creatine, if we're already producing it, it's not like caffeine, a drug effect, or are already producing it. That's like telling people you can't take protein in your food or supplement, that's just non-sensical. So I'm one of the big people say, anybody can take creatine, even if you have chronic kidney disease, there's some benefits because it'll help the kidneys absorb creatine. And so right now, there's potential benefits for children, for pregnancy, stacey Allerry in Australia is the leading researcher there, and Abby Smith-Rine in UNC. And so they're actually looking at fetal development, having more brain bio energetics for the female. We now know that the transporter from breast milk is there. And then when you look at habitual diet, again, surgery, I guess, is look at that and hains data. And for those children taking less than one gram, it leads to a lot of potential detrimental later on cognition impairments, mean body mass, bone mineral. So I mean, asserving a salmon is about three to four grams of creatine. My hamburger would even have that. So again, in habitual diet, unless the child is vegan, they're probably getting a little bit of amount. And the dose, two to three grams, or you can even do 0.1 gram because they're so much smaller. So if I had a child, I'd just have animals a dog. I would give my children's creatine for sure as early as possible, because I'm looking at brain development, bone development, muscle immune system. It has all those benefits and keep in mind. If our body didn't like it, we just make expensive urine. Like we just excrete it. People see this when they go for their blood requisition. They see creatine on this blood requisition form. And that's all it is, a byproduct. So it's very safe. The safety profile is exceptionally young. Wow, I mean, so a few things here. So with respect to the dose with children, so you said two to three grams, or 0.1 gram per kilogram body weight, or is that applicable? Absolutely. Well, I mean, if you want to do five grams or more, I don't see any reason why not. Do they need to be taken at 10 and 20 grams? We just don't have the data to support that. But a low dose, two to three, five grams is totally viable. And vegan kids probably even more so. Correct. And then pregnancy has there actually been any human data looking at women supplementing with creatine being safe? Just subjective questionnaires, how they're feeling, things like that. It's too dangerous in a sense, because we just don't know yet. And to get an ethics board approval at a research institution is very difficult, even for teenagers and adults under the age of 18. So I know Stacy is in our big mispaper. It's concluded that we need more randomized control trials. A big trial, because we definitely want to get this one right and make sure it's 100% safe, not just for the unborn trial, but also for the mother. So there's going to be a lot more data to come out. But overall, there's no reason to suggest there's any issues whatsoever. Yeah. And again, coming to the back to the vegans that comes to mind, you're talking about women who are pregnant, who are only relying on their liver ability to make creatine. Yeah. So that would be phenomenal to get a study like that done. Yes. Do you think it'll be a proof? I think down the road when they look at the hypothesis environment of a fetal grove, I think it probably will get approved. But we're going to need a lot more clinical data to suggest it's safe. And maybe a pilot study in that. The issues with pilot studies are usually low sample size. So then from a feasibility perspective, it might be have, it actually, I can see that a multi-country, they get a lot of people in different countries to come together and make the sample size that high. So that's something to look forward forward to as well, especially in addition to the neurodgettion of diseases. Yeah. And now I'm jumping all over the place here. But going back to the kids, you mentioned the creatine supplementation was shown in improved agility. Now, why is that? Is that because of the type two muscle fat? Or the motor unit of recruitment or maybe muscle activation. So there's a whole plethora of ideas from a balanced agility, coordination perspective. It could be that they're able to exercise at a higher capacity, sort of, almost hyper-excelerate muscle development. Those are all the things that are in its infancy to look at. Again, there hasn't been a study to look at blood biomarkers for like liver and kidney enzymes, but I would be very surprised if a low dose study was done and there was any issues. Okay. Well, getting into some of the supplementation, you know, questions and I think we've kind of touched on quite a few, but I want to kind of dive a little bit deeper. You first mentioned, of course, I think a lot of people that are in, from the way with the creatine field, no creatine monohydrate. Yeah. Creatine monohydrate is that still the gold standard for supplementing with creatine if so why? Yeah. So when I say creatine today, it's monohydrate and the reason being it's based on its safety and efficacy. So monohydrate means that creatine is linked to water. So when it comes to your GI tract, the water diffuses in the hydrochloric acid of your stomach. So that molecule, it's very unique. It can actually get through our small intestine intact, unlike protein, which gets to great. Creatine is very unique. It's because the acidity of our stomach is actually too acidic. It doesn't like it so much. So it gets through and then when it gets in our blood, the creatine that you're taking from supplementation monohydrate is identical to what's being synthesized in the liver. So that's likely why the safety profile is so exceptional. Now, there's probably 50 different other market of forms of creatine out there. First, it has to be creatine when it gets into your blood. So whatever market of form you want to try, make sure it is creatine getting into the blood or it's useless. And no other creatine has ever gotten into the cell and had superior effects. There has been a few studies that look at creatine hydrochloride and with the ester bond to get sort of through the fossil lipid bilayer of your cells quicker. But no study has ever showed it to be safer or more effective. So I know monohydrate has been boring. It's been around since the 1990s, but in my opinion, why mess with a good thing and probably because the efficacy and safety behind it? Why do people turn to these other forms? Is it because of GI distress? Like, and be experienced with monohydrate? Is it? It seems as though like, I get mixed reviews. I'll talk to like almost like 50% of people say, hey, like, I get GI, like some of some of distress GI problems if I take creatine monohydrate. Some people have to go to another form or they have to lower their dose. Why does that happen? Are there any ways around that? Is there any tricks to improving, you know, the lipid of your stomach to digest? I think 99% of it is marketing. I think people get conned into buying something that's more expensive or flashy. And maybe they're making some errors with the monohydrate. They're taking a problem from the loading phase. So creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase intracellular water. So it's based on the doorway. It sort of brings water with it. And some people get GI tract irritation or some weight gain and other forms of creatine are marketed to not do that. I argue if it doesn't do that, it's probably not creatine. In other words, creatine is automatic. If you're taking a form of creatine that doesn't increase intracellular water a little bit, I would question the validity of that type of creatine. So I'm in the camp of 100% monohydrate based on the mechanisms, the structure of the molecule and the efficacy behind it. Do you need to spend more on a fancy type of creatine? If it works for you, I'm all for it. But at the end of it, I don't think you need to. Well, the question is getting back to what you said, if it's not increasing intracellular water, then it may not be doing what it's supposed to do. And ultimately, that's the whole point. So the question is if you're taking creatine HCL or there's light basomal creatine or there's a GNC brand that's like, it's an AMP creatine HCL. So it's like, you know, at the end of the day, the bulk of the research is done using monohydrate. And 99% of all the thousands of papers and the one I hear a lot is there's a better bioavailable form than monohydrate. Unlike wait a minute, creatine monohydrate's bioavailability is near 100%. There might be a little bit extractor from the gut. So how can you get more than 100%? And then if it even got into the cell, I've never seen a study to show that an increased protein synthesis or had any of the effect on satellite cells or whichever. I'm only aware that it increased creatine content. So the good thing there is in those cells, I think it was hydrochloride. That means it is a form of creatine, but did it lead to performance benefits better than monohydrate? I've never seen it. So I just caution people, just don't get con in a lot of these marketing forms, really explain, expensive forms when monohydrate is the one true. And it does. The germany, and we're going to be talking for four straight days and two weeks, a monohydrate. Why? Because that's why all the evidence-based researchers need to talk about because it's the only form that seems to be very viable. Well, aside from the marketing, I think some people, I know some people personally that even taking a five-gram dose of creatine monohydrate experience like stomach issues. So what can those individuals do? Yes, why recommend that these people and happens quite often, the micro dose. Why would say if you're taking five grams, take about two and a half grams in the morning, wait at least six hours and two and a half grams later. Also take it with food. So I put, I have for breakfast, I'm sort of boring, but I take Greek yogurt, collagen protein, way protein, blueberries, and I usually put 10 grams of creatine in my yogurt, but some people can't. So if you want, you want to put two and a half grams there. But if you want to start as low as three grams, one and a half in the morning, one and a half in the evening, or you could do one and a half in the morning, another one and a half with lunch, with food seems to increase the absorption because the insulin from carbohydrates and or some of the effects of fat. The most times is when people just drink with water, I find that's where they get the GI tract irritation just because it's going through the GI tract quickly, taking water with it, but with food, whenever we tell people that, they say it all went away. So that would be an interesting experiment for someone to try, that's experienced, GI problem, to try taking with food and carbohydrates seems like it might be really good. Okay. So, and then the other thing is you're talking about lower dose, microdosing and spreading it out. Does that, is that something you'd have to do forever or is that to kind of get your gut used to it or is that kind of? Both, it's almost from a consistency, not perspective, but there was a study done in 2003 where they showed a smaller, more frequent dose, it's just we're better than a super large 20 gram bowl of dose. So it's almost like this retention idea, but taking multiple, 1.5 gram dose, each is somewhere, it might not be feasible on a daily basis, but a quarter of a teaspoon, 2.5 grams, whichever, that would get your body used to it, then slowly tie trade up. So the best way I usually tell people is start with three grams, one and a half, morning evening, then move it up to five, two and a half, then move it up to nine. But then I say three, three and three, and then eventually you're sort of getting tolerated as like caffeine starting with a small coughing and working up to a large, your body gets used to it and then there's more in circulation. Well, you said the smaller doses were more effective at what? The idea was that it would get into the blood, maintain peak or plateauing plasma levels and hopefully you can retain more than some being extruded as creatinine. The thought was a super mega bowl of stoce, maybe 20 grams. Now there's new evidence that can get in the brain, but there's logic like some of that would be cleared from the kidneys and because the muscle may not be able to take that in all in one, so. Okay. So the dosing studies need to be really done. Well, this kind of goes to another question I had, which was we talked we've been talking a lot about dosing, but it's also about, if you're taking the cycling of it. So some people like to slam their protein shake right after a workout, is there any reason to worry about that with creatine? Because you're talking about reputant, saturating the stool. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's you're trying to saturate the stores. Yeah. I don't know that's cycling around that's going to do that. Yeah. So that's a two part answer. I think from a timing perspective and cycling, so from a timing perspective, unlike caffeine, we don't think the timing really plays a major role. There is one area that I would just recommend. It's post exercise or pre exercise. And the reason for that is that we think blood flow or transperkinetics is turned on with muscle contraction. So if you want to take creatine within an hour before you workout or I drink five grams of during my workout or right after, that seems like a very viable time, but for the viewers, the timing seems to be irrelevant. But that begs the question, what about cycling? So if you've been taking creatine for maybe two months, three months, it's very likely your muscle stores are so saturated that when you're consuming the extra creatine that you would just be excreting it. So some people say, hey, I don't want to do that. I don't want to waste my money. I'm going to cycle it. I now argue you should take it on a daily basis because of the emergence of like, okay, I'm okay with the muscle being full. If someone's going down the toilet in your nation, that's okay. But now I'm hoping our bone is taken in some. Our brain is taken in some. So we used to be in the camp where you just need creatine on the days of workout. Now I say take it every day and hope someone's going to go to your brain and muscle. I'm sorry, bone because on the days you're not working out, your muscle is not sucking it in as fast. Maybe those other tissues are getting replenished. So do you think it's better to take um, creatine like, you taking it in the morning if you're going to work out in the morning, but what if you work out in the evening, do you want to take it in the evening? Yeah, I would take it any in close proximity exercise. I would take it. So if you work out twice a day, you're taking creatine twice a day. Um, but if you take it in the morning and then work out later in the night, that's totally fine. We're not seeing any big differences. But I'm a big advantageous proponent of taking in close proximity to exercise. And that's when an hour pre-imposed. Okay, so some of the other questions are interaction with other supplements, other compounds for a very, very, very, very long time. I put creatine in my, my coffee. I put everything in my coffee because it just masks everything I just didn't do it in one. I've never really had any GI problems with creatine supplementation myself. So, um, but I'm not sure that I'm supposed to be doing that. Yes, I'm one of the rare people and most people argue against me. I don't do it either. Um, so there's two ways to look at this. The pharma kinetics of creatine and caffeine do not oppose each other. But from a cellular perspective, they certainly do. So remember when I talked with the circle plasma, we're taking, you know, caffeine likes to release calcium, but creatine likes to take it in. And some really good research of Europe has shown that the, the two molecules oppose each other from a muscle relaxation time. But the dose of caffeine seems to be the most important factor. If the dose is over 250 milligrams or even higher, that's when it seems to have the interference effect. If the dose is lower, it doesn't seem to have an interference effect. So the average large black coffee from Starbucks might be 3, 400 milligrams of caffeine. So if you were to put your scoop of creatine in there and sip on it for hours, you probably won't notice an interference effect in a few, few times. But if you did that every day for months, you might notice a blunting effect. If you did it a one time shot, you know, you, you were doing an experimental trial. You might not notice it. So I never combined the two. I always have coffee early in the morning. I love coffee. And then I wait at least two hours before I take my first thing at creatine in anticipation of those cellular interference. But other people, other big time, reading researchers say, no, they, I take it together. If it works for you, great. But there's something there that makes me a little cautious. And we've done the only training study. It was underpowered, but they did interfere with each other. Yeah. Okay. Is, is creating heat sensitive? It is. It denatures a little bit. So if you warm up the solution, some people don't like the grittiness. So when the temperature rises, it will decrease the, or increase the solubility if you will. It will not degrade at the creatine unless it's super heat of her long period of time. So if you are putting it in your coffee, the heat is not the act. It seems like the caffeine molecule might be the one that might interfere with her. Okay. So you don't have to worry so much about it being in like a hot liquid, like, no, or. But if you had a normal cake up, is 80 milligrams? There should be no interference effect. You could have two of those. But if you get up to like a large coffee, so a normal cup of coffee here in the United States may be 80 to 100 milligrams should be totally fine. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is all really good information. I think addressing some of these, the myths and questions, the misconceptions. I mean, all those things, because you've published a couple of meta analysis or review articles like that's a review artist on this. And so you talked about, let's talk about the fact gain, right? So that was kind of when you touched on a little bit. I mean, especially women women. Is it really just because of the lean mass? We freeze. There has been some cellular and animal data to show that increases thermal genesis. But overall, the decrease in body fat is there, but it's very low. So don't run out and buy creatine. I think you're going to lose 20 or 30 pounds. We're seeing it best about 1% decrease in body fat. And about 0.5 kilogram reduction over time in combination with weight training. Now, that could have implications for obesity, type 2 diabetes, or chronic diseases down the road. My thing is, a lot of people had a myth, a creatine increased body fat. We don't see any evidence to that. Okay. So it's really opposite. Yeah. The hydration myth. So what about you here, I've heard some people talk about cramps. It cramps or dehydration. It's opposite. It's super high-dress the muscle. So it could be from the sodium potassium pump or disruption from dehydration. But if you're metabolically dehydrated, creatine is not the cause. If anything, creatine is trapping water into the cell, it also has been shown to increase an extracellular water in total body water in some studies. So from a cramping or dehydration, it's actually opposite. So for those exercising, upcoming summer months, NFL football players, 2-day practices in July, creatine might actually help hydrate the muscle and decrease the chance of muscle cramping or dehydration. Ooh, that's super important. It's super important. Interesting. Yeah. Has anyone directly looked at that? I think recryters done some studies with that when he looked at NCAA players. But a lot of people don't take the myth was that it was dehydrating and we just don't see that. Where did that myth come from? I think what happened was in the inception of creatine research. A lot of people were not drinking water or going through some practices like wrestling, wearing rubber suits, extreme hydration that happened to be taken creatine. And then they said, well, I'm not on creatine. Since the traps water, therefore, my cells must be exploding or muscles and their focus causing cramping. And we just don't see any evidence behind that. Yeah. Okay. So it was like a correlation thing. Yeah, I wasn't on call anyway. The opposite. And then sort of go with you. Okay. We've talked a lot about the kidneys and we're talking about creatine. And I'd love to talk about that. That's one that I hear a lot that it's bad for the kidneys. It's bad for the liver. Can you address that? It's probably the biggest concern. So we've looked at study after study and rest assured from a clinical perspective, a creatine does not adversely affect renal liver or cardiovascular cells. And we've given 11 grams a day in postmenopausal females to a population where their organs are under a little bit more stress and no adverse effects. The theory here was that when creatine enters your muscle when it gets metabolized, it's non-enzymeacly metabolizes something called creatine. And those watch you say, oh, wait a minute, I just saw that my doctor checked that off. And the reason they do that is creatine is a byproduct. It's supposed to be filtered by the kidneys. So if you have high blood creatine, that means your filtration rate in the kidneys is not working properly. Think of your brittle water filter. It's clogged up. So unfortunately, when a lot of people go to their doctor, they don't say, hey, to the nephrologist or GP, I'm on creating supplements because it's logically that if you're taking creatine, your creatine might be acutely raised. And then that causes a false pause. And if your estimated filtration rate is low, so your doctor says whatever you're taking stop, it's killing your kidneys. We know that's not the case because when they do stop, their kidney function just comes back. So it's just the metabolism of the molecule. Okay, well, this is really important. I've had a few people reach out to me and tell me that their creatine was elevated. And I don't think they told their GP that they were taking creatine or creatine. And so the idea here is that it's the metabolism of the creatine to creatine. That's being excreted through urine. That's right. So creatine and false creatine don't leave the muscle. It gets left in the muscle as creatine. And creatine can also be raised with a very, very high protein diet, excessive exercise or dehydration. But make sure if you're on creatine supplementation, tell your doctor because it's logical that your creatine in the blood will be elevated. That's just from the metabolism of the supplement. Now, if your liver enzymes are through the growth that could be an infection. So again, make sure you go and get medical screening and guidance. But every time we hear this, it's usually a false positive. I see, false positive. Okay, so it's really going to talk to your physician about that. Baldness. That's one, that's one. Yeah. Was that rugby? Was it rugby players? Without a hug? Yeah, yeah. I was going ball way before I started taking creatine. So a lot of people say, obviously. And it's interesting. It was a great study in a sense that they looked at a novel concept. So when they had elite rugby players do a crossover design and a crossover design is really powerful. That means the group gets both placebo and creatine. So it really controls for diet, genetics, hormones, things like that. And when they took 20 grams a day, it might have been even 25 grams a day for seven days during the creatine supplementation phase. The increased the hormone, dihydroxy, testosterone or DHT. And most people say, oh, I think I've seen commercials about this. It's a surrogate of testosterone, but it's been highly linked. I hear follicle loss and thinning from a soluper's fact of they measured it in the blood. So the correlation, you know, it's just a surrogate. But when they went up, I think it went up by about 57%. But it was still within the physiological range. And what I mean by that is when you go to your doctor and they measure your blood glucose and it comes back and doctors have no, it's within the normal range, cholesterol's in the normal range. Even increasing by 57%, I think that was the number. It was still within the normal range. And they were on placebo, it increased by about 40%. So everybody says, whoa, hormone went up, correlation, causation, everybody was freaking out. That this hormone went up. They did not measure hair follicle loss, thinning, cross-sectional area, no dermatologist was involved. But a lot of people have run with this. And to this day, they cite this single study that even didn't look at free testosterone, there was no increase. So just because DHT went up a little bit and they started lower. So there was more room to improve. People think it causes baldness. I've assessed easily over a thousand people. Male and female is not a single person to say, hey, whatever you're giving to me, blot double blind is causing my hair to follow. And I got to believe a participant would say, I'm not taking the same more my hairs falling out. And I do know, I can't talk about it because I'm not sure, but I do know that there's been a paper submitted that have looked directly at hair follicle loss and thinning with creating supplementation. And that was going to be my next question. I mean, has a first of all has anyone replicated this study? It sounds like no. No. And has second has anyone directly looked at hair follicle. It's in review right now. But if I had to have a magical guess, it doesn't affect hair follicle loss or thinning. So if people are watching me, they're like, oh, and then they look at other creating researchers. I can blame my parents. I'm primarily my mother for that for the maternal DNA. And then there's other people with false heads of hair. So it can't be a cure. It's like carbohydrates, causal obesity. That's non-sensical. It's everybody's different. But I still get this on a daily basis. Both from males and females. They don't want to take it or their hair is thinning. And I'm really glad that the study is coming out because the way we should have answered this is we don't know. And told us studying and fatally says, no, we didn't see any of the effects. We would have to say we don't have any evidence to suggest a dozen. We don't have any evidence to suggest a dozen. But even when the study gets published, we'll probably have to do multiple. But just has never been done. And no road in studies. No road in studies. Nothing. I think it's an area that people said no one cared about. And then I'll have to saw nobody cared about it. Is there any other really, I think, prevalent misconceptions or myths that you want to talk about about? There's so many. I think the big one that the big one we're getting a lot is it does it increase hypertension or blood pressure because of it increases water into the body could that have any effects. And we're not seeing any adverse effects there. The other one is we do not see any evidence that disrupts sleep. Although we talked about the study earlier, it doesn't have any negative effects there. And then cancer. So this is an area that is difficult to answer talk about because we just don't have a lot of human cellular data from the in vitro data. We're not seeing any in humans at least from recommended doses. Just any malignant growth or any cancer promotion. If anything, we're seeing anti cancer properties from improving inflammatory responses there. And our latest paper, the mis-miss misconceptions part two, one of the world's best creating researchers in medical doctor, Mark Turner Polskie, read really good section on that. So if anybody's interested, read that and it seems to have some potential for cancer rehabilitation. When you're looking at tissue loss, caxia seems to have some beneficial effects there. On the collaborative with Karen Fairman in University of South Carolina, looking at prostate and breast cancer rehabilitation. So I think you're going to start to see some medical applications growing more than just young healthy individuals. Again, the common denominator is all these are sort of asking something for help. So the rehabilitation or prevention and that's where I think creating is really changed. It used to be for just young individuals who are healthy. And now it seems to have some of these health aspects. So very exciting times to be talking about it. Are you familiar with any of the research of Dr. Kerry Kerney? How do you universal bird? Yeah. The cancer there. I don't think he's ever looked at creating, but he doesn't a lot of community based yet. I just had him on the podcast. He was a lot of extras, the role of exercise in cancer treatment. And not just a robot, but resistance training. So that'd be interesting for you guys to have a discussion. The other thing that came to my mind that I now remember, I've heard a lot of people talk about is creatine supplementation, increasing their urination, particularly during sleep. Like having to go, your name frequently. I just answered this question on Instagram. So an individual, because I said, I take a pre-sleep sometimes and then all that'll keep me up being all night and I said, oh, actually that's interesting. So in this misconception paper as well, there's a section there that the creatine molecule, whichever, does not increase urinary output. People thought since it's creating creatine and you need to filter it, we think it's the increase in fluid ingestion that you're probably taking either with exercise or what is usually recommended with creatine. That's actually a myth as well. You don't need to increase tons of water consumption. But the molecule doesn't cause an increase in urination. It's not a diuratic or it doesn't increase urinary flow that way. I do hear that a lot. My logical guess is you're probably putting the creatine in eight ounces of water and you're probably drinking more water or exercising. And that's one of the things. But there's no evidence who suggests the molecule itself stimulated urination. Okay. Well, let's get to know. I think we've covered a lot. There's one area I did want to talk about and we talked about kind of saving at the end because there's more speculation here. And this is just an interest of mine. I remember several years ago, a former colleague of mine, Mark Shikinaga, was talking to me about, you know, creatine production in the liver being one of the biggest, biggest sort of sinks for methylation. And that's because you need, you need methyl groups to produce it. And as a byproduct, you also make homocysteine. And so he was talking about some at the time. I think it was pretty preliminary. But some evidence showing that if you did supplement with creatine that the enzymes and the liver that do produce creatine were, there's a feedback. And they sent, they sent that. And they didn't use so much of the, the methyl groups were being shunted to other methylation pathways. And so I was just wondering if you've come across any evidence looking at creatine supplementation and homocysteine levels for example. Yeah, the most studies don't support it. And that's where we got to the point where all, if it doesn't decrease homocysteine levels, then maybe exogenous creatine doesn't reduce our natural creatine synthesis. The studies I show it does are in animals. And I believe there was one human trial. But the majority shows it doesn't have any effect. Now that could be the dose there. But you're totally right. Methionine is donating. I think it's 40% of our methyl groups to creatine synthesis. So if I'm taking more dietary creatine or supplementation, why use that? Why not decrease the amount being synthesized? That has huge implications on energy, health and cardiovascular health. But ironically, it's not even a typical, the majority suggested doesn't decrease. Maybe the studies are not long enough or maybe they're not in populations that need it is much. Right. So the question is like, you maybe you need to start with a population has elevated homocysteine. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's hard to detect small changes when you already have any. It's easy to do. You just look at some of these blood biomarkers. But there's not a lot of stuff. There's probably less than 10 majority in rodents. Right. And I think last time I checked it was probably 7 against 3 supported. So it's there's a lot of methodology issues there. Well, maybe someone will look at it. Yeah. And I'm totally. Especially as we start to get into the vascular health for sure. That's a huge area. So I would be shocked if more studies don't come out in vascularity health or angiogenesis or anything like that potentially looking at homocysteine as a surrogate marker for potentially explaining some of the effects. Because if homocysteine comes down, you would speculate and a field health would go up in some of those things. Yeah. Right. Well, if you talked to any researchers to do doing vascular health, I will. I will. There's a little bit of energy. So I think we've covered pretty much just a lot of ground, really interesting stuff. Did we miss anything? There's anything that you wanted to discuss. Oh. Geez. No, you hit the caffeine one. I knew that was an important one for people. Are there any other interactions with other? You know, let's go back to the carbohydrate one because I think people hear this. The best way to augment creatine into the muscle is with muscle contraction, which is great. But the dose of carbohydrate shown to sort of increase it is almost over 75 grams. And I think most people are not going to consume that. Protein is a great one to add creatine too because it's insulin genetic as well. So combining creatine and protein will probably give you a superior effect. There's been two studies that showed you good greater increase in muscle performance and lean body mass when you combine creatine with protein. And this protein case, it was way protein was only about 30 grams. So now when you're looking at your pulse exercise meal, pre exercise meal, I think creatine and protein are good friends. Consider them as something that you may want to consider, especially in your pulse exercise meal or like I take at least 50 grams of protein with breakfast. I put my creatine in there. I don't need to worry about it until later on. And then I use a drink it or have it with the meal. Most creatine is tasteless. You can put it in food. That's fine. You can, you know, the heat would denatured a little bit, but it's something to consider. I'm glad you brought this up because to clarify, maybe some people were confused when we were talking about this earlier, taking the timing of the creatine around exercise it was to improve the uptake of creatine into muscle. And that can be done before or after like, first proximity to the exercise. And if you don't want to work out, keep in mind it still accumulates. Maybe just not as quick so the study in 992 was very elegant. They had one leg exercise and that increased creatine uptake by about 37%. And in the other leg that didn't exercise is still improved by 25%. So at the end of the day, the person, you know, at home watching TV, taking creatine, whatever for some time, they're still accumulating, but exercise unlocks a lot of the doorway, so to speak. That's sort of a get it in there. Or so it might give you a little bit extra benefit. And that's why I say a proximity exercise is a very viable time to take it. Yeah. But if you're looking for the benefit in terms of improving or increasing your training volume and, you know, the explosive power, the strength, that it doesn't necessarily have to be timed around the exercise. Just take it. Just take it. Like if you don't want to take it all at once, take it in small dosages. I think consistency. I now recommend taking it every day. Just get it like a multivitamin. Whatever you're doing, but just keep in mind, it's giving you not only exercise benefits, but I'm really happy to see the emergence of the health benefits. And I think in the day society, we could all use a little bit of help. Yeah. It sounds like there's no reason not to take it. I mean, there's a lot of benefits that muscle the bone and brain very, very convincing. Third party testing. You can look at companies that have been vetted, that are reliable brands. And that's always like a big thing that we didn't talk about. So if you are considering supplementation, again, you don't necessarily need it if you're getting it through your diet. But make sure third party tested. I would really focus on model hydrate based on the evidence-based research. Model hydrate has grass status. Create a pure is from Germany. It's a small scrutinized. It has less purity. That's an excellent form of creatine model hydrate. Make sure it's pharmaceutical grade. So all these things that you would do by putting something in your body just do a little bit of homework. But if you're not seeing certified safe or a third party tested, that's something to be a little cautious. And the other thing is when you're buying a compound or ingredient with a whole bunch of ingredients in there, we don't know if the creatine is going to be effective or not. And these pre-workouts, things like that. There's no reason to suggest not. But when I've been talking about creatine in our experimental studies, we're giving a hundred percent pure creatine. We're not giving it with 10 or 12 other compounds that you've got at a grocery store, things like that. But again, so there's a little bit more work that needs to be done if you're considering a multi ingredient compound. Yeah. And that's a good point because we're talking about taking 10 grams a day, which is your sort of go-to. Right. Now, it's soon will be mine. Okay. You don't want to take 10 grams a day of some mixture of things, right? You want it to be just creatine. Now, you mentioned creatine pure. Creatine pure. Creatine pure is a pure model hydrate. Yep. That's very pure. It's very pure from Germany. It's through party tests. Now, as it is closed, I'm on the advisory board for create pure. So, full of slander. And that's helps sponsoring the creatine conference in Germany in a few weeks. But it has grass status. And when you look at the independent lab, results is a hundred percent pure. There has been some issues out of Asia with transportation and not being third party tested. So, I think the consumer just needs to do a little bit of work. Most companies nowadays, if they're on the shelves of a product, are very reputable. And again, if it has third party tests that's safe, just look at the ingredients. It should say model hydrate or if you're entertaining another form of creatine. That should be the only ingredient or at least the most important ingredient on the product. What about micro ionized? Yeah, that's a new form to get away from some of the things you mentioned on GI track irritation. So, that's just being continually processed. It's very fluffy. I've noticed some of the new products, it's dissolves exceptionally well. I get away from that creatineist that the creatine can cause in solution. So, these are just coming up in new alternative forms to help please a lot of individuals make it more attractive. But it's another form that can just sort of be solidability is very high. Is there any reason to believe it when it's, because it's model hydrate, right? So, it should do the same thing. A hundred percent is just a different way to get into your body. If you like it, really, really micronized. So, it's purifying. I just take normal creatine. If there's a little bit of grittiness at the bottom, that doesn't bother me with some people they do. Okay. Excellent. We've just covered so much wonderful information and thank you so much for taking time to talk about all this research with me today. And thank you for doing all this research. Thank you. Really, you've just done an amazing job covering so much important ground in terms of the effects of creatine on human health. Right. So, thank you so much for having me. Have a great time. Thank you. Me too. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you to Dr. Deren Kandell for coming on the podcast. After this episode of recorded, a new study was published to address in that creatine supplementation was not effective for increasing muscle mass. But that study is not what most people think it is. Dr. Kandell, who was actually one of the co-authors of the paper, joined me to break down what the study actually showed, what the data support, what they don't, and how to interpret the findings in context. You can watch that full breakdown on the found my fitness clips YouTube channel. And if you found this podcast valuable, please consider sharing it with friends, with family, colleagues, anyone who you might think benefit from this information. I think your direct link goes a long way. Thank you so much for listening and I'll talk to you guys soon.

low muscle mass is really the critical thing driving risk of recurrence and death from cancer. And there's some really interesting research suggesting that if you exercise, while the tumors are shedding these circulating tumor cells, those circulating tumor cells are less likely to survive because of the increased shear stress. So when blood's flowing through the baschature, it's under certain amount of pressure, but of course that's dramatically increased when you exercise. And these circulating tumor cells are far more likely to die and not survive that journey if you're exercising. So I think of it kind of as stirring the biological soup. And the more intense the exercise, more these biological changes get stirred up. And what we found is the patients who exercise well getting this chemo radiation therapy were more likely to have a complete response, meaning the tumors were completely gone, prior to having the surgery. Exercise is no longer at the fringe of oncology. Emerging evidence has revealed that exercise really has become one of the pillars of cancer care, whether we're talking about prevention or treatment. And at the forefront of this research is Dr. Kerry Kerne, who has done a remarkable, remarkable about a research looking at how exercise affects cancer outcomes and much much more. He's a professor and a chair at the University of Alberta in Canada. I'm very, very excited to have this conversation with you, Kerry. I've been a big fan of your research, read many of your studies over the years and have been looking forward to this conversation with you today. Thank you for having me, Ron, to pleasure to be here. Well, I was thinking maybe we could kind of start at the top and just talk a little bit about why effortful exercise is not only beneficial for cancer, but also for health in general. Yeah, as you know from previous podcast exercise has a lot of benefits for the cardiovascular system, the muscular system, the immune system, and many other organs benefit from exercise. So it's really one of those behaviors that has positive health benefits throughout the body and the improvements in those health parameters throughout the body really reduced the risk of various chronic diseases and helped you manage those chronic diseases if you are diagnosed with them. So maybe we can talk a little bit about cancer prevention. You often hear about how cancer prevention occurs, you know decades before you get a diagnosis. From your research, what is the single best lifestyle shift that someone can do right now to positively affect their lifetime cancer risk? So every year in the US about two million Americans are diagnosed with cancer and the American Cancer Society estimates that about 40% of those cancers could be prevented if everybody followed sort of the optimal lifestyle suggestions that they make. So we could reduce those two million diagnosis every year to about 1.2 million. So they're not all preventable, but we could certainly prevent a bunch of them. So number one on the list, I'm sure everyone will know is smoking. That's the biggest risk factor for cancer and it's the one that many of the public health people have focused on for many years reducing cancer rates, making great gains in cancer, reductions in cancer rates because of reductions in smoking. Assuming you're not smoking, which is 80 to 85% of the American population, obesity is actually the second on the list of risk factors for developing cancer. Unfortunately, obesity is going in the other direction as smoking rates go down, obesity rates are going up, so we're starting to see more obesity related cancers. Assuming you're not smoking and you're not obese, next on the list is actually alcohol consumption. You might have heard of the surge in general warning recently about the link between alcohol and cancer that many people are not aware of. So there's a lot of alcohol-related cancers as well. After those sort of big three lifestyle changes, yes, exercise and diet are important. An exercise has been shown to reduce the risk. Maybe eight to 10 of those cancers, there's over a hundred different types of cancers. So it's a very complicated disease, all different cancer types, but we now have evidence suggesting that exercise will lower the risk of getting some of those cancers, particularly colon cancer, breast cancer, and the meat-year-old cancer, and several other cancers as well, such as stomach cancer, a soft-a-geal cancer, and a few others. So yes, some evidence that these lifestyle chances really can reduce your risk of getting cancer. If someone had limited time and resources in this sort of 80-20 cents, so if you were going to put in 20% of your effort to kind of get 80% of the reward, do you think that, you know, what are some of the prevention strategies that would give you the biggest bank for your buck? Like cancer screenings, exercise, things like that? So for sure, if you're a smoker, that's absolutely the best thing you can do is quit smoking, and you can really substantially reduce your risk by quitting smoking, and it has fairly correct benefits in terms of lowering cancer rates. If you're obese, then yes, going on a weight loss program and reducing obesity would be the biggest thing. If you're a heavy drinker, then that's going to be a key thing. As summing you're none of the above, you're not particularly overweight or smoking or drinking heavily. Then I think exercise really is next on the list. And you know, the general recommendation is the public health guidelines of about 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise. Some evidence is suggested, muscular strength training can lower the risk of some of these cancers as well, but most of the recommendations are really around sort of moderate to vigorous intensity, physical activity. Do you find that these recommendations are so like if you're going to do aerobic exercise versus like the resistance training or high intensity, and will training, do you think there's any differences between them or is it really just kind of do something? I don't think there's large differences in terms of the length. So, you know, ultimately exercise is energy expenditure. So you're causing the system to engage in energy expenditure and that has a whole sort of cascade of biological effects that occur. There are a little bit different if it's strength training, we know there's going to be particular adaptations or if it's aerobic exercise, they're going to be other adaptations. But in terms of some of these biological changes like the anti-inflammatory effects, the stimulation of the immune system and stuff, doesn't seem to matter which type of exercise. Certainly some support from more of the moderate intensity exercises, having more of a stimulation effect on the biological system. So you want a little bit of a stronger stress to cause that immune adaptation, for example, or the metabolic adaptations? Yeah, exactly. So all these recommendations will generally be at the level of at least moderate intensity. There's definitely been some research on the light intensity physical activity just getting up and moving around and what are some of the benefits and outcomes related to that type of exercise. But more compelling evidence once you get into the moderate intensity exercise zone and certainly even more benefits with the vigorous intensity or the higher intensity exercise. I know the major area of focus of your research is looking at how exercise effects cancer treatment. But there are some interesting questions I have with prevention. You're mentioning obesity being a big risk factor for a variety of different obesity related cancers and perhaps there's people that have genetic predispositions. Maybe they have some of these BRCA1, BRCA2, single nucleotide polymorphisms that may increase the risk of breast cancer, for example. Is there any evidence or do you have any opinions on whether someone that may have those risk factors if they're incorporate exercise into their personal hygiene? Is that something that can help negate some of that cancer risk even if they still have the genetic predisposition or even our obese, for example? Yeah, there is good evidence on that. So one of the mechanisms how exercise might lower the risk is true managing obesity. But what we also see is exercise lowers the risk of cancer regardless of your obesity status. So we can do the subgroup analysis of those who are BMI above 30 overweight category healthy weight, all of them show a reduction. So obesity is not the only mechanism by which exercise is lowering the risk. So even if your obese and you don't lose weight, exercise can help you lower the risk of developing cancer. We even see this with smokers. So we can break them into the sort of the smokers and the non-smokers with lung cancer risk. And even those who are smoking exercise will help them lower the risk. Of course, that's small compared to the impact of not smoking. But it shows that exercise works within these groups to lower the risk. Whatever is kind of driving your risk, whether it's obesity, whether it's smoking, you can benefit from it. The genetic stuff we haven't seen quite as much evidence yet. The the bracket genes you talked about there is like an 80% chance of getting breast cancer and very high with ovarian and some of these other ones. So you're almost on a kind of genetic trajectory that would be very hard to stop, you know, with a lifestyle change. So I haven't seen as much evidence there suggesting that it can be beneficial for those patients. There's other options for those patients and trying to reduce the risk. Yeah, that was probably the most extreme genetic, pretty special case. I mean, there's other genetic predispositions as well or maybe a family history. Someone's got a family history. And we've seen some of the studies look at that trying to look at kind of and just do it as you say by family history, a very simple way of looking at it. And we do find that exercise lowers the risk of developing some of these cancers even in those who have a family history. There's um, it seems like it's really just a panacea. I mean in some regards, obviously, you know, if you're a smoker, you know, with the take home message to be, I'm going to exercise but still smoke, right? Like no, like you should quit smoking, right? That's like the number one thing. But but the fact of the matter isn't and well, I'd love to get in to some of these mechanisms in a minute about how exercise is, you know, how it's playing a role in cancer prevention and, you know, affecting tumor biology through metabolic signals. I mean, glucose regulation being a big one, right? I mean, even if you're someone that who is obese and you're exercising and you're increasing glucose uptake into your muscle, I mean, that's that's very beneficial to not have it than available for a lot of cancer cells, you know, which primarily do use glucose for fuel. So what about someone who is, let's say, not obese, they're healthy, maybe they're in their 40s and there are someone that's more like a weekend warrior, maybe. I don't even know if that would be the term, maybe there's someone that just goes for a jog on the weekends only. Would there be a case to make for those people to maybe push a little bit higher intensity than just going for your your jog on the weekends in terms of like making an impact on their cancer prevention? Yeah. So what we see in the cancer prevention literature is there is a dose response association, as we say. So that means the more exercise you do, the greater the risk reduction. So even though we can kind of look at different cut points and say, here's kind of a amount of exercise that will give you a benefit, we know that more is better. And there's various ways of getting that more, one of it, as you pointed out, is increasing the intensity, but also increasing the frequency or increasing the duration. Now what you see with the exercise guidelines nowadays, if they've almost backed off any recommendations in terms of the frequency duration component, doesn't really matter how you slice and dice that exercise. So this guideline of 150 minutes per week, we used to say five days per week for 30 minutes. And then we used to say, okay, we'll spread it over at least three days and in minimum durations of 10 minutes. And now they're not even saying to spread it out over multiple days. And they're not even saying it needs to be a minimum of 10 minutes at once. So the whole weekend warrior thing brought that well, you can probably go on a Saturday and Sunday and do 50 minutes, you know, if you're out doing a hiking or or some other activity. And that might be just as beneficial as spreading it out over different days. Now that's on the prevention side of things. Things get trickier, I think, on on treatment side of things where maybe maybe more frequent bouts are important because you're looking at the acute effects of exercise, accumulating acute effects. But in terms of the general prevention strategy, the more you do the better, and it doesn't really matter how you slice it up over the course of a week as long as you get to that 150 minutes. Is there a limit on that? So we're saying 150 minutes of modern intensity exercise, you know, depending on where you what journal you read for the definition of modern intensity exercise, you'll find it's, you know, your heart rate, your heart rate, max is going to like what 70% 75% heart rate max. So I mean, you're getting some sweat on your brow there. If you were to do, let's say 300 minutes a week, you were to double that of modern intensity or you're going to also increase the intensity, right? So you're doing more vigorous types of exercise. You're going above that 70, 75% you're going to 80% max heart rate. Would you continue to see decreases in cancer risk in that? I mean, is there, is there a limit? Like does it? Yeah, it's a good, it's a good question. So the general recommendation is actually 150 to 300 minutes. So, you know, 150 we kind of use the minimum to getting these benefits, and then those benefits will continue to crew up to about 300 minutes. And then the curve's kind of plateau after that. You know, you can certainly do more than that. But in terms of bang for your buck and really getting the benefits is getting up to that 150 minutes, and then further increases as you get to 300 minutes. But it does kind of plateau after that. Okay. So really it's better to be on the higher end of the recommendations, whether that's, you know, the moderate intensity exercise 300 minutes a week or vigorous intensity the higher and being 150 minutes. That's right. Okay. Yeah. So it is viewed more as the minimum of achieving that. And all these guidelines note that further benefits can be gained by doing more. So we set that guideline around 150 in additionally getting up to 300 can be more. And generally the guidelines just sort of double weight vigorous minutes. So when we say it can be 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous. You kind of get double credit for the vigorous intensity exercise or any combination of the two. It doesn't have to be all moderate or all vigorous. You can mix it up as well. But that's roughly the extra benefit of the vigorous is this kind of double waiting that you're probably getting about twice the benefit as you might get with moderate intensity exercise. It seems as though people that let's say do you have a family history of cancer? Would really benefit from knowing this information as well as their physicians that they you know speak with because you would imagine someone with a family history would want to hit the top end of that you know recommendation right? And so not the minimum. So you often only hear the minimum when hearing recommendations which I don't really I don't think I think that's kind of you know a problem to be honest. I think we should be talking about more of the upper end especially if you're getting a dose response and people really do want to get and maximize their their benefits that they're going to get from exercise. For someone who is exercising and has been and say they still come down with cancer. Is there any preemptive benefits they get? So in other words like does the fact that they've been let's you know say exercising for decades before their cancer diagnosis? Does that seem to change the trajectory of their their outcome at all? Like do they have a benefit? That's a great question. And so there is some studies that link both pre-diagnosis exercise and post-diagnosis exercise to better cancer outcomes. And some of those studies show that yes even the amount of exercise you were doing before diagnosis might improve your outcomes after diagnosis independent of what you do after diagnosis. Some of it is that the exercise might alter the cancer itself. So even if it doesn't prevent the cancer it might be a less aggressive cancer or genetically different type of cancer or it might be more of an early stage cancer. So some of it's related to changing the cancer itself. But even if exercise doesn't prevent the cancer it may delay the cancer. So someone who gets diagnosed at age 70 might say, hello I exercise all my life and I still got cancer but they might have been diagnosed at 65 without the exercise. So sometimes it's just delaying the cancer. And then I think the pre-diagnosis exercise helps you get fit and ready for cancer treatments. And so you can think of exercise kind of this whole pre-diagnosis time as the entire pre-habilitation part. It's preparing you for getting diagnosed with these chronic diseases. Because once you get diagnosed with a chronic disease sometimes the treatments happen fairly quickly. And that window of getting fit and ready for the chronic disease and as treatments might be short. So the other way to look at this sort of prevention lifestyle one is really pre-habilitation for the eventuality. Most Americans will be diagnosed with a chronic disease at some point in their life. And many of them will be diagnosed with multiple chronic diseases. It's the rare person that's going to make a dayage 90 with no chronic disease. So you are kind of preparing for those chronic diseases and getting yourself into the best shape and the best fitness for then having to deal with that chronic disease. So yeah lots of benefits I think to exercising throughout your lifetime even if it doesn't ultimately prevent you from getting a particular disease. What kind of exercise prepares people the most for a cancer treatment that they're going to undergo? I mean, strength training resistance training is obviously you do get your heart rate up. It's not the same as aerobic exercise or vigorous intensity exercise. But your your building muscle mass your building muscle strength very very important for aging. Where does the aerobic versus like resistance training come into play in terms of preparing someone for a cancer diagnosis? So most of the research we have has been on the aerobic side of things. So somebody gets diagnosed with cancer. They do oftentimes go on to these treatments fairly quickly. So it can be a short window in terms of getting ready. But pre-habilitation is as very important concept that you can prepare for these treatments and potentially reduce your complications, reduce your length of hospitals stay, improve your quality of life in your recovery afterwards. Most of the studies have looked at fairly simple aerobic programs, walking programs. And oftentimes they're combined with nutrition, psychological counseling, stress reduction. In the general literature, these programs have been shown to be effective for patients going on to surgery onto a major surgery and showing that they have fewer complications from the surgery shorter hospital stay. In the cancer area, we haven't demonstrated quite a strong event of it. We can show that if you get some exercise before surgery, that you are a fitter prior to surgery and that you end up being fitter and able to function better physically after surgery, but not really the reductions in say length of hospitals stay or the complication rate, which is some of the key outcomes that we're seeing another surgical endeavors. Got it. Yeah, I would imagine also if there would be some evidence looking at resistance training added onto that, it would be beneficial because post-surgery in particular, you're less mobile after and you end up losing muscle mass and it's really hard to gain that muscle mass bath back after, at least when you're older after an event like that. Yeah, the muscle mass in cancer is critical. Cancer can become a wasting disease. This phenomenon called caceccia where you get muscle wasting, especially once you get advanced or metastatic cancer. But now there's a lot of research showing that low muscle mass is really the critical thing driving risk of recurrence in death from cancer. So these patients who have low muscle mass or lose muscle mass when they're going through these difficult treatments tend to have the worst outcomes. So it's prompted a lot of research now into the resistance training angle versus the aerobic exercise angle. Wow, does resistance training counter cancer caceccia? Because I know that's a little bit of a different mechanism. Is that an inflammatory driven mechanism that's breaking down muscle? Yeah, I don't think they know all the mechanisms right now of why that's going on. But they've attempted to address it mostly with nutritional interventions and supplement types of interventions, but not had great success. There is some research looking at exercise and strength training seems to have modest benefits. But I think ideally we'd want to intervene earlier and prevent patients getting from that caceccic state. Because then things, you know, progress very rapidly once you get into that caceccia and it's very hard to reverse it at that stage. But if we can prevent it up front and delay it, I think that would be a really important benefit. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean, on the prevention stage, it would be you have to be incorporating regular resistance training, strengthening into your workout routine because you want to have, you want to basically build up that muscle reserve that will you have more to pull from if a terrible thing like a cancer diagnosis occurs and cancer caceccia, I don't know exactly what drives it all, but if it, you know, kicks in, at least you have more muscle to start with, right? Like that would be. And there is and of course that feeds into the whole obesity paradox, right, which is obesity is a risk factor for getting a chronic disease, but it actually helps you live longer after a chronic disease. So we've seen that in a few of the studies say with lung cancer, that once your diagnosis with lung cancer patients who are actually larger, more obese have a little bit longer survival and I think it gets into this idea of the reserves that you've built up and sort of this rapid decline that's going to occur. I think the obesity angle may be important, but it's probably even more important with the muscle mass, right? The larger amount of muscle mass is going to help you live longer, you know, as cancer sort of takes this toll over the course of months or years. Do people with obesity also have more muscle mass? Are they just eating more calories, including from protein, which is a signal for muscle proteins synthesis? Yeah. And the research shows there's no necessary link between that. There is this phenomenon we call sarcopenic obesity. So there's high rates of obesity, but those people have fairly low lean body mass as well. So there's different kind of phenotypes if you will of the obesity. And you're right, the real issue we want to look at in obesity is how much muscle mass versus how much fat mass. And look at kind of that fat to lean ratio. And that's really the more important factor. Some people who have very high weight might have a lot of muscle mass and be in very good shape. Others might have a balanced muscle mass and then others might have very small muscle mass despite these high levels of obesity. You know, the other thing I wonder, carry is oftentimes you'll you'll see in some of the scientific literature obesity defined as ABMI of X fill in the blank right? And if they're measuring BMI, you know, some people that are lifting weights that are very muscular have a high BMI. And if you were just to look at BMI only and not like hip-to-waist ratio and other factors, you might actually miscategorize someone as obese. And so I wonder, it'd be interesting to see if there's anyone that's looked at this obesity paradox and whether or not like that's contributing to confounding that data. Yeah, and that's definitely one of the explanations for the obesity paradox and that is it's not it's not a good quality measure of body composition. So in our research, another research will either look at dexas scans that allow you to look at fat mass and lean mass. But what they've done in the cancer field is all these patients are getting scans to track the tumors and these scans will go through the skeletal muscle in different places and they're able to get really good quality measures of how much skeletal muscle mass you have. And they're the ones who have pointed out that's really what's driving these survival rates is this low muscle mass which also drives low physical functioning and poor quality of life as well. So I think, you know, in the cancer field, muscle mass and strength training are turning out to be critically important. Yeah, that's really not something that at least, you know, in the past decade or so or more was really talked about at least within the context of how why it's important to be fit with the cancer diagnosis. Right, usually you think about aerobic exercise and the stress of aerobic exercise. And of course there's all these mechanisms that occur. But it is really interesting to think about how important having that muscle reserve is if you are going to get diagnosed because I mean, it really does affect, you know, it's almost, it affects the trajectory out of almost any kind of illness, not just cancer. I mean, a respiratory illness, a surgery, anything that's going to have you immobilized for a period of time because you're you're recovering you know, anything like that. So I know for myself, I've really gone on this personal journey of always been really into endurance training. I've loved being, you know, outside and running. That's been something that I love to do for many decades. But in the last year, I've taken strength training, resistance training really serious. And, you know, I'm doing, I'm doing, I went from doing like 30 minutes a week to like two and a half hours a week of resistance training. So I've really gone up on and I'm, and we're talking, you know, compound lifts and things that are that are working multiple muscle groups at once and joints and affecting strength as well as, you know, bone density and everything like that. Okay. So I want to get into exercise treatment in a minute because I know that's really where the bulk of your research is. But a couple more questions before we get there on the prevention side. So I've, I've talked to some people and I've heard them say things like, oh, I do a lot of house chores. I walk around them on my feet at work. Therefore, I'm getting enough exercise and I don't really need to make structured exercise at a part of my, my, my physical fitness routine. What would you say to that in terms of affecting cancer risk? Well, the recommendations for the 150 moderate and intensity exercise minutes per week is above and beyond sort of what we call background activity just sort of what you might do over the course of a day. So getting up and moving around is important, but it's not a replacement for a structured exercise program. The way I think of it is I view those types of things where you're getting up standing around, you know, parking at the far end of the parking lot and, and walking in or getting off the bus stop, a stop early to get a little bit of walking in. I view those kind of as activity supplements to be added to a good quality exercise program just the same way when you talk about nutrition, you know, you don't live on nutritional supplements, right? You want a good quality healthy diet and then you might take nutritional supplement depending on health issues. So at the core of exercises, a good quality structured exercise program combining a aerobic and strength exercise. Then on top of that, yes, getting up and moving around, not sitting for extended periods of time and building activity into your day, I think are also important. So you're hitting on my next question, which is the concept of exercise snacks, because there's some studies that I've read where sedentary time, so the time that you're sitting at your desk or sitting down at work accumulates, and that sedentary time is an independent risk factor for cancers, which kind of raises the question of whether or not if you do these sort of structured exercise snacks where you, you, you know, every hour, so you get up and you do a minute of high knees or you do some, you know, burpees or jumping jacks or whatever your favorite exercise snack is to kind of get the blood flow and and break up that sedentary time. Is that, is that something that would be beneficial? There's a little bit of research supporting it. It's not as strong as the moderate to vigorous and tency exercise. So if I had to rank them, you know, that would certainly be above the sedentary behavior. Part of the challenge in those studies, it's very much harder to measure, you know, all these little things that people do over the course of the day where they're a little bit better at recalling vigorous intensity and moderate intensity exercise, but nevertheless those movements are going to be beneficial because we know they are going to expend energy. So it's going to be similar to these other exercise benefits. And as I mentioned, you know, we're no longer recommending this at least 10 minute duration as the minimum of exercise break. So if it's moderate intensity and you're able to accumulate it in a few minutes here in a few minutes there, there could be beneficial effects of that type of exercise. I think there's some evidence showing that as well at least with the the Ville<|es|> studies, the vigorous intermittent lifestyle activity where people are accumulating these short bursts of a couple of minutes throughout the day. All the way, I think they accumulate up to between six and nine minutes of that, you know, the short bursts of intense, actually exercise more intense. Yeah, yeah. No, it's very interesting research and there, of course, using the objective accelerometer so they're not relying on the person's recall and they get a better indication of that. But yeah, if you're engaged in this type of vigorous intensity exercise, even if it's only for a minute here, a couple minutes there depending on how much you accumulate during the day, there's going to be beneficial effects to that. So you mentioned supplements, people take supplements sort of as insurance and it's funny because I've even used that term before, like I take a multivitamin, you know, there's a lot of trace elements and minerals in there that I may or may not get from my diet, but it's kind of like an insurance that I'm at least going to get some of these, you know, minerals and elements that I may not be meeting the recommended intake for. And I think of exercise almost as like the best long-term insurance for reducing my cancer risk, because you agree with that in terms of, yeah, in the absence of smoking and obesity, yeah, exercise is really important for lowering the risk of cancer. Okay, so let's shift gears and talk about the role of exercise and cancer treatment. Maybe maybe we could start just a little bit with explaining this sort of cancer treatment landscape, like when someone's newly diagnosed with cancer, like what kind of treatments are they potentially looking at for these different types of cancers? So there's been a lot of exciting progress in cancer treatment over the last couple of decades, you know, the main days of cancer treatment in the past were surgery, very important radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapies. And now over the last couple of decades, there's been a lot of research on so-called targeted therapies and immunotherapies. And these have really changed how these patients are treated. What it does mean, though, is many of these patients are in for extensive treatments. I think cancer patients are probably the most heavily treated chronic disease group that we have. So patients get what we call multimodal treatment, so it's rare that you would only get one of those treatments. And some of these patients get surgery followed by radiation therapy, followed by chemotherapy, and then they may get immunotherapy. There's over a hundred different types of chemotherapy drugs with all different side effects. There's dozens and dozens of immunotherapies that are now approved. So patients get treated with all these combinations and sequences of these treatments. So it's not a quick and dirty, sorted disease where you're in the door, you're treated in your route. These treatments go on for many months and in some cases many years. So patients kind of face this treatment gauntlet and it can take a physical toll and a mental toll on these patients over an extended period of time. And when you get into advanced cancer, which you might have for many, many years, we have what we call first line treatment, second line treatments. And some of these cancers we have six and seventh line treatments. So you're looking down knowing that ahead of you, you've got all these different treatment options that may be available. They help with the cancer, but they do have a lot of side effects and and so it can be a real challenge, you know, to go through these cancer treatments. How does that complicate the role of exercise in cancer treatment? Yeah, so we have to think about exercise as a cancer treatment. So that means we have to think about combining exercise with other treatments and sequencing exercise. You know, as exercise more beneficial before this treatment, during this treatment after this treatment. And what treatments? What treatments does exercise add benefit to in which treatments does exercise not add benefit to or what treatments might interfere with. So this sort of old straightforward question does exercise help with cancer, you know, sort of was in the days of independent of any other treatments. Now that all these other treatments are being given to these patients, we have to think about exercise in a little more sophisticated way about when and how we combine exercise with these other treatments that patients are receiving. I've heard you say, don't take cancer lying down. How do you, how does a patient who is newly diagnosed with cancer, who is scared, confused? How do they transform that fear into motivation to exercise? How do they transform their fatigue into that motivation to to to move and exercise? Yeah, so cancer diagnosis is a very difficult time. These patients can be overwhelmed and very stressed to find out you have cancer. And then they're learning what type of cancer, what stage of cancer they have, what's the grade of cancer. And then the oncologist is talking about all these treatments. We're going to give you six months of chemo and then we're going to put you on a hormone therapy. So it's a very overwhelming and difficult time. And so we have to look at, you know, what's the opportunity time to present exercise to these patients and help them intervene? But I think many patients tell us that cancer makes everything feel abnormal. They lose control. It's just the cancer has taken over. And many of them feel that exercise helps them maintain control, helps them feel normal. So once they kind of settle in the initial shock and realize they have cancer and they're in for these series of treatments, many of them start looking for, what can I do to help myself? Yes, I've got to show up and get all these treatments. But what can I do to potentially benefit myself? And when they start looking into the literature, exercise is one of these things that they're quickly seeing is potentially very beneficial for them, not just for the disease itself, but yeah, many of these sort of side effects, symptoms, quality of life issues that they're going to face, the clines in physical health and mental health. And I think once they start seeing these cancer specific benefits, right? Cancer patients aren't motivated to increase their VO2 max or their much better strength. They want to know what's going to help me get through these treatments? What's going to help me benefit from these treatments? What's going to help me manage the side effects? And once they start seeing the research there that exercises not just this general health behavior for cancer patients, but it's actually going to help them manage their cancer, that can be very motivating for them. So what are some of these effects that exercise can help improve whether we're talking about chemotolerance, side effects, improve survival? What are some of the effects that exercise helps with? Yeah, so one of the big ones is managing some of these side effects of the treatments. You mentioned fatigue, which is one of the most important ones, many cancer patients experience fatigue from these treatments as well as symptoms. And in the past, I'm called just used to recommend take it easy, rest. This is the best way to get through these treatments. And so some of the early studies started showing the patients that rested during chemotherapy actually reported more fatigued than the patients who exercise. And this is very counterintuitive for patients. And it's counterintuitive for doctors, you know, when you're tired and not feeling well, rest seems like the best medicine. But it's not the best medicine. And we've demonstrated that consistently in the exercise oncology field that patients who exercise going through these treatments have lower fatigue. So that's a huge factor. The other benefits that have been shown definitively are improvements in sleep quality. So you can imagine the stress and the anxiety of going through these treatments, not knowing whether the treatments are working, whether or not you're going to have recurrence very difficult with sleep. And exercise has been shown to benefit sleep quality. We're doing some of the anxiety associated with cancer depression levels. And some of these other side effects as well, peripheral neuropathy. There's been some studies showing some potential benefits. So that's one of the key benefits is managing the side effects. You mentioned treatment tolerance, which is your ability to complete these treatments, very, very important. Every cancer patient learns very quickly that I need to get all of these drugs that I'm supposed to get and I need to get them on time. If the oncologist has to reduce the dose of those drugs or delay them, that increases the chances of recurrence. In other words, it reduces the chances of being cured. So the last thing on call just want to do is sort of reduce these drugs or delay them. But if the side effects are so bad, they have to do that. Some of these patients, the side effects are so bad, they can't complete these treatments. So early on when we were looking at exercise, the concern was that we might interfere with patients' ability to complete these treatments. That we're going to make it harder. We're piling on the exercise on top of all these side effects, whether sick, nauseous, and diarrhea, and vomiting, and so on. And so some of these studies have actually shown that it's the patients who exercise during chemotherapy that end up completing more of their chemotherapy. They have fewer reductions in the chemotherapy drugs and fewer delays. And that portends a better outcome, a higher chance at cure, and a lower risk of recurrence. So that's been a huge finding that's very motivating for patients. And then ultimately this link to survival. You know, does it reduce the risk of recurrence, does it improve survival? We have a growing amount of research. Pre-clinical studies in the animal models looking at exercise and tumor growth and spread, but also these epidemiological studies showing that cancer patients who report more exercise seem to have a lower risk of recurrence of the disease and a lower risk of dying from the cancer many years down the road. So yeah, lots of benefits across the board in terms of quality of life benefits and also disease and survival benefits. So when it comes to the exercise type, do you think that more intense exercise is more beneficial with respect to cancer treatment and some of the least mechanisms that may be occurring to have these beneficial outcomes? So some of it's been showing that the higher intensity exercise is better. A lot of these studies have done high intensity interval training, but it very much depends on the patient's ability and how they're responding to the treatments. Some patients will get a very first chemotherapy infusion and they are completely wiped out. They got nausea and vomiting. They have diarrhea. They have sickness and it's very difficult. So we have to individualize the exercise for them. Other patients don't even know their on chemotherapy. They continue working and continue going through it and they're able to do a much more demanding exercise program. But the weight training has also been shown to be very important. I mentioned that improvement in chemotherapy completion and one of the studies that we did it was actually the weight training group that completed more of their chemotherapy compared to the aerobic exercise group or the usual care group. And so this weight training group was able to put on over a kilogram of lean muscle while they were on chemotherapy and this might help with the metabolism of these chemotherapy drugs. So higher intensity exercise seems to be good. Weight training seems to be very good during these treatments. What kind of protocols are we talking about with respect to the weight training protocol, the aerobic exercise training protocol, that some of the patients in your trials have been on? Most of the protocols we've tested are three days per week of weight training, maybe eight exercises covering all the major muscle groups, modern intensity. So eight to 12 repetitions before failure. So I would consider kind of a standard full body type of weight training program. Many of the other trials have done two days per week. So lots of good evidence suggesting that even two days of a week of weight training can be very beneficial for these outcomes. Have you ever combined the aerobic exercise with weight training and see if there's like synergy or additive effect? Yes, we did one trial we call the care trial which stands for combined aerobic and resistance exercise and breast cancer patients. And we did find some additional benefits. We did a high dose of aerobic exercise, we did a moderate dose of aerobic exercise, and then we did a combined aerobic and resistance exercise. And of course additional benefits and things like muscular strength improvements and lean body mass, but even in some of the symptom side effects, small additional benefits of combining the two. But the best evidence definitely is exercise compared to nothing at all. That's that really drives the benefits. And once you start manipulating exercise prescription, we can see some additional benefits for patients who are able and willing to do more exercise or able and willing to do a combined exercise program. When you say high aerobic exercise versus moderate, is this guidelines like per week or what was the kind of protocol? Yeah, so it was 75 minutes of vigorous in the sort of moderate group and then 150 minutes per week of vigorous in the higher aerobic. So it's more kind of the minimum guideline versus the the optimal guideline for aerobic exercise. What, so I want to talk a little bit about some of the mechanisms for proved survival for reduced cancer recurrence. I mean you mentioned one which was continuing the treatment, right? So obviously that's one important. But perhaps some other ones that may also affect cancer metastasis, right? That would also affect survival and perhaps recurrence later down the line as well. What do you find? Can we talk a little bit about some of these mechanisms like immune related metabolic related? I've heard you talk about increased blood flow as well and maybe what's most compelling if there's any that's most compelling? So if we talk about influencing the primary tumor and we've seen this in preclinical models but also in the human studies, sometimes when we've got an existing primary tumor, the first treatment is not to surgically remove it. The first treatment is to treat it with chemotherapy or radiation therapy and try and shrink or eliminate the tumor that way. And so what they've shown in some of these preclinical models is if you're giving these mice, a particular chemotherapy drug and exercise versus neither versus both, exercise combined with chemotherapy is more effective than exercise alone or chemotherapy alone. And what they've shown in these studies is that these primary tumors have a very poor vasculature. It's poor quality blood vessels, they're leaky and they're chaotic in there. But all these tumors in order to grow, they need to draw blood vessels. They only grow to a very small size and unless they get blood vessels within them, they can't grow any larger. So they all start developing these blood vessels. What they're able to show in these exercise studies is that exercise improves the quality of these blood vessels and the density of these blood vessels. And while you're improving the quality of these blood vessels, what that improved was chemotherapy delivery to the tumor. So it improves the delivery of the drugs to the tumor. What also does this improve profusion to the tumor. And these tumors become better oxygenated. That's critical because radiation therapy is effective with well-oxygenated tumors. If they are hypoxic tumors, they're not radio sensitive. So now we start thinking, if you're exercising well-getting radiation therapy or well-getting chemotherapy, we might improve the delivery of the drugs to the tumor and improvements in making them more radio sensitive. And we've seen this in actual human studies. So in actual studies with patients, we did a study in rectal cancer patients. And the treatment for them is a combination of chemo radiation therapy prior to having the tumor surgically removed 12 weeks later. So they want to shrink and try and eliminate that tumor. And what we found is the patients who exercise well-getting this chemo radiation therapy were more likely to have a complete response, meaning the tumors were completely gone prior to having the surgery. So this is a very profound and important benefit of exercise potentially in these patients who are getting treated with what we call neolage event therapy. This kind of chemo and radiation therapy prior to surgery. So that's one very important mechanism and perhaps the most compelling. Once the tumor is surgically removed, you're no longer concerned about the primary tumor, you're concerned that a small number of cancer cells have been shed from the primary tumor and might spread throughout the body. So these cells have to go on an arduous journey through the vasculature so they can spread through the lymph system but also through blood vessels. And there's some really interesting research suggesting that if you exercise, well the tumors are shedding these circulating tumor cells, those circulating tumor cells are less likely to survive because of the increased shear stress. So when blood's flowing through the vasculature, it's under certain amount of pressure but of course that's dramatically increased when you exercise. And these circulating tumor cells are far more likely to die and not survive that journey if you're exercising. So this is another really interesting mechanisms for how exercise might be able to prevent the spread of a primary tumor. And once those cells are circulating or they've kind of disseminated elsewhere in the body, this is where some of these other mechanisms can be important. The metabolic effects of exercise such as reducing insulin and IGF. These are all things that help cancer cells grow and divide more rapidly. The anti-inflammatory effects of exercise can be very important and probably one of the key ones is immune system. Tracking down and killing these cancer cells, right? This is why we have the whole new treatment now immunotherapy. We've realized how important it is to call on the immune system to be able to track down and kill these cancer cells. So exercise in some ways was the original immunotherapy. This was stimulating the immune system and improving natural killer cell, cytotoxicity, the number of natural killer cells, the number of T cells and B cells that were all doing immunoservalance of these cancer cells. So lots of good biological mechanisms for how exercise might improve these cancer outcomes. That was phenomenal. Thank you for that explanation. A couple of follow-up questions. So one, what you're just talking about, you know, the immune surveillance surveillance. And I'm wondering, so I've read some studies about exercise and these are normal healthy people. And, you know, for a long time, it was thought like, oh, if you're sick, if you have a respiratory illness, you should not exercise. Because some studies that were done found that exercise acutely lowered the number of circulating T cells in the bloodstream, the vast color system. But then subsequent studies were done and found that actually those circulating T cells were going somewhere. They're actually going to the lungs. So they're immobilizing going to the lungs to help fight off pathogens, right? The respiratory, the cause and the respiratory illness does exercise affect the immune cells, like the cytotoxicity, lymphocytes, or the natural killer T cells immobilization to go to the side of the tumor, as well, as, you know, surveilling in the vascular system. Yeah. So that's been demonstrated in those pre-clinical most models. Well, they've shown that the mice that exercise will have higher numbers of T cells, natural killer cells within the tumor itself. So that improved blood flow allows everything to get into the tumor in order to be able to kill it. So yeah, the improved immunity, it will push all the immune cells out into the system to potentially track down some of these circulating or disseminating tumor cells. But it also increases immunodelevry to the actual primary tumor as well. Now exercise to your point can be immunosuppressive as well, right? We know these very high levels of exercise that kind of triathletes in the marathon runners, right? It can cause immunosuppression. And this was one of the reasons someone colleges early on were concerned about exercise, right? These patients can become immunosuppressive from the chemotherapy treatments and other treatments. So they were a bit concerned with the very high intensity exercise in these patients. But most of what we're studying and looking at is more the moderate intensity or the or the higher intensity, okay? But for reasonable amounts of exercise, not sort of these marathon runners or these triathletes where you might overwhelm the patient. In most people aren't out there running marathon. So it seems kind of silly to be so concerned about immunosuppression when a very small percentage of people are overtraining in that regard, right? Yes. Yeah, we don't have a public health concern about too many people exercising too much. It does happen. There is such a thing as exercise addiction and overdoing it in overtraining. So on, but that is a very small slice of the population. My second question is, you were talking about the shearing forces of increasing blood flow and not can kill these circulating tumor cells. There's a variety of ways you can increase blood flow through various forms of exercise. So for example, aerobic exercise, it's on a continuum, right? With the higher the intensity you go, the stronger the sort of push of blood flow, you know, cleaning out the system, resistance training. So lifting, lifting weights can also cause blood pressure changes and changes in blood flow. Do you think both of those types of exercise could affect that pathway or is it mostly the more higher intensity sort of aerobic Yeah, based on the mechanism, then anything that increases that blood flow should work. So some of the research that's been done has been more of a preclinical in vitro model. So there's researchers who developed these plastic tubes, rubber kind of tubes, and they can spin blood through these tubes faster or slower. And then they can put these circulating tumor cells in these, this sort of microfluidic system that they've developed and they can spin them around faster and slower. And they show that the faster you spin these around, consistent with what might happen during exercise, the more of these cells that die. So they've not looked at what's causing that increase in blood hemodynamic shear stress. So yeah, and theory both strength training and aerobic exercise should be able to do it. The one study that's been done in humans showing that exercise improves or reduces circulating tumor cells. Was in a aerobic exercise program, but in theory both should work. And if you do reduce the number of circulating tumor cells in your vascular system, is that associated with, is there data showing that, is associated with lower cancer recurrence, lower cancer mortality for example? That's right. So the way that cancer spread is these, it has to shed cells from the primary tumor and they have to circulate throughout the blood vessels and they have to get somewhere else. And so if you're preventing that or reducing that, you should be able to reduce the number of metastases. That's absolutely critical because that's what ultimately kills cancer patients. Right? So breast cancer, prostate cancer, you think of these cancers. The breast is not a vital organ. Women can live without a breast. So how do you die from breast cancer? prostate cancer, men can live without a prostate, how do you die from prostate cancer? It's because these tumors shed these cells and they disseminate throughout the system. And then they arrive at places like the brain, the lungs, the liver, and the bone. And they set up what we call sort of colony tumors there. And they begin to grow and invade those organs. And that's how you ultimately die from breast cancer. If it's localized, you're not going to die from breast cancer. And so preventing that spread is really the critical aspect. And so reducing the number of circulating tumor cells is critical. How long does cancer metastases take? And does that vary by tumor type? So if someone's diagnosed with, or let's say someone has stage one, they don't even know the abs. They would stage one breast cancer, prostate cancer, call the rectal cancer. What's the timeline typically like to get to the next stages? Yeah. And it varies dramatically by the types of cancer for sure. So sometimes we see very small tumors might shed cancer cells. So even though we find what we think is a small tumor, it may have already shed these cancer cells and they've already spread. Sometimes the tumor can be fairly large and not have disseminated any tumor cells yet. And the real challenge there is these tumors can disseminate these tumor cells. And metastases may not happen right away. Sometimes they sit dormant for years. So this is where someone with breast cancer may go in. We've got a primary tumor there. We cut it out. We don't know if any cells have disseminated but five years later, eight years later, ten years later, we detect a brain metastases. There's their lung metastases. So these cells can sit dormant for an extended period of time before they sort of start to regrow. And so metastases can be a very, very long process or it can be a fairly short process. Other cancers, these cells spread quickly and they grow quite rapidly at these other metastatic sites. Is there any type of tracking that can be done for tracking these types? I mean, is it, can you get a blood test and measure circulating tumor cells? Is that something that a test is sensitive enough to do? So that's the new area of hot research. So in the past, we could essentially only detect these cancers based on imaging. So these metastases would have to grow to a certain size, like one millimeter, two millimeters before they would show up on these scans. So small numbers of cancer cells we couldn't detect. And so you're waiting many, many years you know, doing a follow up scan five years later. And all of a sudden you see a spot on the lungs or a spot on the liver and say, okay, that could be cancer. So this whole idea of can we find them earlier through blood tests, what they're calling liquid biopsies. And this is an area of a lot of research now where they're trying to develop these blood tested detect, small numbers of circulating tumor cells, or small numbers of circulating tumor DNA. Because these cancer cells will grow divide undergo cell death as well and they'll shed some elements into the system. But this is very experimental. It's not being used in clinical practice right now, but there's a ton of research on these blood tests and liquid biopsies. So that would revolutionize cancer care if we can actually go in at the time, you know, do a surgery, remove the tumor, and then test a few weeks later to say are there any elements of circulating tumor cells still around giving us an indication, okay, well, maybe we need further treatments with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. So it would revolutionize the field, but it's not in clinical practice yet. Well, there are consumer available tests like rail that are available. These liquid biopsies tested are done. Do you think what are your thoughts on like someone that's healthy without like a family history or perhaps with a family history cancer doing a liquid biopsy like the grail test versus maybe like your situation that you're saying, which maybe it may be a little more applicable, where someone has had a cancer diagnosis has successfully, quote unquote, successfully on a gone treatment in that the primary tumor seems to have gone away by all means. And they go and do a grail test and perhaps maybe find something or don't find something or maybe monitor, maybe someone doesn't yearly annually, you know, I don't know. What are your thoughts on on those tests? It's probably too early for the science, so you're talking about using it on sort of the prevention side of thing or the early detection side of things as opposed to the treatment recurrent side of things, just reading a study today in colon cancer. They've got a blood test now out for colon cancer. They're comparing it to colonoscopy because that's the gold standard way we detect. And it is fairly effective. It was like 80% sensitivity in 90% specificity, but they still were not recommending that for the general population. But I think it's coming down the pipeline. I mean, if it is available privately and you want to get that test done, you know, you want to check with your doctor in terms of how to interpret it and make sure you're looking at things properly. But I think that technology is coming down the road and it may not be too many more years when the average person is getting a blood plus on the early detection side of things. On the cancer recurrent side of it, let's say someone wants to pay out of pocket and they're going to go do, I say grail because that's like the biggest probably most studied one that's out there for consumers. And let's say they find, oh, I have a positive test. I've got some tumor cell DNA that was detected and it's the same kind of cancer that I was previously diagnosed with. What would be the next steps with for someone? Do they go to the oncologist and then somehow verify? I mean, is there any way to verify if that's, you know, if the test, you know, is accurate or so on the post diagnosis, the recurrent side of things, it is being used in clinical practice to some extent. So their oncologists may already be recommending that. So I would check with your oncologist to see if that is something that's recommended. The whole advantage, the idea of this is we have to be careful that we're not overtreating cancer and of course we're not under treating cancer. So right now we overtreat a lot of patients because we're not sure if they have any remaining disease but we just want to be sure. And so they get all these treatments that they ultimately didn't end up needing. So one of the advantages of this testing on the post treatment side of things is if there is no evidence of any circulating tumor DNA, we can potentially de-escalate the treatments and say you don't need any further treatments right now. For the patient that test is positive, we probably do want additional treatments. If there's evidence that they're still small number of cancer cells around. So usually we'll recommend additional chemotherapy or immunotherapy depending on what the doctor's find. So yeah, check with your oncologist if that's already built into the clinical care or whether that's recommended. Well back to this exercise as insurance and the fact that a aerobic exercise in particular, anything that's really increasing blood flow does seem to really have an effect on these circulating tumor cells, then it would seem silly for someone who has been diagnosed, has been treated for cancer to not be just moving like their life dependent on it, right? Exercising is much as possible because it seems like that would be your best bet for reducing the cancer metastasis and ensuring that the circulating tumor cells do not go and take camp into another organ. Yeah, so again, we have a lot of research suggesting that it's still experimental, but I still think it is one of the few things the patients can do themselves, right? Everything else is done to them, done for them in terms of the chemotherapy, the surgery, and so on. So patients are looking for what sorts of things can I do myself? And exercise probably has the strongest evidence of additional potential benefit beyond sort of their current treatments. So yeah, and I think in some of these cancers, we are going to be able to show that there's absolutely benefits to improved outcomes for these patients. Are there? So you've done a lot of research on a variety of different types of cancer in conjunction with exercise and standard care treatment, prostate, breast, colorectal, on and on. So have you noticed that their different types of exercise affect these different types of cancers differently in terms of combined treatment? Yeah, there are some differences among the cancers. So even though we use the term cancer, like it's a singular disease, it's a collection over a over a hundred different diseases. And all the mutations that drive these cancers can be different. So not everything is going to be sensitive or receptive to an exercise intervention. But we see this with all treatments, right? Some cancers are chemo-sensitive, some are chemo-resistant, some are radio-sensitive, some are radio-resistant. We've even seen in immunotherapy that we make incredible gains with certain types of cancers. But in other cancers, immunotherapy doesn't seem to be effective at all. So we need to think this way about exercise. You know, exercise is not going to be a magic bullet for all these cancers. So it seems to help with certain cancers more so than others. And you know, when you think on the prevention side of things, there's strongest associations, seems to be with colon cancer. So those cells might be particularly sensitive. breast cancer has a strong association. We're some other cancers. We don't see much of an association like rectal cancer, prostate cancer, and stuff as well. So the different types of cancer, we might find cancers that are exercise resistant and cancers that are exercise sensitive depending on the types of mutations that are driving those cancers. But in addition to the types of cancers affecting the type and benefits of exercise, it's also really the treatments. What treatments the patients on might determine what type of exercise is best, what amount of exercise is best. And to give you one example, we've really found a really good fit between weight training and a treatment for prostate cancer called angergy and deprivation therapy. So men get diagnosed with prostate cancer. One of the main treatments is to eliminate their testosterone because testosterone fuels the growth of prostate cancer. So they give in these drugs which take them down to castrate levels of testosterone. That's fantastic for the prostate cancer, but it's not very good for the man in terms of health, strength, muscle weakness, and these types of things. So these guys who are on these angergy and deprivation therapies, we've done multiple studies with weight training. And that seems to be a really effective intervention for these guys to regain their strength, regain their muscle, and improvements and things like fatigue and energy. So again, depending on the types of treatment, certain types and amounts of exercise may be more beneficial. I wonder if it's interesting because compound lives and lifting heavy is probably one of the strongest lifestyle factors that can increase testosterone, actually. And wondering if it's having more of a local effect on muscle and not going to the prostate versus, I guess, other things that would increase testosterone. Yeah. So that was one of the concerns of the conditions when we first approach them about the patients. Oh, maybe exercise is going to increase the testosterone and help this prostate cancer grow. So a couple things, one, these drugs are so powerful. They take testosterone down to castrate, levels the small impact of exercise, the doctors are not worried that it's going to overwrite that. But also those effects you're talking about tend to be just acute effects. The chronic effect can be a little bit of a reduction in testosterone. But it is one of the explanations for why myding increase, say prostate cancer risks. Some of the studies are mixed on that. Well, if it's driving testosterone levels, but in the context of cancer treatment, it would be very, very small compared to what these powerful drugs do. Well, I'd love to kind of on the flip side of that talk about exercises as a monotherapy. So there's been some pretty recent large scale trials that you're involved in a race that prevent trial that are potentially going to be looking at exercise as a monotherapy in low grade early stage cancer. This is an area that really excites me. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about that. So as I mentioned, most cancers get treated with a combination of treatments that we give in different combinations and different sequences. So these patients are very heavily treated. When we think about exercises, a monotherapy, we think about exercise by itself. What's the effects of exercise by itself on cancer? So we've done the pre-clinical studies in mice. We can take these mice. We can inject small number of cancer cells or implant small cancer tumors. And we can randomly assign them to exercise versus no exercise, just like the drug researchers would do. Drug versus not. And we can show in those studies that exercise by itself independent of any other treatments tends to slow the growth and spread of these cancers. Most of the studies are showing that, not all, but most of the studies. So then you think of clinical scenarios. Well, if all these patients are getting treated, what's the relevance of that clinical scenario? But there's a new clinical scenario in cancer. And as I mentioned before, there's concern that some of these small low grade cancers maybe were overtreating them. Maybe were jumping in and treating these patients causing all sorts of side effects, not to mention the medical costs and so on. Maybe they don't need to be treated. And this whole approach to managing cancers is now called active surveillance. So these cancers are so small and so low grade slow growing that we're not going to jump in and treat these cancers with anything. It's being used mostly right now in prostate cancer. That's where they've pioneered this active surveillance. But it's starting to get attention even in other cancers about maybe maybe some of these cancers we don't need to jump in and treat right away. So now you've got these guys diagnosed with prostate cancer and they're not giving any treatments whatsoever. So this is allowed lifestyle researchers to kind of jump in and say, what's the role of lifestyle here? Can we help these guys out at all? So we've done a recent study looking at high intensity, the interval training and these men with prostate cancer who are on active surveillance, no other treatments. In addition to improvements in fitness and function and the types of things you might expect, we also showed that this high intensity exercise lowered prostate specific antigen levels, PSA levels. So this is how men are sometimes screen for prostate cancer. Looking at PSA levels can be an indication of how much cancer there is in the prostate. So we showed that this high intensity exercise lowered PSA levels. And then we also looked at these prostate cancer cells in a petri dish, just a in vitro model, where we exposed those prostate cancer cells to the serum of the men who exercise or the serum of the men who didn't exercise. And we showed that exposing them to the serum in the men who exercise reduced the growth of those prostate cancer cells, suggesting that there's something that exercise is doing. And we think it's the anti-inflammatory, the insulin IGF immune system affects that are slowing the growth of these prostate cancer cells. So this is a very exciting area, because many of these guys who are on active surveillance ultimately will require treatments. So if you can delay the need for treatments or prevent treatments, you can substantially improve their quality of life. So a very promising exercise intervention in that clinical setting. Why did you choose high intensity and level training as your exercise intervention type versus something perhaps more moderate intensity like jogging? Is there something about hit and vigorous exercise that you felt was maybe more beneficial for the prostate cancer? Or is it just easier to adopt that type of routine for people? I think it's the evidence suggesting that high intensity deactivate activates more of these biological changes. So I think of it kind of is stirring the biological soup, right? The body's got all these biological processes. And the more intense the exercise, more these biological changes get stirred up. So you're going to send more immune cells into the peripheral blood, more of the changes in insulin and IGF, more of the anti-inflammatory markers. So there seems to be a dose intensity effect on some of these biological changes. And because we're targeting biological changes as opposed to functional changes, we want to go with what we think is the optimal exercise prescription for really driving biological changes that might be relevant for cancer growth. So how do you guys, and maybe in this trial, or in generally speaking, take someone who's under active surveillance, maybe they have been sedentary. They're not someone that's really done structured exercise as a routine and help transform their fear because I'm sure it's scary to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as early or as you know, I would say, you know, low grade as it is, it's still probably a very scary, fearful process. Are there any sorts of programs structured programs that can help like having a coach or group classes, things like that that what what would help for someone in that situation, what did you guys use in the study? Yeah, so many of these guys are quite motivated to do something for themselves. So that's one of the big motivating factors, right? Waiting around just for treatments, or just getting the surveillance, which is, you know, regular PSA screenings and biopsies and those types of things. So many of these patients cancer diagnosis can be a bit of a wake-up call, it can be a bit of a teachable moment in the sense that, oh, you know, I am not immortal. Maybe I do need to take care of my health. So oftentimes it prompts patients to say, what can I be doing to try to improve my health? So some of it is just the experience of a chronic disease can be very scary and thinking about taking your health more seriously than you might have done when you're focused on the prevention side of things. So we motivate those guys by talking about the cancer specific benefits. As I say, if it's just improvements in fitness, just improvements in strength, yeah, these are the standard benefits that everybody gets, but what about me? And cancer patients are very concerned about their cancer. Once you're diagnosed with breast cancer or liver cancer or brain cancer, you become focused on what kind of diet should I eat for someone with brain cancer? What kind of exercise should I do with brain? You're not interested in general health benefits. So they want to know about these cancer specific benefits. And so we'll usually talk about those types of benefits to try and motivate them. Say, hey, this might actually help with your cancer. It might help with your treatments, getting through the treatments, recovering from treatments. And of course, we always work with them where they're at. We tell them, you know, we'll never ask you to do more exercise than you can do. We'll progress you slowly. We'll build you up to the prescription. One of the other key things for cancer patients is the opinion of the oncologist. The oncologist is absolutely crucial. You know, if the oncologist says that that patient should be exercising or think about exercising, they take that very seriously. So we've been able to get the oncologist on board or the urologist and say, hey, you're all just thinks, you know, with your prostate cancer that you should be exercising as well. So it's really building that team of support and motivating patients with the benefits that are going to be specific to them and their unique situation. With the oncologist and getting them on board, is that something, you know, you often do still hear, again, even oncologists will say, to take you easy to rest, especially if they're going to undergo, you know, they're not in active surveillance, but perhaps they're going to undergo a treatment like a chemotherapy treatment or radiation. And so how do you sort of change the, you know, the paradigm here and help perhaps a patient give the right information to their oncologists, like giving them studies or what, what, what can help sort of change the oncologist from a you should rest and take it easy or just a light walk around the neighborhood to, okay, we should do some high-intensity and overtraining classes to help with treatment. So the short, simple answer is evidence. So oncologists will recommend for patients things that are evidence based. And one of I think the real strength of the exercise oncology field is we've subjective exercise to the same rigorous research that they would subject their drugs to. So we do randomized controlled trials, which are sort of the gold standard research methodology, with large sample sizes showing these benefits for their patients. And then we publish them in the top cancer journals that the oncologist read. So that's what they're looking for is evidence, not that anecdotal stories about, hey, my uncle Fred did this and his cancer went away. They want to see these high-quality research studies. And so that's been building over the last couple of decades slowly at first, but now much more quickly, where the evidence is getting out there and most oncologists are now aware of it. In fact, two years ago, so it's only in 2022, two years ago, the American society of clinical oncology put out its first exercise guidelines. So this is cancer doctors. So it's one thing for exercise specialists to say, hey, cancer patients should exercise, but now we have the cancer doctors themselves, their professional organization, ASCO, the American Society of Clinical Oncology says, all cancer patients who are being treated with curative intent should be recommended aerobic and resistance exercise well they go through treatments. And those guidelines are adhered to very closely by oncologists. So they almost all of now will be aware of these new ASCO guidelines saying you need to be recommending and referring your patients to a good quality exercise program to help them get through treatments. Well, that's really good news to hear. I want to kind of circle back to something you mentioned earlier with respect to the benefits of exercise along with treatment and cancer patients on psychological health. And maybe you can talk a little bit about how important these benefits are compared to maybe some of the anti-cancer benefits or perhaps even, you know, you have one of the big takeaways from the erase trial was that exercise seemed to reduce the fear of progression and, you know, along with fear and that the stress, you get stress hormones and stress hormones really can help fuel tumour growth as well. So maybe you can sort of talk about the psychological benefits and sort of, are they uncoffled from the anti-cancer benefits? Yeah. So in one way it's one of the surprising, I think, findings in this literature when we talk to some of our patients, they will tell us that the psychological benefits are more important to them than even what it's doing to the cancer or some of these other outcomes because it can be very difficult to cope with cancer psychologically. As I mentioned, cancer patients will say, everything about cancer is not normal. And when they exercise, they start to feel like they have some control over the cancer and that their normal life. I'm out playing tennis or I'm out golfing. I feel like I'm normal again. So these psychological benefits can be things like improve self-confidence, improve self-esteem, certainly managing the anxiety associated with cancer. And you mentioned the finding related to fear of cancer progression or fear of cancer recurrence. This is a huge issue in cancer patients. You can imagine being diagnosed with cancer. You go through the different treatments at the end of the treatments. We tell the patient, there's no evidence of disease. We've done the scans. We've done the various other tests. We think it's gone. How will we know it's gone? Well, we're going to follow up every six months. And we're going to do these tests. And then we're going to tell you whether the cancer has come back. So we can't tell you definitively at the end of treatment that your cancer has gone. Go back to your normal life. We know these recurrences happen. And now you can imagine every six months the anxiety and stress of going in and getting these imaging tests and blood tests. And then meeting with your oncologist is going to say the cancer is back or it's not. And patients will tell you that finding out they've had a recurrence of the cancer is even more devastating than the initial diagnosis of the cancer. So this fear of cancer recurrence can paralyze these patients as they continually go through this surveillance. And at no point can we ever tell them that the cancer is definitively gone. And some cancers, there's recurrences 10, 15, 20 years later. So this is very stressful. So the impact we showed in this study of exercise helping them manage that fear of cancer progression or fear of cancer recurrence really important. Helping them get on with their daily lives. To say, I have to live my life with cancer in the background even though I have this psychological stress. So yeah, those psychological benefits, I think are really important for these patients in addition to some of the functional benefits and the disease related benefits and controlling the side effects. There's been some pretty large randomized controlled trials over the years and even meta-analysis of these randomized controlled trials comparing exercise, whether it is aerobic, a lot of times running or cycling, even resistance training has been thrown into the mix, comparing them to standard of care treatments for major depressive disorder, like SSRIs. And exercise as a treatment, it seems to work just as good if not better than a lot of these SSRI drugs are working for the treatment of depression, which is amazing because then you're going to get all the cardiovascular benefits that must be the benefits metabolic benefits, right? Like the endless benefits of exercise in addition to the mood benefits, right? So it's not that surprising to me that exercise would have a very positive effect on mental health of cancer patients, on reducing anxiety and fear because it's been shown in, you know, outside of the cancer context and other sorts of disease that are affecting the brain and mental health as well. And also, you mentioned something interesting you said that exercise seems to help cancer patients feel they have control of their lives, right? Because I could imagine a cancer diagnosis does feel like you lose complete control of your life. I mean, it's like it's very scary. And so I wonder also just if there's a almost a placebo effect, a placebo effect is a real biological phenomenon, as you know. I mean, changes in immune system, dopamine, a lot of things are happening when you have a positive outlook when you feel like you have control of something. And so you almost wonder if that spills over to the some of these psychological effects helping the anti-cancer effects as well. Like there's probably some crossover there. Yeah, I think that's definitely part of the explanation is some of these benefits. But as you know, there's good biological effects as well on depression, on neurotransmitters, these types of things. So there's a biological basis for some of these improvements in things like anxiety and depression. But some of these other improvements, things like self-esteem is just patients feeling better about themselves because they're doing something that they believe is helping themselves. So these are all important psychological changes. And the big difference, you know, we look at all those litatures outside of cancer related to depression and cognitive function and anxiety and so on. But in patients, you know, you're dealing with depression based on cancer diagnosis and depression based on treatments and stuff. So what we've been able to show is exercise helps with the anxiety, the depression and the stress associated with the cancer diagnosis and treatments and side effects that we weren't sure they were going to help with. So it really helps manage some of that psychological stress caused by the cancer and its treatments. Well, it sounds to me like the bottom line is, I mean, at every stage exercise is something that people need to absolutely focus on for cancer prevention for cancer treatment and continuing treatment. So, you know, not only is helping you get through the treatment, perhaps, you know, even having beneficial outcomes, you know, with reducing mortality risk, reducing cancer recurrence. But that psychological let's say you, okay, you get through the treatment, you've got rid of the cancer, okay, it's gone. And some people might think, okay, and there I'm done. But the reality is, then you do have to keep going back for these trainings, you do have to worry about a few of those tumor cells that escaped and maybe, you know, we're going to continue growing at this tumor side or somewhere else. And so having exercise as a part of your daily routine is going to make everything easier and it's going to improve the chances that you are not going to have cancer recurrence. So there's every reason to exercise and every, you know, there's every reason to be motivated to exercise. Yeah, we think about it. Exercise having benefits across the continuum of cancer care. So from the time of diagnosis and for the balance of life. So the initial diagnosis helping you prepare for treatments, once you start treatment, help you get through those treatments and complete those treatments. Afterwards, we're looking at recovery from those treatments. And then after treatments, when you're in what we call the survivorship phase, reducing the risk of recurrence, but also reducing the risk for other chronic diseases. So unfortunately, many of the treatments that cancer patients get increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Some of these drugs are cardiotoxic. Increase the risk of osteoporosis. They increase the risk of diabetes. So now you've kind of survived your cancer, but now you're trying to prevent some of the secondary diseases that might occur. So there's lots of good reasons to exercise right across the cancer trajectory. Before I, before I wanted to just a couple of rapid fire questions, is there anything that we didn't cover, perhaps that might be important to to discuss? I mean, the other way, I think about exercise in terms of its importance. When you look at what's currently being done for cancer patients, because a lot is being done. So there are offered a lot of other complementary therapies, art therapy, music therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, psychological counseling, stress management. And these are all having benefits on symptoms, side effects, quality of life, just like exercise. But none of those other interventions have shown any benefits for survival, any benefits for the disease itself or risk of recurrence. And then you look at the treatments we give for cancer, like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, all those interventions benefit the survival side of things, but they oftentimes undermine quality of life. They make symptoms inside effects worse. Exercise is one of these few interventions potentially for patients that can help both with quality of life, side effects symptoms, and also improve disease-free survival. So it's a real win-win compared to many of these other interventions that we offer cancer patients. Do you have any idea what percentage of people that are diagnosed with cancer actually do use exercise in conjunction with their treatment? Yeah, we've done a lot of those surveys. And what we show is just to give you the pattern of it, we ask many of these long-term survivors what they were doing before diagnosis, what they were doing during treatment, and what they were doing after treatment. And what all this research shows is that a cancer diagnosis in treatment has a very negative impact on exercise levels. All of these patients report doing dramatically less exercise during treatment than they were doing before diagnosis. After treatments in survivorship, exercise will tend to increase back, but not back to prediagnosis levels. So it's like the diagnosis in treatment of cancer is kind of having a permanent negative impact on exercise so what this tells me is that if we don't intervene, we're not helping patients exercise if oncologists and cancer centers aren't working with patients. The natural response of anyone diagnosed with cancer is to sort of give up exercise, get through these treatments and try and recover afterwards. So this is why interventions in support in cancer centers from the American Cancer Society are all very important. And when we ask during treatments in some of our studies, no more than 5 to 10 percent of patients were meeting the exercise guidelines during treatments. Pumps up to 30 to 40 percent after treatment. So again, there's some sort of recovery afterwards there, but there's still lower levels. When we compare cancer survivors with the general population, it's not much of a difference overall in terms of the physical activity levels. There's similar between the general population and cancer survivors, but of varies as you can imagine by cancer type cancer stage. So some cancers like breast and prostate and colon, the exercise levels are reasonable, but some of the more difficult cancers like brain cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, the exercise levels are much lower. And of course, with the stage for metastatic disease, again, we see that having a very negative impact on exercise levels. So there's lots of variation, but cancer in general in treatments in general will tend to have negative impact on patient-sex-or-size levels. And they need that support to be able to exercise right after diagnosis. Well, how do they get that support? And also, what about people that are sedentary before a diagnosis? Who aren't even used to working out or exercising? And then now they're facing a cancer diagnosis and they should be exercising. How do we get that those numbers up? Great question. And you're right. So the patients that we work through exercise before diagnosis, they believe in the benefits of exercise. They're aware of the benefits of exercise. It's not hard to convince them to try and exercise during treatment once you explain it to them. For patients who have never exercised, walking in as they're about to start chemotherapy and talk about exercise doesn't seem like a good time to start exercising when you've not been exercising all your life. So again, this is where the support of the oncology nurses and the whole cancer care team are really important to say exercise isn't an add-on. It's a critical part of your cancer care. It's really going to help you with these treatments. So some of it's just the education and the awareness of the role of exercising these newly diagnosed patients. And also letting them know we can start with something that's realistic and feasible for them. I mean, some of them are scared because they think exercise is lifting heavy weights and high intensity exercise and they're about to start chemo and letting them know that starting even with walking program can be very beneficial. And then we're seeing a big growth in community-based exercise programs for cancer survivors. We have Livestrong at the YMCA, which is a program being rolled out across the U.S. where you can go and work with an exercise special specifically working with cancer survivors. And many of these cancer centers have fantastic exercise programs. MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, Dana Farber and Boston. A lot of the top cancer treatment centers now have exercise specialists working right at the Cancer Treatment Center offering these programs to patients who are newly diagnosed. So there's a bunch of things that are going on to try and and help patients. You know, they're big concerning the U.S. is the coverage, you know, these be paid for by the health insurance companies. And many of these major cancer centers across the U.S. you see a lot of support from philanthropic dollars. So donors who believe in the importance of exercise say, hey, I want to fund an exercise program program because I see this is being really important for these patients. So we have to think about how we can fund it, how we can deliver it and make sure that all newly diagnosed cancer patients have access to these exercise programs. I don't know how the the cost of chemotherapy seems like it'd be much more than the cost of an exercise program. Obviously we're not talking about exercises of monotherapy for every cancer type and every diagnosis because some people are advanced, but it seems like a drop in the pool when you're comparing it to the cost of a lot of these treatments. These chemotherapy can be very expensive. These newer immunotherapies can be very expensive. And this is where if we can demonstrate exercise as a benefit for any of these cancer outcomes, it would be game changing. I remember a study we did where we showed that breast cancer patients who exercise during chemo had a lower risk of recurrence or dying from breast cancer eight years later. And I remember talking to the medical oncologist and says, if we can demonstrate in a larger study that exercise lowers the risk of recurrence, he said, that would change the game. He says, you know what it costs when a breast cancer patient has a recurrence? A million dollars. So that's the estimate that the health care system is going to be in for when someone has a recurrence of cancer with all the drugs and treatments and all the medical care that they're going to be entitled to receive. So you're right. Even if we can prevent a small number of recurrences, the the the the cost effectiveness of exercise is very high. Very recent study in in breast cancer, patient with metastatic cancer. Wonderful randomized control trial showing many of these benefits we talked about. Also did the cost effective analysis and showed this is a very cost effective intervention as well compared as you've pointed out to many of these other treatments that were offering patients. But so but these these these exercise treatments have been shown to lower recurrence. Is it just not a large enough study or more studies are needed to convince? So most of the stuff linking exercise to lower risk of recurrence has been observational studies, epidemiological studies. So these are always viewed with a healthy amount of skepticism by oncologists and by health insurance companies and stuff as well. Oh there's an association between exercise and these cancer outcomes. And some of the randomized control trials that have been done have been very small studies 50 patients, 60 patients. So we're in the process of conducting some of these larger randomized controlled trials that would be equivalent to a drug trial. You know if you were testing a new chemotherapy, a new immunotherapy, sometimes they're randomizing 500, a thousand or more patients. So some of those trials are going on right now in the exercise field and those will be viewed as the definitive trials one way or the other showing whether or not exercise can improve these cancer outcomes. I'm assuming that using biomarkers like reducing circulating tumor cells which would ultimately affect cancer recurrence is enough to convince. This is a big debate in the oncology field let alone the exercise on oncology field. Yeah we call these surrogate endpoints you know and are these going to be acceptable and there's a big debate whether or not you know drugs should be approved based on some of these intermediate or surrogate endpoints. So of course as exercise oncology researchers we just follow along what is acceptable within the what would it take to get a drug approved would be the similar outcomes we look at. So in some of these ongoing trials we're looking at disease free survival which is a well accepted endpoint. We're looking at pathologic complete response to the intervention which is another accepted one whether or not circulating tumor cells or circulating tumor DNA might become an accepted endpoint demonstrating a clinical benefit. We'll see where where that goes. Well the good news is is that there are many ways to exercise that are free then you can do at home you can do in your neighborhood at a park right so yeah it is it is nice to have that support of a group class and it's certainly very beneficial to have a coach class I think but at the end of the day if you are if you're looking at you know affecting your mortality your recurrence your mental health your all all the things that you discussed then you know someone's going to be motivated to go go out and do it. So okay so I have a few rapid fire questions I would say if you if there were only one sentence you could permanently tattoo onto every patient's mind about exercise what would it be. Don't take kids or lying down that's what we started with that would be the the take home message with patients. It's a great one what what's a myth about exercise or cancer that drives you crazy. Okay you might not like this myth but the myth is that exercise improves everything exercise makes everything better improves all outcomes. We've seen in the exercise on college field we didn't get a chance to discuss that but there's a few pre-clinical animal models showing that exercise makes some tumors grow more quickly. So it's not this panacea for every single tumor in general that slows the growth in spread but we've seen a few publications showing the mice that exercise the tumors grow more quickly. We've also seen a few studies including a couple of my own showing exercise exacerbating symptoms in cancer so in one of our studies in rectal cancer patients that looks like the exercise intervention made skin irritation from radiation worse. Exercise making skin irritation worse. It looks like it made diarrhea worse in these patients and foot syndrome which is sort of a peeling and tenderness in the feet in hands you can imagine walking on a treadmill or lifting weights. And in a couple studies it's shown it's made fatigue worse. So there are these you know we have to be very careful about exercise will benefit everything cure everything and make everything better and all end off there is one cancer we talked about prevention that exercise increases the risk of cancer and I suspect you can probably guess it. Which one? Skin cancer. Oh because you're outside. Yeah not very compelling. The next exercise is doing a sun exposure. Correct. So that's bit misleading. So well well it's misleading one sense yeah but patients who regularly exercise have higher rates of skin cancer than non-exercizers. It's due to this exposure so the American Cancer Society is always reminding where the you know the sunscreen and stuff when you grow and cover up during exercise as well because you are potentially putting yourself at at higher risk of skin cancer. So we just have to careful about making sure we're giving good evidence on what the benefits are for patients and understanding some of the harms and we don't necessarily track all the harms of exercise in these studies but we now are doing that what are some of the adverse events what are some of the issues that might be caused by exercise. Having said that the benefits of exercise far outweigh the harms of exercise but so we don't have to sort of put the harms under the rug you know to make the case for exercise we want to track those we want to make sure they're clear but what we demonstrated in cancer is the same thing the benefits of exercise for these patients far outweigh any risks to harms and we do have to be careful about exacerbating symptoms making sure patients are exercising within their own capacity. The other thing I forgot to mention is the risk with bone metastasis that's a big concern in the exercise field so one of the most popular places for cancer to spread is to the bone and these bones can become a bit more brittle so the risk of fracture in patients with metastatic bone disease and again we just have to work around that with the exercise prescription but that's a risk we have to be aware of. With the animal the preclinical animal models what types of tumors were exacerbated by exercise. That's a great question and the problem is we haven't sorted that out so there's no sort of pattern yet to be a okay it's exacerbating you know pancreatic cells but not liver cancer cells or that it's the high intensity exercise making things worse or versus low intensity or when we look at the cancer with this type of mutations or if we do four-stexercise versus voluntary exercise so people looked at all that to try and sort out these sites it's about 10% of the study so the majority show exercise slows the growth in spread about 10% are showing this tumors growing more quickly but there's no pattern to it that we can say ah we think this is what's what's driving it. So it's not like they're being the the animals are being injected with a certain type of tumor exactly. It'd be traced to that type of tumor maybe it's the background of the mice. Exactly. That's right. All those factors are kind of being looked at but there's no pattern yet that would suggest it so it's just something to be aware of as we as we do these types of studies. Okay um next question have you ever encountered a case where effortful training didn't help and what did you learn I think you just answered. Yeah exactly so that's I think one of the key things is this exacerbation of symptoms we have to work around the side effects and the symptoms that patients are experiencing to make sure the exercise is safe and tolerable for them. So you know if patients are experiencing peripheral neuropathy some patients experience issues with a taxi, a balance and stuff as well so you know we're putting patients on treadmills we have to be careful that they're going to be able to do that type of exercise and then side effects like like I say like diarrhea skin irritation you know we get into cancers like rectal cancer and anal cancer that whole area down there gets radiated they get radiation burns and movements with clothing and stuff can can be patients can get dry mouth and stuff from from exercise and it can lead to increases in diarrhea and stuff as well so we're just working with the patients with other symptoms or experiencing and making sure that we're not exacerbating those symptoms. Yeah sweat I mean if you're sweating a lot you can also exacerbate skin problems I do think at the end of the day like is there a trade off like is this skin irritation or the little bit of diarrhea the price you pay for like even more you know positive benefits and so that's also probably something you consider as well and discuss with the patient where it's like you don't want them to necessarily stop the treatment because they're have a little skin irritation but you know it's again it's I mean I mean I guess it's my mentality of thinking too I'm very much like I'll handle like some suffering if it's going to have a net positive effect. That's right yeah. What's one habit or purchase under $50 that can help patients stay active at home during tough treatment phases? I guess probably one of these activity trackers or fitness trackers might be very helpful and there's a lot of research right now trying to develop mobile apps for exercise and cancer survivors one of my own PhD students looking at a mobile app and seeing whether mon it might be helpful for breast cancer survivors so we'll see I think some of these technological things that might be available to help cancer survivors get a regular exercise. If someone only has 15 minutes a day what's the single best use of that time to fight cancer if it's exercise then what type? I'd probably go with the strength training and probably go you know with some of the heavier lifting strength training the squats and the compound exercise you've talked about you know I think what we're seeing is this idea of lean muscle mass skeletal muscle mass being extremely important for getting through these treatments predicting recurrence, predicting survival, strong associations with physical functioning and quality of life so I think targeting the muscle mass if you've only got 15 minutes that's probably how it's been my time. Nice I do cross-fit training and you know it's an hour-long session I'll do and there's a lot of strength training at the beginning progressively working up you know heavier weights and different types of compound lifts but typically at the end of the workout it'll be like a 15 or 20 minute workout and it incorporates you know these what you're basically saying you know squats or dead lifts or these types of strength training and resistance training exercises that do increase heart rate that improving muscle mass improving strength improving function but then it incorporates like some rolling or biking along with it so you're getting like a high intensity and a total training workout that's including resistance training spray dynamic and I think it's very time efficient and I think it's wonderful a wonderful type of training plus you can get a group go to group cross-fit classes and have that like group setting as well we are getting that reinforcement from other people when coaches there so well thank you so much carry for all of the research that you're doing very very important research and for anyone that's wanting to continue to read some of your publications they can obviously look you up on PubMed but also you've got a faculty page at the University of Alberta Canada people can go to that faculty page and find your your faculty page there to look up some of your research as well yeah and the American Cancer Society is a great resource as well they've got a lot of information on exercise for patients and survivors well thank you so much for joining me today really enjoy this conversation and appreciate everything that you do my pleasure thank you for having me a big thank you to Dr. Kerry Kerney first of all for doing this important research and for taking the time to meet me in person to have this discussion to share with the wider public if you're a healthy person looking for a science back way to structure your training we've put together a free guide that distills insights from nearly a hundred conversations I've had with top experts in exercise physiology and human performance it covers everything from resistance training for muscle growth to strength training to interval training for VO2 max as well as key factors like protein timing and creating supplementation all in a clear actionable format you can start applying these protocols now by downloading this free guide by heading over to how to train guide.com once again that's how to train guide.com and if you're enjoying the podcast and finding it valuable please subscribe to our YouTube channel it really helps us out if you have any questions any feedback comments ideas for future episodes leave a comment there we do look over them you can also subscribe on apple and Spotify if you're on apple you have an option to leave up to a five star review which definitely could help in our discoverability for the podcast and if you like to support the show directly check out my premium membership you'll get access to a special podcast feed a monthly ask me anything and a buy monthly science digest it's the best way to support the podcast and get even more in depth content thank you so much for listening and I'll talk to you soon

If a person's magnesium intake is adequate, this can enhance the body's ability to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. On the other hand, if magnesium intake is low, like 45% or half the population roughly of the US, that may hinder the body's ability to utilize vitamin D effectively, even if vitamin D intake is sufficient. I would say a really important takeaway from this section is magnesium 3 and 8 is not the best option for meeting daily magnesium needs. It shouldn't be included as contributing to your recommended daily allowance of magnesium. That is because magnesium 3 and 8 contains a very low amount of elemental magnesium. So if you are considering supplementing with magnesium 3 and 8 for its potential brain health benefits, which I would say have not been established, do not count that magnesium dose towards your RDA goal. Welcome to the found my fitness podcast, I'm your host Rhonda Patrick. There is a lever you can pull every day to significantly enhance your body's ability to repair damage to your DNA, potentially reducing cancer risk in a dose dependent manner. This is the power of magnesium, a mineral that plays a foundational role in our health, yet is often overlooked. The stakes of magnesium deficiency are high affecting crucial biological processes like DNA repair, replication and transcription. When these processes are compromised due to insufficient magnesium, it can lead to development of potentially cancer causing mutations. More alarmingly, recent studies indicate a potential link between insufficient magnesium levels and accelerated brain volume loss, which could hasten the onset of dementia as we age. I'm here to unpack the science behind magnesium. Often termed as the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency, and its profound implications for nearly 45% of the US population who was falling short. Nearly half of the population in the United States doesn't get enough magnesium, primarily because our diets lack sufficient dark leafy greens, where magnesium is abundantly found hidden within the core field that gives plants their vibrant green color. That means that roughly half of you watching are listening to this episode right now have inadequate magnesium intake. In the landscape of essential nutrients, magnesium is a giant. It's part of a triad of micronutrients that when deficient have far reaching impacts on our health. Let's dive deep into the reasons that make magnesium a key player in maintaining our well-being, and how boosting your intake could be a critical step towards optimal health. Magnesium is a co-factor for about 300 different enzymes in our bodies, which are special proteins that perform functions. Magnesium is required for these enzymes to work properly, so to put that into perspective, our bodies have around 75,000 types of enzymes. So the enzymes that need magnesium make up about 0.4% of all the enzymes in our body. This shows that while magnesium's role is specific, it's crucial for a wide range of bodily functions, which are we are going to discuss today. Adult women generally need about 310 to 320 milligrams a day, which increases to about 360 milligrams a day during pregnancy. Adult men require about 400 to 420 milligrams a day, and athletes and those that have high physical activity, including people that are also regular sauna users, may need additionally about 10 to 20% above the recommended dietary allowance due to their greater magnesium loss through urine and sweat. There's data from nutritional surveys like N-Hanes revealing that the average intake of magnesium in the US falls below the RDA, so the typical intake for women is around 230 milligrams per day. Well, men consume about 320 milligrams per day, so this deficit is more pronounced in female athletes who are at a higher risk of magnesium deficiency. Such deficiency can potentially lead to serious health issues, including aridmias like atrial fibrillation, as well as muscle spasms and other complications. What makes the situation worse is that the RDA value is based on the absolute minimum amount necessary in order to prevent severe diseases associated with magnesium deficiency. So even if you're meeting that 300 to 400 milligrams per day threshold, you are still only running at the bare minimum necessary function. Magnesium plays a really important role in maintaining healthy electrolyte balance and preventing dehydration. It helps regulate the body's balance of electrolytes which are pretty important for conducting nerve impulses, contracting muscles, also maintaining a healthy heart rhythm. So when the body is deficient in magnesium, it can disrupt this balance and that can potentially lead to dehydration and other related complications. So this aspect of magnesium's role is particularly important for athletes and those, again, with high physical activity as they're more susceptible to these electrolyte imbalances due to increased sweat and fluid loss. Good dietary sources of magnesium include dark leafy greens, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, brown rice and fish like macarole. The net absorption of magnesium in the diet is only about 50%. It's even lower with high fiber diets, but most of the studies that have found this are studies where they feed people super high amounts of fiber, which most people aren't getting, even when they have a high plant rich diet. The big reason for poor magnesium biobalability in plant sources is because magnesium is bound to fitate in plants. And there are ways to increase bio-ebellability of magnesium from plants and that is by activating fitauses. These are enzymes that break down fitate. So for example, if you heat up oats or you cook your leafy greens or legumes or you germinate or you sprout your grains and seeds, all of these things decrease fitate levels. Because they activate those enzymes that are called fitauses. So as it turns out both weed and yeast also have strong fitauses activity during the baking process. So there are ways that again, you know, we just heat itself, but also germination and sprouting and heating up oats, cooking leafy greens. These are always that we increase magnesium bio-ebellability from plant sources because of the activation of the fitauses. The other really important factor that can limit the bio-ebellability of magnesium is excessive supplemental zinc at doses higher than 124 milligrams a day, which is quite high that's well above the RDA and people should not be taking that much zinc on a daily basis, because it can also inhibit the absorption of other trace elements, for example copper. There is an exception, so the exception of people doing a little bit of a mega sort of a higher dose of zinc would be during illness or the onset of illness where higher zinc dose supplementation, like in the order of for example 80 milligrams a day, has been shown to lessen respiratory illness symptoms and to crease duration of illness as well. So I would say that you know, taking high high doses of zinc on a very short term basis where it's just a couple of days is different than you know someone who's daily supplementing with a high dose of zinc because it can inhibit magnesium absorption. Diet composition is the main reason magnesium, insufficientcy and deficiency are so common. The typical standard American diet is high in calories. It's low in micronutrients, including magnesium. So eating a calorically dense meal full of processed foods meets dairy products. These are pore sources of magnesium. In contrast, green vegetables like dark leafy greens are rich in magnesium because of their chlorophyll content. And magnesium is at the center of chlorophyll molecule. Another reason is biobeleability, which we just discussed. Magnesium is only so biobeleable from certain foods like the plant sources and so ways of increasing their biobeleability like heating up greens or sprouting in germination like we discussed also improves magnesium biobeleability. But the last reason that magnesium, insufficientcy and deficiency are common is because there's certain health conditions and lifestyle choices that can lead to increased magnesium excretion. For example, diabetes leads to this as well as alcohol consumption. So alcohol can increase the rate. I watched the body excretes magnesium, despite normal absorption rates in the gut. Because it acts like a dioritic. So it leads to increase your in production and then loss is of magnesium through urine. So this dioritic effect contributes to a higher rate of magnesium being filtered out by the kidneys in expelled and urine rather than being absorbed in use in the body. I think the logical question is, how do you know if you're getting enough magnesium? Well, naturally one would think a blood test might help shed some light. But unfortunately, most of the time it does not and the reason for this is because magnesium levels are assessed in plasma. And I'm going to take a moment to explain this because I think it's important. So the average person has slightly less than one ounce of magnesium in their body, roughly 60% of all the magnesium is found in the skeleton. So most of our magnesium is found in our bones. About 27% is found in the muscle and 6% to 7% is found in other cells. Less than 1% is found outside of our cells. About one third of the magnesium in the bones is exchangeable. In other words, it serves the bones are serving as a reservoir so that the body can draw from it in times of need. So when magnesium levels are low, the body will draw from the bones to get that magnesium because it's so, so important. So most of the time magnesium will be pulled from the bones into plasma to maintain optimal levels. The body regulates plasma magnesium concentrations with an a very narrow range, typically around 0.7 to 1 mm or per liter. If plasma magnesium levels drop low this range, it could lead to hypomegnesmia, which is, you know, can cause all sorts of problems, muscle, weakness, tremors, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, and other potentially serious complications. So our body will just continue to pull from our bones to prevent magnesium levels from going below 0.7 mm per liter. For this reason, plasma magnesium is not a good indicator of magnesium status for most healthy adults. Similarly, a red blood cell magnesium test, which measures magnesium inside red blood cells. While it might provide a better indication of magnesium status than plasma levels, it still may not fully represent total body magnesium content. So both tests are more likely to identify, I would say, more severe magnesium deficiency, rather than a mild or moderate deficiency, or something that we would call magnesium insufficiency. So really to ensure adequate magnesium intake, the most practical approach is to track and calculate the magnesium content in your diet. This involves being a little more mindful of the magnesium rich foods you consume, such as green vegetables, likely if you greens, nuts, seeds, grains, fish. The USDA's food data central is a good resource for estimating the micronutrient and macronutrient content in various foods. So that would include magnesium. It's still, I personally think it's still a good idea to get a plasma or a red blood cell magnesium test just to rule out severe deficiency, but not to use it as a guide of whether or not you have optimum levels of magnesium or you have sufficient magnesium levels. It's really just to rule out severe deficiency. So naturally the next question on people's minds are what about magnesium supplements, where do they fit in, what if I don't get enough magnesium from dietary sources, can I supplement? So let's start with supplemental magnesium doses. So how much is too much? The U.S. Institute of Medicine's food and nutrition board has set the upper safe limit for daily supplemental magnesium intake at 350 milligrams per day. So this is the level considered that it's unlikely to cause diarrhea or gastrointestinal issues for most people. Diarrhea is the first sign of excessive magnesium supplementation. It's often used there, beautifully as a laxative, but this is a bit of a conservative dose. It does not include magnesium from dietary sources. So in other words, there's no evidence that going above the RDA for four magnesium is harmful. In fact, some evidence suggests that it may even be beneficial, particularly if the magnesium is mostly coming from dietary sources. For optimal bioavailability of magnesium supplements, it's also generally more effective to take the total daily dose in divided smaller amounts, rather than a single large dose. So this approach allows for more efficient absorption by the body. It can also minimize the potential GI discomfort. So smaller spaced out doses, their process better by the digestive system, and this also ensures maximum absorption utilization of the magnesium. The bioavailability of different magnesium supplements does vary. And it's not fully standardized in studies. Clinical research on organic magnesium salts. So these include magnesium citrate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium tarate. These indicate magnesium malay is also in there. These organic salt forms of magnesium are generally more bioavailable and effectively raise plasma magnesium levels compared to inorganic forms of magnesium, like magnesium oxide. Magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate. So organic magnesium salts are better absorbed in the digestive tract. It can lead to more significant increase in magnesium levels in the blood. And I think this for this reason, it makes them more effective choices for supplementing magnesium. And also, of course, addressing deficiencies, but just to eliminate any confusion. The term organic in this context refers to the presence of carbon being in the acid molecule. So we're not talking about agricultural standard of being organically grown here. It's a different term. Magnesium sulfate can be taken early, but in this is an inorganic form, but it's often more commonly used as absincel for a trans-dermal through the skin applications. When it's taken early, it can act as a laxative. And it's used there, particularly as a laxative. The effectiveness of absincel, particularly in baths is unclear. We'll talk about this a little bit later, because the trans-dermal absorption of magnesium through absincel baths really hasn't been conclusively proven. But let's talk about another form of magnesium called magnesium 3 and 8. Magnesium 3 and 8 is a form of magnesium that has garnered a lot of attention because of its potential impact on brain function. So generally, only a small portion of the magnesium ingested in a supplement form reaches the brain. And this is due to the intricate active transport symptoms that control the progression of magnesium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream and then subsequently from the bloodstream across the blood-brain barrier. The body establishes and manages a very tight concentration gradient. It creates a higher magnesium level in the blood compared to the cerebral spinal fluid. And that allows a very controlled quantity of magnesium that can actually get transported into the brain. This precise regulation is really important to maintaining this equilibrium of magnesium necessary for optimal brain function. So in humans, it's been found that even an increase up to 300% in blood magnesium results in less than 19% change in this cerebral spinal fluid magnesium content. And I think this really highlights the significant role that physiological processes in maintaining magnesium balance play, which then influence the brain health and function. So some animal evidence suggests that magnesium 3 and 8 can easily get across the blood-brain barrier. And at a human equivalent dose of 8.1 milligrams per kilogram body weight. So that would be around 662 milligrams for a 180 pound person can improve cognition and decrease amolid beta plaques. Now this is in the brains of mice. And it's thought that the magnesium 3 and 8 is uniquely effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier due to its specific molecular structure. So this form of magnesium is keylated to theronic acid and that is a metabolite of vitamin C. So this relation enhances its ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier or so it's thought. The precise mechanism by which magnesium 3 and 8 bypasses this tightly regulated concentration gradient between the blood and the brain is not fully understood. It is believed though that its molecular structure does somehow facilitate easier entry into the brain thereby increasing concentration of magnesium in the brain more effectively than other forms of magnesium. That is solely based on a very small and limited number of animal studies. When we turn to human studies only a couple have explored the effects of magnesium 3 and 8. So these studies are, I want to point out, industry funded which does invite us to consider a potential conflict of interest. So the initial study that I think garnered a lot of attention was published in 2016. It was a small scale study that only had 44 participants total. Those in the treatment group took daily doses of about 1500 to 2000 milligrams of magnesium 3 and 8. So this is marketed as magteen and they took it for over 12 weeks based on their body weight. That's why there's a range in dose. The findings of this study I personally think are underwhelming. So the treatment group only achieved a marginal increase in plasma magnesium levels with no elevation noted in red blood cell magnesium levels compared to the placebo group. Additionally, there was a significant increase in urinary magnesium which suggests that most of the supplemented magnesium 3 and 8 was actually being excreted through urine. There was some cognitive tests that were also done. There was no significant difference observed when each of these four different measured cognitive tests were looked at in isolation compared to the placebo group. But if the data was all pulled together, so all four cognitive tests were then pulled together, then there was a statistically significant difference in cognitive function compared to the placebo group. So this suggests a degree of statistical uncertainty in the study's conclusions whether or not it was just due to a small sample size. I said there's only 44 people in this study. Perhaps if there were 444 people there would have been more of a stronger signal and the data wouldn't have had to have been pulled together. Or maybe there really isn't much of an effect. There's no talent. Second study was also industry funded which I think is important to keep in mind. This study was published in 2022 and it involved 100 participants and the treatment group was given 400 milligrams of magnesium 3 and a along with vitamins C, D, B, 6 and phosphatital searing. In contrast, the placebo group received only 2 grams of a starch capsule. So despite the absence of any elevation of serum or brain magnesium levels, the treatment group did have improved cognitive test performance compared to the placebo group. I would say this study raises pretty significant questions around causations because the treatment group was not just given magnesium 3 and a they were given a variety of vitamins. They were given vitamin C, the B vitamins, vitamin D, B6. But they were also given phosphatital searing. So I think to be able to establish a solid conclusion that magnesium 3 and a is responsible for improving cognitive function. The placebo group should have gotten all those other vitamins and the phosphatital searing, but not the magnesium 3 and a. However, that was not the way the study was done. In my opinion, I think it's an interesting study, but really no conclusions can be stated directly about magnesium 3 and a. itself. So I think a concluding statement with respect to supplemental magnesium. There's a few concluding statements. One, two, enhanced bio-bailability. It's advisable to take smaller frequent doses of magnesium supplements. Organic magnesium salts like magnesium glyceoneate or magnesium tarate are generally more readily absorbed than inorganic forms like magnesium oxide. I also think there's some added benefits of these organic salts. For example, taking magnesium glyceoneate also gives you some accompanying compounds like glyceone. So glyceone could potentially be beneficial, at least according to some studies. Also, magnesium tarate would give you tarine, which also may have some health advantages. That's the subject of another podcast. There is some caution that should be taken without not wanting to exceed super super high doses of magnesium. So 350 milligrams per day is the safe upper limit and that is for either organic or inorganic magnesium supplements. If you go above that, you may get GI side effects. So that's something to keep in mind. I would say a really important takeaway from this section is magnesium 3 and 8 is not the best option for meeting daily magnesium needs. As outlined by the RDA, it shouldn't be included as contributing to your recommended daily allowance of magnesium. And that is because magnesium 3 and 8 contains a very low amount of elemental magnesium. So if you are considering supplementing with magnesium 3 and 8 for its potential brain health benefits, which I would say have not been established, do not count that magnesium dose towards your RDA goal. So to ensure you're getting enough magnesium, you need to calculate what you're getting from your foods, but also consider supplementing with other organic magnesium forms like magnesium glyceoneate, which does have a higher amount of elemental magnesium content. As you can tell, there are many different forms of magnesium available. And natural question is what do I take? The answer is I hedge my bets. I take a supplement that has many different forms of magnesium salts, which seems logical to me. There are not many products I have found that offer that. One of them is magnesium by moon juice. The other one I sometimes take at night is magnesium glyceoneate by pure encapsulations. There are many different brands. I'm not affiliated with either of those, but I know many of you want to know what I take, so there you have it. The other area I want to kind of dive into and I find very interesting with respect to where magnesium plays a role in physiology is the stress response. So the stress response that your body experiences involves the production of hormones, stress hormones like adrenaline, cortisol. Those stress hormones can potentially lead to a reduction or depletion of magnesium levels in the body. So these hormones are released during times of stress. And then subsequently your body uses up more magnesium to try to help manage the stress reactions. So what ends up happening is this can reduce overall amounts of magnesium available for other functions of the body. So to better understand how stress hormones like adrenaline can lead to magnesium deficiency or lower magnesium levels and its clinical implications, there was a study by white at all that looked at how adrenaline, which is a well known stress hormone, effects from magnesium levels. And what they found, I personally thought was an interesting study. They found when adrenaline was infused into people. It didn't just temporarily lower magnesium levels. These levels stayed significantly reduced even an hour after stopping the adrenaline infusion. Without showing any immediate signs of bouncing back. So in other words, the adrenaline immediately lowered magnesium levels and those levels stayed low for quite some time. There have been a range of studies that have found that stress exposure, things that are stressful and are known to increase cortisol, adrenaline can influence magnesium levels both in blood and urine. So for example, young adults undergoing persistent or even intermittent stress like, for example, anticipating a military conflict. They experience substantial decreases in their overall and plasma magnesium concentrations over three months. And there is similar results or outcomes found when the impact of short term. So this is a one day and also a long term, which would be like a month of sleep deprivation on magnesium levels was examined. So this was done in healthy men and both short term and long term sleep deprivation caused reduction in magnesium red blood cells. So the magnesium levels in red blood cells with the long term sleep deprivation having the most robust impact. Another study found in increase in anxiety levels and a corresponding rise in urinary magnesium excretion in university students during exam time. So that would indicate if you're excreting more magnesium in your urine that you are not absorbing it and using it in your body. In another related study, this was done over the course of four weeks. This was post exams. Researchers found a significant reduction in the concentration of magnesium in red blood cells among college students. Yet again sort of solidifying how the stress response will lower magnesium levels. So yet another study confirmed this. This was done in in people that were impacted by noise exposure. They've been subjected to noise exposure and their magnesium levels of course went down after the noise exposure and their urinary excretion peak after a few hours and it continued for up to two days. So it seemed like there was some sort of long term effect with respect to excreting more magnesium through urine, which is something I mentioned that alcohol also does. Just from that stress response from the very loud noise exposure. It's interesting how our body magnesium levels respond not only to mental stress but also physical stress like exercise. So acute or short term stress can lead to a brief spike in our blood that magnesium levels. This is a phenomenon known as transient hyper-magnesmia. This has been observed in the aftermath of like short and tense exercise sessions lasting around 20 minutes. After pushing your body hard it appears it rallies the magnesium resources probably to aid in the energy production, you know, and other vital functions. But when you start to engage in a more prolonged let's say one hour session that initial elevation in magnesium is not found. And it seems like there's a threshold after which your body does not respond in that way. And magnesium levels then have been noted to go below what your baseline resting levels are. So exercise does deplete magnesium. But let's talk briefly about why mental and physical stress can decrease magnesium. So the body's neuroendocrine system response to stress through a process that many will recognize as the fight or flight response. So this is primarily activated by the adrenal glands. The hormones adrenaline and cortisol rapidly increase during this response. The responsible for preparing the body for that for action. Now part of this preparation involves the mobilization of magnesium which is a crucial co-factor for enzymes that drive energy production and utilization in the form of ATP. So during this stress response the body rapidly pulls magnesium from the cells causes a temporary surge in Syrian magnesium levels. But the catches this mobilization of magnesium is not an infinite resource. So as the stress continues it's extracting magnesium and then and then expelling it through the body through your nation, which then gradually deplete our overall body store of magnesium. And then there's the role of cortisol which is often considered the body's primary stress hormone. So when cortisol levels rise it signals to the kidneys that they need to kick into turbo mode and start expelling more magnesium out of the body. This action further reduces our body's total magnesium supply. And then on top of all this stress also triggers certain hormones that can affect the balancing act of magnesium and our body, especially in in in organs like the gut, kidneys and the bones. So these hormones can result in less magnesium getting absorbed in the intestines, more getting expelled from the kidneys as I just mentioned, leading to this downward spiral in magnesium levels if we don't replenish it properly. Let's move on to another area that is gained popularity, the role of magnesium and sleep. So the role of magnesium and sleep has recently become a topic of interest. We know that sleep deprivation can deplete magnesium levels, but does this create a cycle affecting sleep quality. Observational studies have shown that adults with higher dietary magnesium intake often report better sleep quality. However this could be the healthiest use of the virus, right? People with higher magnesium intake might also have other healthy habits contributing to good sleep. Now when we look at randomized controlled trials, the picture gets more complex. A meta analysis of some trials suggest that magnesium supplementation can improve some sleep metrics, including scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and also can improve sleep efficiency and duration. Yet the results across different studies are very, very mixed. There's quite a few studies out there showing that magnesium supplementation has no effect on sleep. So it really highlights the need for more research in this field. I'm not going to say that magnesium supplementation will not improve sleep, but I will say there is not strong evidence that magnesium supplementation will improve sleep. I do think this, I have to go on a little bit of tangent here because randomized controlled trials in this field of nutrition are very different than the gold standard of randomized controlled trials that are used with pharmaceutical drugs. So we know that 45% of the population has insufficient magnesium intake. So 55% have sufficient levels of magnesium. So when you're starting a clinical trial in nutrition with something like magnesium, half the population in that trial are going to need that magnesium supplement. And the other half really aren't because they've already got sufficient magnesium intake. This is very different from a drug trial. Everyone at the start of a drug trial has the same amount of drug in their system, which is zero. So you either give the person the drug or a placebo, and it's very clear that if there is an effect that it's because of the drug, and that if there is not an effect, it's because the drug did not have an effect. But in the case of magnesium, if you are not identifying who is deficient or has insufficient magnesium at the start of the trial, then you're not going to know whether or not giving them a supplement really is important. They're going to make any difference because they might already have sufficient magnesium. So I think this really illustrates why it's so important for nutritional randomized controlled trials to account and to measure or at least at the very least, look at dietary intake and magnesium and figure out who at the start of this trial is deficient in this nutrient that we're investigating. Let's start with that population because essentially what you're looking at is giving something, you're trying to avoid deficiency, right? And that's the real important thing here to avoid deficiency. So with that said, when I say there's a lot of mixed results in these randomized controlled trials, with respect to magnesium and sleep, or with respect to magnesium and fill in the blank effect, right? Whatever outcome we are looking at, I think it is very important for people to keep in mind, particularly people that are doing clinical trials in the medical field that have this mentality that randomized controlled trials at the gold standard, because they are coming from this pharmaceutical background. Keep in mind that nutrition is different because we all have different starting levels of nutrients. And it is very, very important to measure these nutrients or in some way figure out at the start of the trial, if our starting population is low in that nutrient. If they're not, then that's another question that would be is supplementing, you know, super levels going to do anything, right? That's a completely different question than avoiding deficiency. All right, so sorry for that tangent, but I do think it's very important because until we address these trial flaws, these fundamental, methodological oversights, we're going to continue to have conflicting data in the field of nutrition. So I think we need to improve study designs, we need to consider individual nutritional baseline, you know, and until we do that, we're going to continue facing confusion, uncertainty, and a lot of conflicting data with respect to nutritional trials. Okay, so on that note, let's dive into brain health. There's some pretty recent research that suggests there's a potential association between dietary magnesium intake and brain health. So this was an observational study using data from over 6,000 participants. They were aged 40 to 73, it was UK biobanked data. And those who reported a higher magnesium intake had on average larger brain volumes, which could convey up to approximately one year of reduced brain aging, compared to those with lower magnesium intakes. So the results revealed that, so the higher dietary magnesium consumption, this was about 550 milligrams per day, seemed to correlate with larger gray matter and hippocampal volumes than the average intake of about 350 milligrams per day, which is actually closer to the RDA. This was actually particularly notable in women. I would say this is an intriguing link, obviously interpretation of these results, have to recognize that these are observational studies, so they really can't provide a cause and effect relationship. But only suggests a possible association. So the data is based on self-reported dietary intake. That could be influenced by other overall dietary patterns or other factors like lifestyle habits or health conditions. To really, I would say conclusively say state that magnesium is improving brain health by increasing brain volume, particularly gray matter in the hippocampal region of the brain. We would need clinical trials to substantiate that potential relationship. Those probably aren't going to be done so kind of just have to look at this data and make what you want out of it. Magnesium has been linked to the development and progression of various age-related brain disorders. Higher cerebral magnesium levels have been shown to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve synaptic plasticity, also counteract other mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. So there was a recent systematic review that revealed individuals with Alzheimer's disease also have significantly lower plasma magnesium levels compared to healthy controls. So researchers looked at a lot of data from different sources like blood, serum, plasma, the fluid around the brain, the cerebral spinal fluid, which helped them sort of be more confident about their findings. However, when they specifically checked the fluid, the cerebral spinal fluid, it wasn't entirely clear. So there was a hint that Alzheimer's patients might have lower magnesium in the cerebral spinal fluid, but it wasn't as clear cut as in the plasma in the blood, for example, in serum. And a study that followed over 1000 middle-aged adults for 17 years, researchers found that those who ate the most magnesium, so they were getting at least 196 milligrams per day, had a 37% lower chance of getting dementia when they got older compared to those who ate the least magnesium, so they were getting 174 milligrams per day or less. There was another study in people aged 60 and above who did not have dementia, also showed that eating more magnesium, so this was at least 434 milligrams, might help them from getting mild cognitive impairment, which is the stage before dementia. The numbers from this study suggest that the risk was much lower for those who ate more magnesium. And again, another observational study, this was over 2,500 older adults who were mentally healthy, again, found higher magnesium intake. This was over 407 milligrams per day, was also linked to overall better brain function, but this benefit was actually only seen in women. So again, all these studies are observational. They're really only showing associations, they really can't prove that higher magnesium intake directly causes these health benefits. We need more control trials, clinical research to really establish that definitive link, but we do know that magnesium is a vital co-enzyme, that plays a crucial role in a variety of biochemical processes in the brain. So it serves as the key factor in a variety of brain-specific enzymes. So, adenosine trifospatases, these are ATPases, their crucial enzymes that control our ability to hydrolyze ATP, which is the major energy source for all of ourselves, very important in the brain. So magnesium is a co-factor, it's essential for those enzymes to properly function. And, you know, this is really important for the sodium, potassium, ATPase, and the calcium ATPase, which help establish this electrochemical gradient across our cellular membranes in our brain. It's essential for neuronal function. Another enzyme would be involved with creatine, so everyone, you guys have heard of creatine. Most people think about it in the context of bodybuilding, muscle mass, but it also is important in the brain as well. So creatine passes phosphate, groups from phosphate creatine to ADP, to make ATP, that energy currency. And so, you know, the enzymes that are doing this, again, require magnesium to do it. So, another reason why magnesium would be important for the brain. It's also important for another enzyme called glutamines synthetase. So, this enzyme enables the conversion of glutamate into ammonia and glutamine. And, magnesium is required for the appropriate function of this enzyme because, and this is really critical, because maintaining that glutamate to glutamine balance in the brain is important for preventing excitotoxicity. So, this could potentially lead to neuronal damage. If you're not maintaining that balance, you might have too much glutamate, which could lead to that excitotoxicity and neuro-toxicity. Right? So, too much excitatory activity from glutamate, you'll end up, you could end up with neuronal damage. So, magnesium plays, this is just three examples of enzymes in the brain, where magnesium plays a critical function, and why magnesium is so crucial for brain function. I would say one area with respect to the brain, where the data is a bit stronger, is migraine. So, magnesium might play a role in managing migraines, which is a condition that affects many people worldwide. There's recent randomized control trials that have really shed some light on magnesium's potential benefits for those suffering from migraines. So, what is happening in the brain during a migraine? One key element is something called cortical spreading depression. So, it's a kind of wave of brain activity that leads to visual and sensory changes. We often associate with migraine oras. So, interestingly, magnesium supplementation seems to help prevent these waves. But, there's a little more to it. Magnesium might also decrease the release of certain chemicals in the brain, like substance P and glutamate, which are known to transmit pain signals. So, by reducing their release, magnesium could play a role in lessening the pain associated with migraines. Also, we might prevent the further narrowing of brain blood vessels caused by serotonin. Another neurotransmitter involves in migraines. So, as it turns out, individuals who suffer from migraines are often found to be deficient or have insufficient magnesium. Now, this might not be entirely surprising when we consider that nearly half the US population doesn't get enough magnesium in their diet. But, it does highlight a potential link between widespread nutritional gaps and specific health conditions like migraines. Understanding these connections can offer us insights, I think, into simple, yet impactful ways to improve our health. So, there's results of randomized controlled trials that we're going to discuss. There were five randomized controlled trials that indicate that magnesium supplementation can effectively reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine relapses. So, magnesium is believed to work by preventing cortical spreading depression. The brain signaling waves often responsible for migraine or we just talked about. And, additionally, magnesium reduces the release of those pain-transmitting chemicals like substance pee and glutamate. The effective magnesium dose for preventing migraines seems to be around 600 milligrams per day, which is almost twice the suggested upper limit. To minimize gastrointestinal discomfort, I think it's advisable to divide the dose into smaller amounts, such as 200 milligrams taken three times throughout the day. This can really help minimize the irritation on the digestive tract while still providing an effective dose for migraine management. So, I mentioned these data comes from five different randomized controlled trials. Do you think that while there's only a few studies, the implications could be significant. You know, migraines, they're not just headaches. They're really complex neurological events. So, understanding how something is accessible as a magnesium supplement for some people could mitigate these symptoms. I think it's really, it offers new hope and a potential new avenue for relief for some people. So, it's a great example of how diving deep into some of the brain science and understanding magnesium's role and looking at some of the clinical studies can kind of help lead to some practical everyday health benefits. Let's move on to aging. Magnesium depletion is a slow process. So, marginally low intake would likely take years to manifest, but it would still take a toll. It's likely a factor in aging and the development of chronic disease. So, I want to take a moment to discuss the concept that has been a significant focus in the field of nutrition. Particularly a theory put forth by my mentor, Dr. Bruce Ames, who has introduced what is known as the triage theory and published several studies on it. It's really a fascinating way to understand how our bodies deal with micronutrient scarcity, like with magnesium. So, Dr. Ames has published several papers on this topic highlighting how nature has possibly evolved a mechanism to prioritize certain biological processes over others when micronutrient resources are limited. So, magnesium, for example, is the key player in numerous biological functions. Some of these are critical for immediate survival and preventing diseases that could lead to acute life-threatening conditions. However, magnesium is also pivotal for long-term health processes like DNA repair. So, deficiencies in DNA repair might not cause immediate harm, but they can lead to a gradual accumulation of DNA damage. Mutations that over time can then become oncogenic or cancer causing. So, the triage theory posits that in the face of limited magnesium, the body will prioritize its use for enzymes involved in essential short-term survival, such as enzymes like energy production. This means that other processes that are vital for long-term health like DNA repair might get less of this magnesium. What's the end result? Well, we might not be getting enough magnesium. We might be getting enough to avoid acute deficiency, even pulling it from our bones to maintain levels in our muscles and other tissues. We could be, you know, setting the stage for chronic health issues like osteoporosis down the line. So, I think this inadequate intake of magnesium and micronutrients in general can accumulate its incidious damage over time. In the context of magnesium, when DNA repair and replication, which both do require magnesium to properly function, they aren't functioning optimally due to those inadequate levels. The accumulation of this damage can lead to these mutations, sell this function, and potentially cancer development. And it's a clear example of how, you know, subtle long-term effects of micronutrient inaducacy or magnesium inaducacy in this case can contribute to the aging process and the development of chronic diseases. So, we're talking about cancer, let's dive into a little bit more into that topic. Magnesium does play a crucial role in DNA repair, and this has implications for cancer prevention. So, every day, our DNA is facing damage from both internal sources like metabolism and external forces, things like UV radiation, pollution, things like that. We have to engage our DNA repair mechanisms naturally slow down like everything else. But when we're also low in magnesium, it's kind of like throwing gasoline on a fire. The risk of DNA damage escalates. Magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of DNA repair enzymes. So, consider the sheer frequency of cell division in our bodies. Millions of cells divide daily with some tissues like our skin and intestinal lining. They have exceptionally high turnover rates. So, DNA replication, which is necessary to make a new cell, is really vital for that, you know, process of making a new cell. And magnesium plays a role in DNA replication as well. It's essential for the proper functioning of those enzymes called DNA polymerases. These are essentially the work horses of cell division. Without adequate magnesium, these processes can be compromised, and this could lead to potential errors and mutations when you are making new DNA. Now, let's dive a little bit into the role of magnesium in what's called matrix metalloproteinases or MMPs. So, these are enzymes. They're more like agents of extracellular matrix breakdown. They're involved in critical processes like tissue remodeling, wound healing, and magnesium deficiency can upset the delicate balance here with the activity of these MMP enzymes. That also could potentially aid in cancer, cell invasion, and progression. So, it plays a little downstream role in cancer, progression, and cell invasion. But again, I think it really highlights the sort of broader impact of magnesium on cellular health, cancer prevention. And it's really an important micronutrient that is just, it's fundamentally, you know, intertwined with our bodies ability to maintain what's called genetic integrity. And to prevent the formation of, you know, oncogenic cells, which are cancer cells. So, let's talk about a study that followed about over 66,000 men and women aged 50 to 76 years old. So, this was part of the Vitamins and Lifestyle study or the Vital study. It was from 2000 to 2008. Among the 151 participants who ended up developing pancreatic cancer, those with magnesium intake below the RDA had a significantly higher risk of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, those getting 75 to 99% of the RDA, the risk was increased by 42%. And for those with less than 75% of the RDA, that risk jumped to 76%. But what was even more striking about that study was that for every 100 milligram per day decrease in magnesium intake. There was an increase in a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidents. And so, this was an adult dependent matter. Every 100 milligram decrease was associated with a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidents. And what's particularly interesting here is also the role of magnesium supplementation. So, the inverse association between magnesium intake and pancreatic cancer risk seemed to be more pronounced among those who took magnesium supplements, either from a multivitamin or even as an individual supplement. So, in other words, what I'm saying is that within that cohort, it wasn't just dietary intake, it was also supplemental intake. And people that were also supplementing with magnesium, that was associated with a stronger decrease risk in pancreatic cancer. Obviously, it's important to approach findings with a very nuanced understanding, right? This is still observation data. Still means correlation, can't really establish causation. There could be a variety of other factors that could influence this as well. So, it's always important to keep in mind when we're talking about observational data. There was another study. This was the Paris Perspective Study 2, which followed about 4,000 men aged 30 to 60 over 18 years old. And that study found that men with a highest magnesium levels. That was associated with a 40% lower all-cosm mortality, and a 50% lower decrease in cancer death. Compared to those with a lowest magnesium levels. Yet again, all the caveats I just mentioned, this was also an observational study. So, I think the beauty of observational studies, honestly, is in their ability to reveal these patterns, these associations in large populations over extended periods. So, that is really the beauty of observational data. And then, once you get that observational data, you kind of need to approach it with a little bit more of a critical eye and sort of also try to turn to some interventional studies as well. With respect to cancer incidents, that's going to be very challenging because cancer takes decades to develop. So, having a randomized control trial with a supplement like magnesium is going to be challenging if not impossible to do. So, that's also something to keep in mind. But let's dive a little deeper into a meta-analysis that examined both dietary and supplemental magnesium intake and their effects on mortality risks. So, dietary magnesium intake was linked to a significantly lower risk of both all-cosm mortality and cancer mortality. So, specifically for every additional 100 milligrams per day of dietary magnesium, there was a 6% reduction in all-cosm mortality and a 5% reduction in cancer mortality. And again, this was an adult dependent manner. So, for each 100 milligrams increase per day, that was, you got those reductions. So, I do want to point out that this was from dietary sources and not from supplemental sources. So, it really could be that there's just a barrage of things going on because you're talking about getting magnesium from, you know, sources of healthy foods. So, what I'm trying to say is because foods that are high in magnesium like leafy greens, they come with a, they're packed with a plethora of other vital micronutrients and phytonutrients. You know, so these components collectively contribute to overall health. They're also a part of a food matrix that enhances their benefits. The analysis also looked at supplemental magnesium intake and here's where things get intriguing. The supplemental magnesium intake showed a non-significant positive association with cancer mortality risk based on three studies. It's important to note that non-significant doesn't mean that there was no effect. In fact, the p-value that's used to determine significance can actually be quite arbitrary, but that's a whole other tangent. But I do think it highlights the complexity of interpreting data. Similarly, there was a total magnesium intake, which looked at both dietary and supplemental sources. And that really didn't show any significant association with cancer mortality or all cost mortality. But there was a lot of what's called heterogeneity between studies. In other words, some studies did see an effect. Other studies saw no effect. And so again, it comes down to that mixed mixed data. Really, those sorts of things, those sorts of differences come down to, you know, differences is study design, population, other factors that can just add all these layers of complexity to our understanding. I think these findings reinforce the idea that getting magnesium from dietary sources might be the most beneficial approach. They also underscore the nuance nature of nutritional research, right? The variation in these studies, the arbitrary nature of statistical significance, the heterogeneity between studies, the all really point to this careful interpretation, a deeper understanding of how nutrients like magnesium are impacting our health. And again, to how trials and nutrition and just how complex trials and nutrition are. And, you know, the need to sort of standardize some of these trials as well, so that we can get better data. I do want to shift gears and talk a little bit about osteoporosis. So magnesium also plays a role in bone health. We already discussed how roughly 60% of the body's magnesium is stored in the bones. It serves as a reservoir during times when you need magnesium, your body will pull it from your bones to get that source of magnesium. As a person ages, magnesium losses from the bones increase. And this is partly because the body strives to maintain a very narrow stable range of magnesium in the plasma. When our dietary intake is insufficient, the body compensates again by pulling magnesium from the bones, which is a reservoir. I know I'm being repetitive here, but it's important to understand that. Just like the muscle is a reservoir for amino acids. Our body pulls amino acids out of muscle when we need to get when we need amino acids when we're low on protein, which is not a good thing. Because then you end up losing muscle mass. Well, the same concept here. Your body is pulling magnesium from your bones. That's a reservoir for magnesium. But pulling from the bones, especially when you're talking about over lifetime, right? You're talking about in older adults, this can contribute to a decrease in a very large decrease in bone magnesium content. In fact, over lifetime nearly half of the magnesium content of bone is lost in people. And there are some evidence that suggests that this magnesium loss in the bones over decades contributes to osteoporosis. So, adequate magnesium intake early in life really honestly is like an investment in your long-term bone health, right? Because if you are getting enough magnesium from your diet and supplemental sources, your body is not going to have to pull on the magnesium from your bones to get it. What it needs. So studies have shown that magnesium rich diets in pre-adolescence, positively affect bone density in young adulthood, particularly in the heel bone. There's been a year-long magnesium supplementation study that found that magnesium supplementation for one year can enhance bone mass in the hips of peri-pupurral girls. And I think this highlights again, magnesium's crucial role beyond just calcium in building strong bones and preventing osteoporosis. A lot of people think about the role of calcium, also very important for bone health, but getting enough magnesium early in life is I think really important. So I'm not talking about supplementing with magnesium later in life when you already have osteoporosis. I'm talking about preventing your body from pulling that magnesium out of your bones so that you don't go into getting more. So that you lower your risk of osteoporosis later in life. So, magnesium is important for ensuring stronger bones as you age. And I think again, think of it as an investment strategy earlier in life. You're going to make sure that your body is not going to pull that magnesium from your bones. Year after year after year after decade after decade, eventually depleting 40% of your body's bones, you know, reservoir of magnesium. I think on a very similar note, let's get into vitamin D and vitamin D metabolism. Vitamin D also plays a role in bone health, but I think even more important here is the role magnesium plays in vitamin D metabolism. So it's just another layer of, you know, a connection that magnesium has to our bone health because we know vitamin D plays a role in bone health as well. So vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and bone health. So, the reason why I think of vitamin D is that it's a very important thing. So, the reason why I think of vitamin D as a bone health, magnesium, by acting as a co-factor for several enzymes that metabolize vitamin D, then helps make sure that we're getting vitamin D and using it effectively. And directly contributes to bone density because it makes up the bone, right? So it, but it also plays an important role in bone health indirectly by contributing to vitamin D metabolism, which is a key player in bone health. So the synergy between magnesium and vitamin D metabolism, I think is a perfect example of how interconnected our nutrient intake is with, you know, overall bodily functions and how some of these micronutrients are sort of working together. And synergizing and why some trials where you're just giving one micronutrient may not be enough because another one is needed because they work in concert. So let's discuss this a little bit. High intake of magnesium, whether from the diet or supplements or both, is linked to a lower risk of having low levels of vitamin D. There's also a notable interaction between magnesium and vitamin D intakes that influence the risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. So what do I mean? For example, if a person's magnesium intake is adequate, this can enhance the body's ability to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. On the other hand, if magnesium intake is low, like 45% or half the population roughly of the US, that may hinder the body's ability to utilize vitamin D effectively, even if vitamin D intake is sufficient. So this study found that the benefits of having higher vitamin D levels in reducing the risk of death, especially from cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer were more significant in individuals that had above average intake of magnesium. Building on the insights of those observational studies I just mentioned, a randomized controlled trial helps shed further light on how magnesium supplementation influences vitamin D status. So magnesium is key for enzymes that convert vitamin D3 into 25 hydroxy vitamin D, which is the main circulating form of vitamin D in our bodies. It's what we typically measure on a vitamin D blood test. So this trial showed that for people with low 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels, which usually can indicate vitamin D deficiency, magnesium supplementation effectively increase these levels. It appears that magnesium is aiding in the conversion of vitamin D3 into this more stable form of vitamin D, which is 25 hydroxy vitamin D. So what this tells us is that magnesium's influence on vitamin D status is not a one size fits all. It really varies based on your existing vitamin D levels. It's playing a critical role in either helping stabilize vitamin D in the body, converting that vitamin D3 into that active that stable circulating form, or it's also activating that circulating stabilized form 25 hydroxy vitamin D into the active steroid hormone, depending on your individual needs. I think this study really, I like this study. It offers a deeper understanding of like the intricate relationship between magnesium and vitamin D. They're both crucial micronutrients, although vitamin D actually functions as a steroid hormone of the body. But it also adds layers of complication to randomized controlled trials using vitamin D, and perhaps there's a negative result where you're getting no effect after giving a vitamin D supplement. Well, if half the US population is not getting enough magnesium and magnesium is required to make vitamin D function as an active steroid hormone, then you're going to have a problem. Those trials are they're going to be flawed at the get go. And again, it just it highlights the important role of thinking about nutrition differently than pharmaceutical drug trials. We have to think about not only the varying levels and different levels, people have of these nutrients at the start of the trial, but how these nutrients are interacting with each other. And if a deficiency in one is going to affect the function of another, then giving that supplement of the other isn't going to do much if you're still deficient in the important micronutrient that is needed to make that other one properly function. So again, I just I just want you guys to understand why nutritional trials are so complicated and why there's so much to mix data out there. It's it's it's it's incredibly hard to design the trial properly and to think of all these things and to get enough funding to do them as well. So lots of things to keep in mind when it comes to interpreting the results of a trial. The shift gears and talk now about blood pressure, hypertension, the role of magnesium in lowering blood pressure. So hypertension or high blood pressure. It's actually a pretty prevalent issue. So it affects nearly half of US adults, including 20% of young adults age 18.39, which well, that's kind of important. 20% of young adults age 18.39 have hypertension. It's it's really crucial for people those younger adults, people in their 20s and 30s to be aware of their blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is not only going to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, but it also significantly raises the risk of dementia later in life. And what's the most important factor for that is the cumulative exposure to high blood pressure. So the earlier in life you get high blood pressure, the more the risk you have of dementia later in life. And this is because sustained high blood pressure can lead to damage in the small vessels of the brain and that impaires cognitive functions and potentially leads to conditions like dementia as a person ages. So monitoring and managing blood pressure from a young age, I think is a really important and can be crucial for mitigating these dementia risk is cardiovascular disease risk. So where does magnesium come into this? Well, magnesium helps control blood pressure by boosting the production of substances like process cycling and nitric oxide, which relax blood vessels and improve overall cardiovascular health. It also aids in the widening of blood vessels, which reduces blood pressure. So vasodilation, it makes it easier for the heart to pump blood. Also, magnesium's ability to fight inflammation and protect against damage to blood vessels also is another way that it can support cardiovascular health. And I think this shows, you know, there's a lot of different ways that magnesium plays a vital role in helping maintain and keep the cardiovascular system healthy. So there was a comprehensive meta analysis involving 34 different randomized controlled trials. There was over 2000 participants and researchers discovered that magnesium supplementation at an average dose of 368 milligrams per day, notably lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. So the fact, which is slightly influenced by the dose and duration of magnesium, I think, does underscore the potential for magnesium to play a role in blood pressure management, perhaps in some people. There are laboratory studies that also back this up that have found magnesium ability, magnesium's ability to adjust. So, in particular, smooth muscle function, it can reduce the vascular resistance, it can combat hypertension, prevent vasoconstriction. Also, it's been shown to have antioxidant properties in the vascular system. I think all these things help mitigate vascular damage caused by oxidative stress and other factors as well. So, this research, including a comprehensive meta analysis really does meta analysis of randomized controlled trials, really does highlight that magnesium may could play a role in helping managing blood pressure effectively in some people. Also, integrating, you know, magnesium rich foods into the diet also is an important way as well. And a lot of studies out there showing things like a dash diet, which include a lot of foods that are rich in magnesium, is another great way to manage hypertension or high blood pressure as well. So let's move on to an area that has really, I would say, garnered significant interest, and that is the effect of magnesium supplementation for the prevention and treatment of muscle cramps. This interest really, I think stems from magnesium's role in muscle function. It's essential for muscle contractions, relaxation deficiencies in magnesium could potentially lead to increased muscle excitability and cramps, making supplementation in area of interest for those with low magnesium levels or those prone to muscle cramps, such as athletes or elderly individuals or those with certain medical conditions. However, when we look at the data surrounding magnesium supplementation and its effect on muscle cramps, it's really a mixed bag. Some studies suggest benefits, especially in pregnant women, but the broader picture is a little more complex. I think this complexity likely stems from the fact that not all studies, check if participants were, you know, deficient in magnesium or had insufficient magnesium at the start of the trial. As we've already discussed, also another layer of complexity is the fact that muscle cramps have a diverse, you know, array of causes. So not are all related to magnesium levels. So considering only about half the US population might actually have a low magnesium intake, supplementation would only affect perhaps the half of the population that would not be getting enough magnesium. And so you might expect that there would be some mixed data with respect to some of these trials, again, based on on those facts. I would say overall the data is not very strong supporting magnesium supplementation and its effect and it's effects on reducing muscle cramps. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have any effect. Again, like I've been really sort of trying to drive home throughout this podcast is that the nutritional trials in nutrition, micronutrients, things like magnesium are flawed at the get go. And so in a way you're almost setting yourself up for failure. And when you actually get a positive result in my opinion, it's kind of like almost just amazing because of all the hurdles that need to be overcome with respect to designing randomized control trials in nutrition. The other area that I think with respect to muscle cramps and magnesium that's got a lot of interest is the absence all baths. And we talked a little bit about this earlier in the podcast and this is where I think we really go into scientifically uncharted waters. There's a debate on whether or not magnesium. So magnesium from absence all is in the form of magnesium sulfate. And there's a debate on whether or not the skin can effectively absorb magnesium and sulfates from these kinds of baths to influence muscle and tissue health. I would say there's some studies that suggest the pathway for magnesium penetration via the sweat glands and hair follicles. They're representing a very small fraction of the skin's overall surface area. So the clinical significance of absorption remains a question not to mention that there's never been any indication that absence salts, can actually increase any plasma magnesium levels like that's I have not seen that study showing that. There are I would say there have at least been some studies showing that absence salt particularly dead sea salt. So dead sea salt is high in magnesium. It can improve skin barrier function and hydration as well. But with respect to muscle crampings, you know, I would say that there's no real scientific validation that absence salts are going to improve muscle cramps. Nonetheless, I would say that, you know, ultimately if you find relaxation and a sense of well being by taking an absence salt bath as I do, then you should continue to do that because at the end of the day, that's what's most important. As we wrap up today's deep dive into the world of magnesium and it's myriad of roles and health and disease prevention, I think it's clear that magnesium holds a pivotal place in the intersection of neuroscience, physical health and longevity, magnesium's contribution extends far beyond its role and muscle function and bone health. It's touching on crucial aspects of metabolic health, cardiovascular function and even cognitive processes. For individuals aiming for longevity and peak performance, I think understanding the subtleties of magnesium's effects, particularly in the context of dietary intake, potential supplementation is important. The evidence suggests that a tailored approach recognizing that while some may benefit significantly from increased magnesium, particularly those with already sufficient levels may not see much of the effect or improvement with increased magnesium intake or supplementation. This really highlights the importance of a sort of personalized data-driven approach to nutrition when that considers individual health statuses and goals. So that brings us to the end of today's discussion. Friends, I really appreciate your tuning in and sharing this deep dive into the fascinating realm of magnesium and its pivotal role in evidence-based nutrition. Thank you for your curiosity and commitment to understanding how this essential mineral influences our health. Thank you.

Welcome to today's deep exploration into one of Nutrition's most critical and debated topics. Protein. Beyond its well-known role as the building block of muscle, protein is fundamental to our metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and the prevention of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and sercopemia. But how much dietary protein do we really need? And could too much protein, especially for meat, actually be harmful. Today we'll discuss why maintaining an even building muscle is critical for everyone, not just athletes. You'll discover how protein intake coupled with resistance training drives muscle repair and growth, enhancing athletic performance, improving metabolic health, and promoting longevity by acting as a defense against age-related frailty. You'll learn about optimal protein amounts based on age, activity level, and goals. Whether you want to actively gain muscle, maintain it, or just improve body composition. We will critically examine current protein recommendations, challenging the adequacy of the RDA of 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight. Drawing on the latest research, we discuss why higher intakes, ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram, are more beneficial for general health, and why up to 2 grams are higher, maybe best for body recomposition. Addressing the contentious links between high protein diets and health risks, we will analyze evidence surrounding proteins association with cancer, heart disease, and kidney function. We'll explore how lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity, profoundly influences risk. Specifically, we'll uncover how exercise modulates growth factors like IGF1, diverting them towards muscle and brain tissue, where they support repair and growth, while potentially mitigating their pro-cancer effects and other tissues. We dissect the differences between animal and plant proteins, and stimulating muscle protein synthesis. We'll provide practical strategies for vegetarians and vegans to meet their protein needs effectively through increased total intake, diversified sources, and the use of plant-based protein concentrates. We'll also dispeel myths around protein intake timing. You'll learn how distributing protein evenly across meals can maximize muscle protein synthesis, and why the so-called post-exercise animal like window may not be as narrow as one thought. Additionally, we highlight the pivotal role of the amino acid loosing in activating muscle building pathways, and how this impacts protein quality considerations. By the end of this episode, you'll be equipped with all of the evidence-based insights you need to better navigate common misconceptions and ultimately harness protein for muscle maintenance, performance, and a frailty free future. So let's get into it. How much muscle we have tells us more about how we are aging than body weight or BMI ever could. Here's the startling fact. After the age of 50, the average person loses about 1% of the muscle mass every single year, and it's not just muscle mass. Strength plummet's even faster, dropping around 3% annually. By the time you reach 75, if you're not engaging in regular strength training, you could be losing up to 4% of your strength every year. So what can we do about this? Exercise, both before you need it, building muscle reserve, but also in old age to slow and reverse the decline. While resistance training is the most important factor for building and maintaining muscle mass and strength, protein intake plays an important role too. A meta-analysis from Dr. Stuart Phillips and colleagues highlights the importance of protein intake by showing that people who engage in resistance training and supplemented with additional protein taking their total daily protein intake up to 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight, increase their muscle mass by 27% and their strength by 10% more than those who did resistance training without additional protein supplementation. So these people were getting around 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. So dialing in that protein intake matters for both muscle mass and strength when combined with resistance training. Skeletal muscle makes up around 30% to 40% of our lean body mass. More muscle doesn't just mean more strength. It means better metabolism, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and a pretty good defense against type 2 diabetes. It also dramatically decreases frailty and the risk for sarcopenia, one of the main risk factors for falls and fractures in older adults. Research has shown that individuals who suffer from a fragility fracture are twice is likely to die compared to those without such fractures. And between 22 to 58% of people with a hip fracture pass away within just 12 months after the injury. In old age, falling and breaking a hip can literally be a death sentence. A better body composition dramatically improves quality of life and reduces disability risk. Having a higher muscle mass can decrease the risk of early death by 30%. Whereas having a high fat mass can increase that risk by 56%. So what explains are greater susceptibility to lose muscle mass as we get older? There are a few factors that play a role in this, but a big player here is a phenomenon called anabolic resistance. So as we age, our muscles become less responsive to amino acids, meaning they don't trigger muscle protein synthesis in response to protein intake as effectively. So for older individuals, the same amount of protein results in a smaller increase in muscle protein synthesis compared to younger people. Some studies have shown that an older person requires almost twice as much protein for the same response. For example, around 0.24 grams of protein per kilogram body weight or 0.1 grams per pound. That's 20 grams of protein for about an 80 kilogram man. Someley stimulates muscle protein synthesis in some young. But this dose is higher for older adults who need about 0.4 grams per protein per kilogram or 0.18 grams per pound of protein per dose. An older adult man weighing about 80 kilograms would need about 32 grams of protein to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. By the way, for anyone taking notes, this suggests that the optimal amount of protein per dose is between 20 and as high as 35 grams of protein depending on your personal level anabolic resistance. So this means a few things. The first is that if you're older, you need a higher total daily protein intake to maintain or increase muscle mass. It also means that you need a higher dose of protein at each meal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. But anabolic resistance is not inevitable or only due to aging as some might suggest. In fact, physical inactivity may actually be the biggest contributor. Reducing physical activity worsens anabolic resistance. For example, taking fewer steps for just two weeks causes anabolic resistance and older adults and reduces their insulin sensitivity. Imagine what decades of inactivity can do. That's the bad news. But the good news is that exercise makes muscle more sensitive to protein and essentially negates anabolic resistance. When older adults exercise before protein intake, their muscle anabolic response is identical to that of a younger adult. So how do I interpret this? Active older adults probably don't experience as much anabolic resistance as inactive people. And therefore it might not be such an issue for people that are physically active. The most effective way to combat anabolic resistance as we age is through regular physical activity combined with a higher daily protein intake, ideally around 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight. We do not have to be frail on old age. We can build muscle into our 40s, 50s, 60s, and even our 70s and beyond. And we can definitely increase muscle strength and power output at this age. In one study that recruited adults aged 90 years and older, 8 weeks of high intensity strength training produced a hundred and seventy four percent increase in muscle strength. Muscle strength in size increased even in the ninth decade of life. An age when most people wouldn't even think twice about touching a weight. So let's talk about the optimal protein intake. The optimal amount of protein will not be the same for everyone. Some people want to build muscle mass, some people want to maintain it and others want to improve their body composition by building muscle and losing fat. Each of these goals requires a more tailored approach. The first thing to know is that it's generally agreed upon that protein needs should be calculated based on a lean body mass or an adjusted body weight reflecting a healthy body fat percentage. So for example, 12 to 15 percent for men and around 20 percent for women. This prevents unrealistic targets, especially for those who are overweight or obese. So when I refer to protein intake in grams per kilogram of body weight per day, what am I dealing referring to is your ideal or goal body weight. Let's address one thing up front. The recommended dietary allowance or the RDA for protein of 0.8 grams per kilogram is thought by many to be too low. This is because the RDA was derived from nitrogen balance studies which have limitations due to incomplete collection and inaccurate estimates of amino acid losses. The optimal range for daily protein intake is closer to 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight per day or roughly 0.54 to 0.72 grams per pound. This is based on alternative methods like stable isotope studies which consistently show that higher intakes are necessary to maintain a positive protein balance. Far above the 0.8 grams per kilogram often cited. So aiming for at least 1.2 grams and up to 1.6 grams is what we're talking about for optimal protein intake. There's good evidence to suggest this. For example, older adults consuming at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day prevented age-related losses in lean mass when compared to consuming the RDA of 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight. Older women were also 30% less likely to experience frailty when consuming protein above the RDA. So what is the optimal protein intake for building muscle while resistance training? For people engaged in resistance training, a protein intake of 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight per day has been shown to maximize gains in lean body mass with a 27% increase and muscle mass over even a 1.2 gram per kilogram intake. That's a lot and it really just serves to really underscore how low the RDA really is when you're talking about 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight.

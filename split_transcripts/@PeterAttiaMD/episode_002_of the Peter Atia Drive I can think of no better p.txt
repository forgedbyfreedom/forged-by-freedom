of the Peter Atia Drive. I can think of no better person to begin this podcast with than my very dear friend Tim Ferris. Not only is Tim a really close friend, but he's also almost single-handedly the reason his podcast is coming into existence. In other words, if you hate it, you can blame Tim. Tim has been kind of on my case for about two years to do this. And more than anything else, he's just really helped me think about how I can sort of put something together that allows me to create something that is sort of new and isn't already out there in terms of content, but also is something that I'll find enjoyable to do. And that hopefully will come across as this podcast gets underway. I'm guessing most people listening to this know a lot about Tim, but on the off-chance that there are some who don't, I think it's just worth kind of giving a little bit of background on Tim. He's been described as a, quote, a cross between Jack Welsh and a Buddhist monk by the New York Times. He's one of fast companies, most innovative business people. He's an early-stage tech investor and advisor. That includes a number of companies that most people have heard of such as Uber, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Alibaba, and least 50 others. He's also the author of five number one New York Times best sellers and Wall Street Journal best sellers. The four hour work week, the four hour body, the four hour chef, tools of Titans, also known as biggest tools that's an inside joke in reference to the podcast and tribe of mentors. The observer and other media outlets have described him as the Oprah of Audio due to the influence of his podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show, which has about 300 million downloads at the time of this recording. It's also been selected as the best of iTunes for three years running. Now, I want to say something about this episode that will become apparent. Obviously, once we get started one, we talk a lot about things that are topics that Tim and I don't really spend a lot of time discussing publicly and certainly personally. And so it's important to understand here that while Tim and I do talk quite openly about psychedelic experiences, we've shared in South America, it shouldn't be taken to mean that that's what we were recommending that anybody go out and do. We're absolutely not doing that. There are physical, there are psychological and there are legal risks among these things. And it's important to remember that in the United States, at the time of this recording, psychedelics, like psilocybin, which we speak about quite a bit, along with masculine and things that we don't get into much detail around such as Ayahuasca, these are currently schedule one, which means that they are illegal. And while we believe, obviously, that designation is completely unwarranted and will likely, you know, eventually no longer be the case when the scientific community has a chance to catch up and understand the great potential of these things. Really the purpose of this podcast is informational only and well. I do generally provide a disclaimer at the end of my podcast that explains that all of this information is informational. I want to be really clear about this particular issue. We talk a lot about these things. We talk about a few other things as well. And I think even for the listener who doesn't find this topic to be particularly interesting, one thing that we talk about at the very end of the podcast that I'd been meaning to ask Tim for a while and certainly I get asked a lot is, what are the things that you still incorporate in your daily routine? Tim has written so eloquently about this stuff and has codified so many ways to find these minimum effective doses and to optimize everything he's doing. But I think people wonder, hey, which are the things that have really stood the test of time. And so I actually found that last part of the podcast to be, especially interesting, even for me, though I knew these things and I can see all the things that Tim does day in and day out, but this sort of have him say, look, if I had to pick five, these would be the five. Tim can be found all over the place, but I think the best place is to see him or on his blog, which is Tim.plog. You can follow him at T-Farist. That's F-E-R-R-I-S-S on Twitter. And you find him at Tim Ferris on Facebook and Instagram. I hope you enjoy this first episode half as much as I enjoyed recording it and there will be lots more of these to follow. So with all of that said, please welcome Tim Ferris. Hey, Tim. Peter. Thank you for having me on Austin this weekend. My pleasure. It's been a good weekend. Good view too. Yeah. What I can't believe is in the relatively short period of time you have lived here. You've become essentially the unofficial mayor of Austin. Well, I like to get involved and to explore all the various nukes and crannies of any city that I live in. And after 17 years in the Bay Area, I felt like I'd left almost no stone unturned. Have many dear friends who are still there, but many of them have traveled outside. And one of the places that was an annual migration was South by Southwest here in Austin. And had wanted to move here right after college gotten to know it year by year with increasingly longer stays in the city before and after the festival itself. And now it's home. Couldn't be happier. Feel like every place we went in the last three days, everybody knew you like the owner of the restaurant would know you. And the coffee shop. And it was, I don't think I drank more coffee and topo chico in a short of period of time. I thought I had the last three days. Yes, coffee, topo chico. And so many things here. Yeah, breakfast tacos is something I haven't yet explored. That's another form of religion here, right next to barbecue and a bunch of other things. But it's a cozy feel. It has a neighborhood feel and I've come to value that type of neighborhood feel and cohesion, which is something I probably wouldn't have paid much attention to 10 years ago. Yeah, I've sort of always assumed I would live forever in California and I kind of say, all your hard work here to get your friends to move out here. It's, I think it's going to pay off. I, I, I, I think I can see Austin in my future. Yeah, I have a lot of friends are moving and I think in many respects, it's defined by the fact that it's difficult to categorize. There is no one mono conversation about tech or entertainment or finance. And some people might view that as a weakness, meaning if you're looking to live in the epicenter of a certain industry and you're in your early 20s and want to cut your teeth and live that hyperkinetic super aggressive lifestyle while you're building your foundation for the future. That's one thing. But in my case, I much more so in placing value on the general friendliness, the cultural diversity, which is not just skin deep, it covers so many different bases here. And I enjoy the fact that you can go from a strict vegan restaurant to a dear processing plant to an electric scooter, start up office to a cowboy boot store, all in the stretch of a few blocks. That's exciting to me. And though I've never really bought the argument that people in New York and Southern California, which are the two places I spend most of my time are, you know, I'm not about the argument that those are snotties, super snottie places and nobody's nice. Because I do think that people are actually pretty decent everywhere and including in the middle of Manhattan. But that said, it's a different level of nice here that is completely foreign to me. Yeah, it is. I remember when I first moved to Austin and I had a number of neighbors drop off cards or come to the door to ring the bell to ask if I want to come over for dinner and I didn't even know how to respond, which really, you're like, one of myself. I'm being more about myself than I was so mistrusting perhaps. But in San Francisco, that does not happen as far as I know. I've never heard of that happening. Certainly in New York, it would be a time to check your security system and consider your avenues of getting out of the house. But here that's just part of the course and it's really been nice to embrace that. And even with in Texas, Austin is known for being very, very friendly. I've met many different people here who've moved from Houston and other parts, which are also fantastic in their own way because of the general level of friendliness. So I'm a fan. I always thought I would be, felt the gravitational pull here when I graduated and did not get the job here that I was so coveted at trilogy. And it turned out being a blessing to skies that I didn't get the job. And I think also for trilogy, because I most likely would have been a terrible employee. But that took me to Newarkell had a great stint there, but that chapter came to a close. And it was just the right time. Well, as I said, it's been amazing to be here. Not my first time here, but each time I kind of like it more and more. I guess with that said, we are kicking off effectively the first episode of a podcast that you, more than any other friend, although several friends have played an enormous role in the so-called cajoling as I referred to it earlier and making this happen. So if this ends up sucking, I'll take all the blame. I'm blaming you. And if this ends up doing okay, I'm thanking you. But either way, I think this has been this will be fun. I think my customary 30% is very reasonable. 30% of what, right? Yeah. Now, obviously this podcast is on some level. And probably on a large level, going to come down to things that I think a lot about and hope to bring to people, you ask me the other day, you know, what am I hoping to accomplish with this? And I don't have a great elevator pitch on it, but one of the things is I find myself so often having conversations with people that I think, God, this person is so much smarter than me and knows so much more than me. And they're letting me be a sponge right now and absorb so much information from them. And so many times I find myself at the end of those discussions thinking, I can't believe nobody else got to hear that. What if I didn't extract everything from that correctly? What if there was more to be gathered? And so it's really that desire to sort of have as many of these conversations as possible and be able to sort of share them in their natural state that I think is a large part of this motivation. And while most people sort of associate me, I suspect, with thinking about longevity, we probably don't spend enough time talking about what longevity means. But the way I talk about it with my patients is it's both enhancing lifespan, but also a health span. And lifespan is the easier of those two to understand because enhancing lifespan just means not dying, which is not to say that that's easy, but it's conceptually easy. I think the health span stuff is harder to understand. And as I have come to learn in the past three or four years, I believe for most people, it actually matters more. Many people think, you know, if you helping me, doesn't add one day to the length of my life, but improves the quality of my life, especially at the end, that would be sufficient. And so in many ways, what I want to talk about today is one piece of health span that I know the least about by far, but also I think is the one that we are least likely to talk about as a society, which is sort of mental health. Now, you've spoken really publicly about your interest in that. I knew a lot of this before you talked about it at TED, but can you tell me a little bit about that? And thrilled you're doing a podcast because I do think that just as a bit of overlay on what you said, there is so much focus on extending lifespan, rightly so, but the equal obsession, equal level of obsession that you bring to performance and health span. I think creates a compelling combination that I don't find in many places. I find the combination of those interests are a common, but the combination of competencies broadly speaking in both of those domains is very uncommon. So I'm excited to listen to other episodes of the podcast. And as it relates to mental health, I should as maybe a introductory preemble say that this is not a topic I've always been comfortable talking about publicly. In fact, I would say for the vast majority of my adolescents and certainly throughout high school and college, I somehow came to the conclusion that I was just not designed to be happy that evolution did not optimize for happiness. And I just did not have the code for happy, and that was okay, that I would be an instrument of competition. I would learn to be good at various things that were valued at colleges and then by the business worlds and so on, and that it was not worth trying to be happy or to not just love myself, but really have a high opinion of myself and in fact, that was self-indulgent. And that I would just focus on being the best competitor possible and hopefully turning that into something that was not only a value to me or that I was rewarded for, but that would help other people and that perhaps I would find some joy in the joy of other people, but that was the extent of it. And suffered from many different bouts of extended depression for as long as I can recall. Really, and that is also something that you can spot very easily looking back at my family history on both sides. And if you look back to grandparents and great-great-grandparents, fair amount of alcohol consumption, certainly fair amount of alcoholism, I thankfully have not sued myself with excessive amounts of alcohol, but you see a lot of patterns that scared me certainly, but the depression was one that I could just not seemingly navigate around. And the TED Talk opened with a particularly close call. The closest call I've ever had, this is not a common experience for me, but in college, where I can very, very close to killing myself and actually got to the planning stages. It wasn't just rumination about what if I wonder what it would be like to take my life. No, it was a decision that had been made and I was already in the planning stages and to give people the short punchline to that, which explains why I'm here today, I had reserved a book, which was going to be the last of many that I had read on this subject, related to suicide. It was already checked out of the Firestone Library, Princeton, where I was at the time taking a year away from. And it was checked out to some other poor student, so I put in a request to be notified when it came back into the library. But I forgot to update my dress at the registrar's office and the dress that I had on file after taking this leave of absence was my home address in New York where my parents lived. And so my mom got this postcard, which was, dear Tim Ferriss, this is to notify you that, and then whatever it was, you know, the final solution that I did it out, whatever it might have been, the how to kill yourself manual, has arrived. Please come to claim your book within the next X number of weeks, or it'll be released to the next person who has it on reservation. Whatever the postcard said, and I got this very heartfelt, understandably nervous call from my mom with her voice cracking, asking about it. And I lied, I said it was, I was very fast on my feet, and I said it was for a friend, Rutgers who wasn't able to get the book for a dissertation, there are thesis, he was working on, so I reserved it for him, know everything's fine. But in that moment, after that call, I realized how these, in retrospect, little waves, small events can be blown, or even large events can be blown so at a proportion or seen as permanent in such a way that regardless of socioeconomic status, regardless of race, regardless of gender, people can be so knocked off course that they end up taking their own lives. And certainly, recently that's been very dramatically demonstrated and tragically demonstrated with the deaths of many people, including Anthony Bourdain, who comes to mind most recently, and that's just on the high profile side. But in my case, personally, I realized how my blinders and pessimism in this downward spiral had led me to really only focus on my pain. I didn't realize how until that phone call, committing suicide would have been like taking 10 times the pain that I felt and imposing it on the people who loved me the most. And that was a huge wake-up call. So that is why I'm here today is the lucky accident that I did not update my address at the registrar's office. And if that had not happened, I mean, I was ready to pull the trigger so to speak, although that wasn't how I was going to go. But it was all specced on. It's terrifying to think of really, really terrifying to think of. And I have some of my best friends in high school who you never would have suspected from the outside looking in, killed themselves, college, same story. I just know so many people who have taken their own lives. And it always came as a shock to people at least to knew them in school, for instance. They seem to have it all together. They seem to have the good relationship or the good job or the good grades or whatever it might be, the good family. And that's led me in the last few years in particular to it. The very least want to focus on discussing mental health, different facets of mental health from an experiential firsthand basis. Simply to tell people, if assuming I don't have any type of ready answer for them, you are not this is exceptionally exceptionally common. But it's the dirty little secret that so many people carry around and are unwilling to discuss. And so at the very least, I want to say, you are not alone. There are millions upon millions of people fighting similar battles. And everyone you meet is fighting some inner battle. You know nothing about. So do not assume that you are alone. And I think in that, hopefully people can find some solace. And then beyond that, I've spent the last few years, really investigating using the contacts and network that I've developed through the books and the podcast and the tech investing to explore avenues and potential treatments or interventions that can certainly help people who are on the brink get back to stability potentially. But also to take people who might view themselves as stable or normal and to mitigate against the potential of losing their footing. And then there are, we can go beyond that certainly. But that is, my interest in this certainly began on a very personal level. How do you I, is it possible? I should say, forget about how? Is it possible for me to manage this? And the type of thinking that triggers the most dangerous downward spirals is what's the point? If I'm, if I'm constantly going to default to this negative thinking and I'm so blessed for A, B, and C reasons, what's the point? And that is a really, really poisonous toxic mental landscape to immerse yourself into it. And get caught in. So is it possible for me to somehow decrease the frequency of those types of episodes? Is it possible somehow to decrease the severity of those episodes? Is it possible to look at my quirky biochemistry, my software in a way that I see some blessings within my day-to-day month-to-month experience, then some way counteract the tendency to view myself so harsh when the inevitable dips come. Long answer to a short question. But that's, that's really been particularly in the last I would say two years, three, mostly starting about five years ago, but in the last two or three, really diverting a lot of my attention that was going to start up investing. A lot of my resources that were going to start up investing to areas that are related to this. And there's so much of that stuff I can't wait to talk about today because you've brought a lot of people along on this ride with you. So obviously I can only speak from my own personal experience, but we have so many mutual friends who have also been heavily influenced by sort of a sense of awareness that you've brought to us with respect to all of these things, but also potential solution spaces that are outside of our realm of thinking. You said something at the outset, which was, you just thought you weren't wired to be happy, which I mean, I can resonate with that completely. I remember as a child, my mom would always say to me, you know, Peter, do you just not want to be happy? And I would look at her, like, I don't know what kind of dumb question that is. Like, it's not an option. Like, you might as well be asking me if I want to be 12 feet tall. Like, I have some say in the matter. It's not about wanting to be happy. It's just about metaphysically not being able to be happy. And then furthermore, my thought, which was even a bit more obscure, or maybe bizarre, was happiness was a bad thing because you would stop being hungry. Makes you complacent. Yes. Right. So right along with self-indulgence, there was that. Yeah, it was like, mom, if I was happy, I wouldn't get up at 430 in the morning and run harder and faster than anybody else. And of course, I didn't have the, I don't think I had the mental framework to probe that idea further, which is what are you proving? Who are you proving it? Two, why do you feel the need to do all of these things? But it wasn't until quite recently that I even began to entertain the idea that being happy is not a bad thing. We're put in another way that it's a good thing. Yeah. The double negative. Right. Right. Just to touch on a few things that you just mentioned, I think are really important. The self-talk, Jim Lair, who's a performance coach who has worked with many, many of the most famous tennis players and other athletes in the world. I had a chance to spend time with him for my last book and then also for some tennis training in Florida. And he's, he spent time with one of my very close friends, Josh Waitskin as well, who's best known for being the basis for searching for Bobby Fisher for those people are familiar. And he talks a lot about the inner voice. The most important coach and voice you ever hear is your inner voice. So I've learned to pay increasing attention to the words I use, particularly when I'm rumenating, referring to myself, talking to myself, making a note to self. That's a long story inside, Joe, guys. Another time. And I found myself using perhaps very unsurprisingly similar language to yourself. If I were happy, I wouldn't be doing the things that are very clearly contributing to my success. Whatever that means. And not only that, but on every possible level, if I were to find joy in too many moments or to not feel deficient or inadequate or low-thewardly, which is honestly how I felt for the majority of my life. No, I don't just not love myself. Like there's a deep sense of why hate to use the word hate, but it's the right word. Like low thing. Like how could you be so stupid? How could you be so lazy? How could you be so filmed the blank? Tuff in the fuck up. And you may not have control over all things, but you know, you can get really, really good at doing is absorbing pain. Like it really good at absorbing pain. It's like, okay, if you were a card and have a high pain tolerance, maybe you can win. Maybe you can be successful and I should put in successful in quotation marks because they're so seldom well-defined by people who use this type of language, including myself for decades. But what I've come to realize, and this is also a, I think a common concern among type A personalities who consider or are told by people they respect, that they should take a stab at meditation for a period of time. There is this highly prevalent, almost universal concern among type A personalities by which I just mean driven like hard charging, head through walls. I can take the pain, fuck it. I'm just going to grip my teeth and white knuckle through anything that comes my way. Which, hey, let's face it. That serves people very well up to a point in certain ways. They worry about losing their edge. This is the exact wording that I hear so often. And the exact wording that I use with my friends when they first recommended a few of them, Rick Ruben and Chase Jarvis, very specifically Rick Ruben, legendary music producer. Although that doesn't, it's not even a drop in the ocean of what Rick does. And who Rick is? But Rick Ruben and then Chase, very, very famous photographer, also the CEO of a company called Creative Live, which is an incredible company in and of itself. Both of them recommended meditation to me, and I resisted for more than a year I want to say because I was afraid of losing my edge. Even though what I came to realize was, if you want to use your edge indiscriminately, like a kitchen knife, which is only a blade, like the handle is also blade it on both sides, you can continue doing what you're doing. If on the other hand, you want to put a nice ergonomic handle on that beautifully honed blade so that you can use it as an instrument for its highest purposes, you can utilize different tools, meditation being one of them when we could talk about all the different types of meditation as well because I think they do have slightly different applications. Is a tool in the toolkit that allows you to build this beautiful kitchen knife instead of holding onto the blade itself, just bleeding over and over again, scabbing, bleeding, scabbing, bleeding, which is I think day to day how many driven people experience life, whether they are financially stable or not, if they are compulsively active, if they are using the distraction of constant motion and absorbing pain and seeking pain to numb themselves that they don't have to be in their own head any longer than possible, which is what I did for a fucking long time, pardon my French, but I'm a decade. If they're able to develop other skills that allow them to and I've certainly less than seeking happiness, I have been looking for ways to both develop in myself and help others to develop a sense of peace even if it's 10 minutes a day. That does nothing negative in my book other than magnify your strengths and allow you to, maybe for the first time, see some of your weaknesses that are very often self-imposed and the blind spots that have been like an invisible hand guiding your life for, in some cases, decades. I really see no downside to that and since I've had two capuccinos and I guess have some extra personality, I'll further extend my long ass answer by saying my books very clearly track my priorities in some respects. You have the four hour work week which looked at different types of currencies, time being the most valuable non-renewable of those and how to address a few runs on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As I've moved along and suffered my own burnout of different types, not necessarily financially related, but certainly for our chef took me out for the count. I bit off more than I could chew in part because I was having some personal difficulties and some relationships and I wanted to numb myself. I went back to that numbing behavior which included taking stimulants, which included over caffeinating, in addition to the pills and so on, using alcohol at night to wind down, engaging in exercise that was far more painful and ridiculously punishing than it had to be for any type of health or performance purpose. I crash and burned and that led to the podcast as a way to take a break from bookwriting which led to the explorations and talking to people like Brinebrain, talking to people like Tarbrain, talking to people like Jack, Cornfield and many many others that then led to say, travel mentors or tools of times, then travel mentors and where I am now. Where I look at this Maslow's hierarchy of needs and realize at least for myself, let's say you cover your food, you cover your shelter, you cover it, that that that that that you get up to these rungs on the ladder where you've checked off success. You are blessed, you are hopefully healthy, your family might be healthy and you can meet all of your basic needs and probably have some disposable income and yet you have trouble living with yourself. That's a fucking tragedy. I mean, it's to have deciphered how to achieve and yet not be able to appreciate is that it's just the tragedy of tragedies. It's this kind of fools errand that could have taken five years, could have taken ten, could have taken twenty and then you see people like that who do not know which way to turn and then perhaps just withdraw into a shell and sit at a table with their family and look at their phone for the entire dinner over and over and over and over and over again because they don't know how to emotionally engage with themselves, let alone other people or you see the more dramatic cases where they're like, all right, I thought these things would make me happy. I was told these things were the necessary ingredients for eventually solving this emotional ruby cube that I'm struggling with my whole life where I assumed that poof one day I would just wake up and have made it. Even if having made it just means you're not struggling with alcoholism and rant like your parents did or something like that. And I've come to realize you don't need to and you should not wait until you think you have all of the other pieces, non-emotional, non-psychological pieces that puzzle together to start working on self-acceptance among other things and untying some of those gordian knots that you have that you might have carried for decades since your childhood and that it is not esoteric, it is not intangible and you start to address some of those things, it makes everything more effortless, it makes everything more rewarding and that I think is a project worth tackling. It's a lot but that's, yeah this depression I think particularly among men who are very very very bad generally and I'm just going to paint with a broad brush because that makes this type of conversational easier but broadly speaking, cross across cultures, it really doesn't matter where you go. Women are generally better at social cohesion and building groups of friends who are mutually supportive and we could look at a through an evolutionary lens but men very often are biologically culturally who knows, fill in the blank, trained and maybe born to just bite their lip and suffer in silence and I do think there are certain places for that look if you're going to be an aviciel commander, waking up every morning and telling your direct reports like about your really hard dream you had, probably not strategically tactically professionally or ethically the right thing to do when you have to go out and then risk your lives doing things that are mission critical to fill in the blank, right? So there is a time for that but to make that you're one coping mechanism for navigating life or like the sort of the mesh that is imposed on everything else that you suffer in silence and that the solution to that is just to get tougher to get better at accepting pain to use cheesy tech parlance doesn't scale, it just doesn't scale. You know when I was on your podcast the first time which I don't know how long ago that was it feels like it's probably been three or four years ago. One of the questions I remember you asked me which of course you asked many of your guesses what book have you gifted more than any other and I remember the book I mentioned at the time it was and remains a great book but I now have to update that answer. What was it just for people who were curious? It was mistakes were made but not by me which is just an amazing book on the psychology of cognitive dissonance but of course that now has been surpassed there is now a new book that is my most gifted book and amazingly I can't believe I didn't bring a copy to Austin to give you because I now I probably I think I just buy Amazon out of this book like I just have stacks of it all over like you have stacks of certain books in your place and this book is called I don't want to talk about it by Terence Real who have since reading the book and becoming obsessed with actually it comes back to you you introduced me to Esther Perrell. Esther recommended the book the book was one of a series of little nudges that ultimately led to me meeting Terry and of course that book has now been the book I have given most but what you said is spot on which is there is just this epidemic of male depression and it's not always overt that's the thing right people have this image of what depression is but you know like a guy who's constantly angry emotionally volatile he can be quite depressed so depression isn't always disthymia and I think that's where people miss this idea of how much pain people both men and women carry around but how men have this more orthogonal way of displaying it that makes it get masked longer and longer and I want to go back to something you said earlier because it really hit home about a year ago when a mutual friend of ours Paul Conti made this point to me which was the way you treat yourself is ultimately how you will treat those you love most and you know when he really pushed me to think about that which is do you want to be the guy who treats his kids the way you treat yourself and I had to be put that way for me to think no I mean if I'm going to be brutally honest I would not want to watch my kids get treated by another human the way I treat myself even though I think it's good for me to treat myself this way so again I think the challenge is by far the hardest part is getting people to accept that maybe what they're doing isn't the right thing or isn't maybe right the wrong word it's not the best thing it's not the optimal thing I love your analogy of taking the best blade in the world and not having a handle on it I mean it's a limited tool yeah and there are so I would say just to maybe put a fine point on it going through life merely tolerating yourself which would have been a dream for me I mean I actively loathed myself and any weakness any mistake any foable any flaw I was I was and and still at times and I'm so incredibly violently critical in my own head that it is not the treatment I would want that I would wish on anyone I care about that is not a state you have to accept it is not programming that you have to accept and there are ways to begin to chip away at that and to rewire it and to reformat in a sense certain behaviors that you've experienced for so long many of them are thought patterns self-talk that you've come to believe they're completely unchangeable and in my experience and more and more the experience of dozens and hundreds of that and thousands of other people I've observed in the last five years it is patent it is patently untrue that you have to accept that and I think what you said is really really important to digest and ponder and that is how you treat yourself is how you're going to treat the people you care most about and I think it was actually glorious dynamo that a quote I don't know if this is accurate but somebody on the internet I'm sure will fact check this who said in effect I'm paraphrasing here but the goal and you have to remember that the golden rule goes both ways so we all know do one to others as you would have them do unto you if you flip that around it is do unto yourself as you do unto others and that is really has very profound and wide-ranging implications when you really sit with it for a minute and it's nice to say though you do not have to accept the inner voice or the patterns that have led you to pursue success with rare glimpses of any type of inner peace that is not something you have to accept so one of the most sort of profound experiences I've had sets of experiences I've had in the past few years our experiences we've shared together around certain plants that honestly I was completely unaware of an ignorant of for most of my life had never really given them any thought and probably much of the stuff that you've talked about written about in the past in particular there were two podcasts that you did one was with Martin and I'm trying to thank the other team Palanco and Dan Angle Dan Angle that was the other one yeah and those were two separate podcasts but they were very close together if I recall there a couple of months they were a few together and then a few of parts you had James Fademan and then Dan Angle and Martin together that's right and then later Michael Palan yeah but that first wave was probably 2015 ish yeah it was a few of course it was a year ago that was the thin end of the wedge and interestingly the thin end of the wedge for me was around something that wasn't a personal issue but more of a societal issue which is I was blown away by the discussion and the clinical results that they were achieving in Mexico using a plant called iBoga and using a iBoga and as well to treat patients who were opioid addicted and that's something that even back when I was sort of you know in my residency and you would see in a city like Baltimore what the effects of heroin addiction are and of course today it's even a much bigger issue and it's spread far beyond just heroin so that just interested me purely from intellectual standpoint which is wait a minute we have a drug or set of drugs that are so categorically addictive to so many for which our only treatments are at best useless and there's this other thing that admittedly comes with plenty of risk and plenty of unknowns but it seems to fundamentally change the way a person's brain is wired which would seem to address the root issue as opposed to the band aid that led of course to me wanting to understand more about those entire classes of compounds and that led to my very first experience with them which I shared with you meaning which you helped me through which to this day remains one of the most profound things I've ever done and if anybody's listening to this who's thinking what are they talking about what are these psychedelic agents aren't those drugs you know all these things one of the most remarkable things I remember after the first time I tried psilocybin was I don't feel like doing that again anytime soon like these are the most anti-addictive compounds on the planet what started your interest into that space the interest began and for those people listening who are wondering if if we'll discuss any other tools I think we should also discuss some other options on the table aside from this although this is very fertile ground for discussion so we can talk about meditations some other tools and books and so on later but the my interest in psychedelics began long ago with a close friend who introduced me to psilocybin contained in what is commonly called magic mushrooms must have been in college midpoint perhaps in college and it became an annual ritual and once a year I would meet up with a few of my closest friends and we would consume mushrooms in retrospect it was very haphazard we were not measuring any doses you just have a big bag of mushrooms and split it up and then hope for the best which is not ideally how you go about things and nonetheless despite the lack of controls and I do not recommend anyone uses compounds under uncontrolled circumstances I experienced what I began to refer to as as a reboot and I would have this anxiety and depression plaguing me I would go very very deep and looking back now I was almost certainly consuming minimum of five grams I'm sure I was consuming quite a high dose of mushrooms which is for those people who might read the writing or listening to some of the presentations of someone named Terrence McKenna five grams is referred to as a heroic dose and that is a dose sufficient to flatten even the most resistant to ego I believe is the wording that was used in any case I felt this decrease or even complete removal of depression anxiety that extended far beyond the supposed duration of effect let's just call it five to eight hours and there would be this after-glo period that certainly lasted most acutely for a day or two after the experience and I was going into this also with none of the best practices that we know of now in terms of preparation intention setting perhaps some of the preparatory steps you can take and then integration there's none of that so this was very bearer bones haphazard experimentation with a few friends nonetheless there were these periods of let's just call it two weeks to two months where I was able to finally see things clearly appreciate all of the incredible chance blessings that I experienced in my life and make decisions about things I've viewed as serious problems or challenges or opportunities whether it was making a decision about academics making a decision about a relationship to either start a relationship or end a longstanding relationship these were things I was able to look at very calmly and make decisions about and ultimately after I want to say four or five years of this had a very very very very scary and dangerous experience which was again with no sitters in other words no sober person supervising this any number of things can go wrong and one is people can wander around and get themselves into dangerous situations in my case I ended up coming out of my trip very late at night walking on the side of a street with cars whizzing by me I mean that could have very easily been the end and that scared me enough that I stopped it's never again two dangerous and I stopped I didn't revisit psychedelics until let's just call it let's think about this 10 to 15 years later when a girlfriend at the time who had some very very very difficult traumatic experiences as a child travel to Peru which has its own set of very real risks that we can talk about if he would like if you were going down explicitly for the purpose of using a psychedelic most commonly in this case IOSca but her experience was strong enough and meaningful enough that she came back and said to me that she wished it for me because it was like 15 years of therapy in two nights now if anyone knows anything about any of the books I've written or the way that I tend to view the world that is a very very effective sales pitch for two 15 years of therapy in two nights interesting and I put that in the back of my mind did not move ahead with it because of my fear which I think was very it was well-founded. I had a what could have been a very very dangerous experience or fatal experience things had to get much worse for me to finally decide to reenter that world which I did first through a guided psilocybin experience. I did not want to go straight to iosca which I to this day believe it was a very very big gun and can be very destabilizing. I didn't want to go I didn't want that to be my reintroduction so I did I had one guided psilocybin experience which also lacked much in terms of any type of prep integration or post so it it was effective in the sense that it it was like a returning home and it was a familiar feeling that I came out of unscathed. I took an absurdly high dose because I didn't know what I had taken before. So for those people who know anything about it I began at seven and a half and they did a booster in nine which for me is it is such an absurd overkill it is too as to almost defy belief at this point which by the way is a counterproductive taking too much is counterproductive it is not more as better by any stretch of the imagination. Being strapped to the icebreaker is not as very rarely what someone needs in any case came out of it realizing that you could approach this any safer fashion with a container physical and otherwise that allowed you to avoid the risk I had that it scared me off. Then went into the iosca experience about six months perhaps six months later took it very seriously had people sign non-disclosure agreements had someone act as my proxy to try to vet people in several different countries and ultimately honed in on someone I spent two nights with and it was one of the most disorienting on spiring experiences of my life without question. The first night I was prepared for all of the sickness and vomiting and terror that I knew it could be part of the experience and it was blissful it was an incredible first night. Second night was without any exaggeration the most painful experience of my life at one point I experienced full body seizures. So grandmall uncontrolled uncontrollable seizures for about I would estimate two and a half hours ended up with rug burns all over my face and hands and feet and was completely lost there was no contact no footing in this reality whatsoever and my subjective felt experience was one of being torn apart a thousand times a second dying a thousand times a second only to remanifest and have that repeat infinitum it was beyond horror and when I came out of the experience or the the main roller coaster was was coasting to an end after let's call it six to eight hours I was I was partially detached from reality for probably thirty six hours and I had very fortunately paid someone in advance to babysit me and act as a shaper on for that extended period in the off chance that happened which into being the case and the entire time as soon as I was cohere enough to even think in English which took a while I thought never again never again will I touch anything like this and it was only six to eight weeks later and I should mention that my intention I did have an intention this time going in to the second night specifically which was to let go of anger towards myself towards other people very a handful of very specific people and I swore I would never touch this stuff again it was just too scary, too potentially dangerous I thought there was a real chance that I could lose my moring from a sanity perspective and never come back and I realized six to eight weeks later after spending a lot of time with someone I've known forever who I've had a very contentious, emotionally volatile relationship with lots of triggers things I thought were beyond repair meaning couldn't spend more than an hour with this person without feeling extreme agitation and anger well up in some fashion and I had I had given up on that changing that long ago I realized let's just call it six weeks after my two nights that 90% of that was gone with this person and completely gone and to this day it has not come back and that has repeated itself or I've seen that in a number of my closest relationships the value of that is hard to overemphasize it's hard to even put it towards and it's so far outside any conceptual schema in medicine or therapy that I've run into it's hard to convey in a way that makes any sense because I've had so many people ask me well how did that happen I do not have a good explanation for that all I do know is since then having explored this both on an experiential level having spent time in several countries working with people who are some of the best at what they do and I do think I'm very very good at vetting that hopefully people believe that after looking at the books and the podcast and so on I'm really good at getting a hold of people who are really really good and I'm very good at vetting and having explored this space also from a scientific standpoint it just gets more interesting it just gets more unbelievable yet at the same time compelling and some of the changes I have seen in people are they they defy explanation by any conventional means and I'll throw out a few examples but before I throw out the examples I want to make it really clear that these compounds are not for everyone there are contraindications things can go wrong and they're not a panacea they do not fix everything by any stretch of the imagination but for certain types of depilitating conditions thought patterns fear they are remarkable really really impressive to the point that it is outside of the care and feeding and love of my family and myself my closest friends it is what I am most focused on furthering from a scientific standpoint certainly so you and another friend who's a mutual friend of ours so it's all this big circle of people we know but shared an equally remarkable story with me about a single experience he had had in this case it was so a siren as opposed to iolaska that also took him to this place of you know incredible emotional pain that led to a change in a belief in this case it was for this individual it was it was a belief system around a person who was no longer alive so some of them had lost I will never probably forget my first experience with siren for the same reason it's interesting I I didn't know that that experience you described came from your very second time with a lausca I was familiar with that story because you'd shared it with me before but hadn't pegged it to such an early time but my first experience with so a side been if not for the fact that I had that experience I wouldn't know what the hell you were talking about right now because it seems so improbable implausible and impossible that something that occurs over a span of six or eight hours that is nothing more than these compounds that come from these plants could so fundamentally alter the way we interact with other people in my case it was very similar it was a very important person in my life for whom I'd not had a great relationship in a very long time because I simply had no empathy now Michael Pollan has written about this so eloquently and I wish I could even half reiterate what he said because I remember him writing about it going that's exactly it which is for the first time in your life or at least for me I'm not seeing the world through my eyes anymore and David Foster Wallace has talked about this so eloquently in his talk which is one of my favorite talks this is water every experience we have is through our own eyes and these plants give you that ability to be out of that and I still remember watching myself as a 13 year old boy in this situation and for the first time ever not seeing that situation from my vantage point instead seeing it from the vantage point of others and that led to the most profound emotional breakdown which again these are very durable changes I mean I'm a couple of years out of this but I truly believe that 40 years from now I will still have this exact set of feelings about this particular individual and this particular experience and you're right there is how do you explain that it's very difficult and these compounds many of the classic psychedelics let's just for the sake of argument will leave LSD out of the running for a number of reasons including just the the political PR baggage that that acronym carries but we're looking at say mescalin which is found in payo de its found in the San Pedro or Wachuma cactus in South America among other places and we're looking at psilocybin found in quite a few different mushrooms these are compounds that have been used for hundreds of years probably millennia by different civilizations and you have amony to moscario which was used in Europe you have psychedelics that have been used all over the world psychedelics referring to and there's there are different ways to try to define this term but mind manifesting is what the word refers to if you look at the etymology but I would say experientially one of the defining characteristics of psychedelics and we probably will talk about we might have the chance to talk about mdma later which is in some way can be used for for many of the same conditions but I wouldn't consider a psychedelic simply because psychedelics provide what is often referred to at high enough dosages ego dissolution or a controlled death experience where you cease to exist as this subject who is viewing your experience of reality but that is so powerful that again we talk about it with these sort of in this sort of banal way but until you experience that that statement is so difficult to comprehend it is imagine imagine if you will and there there are different analogies or metaphors you can use but imagine if your whole life you have been the protagonist at least in your own mind you are the primary actor in the play of your life and you've always been the primary actor in the play of your life and there are other actors of course all these people you've ever met and for the first time you realize that it's a play and you're sitting in the audience and you're the playwright you're the person who has the ability to look at it from every perspective and you can change the lines of the primary actor that person known as Tim and my case that person known as Peter if you want to change their lines you want to change their backstory you want to change the stories they tell themselves you have the ability to do that because you're sitting in the audience as an observer of this person who is known as Peter or Tim and this is similar to the type of experience that people can have through meditation and they might describe it as instead of being outside standing in the storm you're standing inside looking through the window at the storm or you are instead of being inside the washing machine you're zooming out 18 inches so that you're looking into the washing machine in your observing what is happening as opposed to being tumbled by it and in fact the the states achieved through psychedelics and in very experienced meditators although I'm convinced that you can achieve this state pretty quickly through meditation it doesn't have to take 20 years is remarkably similar as best we know or there are some similarities I should say neurophysiologically in the sense that both seem to not necessarily deactivate but decrease activity in something refer to as the default mode network and this default mode network and Peter you may do a better job of explain this Michael Paul does a fantastic job of describing this in his book how to change your mind which I recommend to everyone yeah we'll link to the book we'll also link to your interview with Michael recently which was excellent as well even if people say they're not quite ready to read the book at the very least they should invest the time and listen to the podcast and by the way I would not suggest that anyone jump out and tomorrow go on Craigslist to try to find a shaman to take you through some experience even if you felt like that was an inevitable step you ultimately want to take there are some things that I would recommend first that can buy themselves be exceptionally, exceptionally useful so to come back to it though the ability to for the first time view this ego that refers to itself in my case as Tim who is a combination of many different things the identity that we have had to voice to upon us or conditioned into us but also that we've created for ourselves by the stories we tell ourselves that we've always told ourselves oh my you know my wife always does this my dad always does that I always do this I never do that these stories that we've told ourselves just so long that we've come to accept it is just a fiber in our being to look at it and realize that you can reformat almost every part of that or you can take trauma that you experienced as a child and for the first time ever re-contextualized as an adult without a motion to look at it with a level of emotional calmness so that you can finally close that that that circle is difficult to describe so I don't want to try too hard to put words to something which by definition if we're talking about mystical experiences which is a a corollary to the durability of these effects let me restate that and English that is a little easier to understand when you look at for instance studies that have been done research has been done at whether it's Johns Hopkins and why you are other places and I've gone to know the team at Johns Hopkins quite well and a huge amount of respect and admiration for what they've they've done and continue to do in many of the studies whether they're looking at terminal cancer patients and end of life anxiety or they're looking at lifelong smokers who came into a study specifically to look at how celcius I've been could be used for the cessation of smoking the duration of effect the durability of effect is very closely linked to something that you could refer to as a mystical experience and it turns out as you would hope there are different types of scales and measurements one can use to determine if something is a mystical experience or not and there's some debate about this but there are ways that you can assess whether something qualifies as a mystical experience based on looking at the historical accounts and writings of people who would consider mystics and one of them is in effortability the inability for someone to verbalize their experience that the words somehow do violence to the experience or don't do it justice. Pauling gives a great example of that in his book I believe it was Michael Paulin in his book how to change your mind about it you take somebody from you know whatever a thousand years ago put him in a time machine bring him the time square but I'm hanging out for five hours shoot him back can they describe what they saw not really they could say that it was big loud and bright but other than that they couldn't explain what a car is they couldn't explain what a building is or a skyscraper because the vocabulary hadn't even been developed and that to me is like the greatest example I'll be at somewhat a lib of this idea of being ineffable which is you and I can sit here and talk about it in short-hand but it's very difficult to explain to one of our friends maybe who hasn't experienced this and when you you know again it's these things sound so goofy when you say them like these experiences you see yourself from outside of yourself you know if someone hasn't experienced that I can understand why they would look at you a little funny and say okay intellectually I understand what you mean by that but why would that matter why would that be profound how would that disrupt your ego it's very difficult to convey and I would say that what I've experienced and what I've certainly seen and heard other people experience in their reports to me and in writing in book very books that I've read is the importance of the felt experience and that in some senses it's not that you have a psychedelic experience you have three realizations you bring those realizations back to this ordinary reality you take certain actions based on those realizations and based on that intellectual legwork your life changes it is not something strictly in the domain of words and thinking and just thinking harder and working harder in other words you're not taking the things that got you here if you've achieved anything professional or personally the pro and con list the spreadsheets the logical arguments it's not that you just get a better set of those things that you bring back it's that you are finally able to see and experience and feel something like empathy deeply for the first time for someone you've never felt it for or you feel love for yourself truly for the first time and you think holy shit like that's what's been missing I've never even felt that if someone had asked me what a self love feel like I wouldn't have had an answer for it these are the things that really stick and I think given the plasticity of the mind or plasticity of the brain that allow as one researcher put it to me you to instead of going to the top of the ski slope and then taking the tracks that have been worn and of course the deeper the tracks get the harder it is to kind of hop out of them as you're skiing but to get to the top and to have four fresh feet of powder fall on the entire mountains that you you have the ability to choose an entirely new path and entirely new record to play it's hard to verbalise but one way to think about it for me has as allowed me to come to grips with this because there's a part of me that has sometimes thought like this is too good to be true it's going to go away this new found empathy I have for person acts or this reduction in this horrible negative emotion I've had that's going to go away in six months and and I thought of something which is when you look at the opposite of that which is how often is a person's life changed for the worse based on one event and the answer is all the goddamn time a child could be abused once and that can change their life forever and again we're not going to go into that now because that is its own topic but so many of the horrible habits that we carry into adulthood are really because we never became adults we are basically adaptive children who are taking on a set of behaviors to protect wounded children and sometimes those wounds occurred very acutely and so in many ways these experiences with psychedelics if administered correctly in the correct setting with the correct integration can act as the exact opposite of a wounding event in other words with something that is so acute and so poignant you can just change the direction of this trajectory this vehicle doesn't necessarily mean it's orthogonal and of course there's so much more to it than that many people go through similar types of abuse and they don't all have the same impact and similarly many people can experience a psychedelic and not have the same impact but I think when I started to think of it in that way it started to become much more understandable why this could happen just as something horrible could alter the course of your life and you know I'm going to one of the podcasts I've already recorded that will be coming out later this summer will be with Cory who you and I spent a couple of days with up at Curn it's an excellent security prison yeah and when we did this we spent this this time up there with the five ventures the story of Cory's life is unbelievable and it's just a again at no point in there I think is Cory using any of these things that happened to him when he was young as excuses for the road he went down but it's impossible to argue that those experiences many of them very acute in this moment on this day in this place at this time completely set him on a different path and he could have been otherwise so as you said I I love the idea of this stage analogy because to me that's actually one of the best analogies I've ever heard about how how minefulness meditation works is it's the awareness that there is a stage that's simply what it comes down to and to be able to leave your vantage point as one actor to step back and see that you are an actor on a stage is I think one of the most empowering things and that's why I sort of love this interplay between you know meditation and these psychedelic agents there's an interplay there's an interrelatedness there is a reinforcement a mutual reinforcement also which is why I'd love to mention a few things just to give people a chance to crack their knuckles and stretch for a second in non-psychedelic territory there are a few things that I'd love to suggest people which help you to develop the same types of meta awareness that you can be thrust into through psychedelics that serve a purpose whether or not you ever choose to take one of these compounds. One would be certainly mindfulness meditation and I think by the time this podcast we're recording right now is live Sam Harris is waking up up I think it's just tremendous I think it does it exceptionally exceptionally good job of this and there's certainly guided meditations if you search say mindfulness meditation jack corn field tarab rock both outstanding Sam Harris also has some some guided meditations that he's recorded awareness meditation and Peter you feel free to jump in if I don't do this justice but awareness meditation being different from say other forms of meditation many of which I have used and still use on occasion perhaps one of the more popular of which being say transcendental meditation mantra based it is a concentration practice where you are repeating a mantra to yourself over and over and over and over again as a way to hone concentration and although not everyone's going to love this description to give your psyche and self a break from the incestant monkey mind and you really can reach a transcendent space where you feel like you are a point of consciousness floating if you do the 20 minutes twice a day very consistently that is a concentration practice if you are thinking of a candle flame and that or a a focal point for a period of meditation whenever you found yourself swept up and thought return to a candle flame that would also be a concentration practice if you're doing there are many also within awareness meditation there are different types but if you're doing say something referred to as I think it's sometimes called open monitoring where you're paying attention to anything that comes up as it comes up and there are different ways to approach this but a very often begins with the breath so it is in some sense a concentration practice but you're focusing on the breath you're not chasing it you're simply observing it then you focus on sounds then you focus on any discomfort or weight that you feel in your body then you perhaps later after 10 sessions 10 daily sessions begin to practice with your eyes open which I never really done before sams up which I found tremendously helpful as a bridge into then waking reality these are all practices that help you to spot the gap between sensory input and cognitive response so that you become more response able in so much as you you have a tiny gap within which you can choose your response as opposed to simply reflexively going through life like some type of slug that's been shocked in a scanner box or something and you have more optionality you suddenly realize they're just more options on the menu then oh whenever someone so does this I always get pissed off there are more options on the menu and that by the way having that basic ability having the just the ABCs of that awareness and control will give you a tremendous advantage and allow you to get very often much more value out of any psychedelic experience because you will have had let's just call it 50 sessions on a boogie board before they're like oh cool here's a surf board it's hurricane season have fun good luck like maybe you catch a wave chances are your first experience is going to be getting tumble a lot and you can accelerate the you can steep in the learning curve really dramatically for later getting more out of psychedelics very often if you develop some of this basic awareness beforehand I'm kind of amazed at how difficult it is for me to convince some of my patients at the importance of meditation and I find sometimes by just telling them about my own struggles and my own journey to accept first of all that this was something that was beneficial even when it didn't feel beneficial and too to realize that you have to sort of figure out what's going to work for you but it's worth making that effort I agree with you I think that just even putting the apps aside it's different people have different ways of explaining things and I remember a math professor I had in college and this was early this might have been like I must have been I was either a freshman or a sophomore but he said something that always resonated with me because now you were sort of getting outside of like you know a rudimentary calculus and stuff and mathematics was starting to get very abstract and he said look if you're reading a proof and you don't understand it assume that the person who is presenting it doesn't know how to present it to you find somebody else and so I think that that really holds also for meditation which is there are just going to be some people who guide in a way that you're willing to be guided and so you shouldn't be put off if someone's listening to this thinking oh you know every time I try meditation it doesn't work for me or something like that and so I don't want to sort of name the app side went through but there were many apps that I went through that just didn't resonate for me you know just the way that they talked about this didn't make sense to me but then when you find the ones that do and there are several that do for me including Sam's waking up which you and I've been lucky enough along with a number of other folks to get the beta version of that which got it it's been six months it's been a while yeah I remember Sam giving me a to me in January the way Sam explains it really resonates with me and there are others that do so the same Jeff Warren was also one of the guides on Dan Harris is no relation to Sam Harris 10% happier I just love the way he explains stuff and so you know I would say to anybody who's listening to this who's feeling sort of bearish on meditation try a different app try a different guide try a different book try another way keep going till you find someone who can walk you through how to do this in a way that resonates and the others mentioned to others since they're very easy to test another is headspace the 10 and 10 program I think is a very very well done format for beginning us 10 minutes a day for 10 days and it is quite well done calm for some people who like the background nature sounds for instance I've used that app and many of my friends really find that to be with a female guide to be there preferred mode of meditation and then you can meditate in silence you can consider taking a TM course as I did which actually really served to kickstart a lot of my meditation because it cost money so I had that sunk cost working in my favor and it's effectively four lunch breaks over four days I want to say if I'm remembering correctly and you have to meditate in between those sessions so you have homework and you are going to feel like a dufist and a disappointment and be embarrassed if you don't do those sessions so you have someone holding you accountable I eat the teacher to actually put this into practice for at least a four day period and that in and of itself I pushed off for so long I for so so long and I remember Chase Jarvis I'll give him credit again at one point said 10 you can afford it it worked for me what is the downside if it doesn't work for you you still get to meditate with someone else for four days might that be worth it and I didn't have a good counter argument so eventually I acquiesced and took that step which was which was very it was one of the first times I finally felt what I had the first hand experience of what meditation could deliver which is in some ways equally difficult to describe as the psychedelic experience when you have your first session where you've completely lost any rumination or compulsive thinking about your to do list and it might just be the last five minutes of a 20 minute session and you come out of it and you just feel this serene piece that perhaps you haven't even touched on for 10 years you go oh okay now I get it if this is something that I could actually call upon reliably that is a super power and for that reason I would say for that if you're going to commit to this commit to it like you would a workout program or a diet you don't go to the gym once and come back and wake up with a six pack abs the next morning for me at least if I take a break and there are periods when I live especially by the way if you eat like we've eaten in Austin we have eaten there's so much good food here you have to be very careful about portion control but if you want to get a taste for what meditation can do I would say commit to 10 days and for me at least if for whatever reason I lapse and there's certainly periods when I lapse this happens to me diet happens happens to be of exercise and occasionally it's like you know what I have a meditate for two weeks for whatever number reasons it will take me I would say five to seven days to finally stop grinding gears and shift into a calmer state there there's a certain loading phase almost like creating or something there it takes me five to seven days to click into that different gear at which point I go oh yes this is why it's so important now I remember yeah there's a great book out there called altered states which I read this year that I think does a great job of parsing that concept out which is it altered states or altered traits oh it's altered traits and it makes the point that it's not about the state thank you for that correction we've had a whole bunch of people potentially going to Amazon I can't find this book or maybe they're at that book does exist and it's completely they're on book but that's exactly the point right which is that we don't meditate for the state the state can be pleasurable I ought to be honest I don't find it that pleasurable I don't actually enjoy meditating that much sometimes I do but but as many times as I do it's difficult for me it's work it's sometimes truthfully it feels like I suck like I'm boy it's really amazing the frequency with which thoughts keep entering my mind I forget who I'm again I can't remember if it was Sam Harris or a different guide who made this point which was actually I think it was actually Jeff Warren which was he described it as the bicep curl of the brain is not the cessation of thought it's the recognition of the thought that then allows you to go back to the breath or whatever the focus is and boy that really again that's just an example of like that's not a particularly like profound difficult to understand concept but it's exactly what I needed to hear which is don't be discouraged that you keep having thoughts that's the exercise the exercise is acknowledging it recognizing it going back to the focus which in this case could be the breath or a sound or something like that and so it's not about that state that you may or may not achieve just as some people who like you and I we love exercising so we actually get a pretty good state out of it I actually if exercise provided no benefit I would still do it just because of how I feel when I do it but for many people that's not the case but exercise is still valuable if you spend an hour a day exercising it's really what it's what it's doing through that other 23 hours so that's I guess that would be the next thing I would say to anybody listening to this who's tried meditation who has found it to be unpleasurable or uninteresting or whatever it's like that's okay you're not doing it for what you experience in that 20 minutes I would also add and this just just occurred to me because I think you're you're in some ways looting to this that in my experience having observed hundreds of thousands of listeners and readers attempt or not attempt succeed or not succeed with different forms of meditation it's very important and this applies to many many different things including physical exercises as far as as I'm concerned but the good program that you follow I let's let's lower it even further the consistent program that you follow is better than the perfect program that you quit so if you're having trouble following a meditation program and you've committed to doing it daily which is a very important commitment in the beginning keep lowering the bar if you think 20 minutes is too much do 10 minutes 10 minutes too much do five minutes if concentration meditation is too difficult use a guided meditation and I recall at one point there were there are two things that I recall having been said to me I think tarabrock mentioned the first I could be mis-tributing but I think it was tarabrock of first said this to me her book Radical Acceptance by the way ties into everything that we're talking about beautifully it had a huge impact on me and has had a huge impact on many people it's the type of title that's going to scare off a lot of people because I think it's going to be a bunch of woohandaway of you stuff there's a little bit of woo in there but it is a incredibly good book Radical Acceptance if you have any type of emotional patterns or thought patterns it's seem to control you as opposed to the other way around this is a worthwhile book and her guide in meditation is very good but we were chatting a header on the podcast on my own podcast and I believe was tarabrock said the repetition for doing the bicep curl isn't the 20 minute session where you sit perfectly without having a single extraneous thought occur the repetition is when you get distracted and something comes up and then bringing it back to the breath so you should be happy when that happens because that is the work the work isn't doing it perfectly every time it took me three years to understand that yeah three years of frustration and am I doing this right and you know why can't I stop thinking and and just all of this misunderstanding but boy once you get what the bicep curl is it's freeing and it makes the pass fail bar lower which for many of the people who most need meditation which I think has a brand like me branding problem it should be called you know emotional non-reactivity training or something that sounds very appealing to you know type A driven people emotional non-reactivity conditioning program there you go or just warm bath for the mind might be appealing to other people but meditation as such is it's a word that's becomes it's so overused and unfortunately could use a rebrand but for the time being meditation and a successful meditation session should in the beginning be as easy as possible to fit into your life you need to stack the deck particularly in the beginning and TM transcendental meditation was very good at instilling this in the training for me at least they said if you say the mantra once in a session that is a successful session you have 20 minutes to say a two-cellable mantra once that's a successful session and you might even drop it further and say you know this is the goal this would be miraculous but if I just sit for 20 minutes with my eyes closed that's a successful meditation session and sometimes I've honestly wondered how much of the benefit comes from some of the mental practices versus just sitting still and breathing with my eyes closed. Well that's actually really interesting that that gets to something I want to talk a little bit about which is the study of psychedelics but while we're on that topic it's it's hard to sometimes study these things because of these performance biases right it's hard to disaggregate the effect of just sitting there for 20 minutes and luckily some of those experiments have been which is you know you take a group and instead of saying the control group just doesn't do anything maybe you have the control group sit in silence for 20 minutes and then you can sort of disagree at those things. So Tim you've spoken with me quite a bit about your interest in funding science and that goes back to even before the discussion of psychedelics but very recently you've made a pretty large commitment are you comfortable talking about that publicly. I am I am very very comfortable talking about publicly I have almost entirely redirected not just what I would have invested in startups but a multiple of that into scientific research. I've made the commitment for me which is by far the largest commitment to not just science but even any given startup that I've ever made financially and that's a million dollars a minimum of a million dollars over the next several years several meaning three or four and I expect I'll exceed that one million dollar amount with primarily a focus on psilocybin and mdma but that could extend to other compounds which which I also find to be understood and that have been in some ways shelved for decades for primarily political and not scientifically justifiable reasons. When we started talking about this when you were thinking about it I remember one of the stories that you really liked was a relatively unknown story in the world of philanthropy unless you dig deep in the animals about the woman by the name of Katherine McCormick that story really resonated with you what was it about that story? Well you should you should tell this story because I think it's it's so noteworthy on a number of different levels but what struck me was how if time to write and if thought about intelligently where you're focusing on points of leverage how even a single person with relatively moderate amounts of investment and moderate is relative right but let me rephrase that how how someone or a small group of people if concentrating on points of leverage in furthering in this case scientific studies can really bend the arc of history in a way that most people would find unbelievable because when folks think of say pharma or bringing a new drug to market in the largest scale census it's billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars but that story was appealing to me because on many levels but what I'd love to do is have you tell it and then I will I will point out the the parts if this were a Kindle chapter which parts I would highlight to go back to to remind myself of certain things but why don't you tell the story because it's such a great example of what one person or a small group of committed people can do I'll leave it at that well it can be probably be read about more eloquently than I can restate it but the just of it was Catherine McCormick and I believe the early 60s or late 50s met a gentleman I believe his name was Gregory Pankis if I'm not mistaken and I think that's right I had a dinner party or a copy of it yeah and and basically he explained to her that he was pretty convinced he could chemically synthesize hormones that could be served as a birth control pill or serve as a birth control pill for women and she was no dummy or self she went to it with MIT yeah I believe had been involved with also funding housing for additional female students so they could attend yeah and her hypothesis was if we could create a birth control pill we could completely change the interaction that women can have with education with work with the family balance etc now we take this we listen to the story today and we think well what's the big deal like so what she funded the research for the birth control pill but the reality of it is at the time again I can't remember I must have the dates wrong but certainly it was long enough ago that this was viewed as an absolute no go I mean there was simply you know birth control was such a taboo and what's really interesting is she decided to fund something that was incredibly risky that no farm a company was willing to touch with a ten foot pole because it was viewed as just a way to sink money into a bottomless pit that could never achieve the regulatory approval and using again a relatively small sum of money and I believe in today's dollars it's to the tune of about 25 million dollars she sunk into the work of this guy pinkus and one other gentleman whose name is escaping me over the span of something like about a decade yeah maybe eight years and when you my favorite graph that I ever saw which was kind of the holy shit moment was the graph of the number of women in graduate schools professional school law school business school whatever pre and post the introduction of the birth control pill and it's you don't get to see a lot of hockey sticks you know as one of my friends once put it it's really cool when the data don't need statistics to be analyzed it's not like well there was a statistically significant increase in the rate at which women entered the workforce not like you didn't have to say the words statistically significant it was a step function change and I don't know I just I thought that was such an interesting story and I remember when you and I were talking about this a while ago I I don't know we've been away I told you the story but you you seem to really grip to it there were many reasons for it I think partially being at the time in Silicon Valley and surrounded by venture capital I saw some of the stupidest I don't know how else to put it just stupidest non viable ideas raise tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars let's just stick with film thru optic dollars no I mean thru profit okay startups repeatedly I mean you just saw dozens and hundreds of examples over time of this and it struck me that we find ourselves in a unique time which sposes something it goes without saying every time is a unique time but in the sense that long ago this is worth discussing for a quick second psychedelic specifically LSD were through the controlled I think it's the controlled substance is act scheduled put into the the schedule one class of drug classification which means high potential for addiction no no known medical or no medical application no demonstrate medical application putting them in the same class as heroin and to be clear for the listener who might not appreciate that even cocaine is scheduled to right which means it still has potential for addiction that everybody acknowledges but it does have at least one viable medical application which is it turns out to be a pretty good local anesthetic in the nose which is ironic of course but it therefore does have a medical use and it's used routinely in antisurgery so if these compounds are so useful if they can have some of the effects without guarantee of course it's not batting a thousand every time if you have a hundred people at random or using these some with direction some without you're not going to have a perfect record but if if even some of the time the effects can be achieved the outcomes can be seen that we're discussing how did these compounds including LSD end up in this category and there it's a it's a multi factorial problem and it's hard to say there's one causal agent but there are a few things that happened at the time number one many people don't realize pollen gets into this really fascinating but LSD 25 which was first isolated or synthesized by Albert Hoffman it was developed on the part or on behalf of a farm accompanied it was later used rose correct I want to say the sandals oh you're right you're right it was sandals and then it was later used in a program that if I remember incorrectly was CIA led called MK Ultra where it might be used as a truth serum for interrogations and things of this type or to confuse and sabotage enemies of the state and it got out into the wild and then the adventure began so to speak and LSD was widely distributed and at the time you had parents who had never experienced psychedelics we were going into the Vietnam era and we had a number of characters come on to the scene in a very high profile ways one of them being and he cannot be even though he is often given the blame I don't think it's it's fair to do this you know literally but Tim Lieri came onto the scene he was at Harvard as was Richard Alpert who later became Ram dos and the things exploded at Harvard and they were both I believe fired I don't think they resigned preemptively because psilocybin was given to an undergraduate when it was only supposed to be administered to graduate students and at some point Lieri decided that science was too slow and that the way to effect cultural change was to have tens of millions of people yet a specific number in mind and that that would effectively lead to a tipping point where all these positive effects on society would be inevitable and if you think about the cultural setting you have a lot of young people being told to drop out of school to resist war efforts and all of that made a number of figures including Lieri very high profile targets that could not in some ways be ignored by the administration and so Nixon famously said Timothy Lieri's the most dangerous man in America and you had parents who could not in any way conceive of the experiences that their children were having on these compounds and that along with dozens of other things was a recipe for political crackdown which is exactly what happened what you have now is you have parents who are well in many cases certainly products of the sixties who have had psychedelics experiences you have people who are in positions of power or in regulatory organizations who have in in some cases experience psychedelics you also have studies now being conducted even though it's it's with great difficulty because of all of the approvals and DEA oversight and so on that's required that are going back to the dozens and hundreds of studies that were performed before the the crackdown and rescheduling and applying more rigorous scientific standards and that is combined with a number of as you mentioned earlier epidemic level problems that we're experiencing that are costing I would have to imagine billions of billions of dollars namely opiate addiction depression PTSD right if you add up the costs associated with those three if we want to be a little crass about it and just look at the profit loss it makes a lot of sense based on the data thus far to explore some of these compounds and that's part of the reason why for instance in the case of MDMA and PTSD the FDA has granted MDMA breakthrough therapy designation which means that not only is the process expedited for ultimately phase three trials that the FDA is in a sense a collaborator so instead of saying all right your methodology is approved and I'm going to apologize and advance this is not phase three trials are not my or effects for these so if I make any if I miss speak I apologize and certainly feel free to correct me in comments somewhere but the FDA is effectively a partner who helps them to navigate the entire process instead of saying your methodology is approved see in three years and you're going to get a pass fail which is a precarious position for any compound let alone something that is currently scheduled to be that MDMA is and we don't have to get into right now but there's also something called the special protocol assessment SPA which should hopefully if the stars align in some ways which I think they they very well might give MDMA a very high probability of ultimately being prescribable with and used in supervised settings it would not be a take home drug in other words but PTSD and specifically with respect to let's say returning war veterans or victim of sexual abuse is a it is a highly bipartisan issue or I should better say it's a non-partisan issue it's very hard for someone to say fuck the vets so the risk of of that getting shot down politically I'm not going to say zero because it's never zero but it's there are more attractive targets if you're looking for a reelection or looking for press time there are safer targets to go after to achieve that than this and then within the scientific community looking at psilocybin which there are at least two entities right now that are presenting phase two data to the FDA and I'm optimistic that within the next year at least one of them will proceed into phase three trials psilocybin has shown remarkable efficacy at least based on preliminary data for end of life or I should say event based depression and people with terminal diagnoses terminal cancer diagnoses and that may end up getting extended to major depressive disorder which is to be continued to be determined but I've already helped to raise funding and also apply funding myself to a study that will be looking at treatment resistant depression at Johns Hopkins utilizing psilocybin and that means I believe by the book to pre-chronic depression that is failed at least two interventions or two other treatments. Are there other agents to him? I mean loosely speaking and this is a gross oversimplification and we will probably get into a few of these time permitting certainly as you said MDMA has really shown pretty remarkable efficacy in PTSD. It's it's wild it's one of those similar to the graph you mentioned I've related to McCormick. Yeah it's just not subtle. It's not subtle. You don't need the p-value to see the difference. No no no no it's I think I'm getting this right anyone interested can certainly look up maps that you can find them at maps.org who have spearheaded a lot of this but I believe that psychotherapy alone something like 27% effective at reducing the scale measurement and I'm adding a little bit here but let's just say that there is a rating of 0 to 10 for determining severity of PTSD anything about three is PTSD something along those lines this is a bit of ad lib but I think it's something between 20 and 27% decreased to below a three so they were no longer they would no longer be diagnosed as having PTSD with psychotherapy alone I don't remember the timeframe. When psychotherapy was combined with MDMA was something like 70% I mean it's just not subtle at all. So which again we could spend just two hours just talking about the role the relationship of trauma and psychological damage and how MDMA can help with that the other thing of course which we talked about very briefly earlier was iboga and ibogane in the treatment of opioid addiction which probably has the worst success rate amongst societal epidemics that are being treated by conventional means I mean there really aren't great options for for the individuals with with opioid addiction and then of course celacid but as you said on end of life depression major depressive along with smoking cessation I heard it's even being looked at now for alcoholism. It is and there are few predominant classes people can look at when it comes to psychedelics I believe you have the there are the trip to means and then the phenethyl amines I believe it is but we don't have to get into all that partially because I'll just embarrass myself but coming back to the default node network which I think is worth returning to for a second which listeners might recall is this collection of different parts of the brain that appear to be active when you are doing nothing what is doing nothing mean and this was discovered I believe in part when scientists were doing calibrations within FMR I'm a chance to do nothing we want to get a baseline and this is the part of the brain that's quite exciting what the hell is going on and it appears to be highly activated when people are engaging in any type of self-referential thinking I had as it affect so not only like think about fear but what makes you fear what makes you fearful okay boom then default mode not work seems to light up any type of temporal projection in other words thinking about the past thinking about the future seems to also light this up and pollen does a great job of digging into this in the book and a number of people have written about this in very eloquent terms robin car her at Harris out of the UK is one of them but to do just pose a question that I think is something that's being explored currently if say anxiety is being stuck in the future and being depressed is being stuck in the past what happens if you're able to temporarily suspend or deactivate that system to some extent and to give yourself that witness perspective so you can look at yourself without being yourself and the implication if many of these psychedelic compounds are able to achieve that is an even Tom Insol who I think is the former head of the National Institute on or of mental health and I am age if you look at OCD you look at different types of depression different types of anxiety and so on these are nice these are very cleanly separated out in some type of what is the the term for this desk reference the people use for the DSM DSM in the DSM but they may all be slightly different species of the same thing which is why something like psilocybin appears to be LSD very similar story mescalin probably very similar story at high enough doses can be used for anything that appears to involve obsessive thought patterns or behaviors that includes alcoholism it includes smoking it includes opiate addiction and there are studies that are seeking funding right now I know at Johns Hopkins related to opiate addiction through the lens of psilocybin treatment which I'm very very interested in eating disorders like anorexia these may in fact be very interrelated phenomena and conditions so you mentioned a few that are LSD I think is off the table not for scientific reasons but for political reasons it's just too loaded there's too much baggage and let us not forget that the media plays a very large role in how politics respond to things and in today's day and age I do not have a high level of confidence that LSD since it was once painted as the villain is not it's too seductive I think in a clickbait world to not fall into the same bear trap in a way so psilocybin then you have MDMA which is thought by referred to as some people as an anactogen or empathogen this is not probably not scientifically too granularly accurate but it appears to tone down that's not a scientific term but tone down the amygdala and fear response that we have to say recalling or reliving traumatic events and it allows us to people say with PTSD we've seen their friends heads blown off or had to blow other people's heads off whatever might be people have been raped etc to in some sense clean up a very messy experience that did a lot of damage and to help people to heal themselves in nonverbal ways this is really key it's very it's very it's very hard for many people to talk their way out of something they didn't talk their way into that's so well said I mean you said in one sentence what I tried to say in like 20 sentences a while ago about the experiences that can cause pain can be so jarring that it should be at least acknowledged or considered that equally jarring chemical experiences might be necessary to put that new powder on the slope definitely so you have MDMA MDMA I'll be honest I was I was biased in some ways against MDMA for a long time because A I didn't have much personal experience with anything chemically related MDMA I had a fear associated with it because of research which I think has since been largely debunked in terms of risks for people who are predisposed to depression for instance it was also at one point viewed as an end is still used recreational as a party drug and I've I've really been swayed to the other side I'm very bullish on MDMA as a therapy I think that it is extremely it's an extremely powerful inflexible tool that does not entail the type of perceptual distortion that some of these second Alex do which is not to say I am not bullish on second Alex I am but it requires much more sophisticated training to administer so MDMA I boga and I begin going back to MDMA I do think it is important to point out if anybody is listening to this thinking well of all of these compounds MDMA is pretty easy to get and you know you can get it packaged and other things and it's ecstasy et cetera but this goes back to intent setting and integration I really do not I am not convinced that just taking MDMA going to a party is somehow going to unwind any of these problems I mean this really I would go further than that and I would bet against it yeah if someone gave me a hundred grand and they said all right this person is going to take MDMA go to a party ten times what is the likelihood that it's going to fix ex-long standing problem I'd go a hundred thousand dollars every single dollar against yeah I would short it and I know people in fact who have used MDMA recreationally and then used it in supervised settings and it is as if they are taking a different drug yeah that that just can't be overstated and I'm not just staying at cause I'm a doctor and I'm supposed to say something responsible but I mean that regardless it's and that for me is the urgency around this stuff it's I think about I think about myself frankly but I think about my patients and I think about a lot of my patients that would benefit from these things that I've experienced or even things that I haven't experienced that I've seen people experience and I I've never had such a sense of urgency around this I mean prior to this the most urgency I ever had was waiting for PCSK nine inhibitors to come on the market when I read that first paper in the New England Journal of Medicine about 12 years ago on the discovery of this type of you know these these individuals who had missense mutations in that enzyme that lowered their LDL significantly but boy the the anxiety might be the wrong word but the anticipation I had for that class of drugs which anybody listening to this is probably falling asleep thinking that's here an interesting guy if that's what was keeping you up at night waiting for that drug but but this takes it to another level which is almost nobody I know has not been traumatized on some level and it doesn't always have to be something that is so obvious so you know we've all been traumatized we've all sort of been hurt we're all dealing with these things and yet I feel how quickly can these things go through this regulatory pathway to get into the hands of people who would know how to administer them I certainly wouldn't right even if these things were legal today that's only half the battle it's can you create enough practitioners that know you know how to select the right patients and how to apply the treatment because this is in many ways harder than any other treatments we have today you know people talk today about the importance of combining psychotherapy with any depressants but that's really the tip of the iceberg compared and it's it's also tricky from a commercial standpoint in so much as part of the reason these compounds haven't been picked up like a football and run to the the end zone by big pharma is that many of these studies only involve two or three sessions with psilocybin yeah a naturally occurring molecule in these cases it's synthesized but there's a lot more money to be made in something that you can charge an arm in a leg for that you have to take on a daily basis or and every other day basis indefinitely as opposed to two or three times with some pre-work and post-work with durable effects in many cases that that's financially an unattractive model to many people and I think it's a mistake there are some for profit companies out there I just say startups who are going after this and I'll be very disappointed if they try to make their money on the molecule by blocking other people from doing a researcher manufacturing and good manufacturing in GMP facilities and so on rather I think they should make their money on the services on the therapy so that's that's maybe a separate discussion now why is ibogaine taken the longest track and why is that still the one that seems to have gained the least traction for testing in the United States I've spoken to a number of people philanthropists who are really interested in this open addiction problem and yet they are understandably not interested in funding research outside of the United States and basically their view is until the DA and the FDA allow for a similar pathway we're not interested in funding this and I worry that there's a bit of a stalemate there is this is this thawing I don't think it is yet to thaw there are some researchers in a blanking on names I apologize but there are a number of researchers are doing very good work looking at ibogaine have been studying at ibogaine in the United States part of what makes ibogaine tricky if on one end of the spectrum you have mdma which again I don't consider a classical psychedelic but as a tool that can be applied to some of the same conditions what makes mdma attractive is general low toxicity relative ease of administration short duration if we're looking at I want to say four to six hours let's say maybe a little bit longer four to eight hours i began falls on the opposite of the spectrum now i before we get to put it on the opposite of the spectrum I should say I know people very directly if you had family members who are her when addicts and say prostituting themselves I mean on death store if they weren't going to die from an overdose they might die from getting shot in the street and in a case like that where nothing else has worked including some say alternatives like method on i've seen kids who were ivy and has worked I mean don't the practitioners of this offer that at one year the recidivism is only twenty percent I don't know the exact numbers but that's given what else I've seen with these compounds it wouldn't I don't find that unbelievable yeah if i'm recalling that's only with two weeks of of intervention now these are people that are put into a you know a very heavily supervised detox environment where the the ibogaine itself are administered over a one week period outside of the you know pre and post integration so I think the entire therapy if i recall it's about six weeks there are there are many different formats and I know people who have been involved with running some of these clinics and certainly there are people like goboramate who have looked at opiate addiction very closely but ended up as I understand at least looking at iawasca and others for helping people who are addicted to opiates i'd be gain is very it's it's unlike some of the others such as psilocybin in that it acts on a whole slew of different receptors and let's discuss what puts it on the opposite end so yes it can have these seemingly miraculous effects on opiate addiction and part of the reason for that experientially is i understand it and I've never gone for a full ride i began or iboga psychedelic experience and i have no desire to it is very unpleasant it is very long so it can last as i understand it people feel free to correct me but 24 to 36 hours that is a long time and many people experience a full review of their lives and a controlled death experience whereby they get to see if in the beginning of life almost like a slideshow the decisions they've made how they've heard themselves the other people they've heard how their addiction is affected things and what goboramate they would how he might frame it is instead of asking why the addiction asks why the pain and the addiction is often a response almost inevitably but often response i'll say often to some type of trauma or pain and if you don't address that in some fashion allow people to reintegrate that somehow the likelihood of recidivism is very very high so just from a phenomenological perspective which is fancy i'm saying subject of experiential standpoint many people report that biochemically and there are people who are looking at for instance using a metabolite of i began nor i began which may mitigate some of the risks and this is part of the reason why i began hasn't taken and the risk i think we've stated is implicitly hardy i think yeah cardiac a-rhythmia people have and can die of cardiac events in using i began i don't know the specifics but i believe you can screen for this in a number of different ways to minimize the risk and then certainly you can monitor in ways having other types of more conventional pharmaceuticals on hand in the case there is some indicator of of a pending cardiac event or cardiac event itself that's one of the major risks it is one of the more potentially dangerous psychedelics it almost certainly is because compared at least say lSD or silcib and for which i don't believe there is a known ld50 meaning but you could experience better than i can yeah they all do fifty being the dose at which fifty percent of a population would receive lethal dose exactly biochemically when i was going to say this putting putting all that stuff aside for it for a moment what's so odd about this and i'm not an opiate specialist but i've had family members die from opiate overdoses i don't even know if i told you about this relatively recently and my best friend growing up on long island also died of a offentinal overdose so i have first hand experience with the pain of losing loved ones to this epidemic it appears that many people can come out of these i-bagaine treatments with close to no physical withdrawal symptoms and i don't know how that works i really don't but it does seem to be certainly one of the constituent pieces of this experience that lead to the success rate that many people are which is really interesting because it's true that opiate addiction opiate withdrawal is not physiologically harmful the way alcohol withdrawal is so delirium trements so that these detees that people get when they withdraw from alcohol will be fatal so you actually have to manage these people with benzodiazepines and other medications as you taper someone off you don't have to do that with opiates but the withdrawal is nevertheless psychologically devastating so that's interesting that you could mitigate i've read accounts where people talk very similarly about i-bagaine the way you described or the way i don't know if it was you or if it was Michael pollen on the podcast talking about the smoker i think it was Michael pollen talking about the smoker who says you know my lungs are just too beautiful to be insulted with this stuff and like i realized that and i'm like and it's like as silly as that might sound to someone listening to it that experience if profound enough can have a have a life-changing event that is durable and that's that the key is the durability and similarly i've heard these i've read these accounts of people who you know have been completely addicted to narcotics you know the account i'm thinking of in particular was it was someone using heroin and they came away from this thinking i could never stick that needle in my arm again like i could never do that to myself again because i now saw this connection i have to a plant and or another person and or another organism and again i i know that i realize that when i say that it sounds really silly it takes this or it brings us full circle in the sense also back to the beginning when i said that you shouldn't and you don't have to go through life simply tolerating yourself at best because there are a thousand things that could follow because but in part if you don't have any regard for yourself if you think you're worthless or if you think you're fatally flawed if you think you're a fuck up if you think you can't get anything right or you just don't you don't have some intrinsic love for yourself you don't see any beauty in yourself why wouldn't you be addicted why wouldn't you stick that needle in your arm why wouldn't you smoke pot five times a day and two now why wouldn't not to say there aren't applications the cannabis don't freak out people out there it's an interesting space we don't have time to get into it right now but there are so many ways you can numb or damage yourself which is a in some ways a logical coping mechanism if you have a lower guard for yourself but when you sense an interconnectedness and you suddenly have empathy not just for other people like we've felt through our experiences but empathy for yourself you look back at like the 10-year-old Peter or the 10-year-old ten-year-old ten-year-old ten-year-old and I'm just like Jesus Christ fucking poor kid I mean and I can sit with that feeling and I actually identify with that kid and forgive that kid and assure that kid everything's going to be all right it's right now in words through this microphone probably not going to have the impact that I would hope it to have but for people to feel that as if you are in the same room with that younger version of yourself can be transformative beyond anything that I could convey right now and when you have an experience like that as ludicrous as it might sound the idea of injecting some type of numbing agent into your body just becomes inconceivable in the in the same way that it would be inconceivable as you mentioned earlier how you treat yourself as ultimately how you treat others like what would you it like inject your son with that you're like to numb his experience of life of course not yeah that was just one of the most powerful experiences I ever had when I really finally accepted all of the issues I needed to accept and go into therapy was something they made me do which was carry around a picture of me at a certain age before certain things had happened that were pivotal in sort of shaping both the positive and negative aspects of my personality and the idea was and again it just works out that way it worked out that way for me that my oldest son is at about that age and just for what it's worth looks like me so it became a very easy way to look at him and say well that was me and it turns out that that was the that was the bridge to understanding it's very it's actually if you're a parent what parent can't find empathy for their child and that's like this stepping stone and so to think that these agents can do that because maybe not everybody has that luxury of having a child or having a child that looks like them at the same age when they were traumatized or something like that I mean it's it's it's very powerful and you know it just I guess it's uh there are many problems to which I really honestly have no not even the foggy as clue how to go about solving them from a practical standpoint like like talk about climate change like we could talk about climate change all day long and we could certainly wax philosophically on the lots of regulatory things that could be done to mitigate it but you start to realize very quickly that politically these things become challenging and you have all sorts of different economies around the world and they'd all have to be in lockstep and and you sort of not to be dismissive of these things or say we shouldn't work very hard at solving these but the solution space isn't that clear to me and yet when you see a problem that in my mind is the single most important problem that's plaguing our civilization and I know that's a big statement that's a super big statement and I realize it's also probably naive when you consider that there are many other problems going on but unhappiness is at the root of more pain I would suspect than any ailment that falls in the quote unquote physical body and to think that we have compounds that could play such an important role that are really facing you know challenges and getting approved I just find that really frustrating it's frustrating and it has been frustrating for people like for instance Rick Doblin who heads up maps who've been he's been at it since 1986 1986 which is just to make it happen before hand if you take into account I believe that that's when maps was officially formed if I'm not getting my facts wrong and we're at a very exciting time now where MDMA is being expedited psilocybin is certainly on its way for people who are interested in learning more about this I think maps.org is fantastic place to look in fact one of the areas where maps could you support as I understand it is in taking their approach to legitimizing MDMA use therapeutically in the US to Europe so there will be steps they'll take with the EMA I think it is which is the FDA equivalent in the EU for hopefully facilitating MDMA use in Europe so that that's certainly if you're looking to become involved with exploring and potentially supporting this as I am that is one clear and present need and it's we're also a very exciting point because psilocybin is one example which has a lot of good research to support it there's a lot more being done at places like Hopkins and NYU and many other places now may have and this remains to be studied but it's plausible that it could have profound applications to opioid addiction for instance and this comes back also to the McCormick story with birth control because the I don't I don't recall what the first compound was that was FDA proved but it wasn't approved for birth control I think it was approved for menstrual disorders that's right that was the thin end of the wedge was women whose menstrual cycles were unusually heavy or uncomfortable or the first approval exactly so and that's the most important step is it's much easier to use something off label once it's been approved than to get something approved right so you pick the right indication that's what's also impressed me about these organizations is just the strategic thought they've put into this which is understanding a roadmap that is interested in the least resistance right because to what does it take to reschedule something if you want to take it from the same classes a heroin and put it into a class where it can be prescribed with proper supervision medical supervision you need to well you you you one of the approaches like cocaine and the the nasally anesthetic demonstrate one clear medical application and if that is depression in terminal cancer patients that is a legitimate medical application and then that entire trance can get in motion that's one nice thing about where the DE and the FDA fall out is for the most part there's a sense that look once we've as these agencies done our job in scheduling something we're going to put faith in the practitioner to use his or her judgment as to how much latitude to grant around the application and and I'll also mention one thing just in case we have regulators or lawmakers policy makers people within the FDA or DEA who are listening and that is lead policy book check out policy book and immerse yourself in this fascinating area of research and and I'll give if like a lot of people you just don't have the bandwidth to dedicate a lot of time to this a something that pollen has referred to on a number of different occasions and that is the addictive potential so what is the addictive potential of these compounds if we're looking at say solosciving specifically we could use other examples but if you take a rat put it in a cage and you give it one dispenser little little lever that they can push to dispense food and another dispenser with cocaine that it can use to dispense cocaine it will consume cocaine to the exclusion of food until it dies in many cases if you do that with food and say salesciving and it gets delivered a whopping dose of salesciving it will press that lever once and the rat's like okay that was enough and it goes to the food and that rather than having high addictive potential many of these compounds have anti as we've already discussed anti-addictive potential and my god it's it is terrifying when I look at where I grew up on say long island and you look at the obvious put putting aside the all of the stuff that I don't see or hear about but the obvious among people I grew up with among my friends who have died of overdoses family members who have died of overdoses these are in some cases educated people in some cases not they are using prescription medications these are widely distributed easily prescribed medications that have demonstrated incredible abusive potential and to think that we have these molecules that can be produced at relatively low cost at scale that are not just non-addictive but anti-addictive really provide some hope that we can counteract some of these incredible epidemics I mean I you might have been the person who told me this could have been someone else but was it last year that opiate deaths exceeded automotive accidents yeah for it used to be that automotive accident was the leading cause of death for people up to a certain age and I believe the age is 40 and now opiate overdose has offset that so you know this isn't an isolated issue anymore you know for me I think I think the rate limiting step is actually going to be training the clinicians to administer these things I think that's going to become the bottleneck and that's why I hope that you know and we we have friends who were psychiatrists psychologists who have become very interested in this and that to me is really heartwarming because they're actually going to be among the people who need to lead the charge on this yeah and there are groups thinking about this certainly both maps and other organizations that are involved to civil servant are thinking about this people who have come to the table to provide some funding like myself and for instance the Bronner family of Bronner soap and others certainly their technologists who have come to the table many of many of them have done so anonymously are very well aware that having these compounds legalized for supervised use is step one and that there will be a very very real need for training clinicians and the wheels are already in motion with prototyping some of this there's a there's a group called CIS at California which is prototyping some some training protocols for therapists who are licensed in various ways already so that when these compounds are available through prescription that there are trained clinicians who get in minister so we'll see we'll say I'm very optimistic but this is where I will be applying a lot of my focus and these problems do not they do not discriminate these problems these addictions depression anxiety that people experience in daily basis don't care what call you are don't care what gender you are don't care how much or how little money you have I mean given how publicly I've talked about for instance the content of the TED talk that I that I put out there on the depression I've had people come out of the woodwork from my listenership my readership some of the wealthiest people in the world who suffer from debilitating depression whose kids are addicted to heroin and then on the opposite end of the spectrum people who listen to the podcast who are just scraping by the same set of issues debilitating and you know in the last few years I've developed a real sense of optimism about myself and my life quite frankly number one is a starting point which I think is a starting point like before you try to save the world is a good idea to try to save yourself and I have come away completely convinced that many of these stories I told myself which were crippling were unnecessary and that they can be wiped and you can write new stories new narratives for yourself and we talked about meditation there's a book you introduced me to then I think we should we should certainly mention also this is Saul for happy can you talk about this yeah so Rickerson who is a mutual friend and you actually introduced me to Rick probably about five years ago he gave me a copy of this book and it was one of those things that just sort of sat there for I don't know six months and it was just in the queue but didn't you know I didn't really appreciate why I ought to read it as soon as it was given to me you know something in the midst of a crisis sort of brought it to my to my attention a little more quickly and I just devoured it and so if if the Terrence real book I don't want to talk about it has now jumped into the number one spot of books I've gifted most Saul for happy is probably in the number two spot and those go that yeah I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right but M.O last name G.A.W.D.A.T. Yeah and that's sort of pushed mistakes were made but not by me into the the now number three spot just ahead probably of Shirley your joking Mr. Feynman it's weird it's interesting it says something about us the books we like to give people doesn't it you thanked Michael Paul and at the end of your interview or maybe it was somewhere in the midst of it but I thought it was at the end of the interview for writing the book that he did because you said it was the book you wanted to read and that you wish you could have written but you're no slouch yourself when it comes to writing books is there is there anything that if you if Michael hadn't have done that and you would have been writing that book in addition to all the stuff we've talked about today is there anything else that you would have included in that book that that wasn't included and that's hard that's a hard he's a tough act of follow a very tough act of follow and I'm so pleased that he wrote the book because I have been very clearly biased in the sense that I am a I've seen the power of these compounds firsthand and I'm not shy about as we've seen in this conversation putting myself clearly on the side of the support I don't think they should be available at every 7-11 some people think it should be every drug should just be available for anyone else to pick them up at any time I I disagree with that position completely but I am nonetheless exceptionally bullish on the scientific research and ultimately the rescheduling and widening of making these compounds available to people through qualified professionals in supervision Michael has such a pedigree and is so widely respected as a and I don't think you'd mind me saying this a skeptical highly skeptical investigative journalist that I'm I couldn't be happier that that he published his book before anything that I might write on the subject if I were to write a book about or including I should say a discussion of psychedelics it would differ in along the lines of Collins and my writing styles meaning Pauline is is so brilliant at taking the history and science and characters in a given field and weaving it into a first-person narrative of his exploration of all of those things much like John McFee I don't want to digress he's also just a hero of mine but they're both so good at that I would never try to outpoll and pollen I'll get my face ripped off I could my book would just be a poor poor poor imitation of of something that he would do masterfully you know as I'm writing a book now sword interrupt it makes it that much more apparent to me when I read good books how much I suck and I'm not saying that in a I that's not a negative self-talk although it sounds like it is just the reality it's like look I mean these people are great for a reason and it's it's exactly what you said it's like the best books are not lecturing you they're bringing you on a journey and when when they can do that in really complicated topics and bring you along and also interweave history non-linearly that's yeah oh it's it's amazing but I would say just to give you a smooch on the forehead that much like the best meditation approach or app or teacher in the world for me may very likely drive you nuts and is not the right person for you that stylistically some writers some books will speak to you or grab your attention in an otherwise overflowing workload and somewhat and that differs person to person so rather than trying to outpoll and pollen or outmix feed McFee for God's sake that would be a losing attempt I've realized that I'm not what I enjoy doing is providing firsthand accounts of my self experimentation followed by prescriptive recommendations that aren't intended to work for everybody but that serve as more of a shoes-yone adventure buffet of options that I have vetted to at least work on myself and a number of close friends who span some different genders different age groups and so on and that's what I did with for our body that's right done with all these different books so if I were to write a book including psychedelics it would likely include experiments with other modalities other vehicles other tools that also produce not my neatly noticeable but profound changes in consciousness which is really the stage upon which everything happens right and in doing so provide you with an opportunity to rewrite the story of your life or to gain perspectives that are otherwise inaccessible and that might include sensory deprivation tanks it might include neurofeedback it might include other types of non-psychedelic pharmaceuticals it might include ketamine for example ketamine we didn't get an answer that would take a while but yeah ketamine is a whole separate ketolophish and I think my book would be more diffuse in that sense thematically connected but with independent modular chapters that includes some likely extreme experiment that I conduct myself and then report back and say I guess what I push the envelope and went way too far so you don't have to let's dial that let's dial that back 80 percent and here's something you can try that I think has an acceptable risk benefit profile that's probably the book that that I would write. Speaking of your books I don't know if I told you this story I think I did but if not it's worth retelling totally unrelated to this but it just made me think of it so like I don't maybe a year ago or so I'm in the airport and I just remember like my flight was delayed and I was sort of like a friend who I don't talk to that often like maybe once a year he called me and he's like dude I just read about you in a book today I think I know where you go and I was like I was like really what do you mean he's like yeah yeah you're in this book it's called biggest tools and I was like what he goes yeah yeah like there's a chapter on you in this book and I mean oh do you mean tools of titans he's like yeah yeah yeah that's it that's it and just kept like he just didn't even and it's it was just and he's Israeli and he has it like an accent so it's like you could tell that like the expression biggest tools didn't mean to him what it meant to me and I just thought that was the funny thing so to this day I feel like proud to be one of the biggest tools well you know that would be maybe the alternate title of the the podcast that you and I have joked about which is you know dumb things that smart people do and that's a separate conversation but there's so many ridiculous habits and obsessions that anyone who could be considered smart has if you have not seen it already just where where should people find egg boxing I will link to it but there's it's it's got its own Facebook page at this point it's hilarious that'll be a teaser I do have one final question that's not on the topic at all of what we've discussed but given that we have now between the two of us in the past two and a half hours drink I want to say 20 topo cheaker my bladder right now is robably at its maximum capacity I think pretty soon I'm going to develop hydrant of frosis so we're going to have to bring this thing to a close one of the questions I get asked all the time is you know people say oh you're such good friends with Tim like does he still do acts does he still do why he wrote about this he talked about this I wonder does he still do it and so I was thinking for the person out there who's sort of wondering like how his Tim evolved when you think of all the things you have written about when you think about all the lessons you have codified for people what are the three four maybe five things that you have written about in some of your books that still consistently shape how you have continued to optimize your trajectory so the three to five things that I would say I return to most reliably are perhaps unsexated some people but one would be some type of hinging exercise movement I noticed that problems crop up when these are emitted for any extended periods time by hinging movement or hipp hinging movement I mean some type of deadlift or kettlebell swing two handed kettlebell swing very very simple to incorporate that into an exercise program I do not believe unless you have some type of competitive agenda that you need to do these more than once a week you can certainly do them twice a week for extra credit but kettlebell swings or deadlifts want a week prevent a whole host of issues and improve a whole host of performance factors so I'll be one number two would be fasting and entering a state of ketosis for at least one week at least once a quarter in conversations with Peter and conversations with Dom the Agustino is a mutual friend very impressive not just published researcher and scientists but also athlete himself the intermittent use of autophagy and entering the state of a fasting and ketosis seems to me to deliver a host of potential benefits with very minimal downside I also like the just the pure asceticism of the practice so we have the hinging movement like a deadlift or kettlebell we have fasting plus ketosis for an extended period at least once a quarter I just actually finished my latest segment about a month ago number three would be some type of meditative practice first thing in the morning I'm also asked constantly one of the questions that I ask sometimes which is what advice would you give your 20 year old self what advice would you give your 30 year old self and it would be meditate 10 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning don't do it after you check your email and do a b and c because you're going to fail 50% of the time you just will knock go back to it wake up right now for instance I have a foldable chair that goes on the floor believe it's called a back jack or a jack back something along those lines use quite often in meditation centers right on the floor in front of my bed that faces out a window looking at a bunch of beautiful trees and I get out of bed through a some water on my face sit down and meditate I would say that's number three absolutely a some type of non-reactivity training for 10 to 20 minutes or put another way non-reactivity rehearsal which is another reason why meditation sessions where you feel entirely scattered and you only return to the breath a few times feel like a waste of time but they are absolutely not a waste of time is that there are going to be periods throughout your day on many days when life is going to just roundhouse kick you in the face over and over again and you are going to be in that scattered state so it is good to rehearse mindfulness in that scattered state which is exactly what you're doing all right so we have the hip-inging movement at least once a week exercise wise Katosis last fasting meditation would be three number four would be the importance of group ritual and this is something that very often falls by the wayside that I forget because I've so often retreated into myself whenever I felt pain or depression or anxiety I don't want to impose that on anyone else and I feel like I should be able to figure it out on my own and just climb back into the cave that is my brain and this very often results in isolation or I'm just by myself even if I'm surrounded by other people by myself sitting in a coffee shop by myself in my own head group dinners at least once or twice a week cooking I found and this was not always the case for people interested you can check out the four hour shift for all the reasons why I find this so incredibly therapeutic but don't have to cook I just happen to find it adds a new another level of decompression but group meals at least once or twice a week would be number four and then if I had to pick a number five I would say I'm not going to use the psychedelics because we've been talking about this entire conversation if you feel like you're having trouble making yourself happy try to make someone else happy and I think that that is the workaround that very often then improves your own state so it's like if you're feeling just awful or depressed or in a funk it's like go get a coffee and pay for the person behind you I mean just exercise some of those random acts of kindness think about someone who has helped you and called them and leave them a voice meal and get them on the phone to thank them for how they've helped you and closely related to that the ties back into the meditative practice is if the meme me practice focusing on your breath focusing on your thoughts focusing on your your your your your meme meme me is maybe exacerbating some of your problems and you feel like you're you're having trouble escaping your own head take a look at meta meditation METTA also known as loving kindness meditation and I have found that to just be powerful beyond belief I didn't think it would do anything I found it kind of cheesy I thought it was kind of cliche I wrote about this a bit borrowing from the teaching of someone named shade man 10 who was an early engineer at Google and created a class called search inside yourself which was hugely oversubscribed by employees at Google I think it had some insane waiting list and this was one of the techniques he recommended so loving kindness type needed loving kindness meditation which jack cornfield has some some fantastic examples of jack cornfield KORN field and loving kind of meditation also known as meta METTA meditation and there've been multiple reports I've certainly experienced myself but by doing meta meditation say at night before going to bed do that for few days and you might have the most at piece week you have experienced in years it's it's really something else it's worth experimenting with so I would say those are my five at least the the five that come to mind right now that I would feel very comfortable defending and backing well Tim that's super helpful because I we managed just somehow figured away to spend so much time together that I when you say those things I'm like yeah I of course like we that's just what you're always doing so but I think it's great for people who are listening to this who who don't you know get the interact with you frequently who who to get that little update on stuff so you've been incredibly generous with you were time but what people probably don't realize is how generous you've been with your time off this podcast including sending me the links to like which pieces of equipment to buy for the recordings and sitting down with me and giving me the not just the one-on-one but the full course on luck do this don't do that waste time and energy on this don't waste time and energy on that so I really want to thank you I can't imagine having anybody else be the number one episode of this podcast and I I do hope that this podcast continues beyond the the initial 12 or 13 but even if it doesn't this will have been incredibly worthwhile and thank you again for your hospitality this weekend in particular I remember I put out something on Instagram another day about what was the over under on how many top of chicos I could drink in a weekend and I think I said it at 15 or 16 we have blown through that so I can't imagine I still don't to this anyone who's listening to this who doesn't know we're talking about we're talking about a sort of bottled water it's in a glass bottle and it's a it's a carbonated water but anybody who's tried it will agree it's not like a paria it's not there's something different little touch of magic sodium to keep you coming back for more among other things anyway Tim I can't thank you enough for for taking the time to be on a little rinky ding podcast at this point but anyway it's been it's been wonderful oh my pleasure man I expect to see you right up there with with our mutual friend Jaco who you introduced me to so thank you for helping to unleash Jaco on the internet and ever since our episodes on my podcast or I had you on

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. Welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. In this episode, which I know is long anticipated. I spoke with Dr. Rhonda Patrick from Found My Fitness. I suspect many of you listening to this know everything about Rhonda and have been fans of her for a really long period of time on the off-chance there's anybody listening who doesn't know who Rhonda is. I suspect by the end of this discussion, you will also become a huge fan of hers and her podcast, which is exceptional. So I've known Rhonda for quite a while and despite the fact that we both consider San Diego home, and we've just been busy enough that we just haven't had a chance to sit down together in quite a while. So this discussion was kind of long overdue and it was sort of funny because as soon as Rhonda walked in, we just jumped right into a really interesting discussion and then ten minutes in, I thought, you know, we should probably start recording because this is interesting stuff. And so we did. And similarly, when the discussion finally ended, we sat around for another 20 minutes talking about a bunch of stuff that I found myself thinking, God, I wish we were still recording this because it's super interesting. So that's just basically to say, I suspect Rhonda and I will speak again at some point soon. So don't worry if all of your questions weren't answered here. The other thing about this podcast that was a ton of fun was that in the days leading up to it, she and I had emailed each other a few times back and forth some ideas of things we would talk about. And in the end, neither of us really had any notes sitting in front of us. We just sort of sat there and shot from the hip and didn't follow a script or anything like that and didn't even get to have the things that in our emails we had suggested we would talk about. That said, all the stuff that we talked about is stuff that I think Rhonda brings a great deal of expertise to. So I don't recall the order, but I know that we certainly touched on IGF. And the growth hormone, what I consider a little bit of a paradox, which is on the one hand we have some evidence to suggest that elevated levels of IGF are bad and that fasting may act in part by reducing those levels. But at the other end of the discussion, you have some confounding and conflicting data around that. We also got into a great discussion about the P-PAR enzymes, so P-PAR alpha, P-PAR gamma. One of the things that Rhonda does incredibly well on her podcast and I would encourage those of you who find this episode interesting, who aren't familiar with her work to go back and actually watch some of her stuff. Rhonda doesn't put out a lot of podcasts, but the reason for that is the amount of work she puts into them is enormous. So when she puts up a podcast on video, there's explanations, definitions, and stuff scrolling across the screen. So it's an unlike me who's incredibly lazy and can't even stand to listen to a podcast after I record it, Rhonda is methodical in her ability to make that easier for the viewer. So you'll learn a lot about this stuff. You think we're going too quickly over it by probably going back to Rhonda's site. We talk a lot about the possible genetic explanations for why some people do and don't respond particularly well to ketogenic diets. And of course, you can think of that in two ways. There's respond as far as the ability to make ketones, but then there's also sort of these patients that I describe seeing where you put them on a ketogenic diet and everything seems to go wrong. At least biochemically wrong. So that's a very interesting discussion. In many ways, I think my favorite part of this discussion was the way it started, which was the first question I asked Rhonda, which was kind of a random question. I think led to some interesting back and forth between us, which was effectively, what do you believe today that you didn't believe before in vice versa? And I always find that to be one of the most interesting ways to dive into a discussion with someone who's buried needy, deep into science. Because if you're really thinking about science, you have to understand, of course, that virtually all facts have a half-life. And our knowledge is constantly evolving. In many ways, that's what makes the field so difficult to stay on top of, but at the same time so interesting. And so to me, one of the marks of a very thoughtful person is someone who's beliefs are flexible and who's willing to acknowledge that something that they believed was one's true or not true can be flipped. And so I think, you know, Rhonda and I share that and I think it was actually really fun to see where her beliefs have changed over time. So with that said, I think the show notes for this particular episode are going to be very helpful and you can find those at Peter Atia, MD.com forward slash podcast. And I hope you enjoy this discussion at least half as much as I did. I suspect it won't be the last. So without further delay, here's my conversation with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. So great to have you here. Happy to be here. It's great to see you again. I can't believe we live in the same city and only see each other once a year. If you win. Well, thank you for taking the trip up here today to my office. My pleasure. And I'll join the long list of people congratulating you on your 10-month-old son. Thank you. Thank you. I almost don't know where to begin because there are so many things that, you know, we share and comment as far as interests. I want to start with a really broad question, which is you spend so much time thinking about many of the same problems I spend time thinking about. What do you believe today that you did not believe four or five years ago? Probably the biggest thing that has changed in what I now believe, but I didn't four or five years ago even more, is that one of the major modalities for, you know, increasing health span, which is the healthy part of of your life, delaying the onset of age-related diseases, the major modality for doing that that would be the best way to do it would be caloric restriction or dietary restriction. So eating 30% less food than you normally would eat. I used to really think that was the way to go for doing that. And I think that my beliefs have changed for that in that being the major modality for a few reasons. One reason is because I think that actually, so one of the things that occurs during caloric restriction is a major drop in the growth hormone IGF1. And that's, you know, that's thought to regulate a lot of the improved health span effects. At least in some organisms like mice and in racist monkeys. But I do believe now based off a variety of research from people like Walter Longo, that periods of growth actually specifically periods of IGF1 are really important. So you're not, you know, if you're constantly doing this caloric restriction, then you're not really going to have that period of growth because you're chronically doing that. And really interesting, I don't know if you saw the recent nature study that came out, I think it was an April of this year on lemurs. So the study essentially showed, and these are, you know, I guess they're not human-primey, animal model, but their lifespan is, you know, median lifespan is around six years or something like that. And I think their maximum is 11 or 12 years. I remember. But the caloric restriction did increase the median lifespan. It also increased maximum. So they like lived a year longer than typically. And there's, you know, a lot of delayed onset of a various degenerate diseases. But there was a massive atrophy and gray brain matter in regions of the brain that didn't occur in control animals, which is just another sort of example of how, you know, sometimes some of these modalities that we think are really good for increasing health spans, sometimes have other effects. And I think that getting into the IGF1, I think we'll probably, you know, and I will talk about that because we both have a shared interest in that. But the periods of growth being necessary for health, I think, I think that's kind of turning point in my mind. And so now I actually think that perhaps even doing periodic, you know, prolonged faster or a better way of doing that because you can, you can get that IGF1 boost and you can get the lower IGF1 among other things that occur. But we can dive into that if you want. But I think that's, it's going to be done. Yeah. But I think that's probably one of the major things. Yeah, there would be actually another interest that we share would be, I think I was a lot more skeptical of of ketogenic diets about four years ago, in terms of being great for long-term health and health span. And I think that some of my, my thoughts on that have changed a bit based off of more recent long-term studies in animals, specifically in mice from work from Dr. Eric Verdin and also from out of UC Davis, showing that ketogenic diets in in rodents can in health span, increased median lifespan, certainly improved cognitive function. Now the caveat there is that typically with a ketogenic diet in rodents, it's actually can be most of the time is obeseogenic. And the way that these guys worked around that was they found that had, they had to limit the calorie. And what was interesting was that or cycle them, right? Well, so Dr. Eric Verdin, the way they did that was by cycling it. But UC Davis, what they did was actually put a calorie cap and turns out after talking with Dr. Sachin Panda that they ended up being on a time-restricted feeding schedule. And so the ketogenic diet was, you know, they were basically eating all their food within a certain, like, you know, eight or eight or so or nine an hour window. And then they were fasting for, so, you know, it's kind of one of those things where you know, in humans we don't really know, you know, I don't know exactly how people, I've never actually done a ketogenic diet myself. So I don't know exactly what people are doing if they're eating, you know, all the time or what. But so I'm also intrigued by that. And in many ways, almost have the mirror of your experience, which was, you know, four or five, six years ago, seven years ago, I guess, is when I really really got into ketogenic diets was on a ketogenic diet for three years, save one day. And I wouldn't say I have any less faith in them today. I just am personally less interested and find it much harder to do. So just as far as compliance with the ketogenic diet, you know, I think my life is just more complicated today in terms of travel and things like that and kids and stuff. But the thing that surprised me with the recent, because those two publications came out in cell, right? The ones, um, versus. Yeah, yeah. I was actually kind of surprised by a couple of things. So one was what you said, which was Eric noting that, hey, when we constitutively gave these guys this food, they just, they got obese. That's really counterintuitive when you think about how ketogenic diets increase circulating metabolic fuels. And that should downregulate appetite. And I think in humans, you know, there's a huge debate about why do people lose weight on ketogenic diets? So they're losing weight because they're eating less, where they losing weight because they're ramping up fat oxidation, disproportionate to where they were before, which drives up energy expenditure. Of course, I suspect the answer is both. In other words, if you do the latter, the formers should happen. So when people say, why do we less on a ketogenic diet? The question is really, the thinking would be, are you eating less because you are basically eating yourself more? Because you're obviously oxidizing all of those fatty acids to make BHB. Or is it some other reason that, you know, has to do with the neurochemistry of these things that go beyond sort of the metabolic central part of me peripheral effects of it? So that's the first thing to surprise me with that study, which was why were those mice overeating? Was there something else in them because they couldn't have had that much sucrose, they usually put sucrose in mouse child, but they couldn't have been that much sucrose, or they wouldn't have been able to get into ketosis? And I think even previous studies, like earlier in the literature, showed something similar, where it was obeseogenic. Now there was certain genetic backgrounds that also seemed to kind of little, you know, regulate that to some degree. But what I was actually thinking, so you brought up some really interesting points, is that thinking of the in the context of like, let's say they're eating the constantly eating the fat, or they're not having the period of rest. I know that, for example, when you're making malinocoué, which is something that you do, when you're oxidizing fat, malinocoué inhibits the conatime palm till transfer is the, basically the transporter to transporter fatty acids in the mitochondria. So if you're constantly making malinocoué because you're constantly eating the fat, then you're going to start to have this inhibition, and you're going to start to then store the fatty acids in out of a position rather than catabolizing them. Right? So it seems to me that- And we don't see that, by the way, with the exogenous ketones, do we? This is something I'm still trying to get a handle on. I agree. I'm certainly, I am extremely interested in the exogenous exogenous ketones, particularly because I try to show them. Okay, you try them. Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to bring you some of it. So I really enjoy the effects they have on my brain. So I've used them for endurance exercise, and I also like it for that as well. I do notice that I have a little bit of a, I seem to run longer than I usually stop at this point on the beach and like I can keep going another, but what I really like is for me, it really helps with focus and lower anxiety level. So like I seem to be able to- I'm always onto the next, you know, and so this kind of helps me, like, stay in the now. At least I- and that could be completely placebo, I don't know, but anyway, that's one thing that I like about that. But to get back to your point, I had one of the same thing because what's the effect of exogenous ketones on normal fatty acid metabolism. And the reason I had one of that is because there was a paper that recently came out where I think it was the one that was done in humans where humans, they were given the beta hydroxybutyrate ester for endurance and it enhanced endurance performance, but they found inhibited yes, and also it inhibited fatty acid, something to do with the fatty acid, a transport out of the out of post, something to do with where I was like going with somewhere- some of that had to do with lipid metabolism, which suggested possibly there could be an inhibition. Now, you know, it's funny, I'm going to see- I'm in New York next week, and a Dom is going to be in New York, Dom, Degasino, who obviously you know well, and we're grabbing dinner one night, and we're going to talk about this paper because I remember when it came out, Dom sent me an email with- I'll know for sure if you want- or I can just send it to you. Yeah, send this to me for sure. Because there was something about that study that was a little bit off, I need to kind of go back and and look at it. But it does back another question. So I want to go back because there's going to be- I know this is going to be a theme today, which is multiple threads that are easy for us to go off on. You're an irgrated going on today. Yeah, yeah. Let's go back to the mice. Let's go back to the two studies. Do you recall if in the verdens study when they before they started cycling the ketogenic diet, when they were just giving it to them all the time? Do they have a window in which they could eat add libidum that they over-8 in or where they give in 24-hour access to food? 24-hour, So what they never tried then was let's give you food for 10 hours and let you eat add libidum. Because that would be interesting if they would overeat in that setting. Maybe not that interesting. The other experiment that I don't think has been done is remember when they did the- they took a variant which was high fat, but high-ish carb. And so it wasn't- there was enough carbon the diet that it wasn't producing ketosis, but it was still a high fat diet. I'd like to see that experiment repeated with an exogenous ketone. Because then you could start to identify the effect of the carbohydrate specifically and tease out the effect of the fat and the BHB. Right. I think I remember one of the big differences between the the high fat low carb and the actual ketogenic diet was the induction of PPR alpha, which was which makes sense because that's involved in, you know, ketogenesis itself, but to what degree that regulates, you know, any of the other important properties that were found, including the really the profound effects on the brain. And, you know, so I like to personally get my ketogenesis from my periods of fasting. More so than carbohydrate restriction. Well, I do, I do refine carbohydrate restriction, but I also, I think there's a lot of benefits and this is part of the reason why for so long I was skeptical of a ketogenic diet is because I think there's a lot of benefits in eating a variety of plants. I think that there's a lot of various micronutrients that are much higher density in plants, full-a magnesium, vitamin K1, but also there's a lot of fermentable fibers and things that are really also really good for the gut microbiome, which I also think is very important for regulating immune function. So that's kind of been my, my hangup, but I think, you know, like people like Dom seem to be doing a modified ketogenic diet where they're, you know, definitely getting the greens, trying to get the leafy greens. So I mean, I think that, you know, one way to kind of get around that plus, I think there's also a way to do a ketogenic diet where you're eating a lot of salmon, avocado, nuts, you know, olive oil, and it's not just like butter and keto bombs and all this like pork grinds and stuff where I'm just like, where's the nutrient density and some of that, you know, so yeah, it's funny. I mean, I guess it depends on how many calories you need, but at the time during that window when I was on a ketogenic diet, I was also still very active, certainly much more so than now. And I really required a lot of calories. I mean, I couldn't maintain my weight below 4,500 calories a day. And I still stuck the pretty strict absolutes on the protein and carbohydrates. I really kept my carbs. And I didn't look at net carbs. I, oh, by the way, for those listening and wondering what that noise is, this is something wrong and I are very used to. Those are F8 teams, which how many overhead drive buys we're going to get today? You feel to predict? I would say more. Yeah, I was probably between 4 or 4. Okay. Yeah, it's the sound of freedom people. So just get used to it. So I was getting probably 50 grams of carbohydrates total carb. I should say probably about 80 grams of total carb, but you'll see what type of carbs it was. Really had to limit protein to about 100 to 110 grams. If I went over that, I would get kicked out. And so fat made up about 90% of my total calories. And so there's only so many ways you can get that much fat. And the most efficient way is actually salad with olive oil. I mean, I couldn't believe the amount of vegetables I had to consume to stay in ketosis. You know, I basically had to have two huge salads a day where I would make my own dressing, which was a heavy olive oil based dressing. And I could probably only have one avocado a day, which I would always have because I didn't know if it was getting too much carbohydrate rate. So it's like a lot of macadamia nuts, a lot of olive oil, olive oil based everything. And then the hardest part for me was clearly being stingy with the protein. What was in the salads? Okay, so I go, you know, I'm a pretty boring guy. So it's romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, had to kind of like limit the carrots a little bit. I normally love carrots. So you get tomatoes and everything on the ketogenic? Yeah, yeah. Now again, part of it, as I can get away with more, because I probably exercise more. And I was doing this before people were sort of putting butter in their coffee and stuff like that. So that was not, I consumed a lot of dairy, though. So see other things, tons of cheese, tons of sour cream, because you just needed those calories. And I actually developed like a spreadsheet that was customized for my coloric needs, but I had this formula of looking at every ingredient. Like, could you find the food that you could eat without restriction that wouldn't destroy your ratios? And so for me at my coloric levels, like cream cheese and sour cream were sort of the perfect thing. Whereas even high-fat Greek yogurt had too much protein. So I had to consume that in moderation. That's the other interesting thing. And I think I talked to Eric about this was, you know, how much of the effects, you know, on health span, or due to low protein intake and how much were due to, you know, the actual being in ketosis. Yeah, I've talked about this with Walter a few times. We don't see Ida eye on this because for several reasons, one, I'm not entirely convinced of the IGF paradigm anymore. So that's one thing where, you know, the question I asked you, that would be my answer. So five years ago, I would have said IGF is the devil. Girl, Thormone is the devil. You want them to be as low as possible. I'm not convinced of that today. And I can't wait to explore that with you. But the other thing is, if you really want to produce the lowest level of insulin and IGF, I am not aware of a way to do that, beyond a ketogenic diet that is incredibly low in protein and incredibly low in carbohydrate. When I go back and look at my blood levels, because I check my blood about every six to eight weeks, and I've been doing this for, you know, 10 years, I mean, my lowest IGF levels were during the three years I was in ketosis. I mean, they were very low. They were, I mean, not ridiculously low, but 25% of average versus say 75% of today. So that makes sense to me because if you think about, you know, some of the major dietary regulators of the IGF one pathway are protein, essential amino acids specifically, and also insulin. Insulin through IGF BP-3. Is that, or IPB-1? Yeah. So I mean, I think that, so for example, you know, if someone's eating a low protein and low, you're getting, you may not be a vegan, but even if you had your limiting your protein, you know, even to some degree, you're certainly getting more than someone maybe me, that's not not doing that really. Although I do kind of limit my protein. But it's a misconception. You see, I think a lot of people assume ketogenic diets are high protein diets. I think some people do consider that, yeah. But if you're, there may be certain people out there who can produce ketones with high protein, but in my experience, personally, and more importantly, clinically, meaning, I don't know, over the course of my practice and my career in medicine. I mean, I've probably at least encountered 50 or 60 patients at a very detailed level on ketogenic diets. Almost without exception, protein is the bigger thing that fouls people up. And so that's the thing I've always found a bit confusing in some of those discussions is, and even Eric mentioned this on your podcast, which is, well, you got to be careful if you're on a ketogenic diet. You don't have too much protein. And I was like, those don't go hand in hand. You're not on a ketogenic diet if you're eating a lot of protein, because you won't make the ketones. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if there are polymorphisms that allow people more or less. And you've obviously talked a lot about the P-par, is it P-par alpha or P-par gamma, where you see the differences in a person's ability to generate ketones? The P-par alpha is predominantly found in the liver, and it's involved in fatty acid cataplysm production of ketone bodies. So that would be the major one. Now, there's nothing empirically. I've seen the literature that's looked specifically at P-par alpha and a ketogenic diet or fasting. But, you know, there's most of the literature out there looking at the effects of P-par alpha with people that are either heteromazagas or have to do with the context of like high saturated fat, low polyunsaturated fat diet, because polyunsaturated fat activates the P-par family of transcription factors, which are a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factors. But the P-par gamma is predominantly found in like adipose tissue. I mean, they're found in other tissues, but I see predominantly that's like the most, they're highly expressed in that adipose tissue, and it plays a role in basically taking up fatty acids and adipose tissue, whereas the alpha, which is in the liver, take plays a role in the transport, cataplysm. So one would just sort of imagine, I mean, it would be nice to see that, you know, someone look at that, you know, people with these specific SNPs and how they're... Just promethius identify various SNPs of P-par alpha? Yes, but they don't really tell you anything. They sort of pull abstracts from P-par met and just kind of like dump it there. So you kind of can start with research there. I've been developing a genetic tool, and I just were actually developing it a lot more of a former NIH geneticist who's probably phenomenal who's been working with me and to tell me sort of develop those. Basically, look at, you know, the literature and see what some of these SNPs are doing, and then in conjunction with looking at biomarkers, very blood biomarkers, to kind of help people guide, you know, what sort of they should do, what's a bypass around a potential bypass, for example. So with the P-par alpha, gamma, I think that the take home, at least from the literature, is essentially you want to have a higher ratio of poly and mono-insaturated fat tissue saturated fat ratio in order to lower your tetradide, B-d's risk. You're saying for any, for people with the wild type or with people with certain SNPs. With the, with the, with the steps within P-P-R alpha, yeah, because end-gammant as well, because to some degrees, some of the ones in P-P-R gamma affect the uptake of fatty acids and out of post tissue, and so, and also muscle, and so it kind of kind of, kind of, you know, you have a lot more free fatty acids around, and that can, you know, have, have an effect on insulin sensitivity and other things as well. So we should talk about this offline because I have a subset of patients for which we have such rich data, and if I'm positive, all of them would be interested in knowing this, and, you know, we'd certainly get their permission, but it would be interesting in taking their, you know, just their straight-up 23 and me data. So, so here's the pattern I've seen, and I'm very curious as to what the overlapp is. So there's a clearly a subset of people. I think my N is too small to quantify it, but directionally it seems like I don't know, 10 or 20 percent of people. When you put them on ketogenic diets in the standard way, which usually ends up meaning you're getting at least 40 percent of your calories from saturated fat, typically 40 to 45 percent from mono and the remainder from poly, everything goes to hell on a hand basket. And the obvious things that go to hell on a hand basket have been certainly written about on the logosphere and Twitter sphere, which is usually their LDL particle numbers sky rockets, despite the fact that they're triglycerides go down. So they seem to be getting more insulin sensitive, but yet inflammation is going up, and you see that both specifically cardiac specifically. So things like oxidized LDL and LPPA-2, but even non-specifically C-Rective Protein Fibernogen. But the deeper level is the why, and what you see is they're making much more cholesterol. Markers of cholesterol biosynthesis like dysmarchalol go way up. And some of their phytosterols go up, which is very counterintuitive. Phytosterols would generally go down on a ketogenic diet, but they're going way up, suggesting that they're absorbing much more cholesterol, like biliary cholesterol. So the first time I noticed this was 2012, and I think I wrote about this one son of a blog, but I don't remember. Maybe I'm thinking of another example. And it was this relatively young patient who really loved being on a ketogenic diet. But when we get his blood test back, I mean, his LDL particle number was above 3500 nanomol per liter. And I know there are a lot of guys out there who seem to think that as long as you're on a ketogenic diet, it doesn't matter. None of this stuff matters. I completely don't subscribe to that. And my view is that's irresponsible. So I said to them, I said, look, I don't think a ketogenic diet is right for you. And he said, no, no, no, no, it's the best thing I've ever done. Like, I feel better, I look better, I'm performing better. We got to figure out a way to do this. And the only thing I could think of, and I talked with Tom Dasebring about this, and he said, let's try and experiment and rip all the saturated fat out of his diet. He was sort of like me. He was eating a lot. He, I mean, he's a high-clawed consumer. So that gets really hard. So we created a diet form that was only about 20 to 25 grams a day of saturated fat. And he ended up getting about 65% of his fat calories from mono-insaturated fat, which was pretty gross. I mean, you're drinking olive oil at that point, but he was interested in doing the experiment. And sure enough, after, I don't know, maybe eight to 12 weeks, same macro nutrient distribution. In terms of fat, protein carbohydrate, the only shift was the type of fat. So we just substituted mono for saturated. His LDLP was 1300 animal per liter. All of the inflammation was gone, and all of the sterile biomarkers went back to normal. I've since seen that about six times. And now I'm wondering if we took those patients and ran them through what you're doing. Yeah, yeah, that was really the ones that have those SNPs. And there's a variety of them that do that. So there's the PPR alpha, PPR gamma. There's a couple of FTO related SNPs also that the relationship of saturated. And basically, in the literature, these studies have all looked at the ratio of saturated to mono-in polyunsaturated fat. And for whatever reason, people with those SNPs, when they have a higher saturated fat poly your mono and or mono, they have higher inflammation, higher oxidized LDL, higher O-small. Then cell the L, higher, you just, you know, all these just terrible. Do you have a sense of the frequency based on the research you've done on this? How prevalent that is? Kind of. I would say, you know, I'd have to look back at the data probably less than 20%. So it might be in the ballpark of what I'm seeing for this different phenythal. It might be, yeah, it might be. So that would be really interesting to run them through through my tool. And like I said, we're even expanding that a little bit. I found a few more. Are patients sending you any of their data? Or are they doing it on their own and just they're doing it on their own? Some people have shared their data with me because they emailed me and something interesting. And I'm like, oh, wow, that's super interesting. Do you mind sharing that with me? And they have? So if anybody's listening to this and they're saying, hey, you know, I had an advanced lipid test before and after I went on a ketogenic diet. And I looked like this situation you described, can they reach out to you through your blog and send this data to you? If they can actually just use the genetic tool and then sort of, you know, share with you the data. If they want to share with me the data, you know, I can't promise anything, but they can certainly get the why themselves by just using genetic tool right now, which, which I have, I have free reports for, for example, the PPR genes, but then I have a whole comprehensive report that's a $10 recommended. So if someone doesn't want to pay $10 to do comprehensive, they can just get the free report and get the why potential why themselves. So I hope that anyone listening to this because I, again, if I'm seeing this at 10 to 20% of the time and you're seeing it, and it'd be great to get a few hundred people who are that phenotype and find out if the phenotype matches the genotype. Right. Yeah. It would absolutely be. And like I said, I have, I have had people have that problem where they've tried a ketogenic diet and couldn't figure out and they did have one or even more than one of this, that regulate fatty acid metabolism. So. And then there's another phenotype that fortunately is more rare. And I also wonder what's going on with PPR alpha specifically, which is people who do everything by the book. And maybe I'm a sucker and maybe I'm gollable and maybe I believe patients too much, but I don't think I've ever had a patient lie to me. I really think like when they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, they tell you. I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. So it's not uncommon in this rare subset of patients that is where they're doing everything by the book. I mean, they're working their tail off to keep their carbs here, to keep their protein here, to keep their fat here, to keep it within this distribution. And they cannot get even close to half a millimolar of BHB in their blood. And to me, that's a really frustrating situation for the patient because they're sort of like what the hell I'm doing everything right. Like I'm not making ketones. And I think Steve Finney sort of put out this notion that the threshold was about 0.5 millimolar. I don't have anything to argue that one way or the other. So I generally can based on my own empirical experience personally. I sort of felt like 1 millimolar was about the threshold, but again, I think that's neither here nor there. But when these people are doing what I'm describing and they're at best 0.2, maybe 0.3 millimolar, it just made me wonder, there's something in their machinery that's not doing this. Now the question is, is it a like policies problem? Is it an oxidation problem? Is it a conversion problem? I mean, that I don't know, but it would also be interesting to understand, where could the weaklings be in their ketosis machinery? Right. And there's probably, you know, there's a variety of SNPs in these genes. And, you know, there may be certain SNPs that aren't having even really been tested or who knows. It sounds like, you know, to me that there's certainly something going on with the process of ketogenesis and some of the patients and their active levels or their active. Yeah, we're pretty, I mean, we've evolved a lot in our thinking on how those patients can be helped, but it seems that the best way to get them over that hump is fasting coupled with exercise if they're capable. But it's got to be relatively, it has to be, it's not gardening. Like it's got to be exercise exercise, you know, they have to really deplete glycogen. So that's the other thing I sort of wonder in some of these folks is what's happening with gluconeogenesis? Because I, I think until you start to dip down and glycogen a little bit, it's really hard to do this. And of course, we can't do liver biopsies. Well, the fasting does get them in ketosis. And so again, we're dealing with such a small end that I don't, I want to be thoughtful about not generalizing too much. So there's one patient in particular who's the poster child for couldn't do the ketosis thing straight away. But when we put him on every month, five day FMD. So he would do the five day FMD, but ketogenic, not long goes FMD. And then the 25 days of ad lib was time restricted eating, ketogenic. Then we've seen great results doing that in two people. So that would suggest that something, again, we're not doing this as an experiment at this point. It's like clinical. It's like just try to get the job done sort of thing. But that would suggest that something about the fasting end or the exercise end or the time restriction could get them over the hump. But it's interesting because from an evolutionary perspective, you should have been selected out really quickly if you couldn't make ketones efficiently. Well, it sounds to me that maybe there's a glycogen, you're not, you're not getting depleting the glycogen too. If that's, you know, so maybe it's not to do with the production of ketempies. But it's actually just takes a long time to complete that glycogen. I do think there's a huge variation. Obviously physical activity plays a role in that as well. I can fast, I can do, you know, like when I do my time restricted eating, ideally I like to do it within, you know, nine or ten hours. You don't might fit within nine or ten hours. And then I, you know, I like to fast for like 15 hours. I can do that. And with my physical activity levels, you know, I will be closer to one millimolar fast, like, we will get to one millimolar after 15 hours of fasting. I will be closer to that when I'm really physically active, like during the periods a couple of years ago, and I was doing lots of like long, like long distance running and stuff, I can get closer. I mean, I mean, I'm, I'm going off of like a precision extra, which probably is not very none of no precision extras. It's, I mean, that's really good for that. Yeah. So I can get between like 0.7 millimolar to like 0.9. But are you consuming a ketogenic diet during your feeding when you're eating? So my, my diet typically, so I like I said, I've never really intentionally tried to do a ketogenic diet, but my, my diet is, I'm, I pretty much eat a lot of the same things, and typically it's salmon, a salad, or a sauteed vegetable with olive oil, some pasturase, you know, butter from pasturase animals. And my food will be like blueberries. I'll have avocado, so I'll have, sometimes obviously, with some blueberries, avocado and kale. And will you have two meals in that window or, so it depends if I have this, but they're not typically I'll have breakfast and then an early dinner, and then I'll have like a snack either nuts or this smoothie, the kale with some blueberries and avocado. So I think it, you know, I need a lot of nuts too. You know, I probably do what kind of nuts? Walnuts, macadamian nuts, pistachios, cashews, almonds. I think probably I could. I put cashews in the candy category. Oh, really? No, no, no, I just mean like, I can't stop eating this thing. So yeah. When I talk about nuts, I'm like, I eat nuts and sometimes cashews because like, I just might as well be eating M&Ms. Is there other flavor? Well, yeah, no, look, you know, all kidding aside, when I was on the ketogenic diet and I had to be very mindful of this stuff, basically I could only consume almonds and macadamia. Everything else was just a little too high in carbohydrate. The cashews just, like, my own personal demons. Okay, I don't know what it is about cashews. Like, I love watermelon, like the summer, like right now. Oh, like my son loves water. We could eat a whole one. Oh, yeah, like put a little salt on it. Like my father-in-law from the south and taught me that. So in the summer time, I like to eat some watermelon. I like to eat peaches. You know, so while I'll definitely indulge in more fruits because that's when they're around. But, you know, so I do, I think my diet tends to be... So it wouldn't be surprised if before you entered your, like, so let's say you finish your feeding window just before you went to bed. It wouldn't surprise me if you're already at point two or point three millimolar range. Probably, yeah. Yeah. I know, actually, to measure the right. So check that. Yeah. And that'll give me a sense because if you, if you're going to... Well, I'm not doing as strict because I'm still nursing. So I'm because it's just so hard to, like, time-wise get everything. I'm eating probably more like within the 11 to 12 hours. Okay, okay. Well, when you, when you get back to the 15, I'd be curious because if you're actually able to go from zero or point one millimolar to point seven to one millimolar in a 15 hour fast, that's impressed. So, so when I took the exogenous ketones and I've done this, did you do the ester or the by HBMN? I did their instructions, which is either with a high carbohydrate diet. So I had a a little bowl of some hollows with some blueberries in it. And then I took the BHB ester. I literally went from, like, point one millimolar ketone to one hour to six millimolar. Wow. Six. One hour. That's really high. So... That's impressive. Okay. I'm trying to think, I definitely don't get that high. And that's just with one bottle. With one bottle. And then how long did it last? Do you recall? Well, it depends on whether or not I did exercise like intense exercise. And so, if I did the intense exercise, like an hour later, I was down to, like, two or three or something. And have you ever taken it and just done work, for example, where basically the brain is doing more of the exercise than, yeah, that's what most of what I do it now, but I'm not measuring because I'm usually like doing a podcast or going traveling and doing, you know, something, but that's, that's typical what I use for. Is that? So I'm not really doing the, using it for exercise. Yeah. They've really come a long way in taste. Really? They still taste awful. Yeah. You know, it's funny. I remember Kevin Rose, who's a good mutual friend of ours, when he tried them first. He texted me and he's like, dude, these things aren't that bad. Like, you made it sound like these things were horrible. And I was like, when I had it, I thought I was drinking caracine or jet fuel. I thought I was going to die. Go blind first, then die. He goes, not another stuff's good. He goes, actually, I wouldn't call it a sipping key tone, but it's actually I was something guys at human and the T-Dall that I spoke so I think they've done a good job kind of making them less ridiculous. They must really have tasted bad when you try it because I personally think it's closer to the caracine side than that. It was so bad around there. There was like a good three-month period where my favorite thing to do, like more than anything in the world was if anyone came over to my house for dinner, they had to try one finger dip worth of stuff. And of course, the first time I drank it, I just took 50 ml and chugged it neat without mixing it or anything like that. And yeah, I had a few days just getting people to try this stuff. The salts are obviously much more palatable. Yeah, I've just lost studied, but more. I didn't really, I wasn't, I certainly didn't feel like I had the same effects as the Esther. And also, if I took a really high dose of it, I felt like I had some GI distress. Absolutely. And I have also noticed that for some people that is, for me, that's the case. So I cannot take the BHB Esther on an empty stomach. The only way I can tolerate that at high doses is either to put it with powdered MCT or actually just take it with a meal. Which in many ways defeats the purpose because I kind of like it as a way to avoid meals. Does it lower your blood glucose? Because I mean, like it, like so significantly, it was like like astounding. Yeah, yeah, no, it's pretty impressive. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I know that Jeff Wu, the CEO at Human is very interested in that. And I republished a post. I wrote five years ago on Exogenous Keytones like a couple of weeks ago. And a lot of scientists have reached out and said, hey, we're really interested in studying this. Like, what can you tell us about this? And so I think people are starting to realize that's an interesting way to lower glucose. Really significantly higher. More than 20%. I dropped 30 points. Wow. Yeah. That's for, again, you, you're, like after a high carbohydrate, after a high carbohydrate, like I said, I had oatmeal with some blueberries. It was nuts. Of course, my, my blood sugar because at the time, too, I mean, I've just been nursing at night and so, waking at multiple times that has terrible on your for your blood glucose levels and such, but so they were a little higher than usual. But yeah, I dropped me 30 points. Well, yeah, that's more than we typically see. Is it? Yeah. On the topic of blood glucose, have you ever experimented with Acrobose? No. I've experimented with it with cells and culture, but not like personally. The stuff's pretty interesting. It works quite well. Yeah. I'll certainly, if I'm going to indulge in some high carb action, I'm going to take 100 milligrams of Acrobose beforehand and just flatline my glucose. Wow. You know, in many ways, I find that actually more potent than metformin at glucose reduction. I mean, I think metformin has many other effects that we'll probably get into as well. Let's go back to the IGF thing. Yeah. Because this is sort of the thing that here's the thing. I'll just jump right to my punchline and my question with this. There are two issues I now have with things I used to take to be the gods on a street. Actually, three things. The first is I found Cynthia Kenyans work on the Daph 16 mutants in C. Alligans to be the most convincing evidence of the role of IGF or attenuating IGF in longevity. And I now question that, not question the work, but question the inference that that can be applied to humans, given the fact that only their germ cells divide. And therefore, cancer in that organism looks nothing like cancer in us. Cancer in that organism is only a cell getting larger. There is no proliferation. We have to sort of, I mean, it's obvious. The risk of stating the obvious, which is we're not worms, but that's a huge difference in biology. So that's the first thing. Let me let you comment on that. Yes, because I've done those experiments. So that's probably what straight out of college. I went to work at the Solkin Institute with Andrew Delin, who trained with Cynthia Kenyans. I was a chemistry major in college and I decided I wanted to try some real biology. I only had a little bit of biology in college. And so I went to work at the Solkin. And really, it was like this first experiments I did with worms where we knocked down the insulin IGF1 signaling pathway, also known as the Daff2. And their worms would live like literally a 100% longer. They go from two weeks to four weeks, right? Yeah. I mean, it was like, and not only that, like, the worms were so youthful. Like you would look at these worms, you know, because it's all I would do day after day and then microscope is just picking and poking and looking at the worms and how they move. And you know, as they get older, they start to become less mobile. And I mean, it's just very odd. It's the most convincing day. It is very convincing. And now it's me in my mind was kind of like when I was like, like, we have a gene that's sort of homologous to this. And this is happening in those worms. Like I want to understand that. Like, and here's the thing about that data. And this is what I think, if you get rid of another gene that's homologous to Foxo, Daff610. Oh, Daff610 is right. That's homologous to Foxo. It completely obliterates the life spent extension. Meaning it's the Foxo 3 that seems to be really important for we have how many we have four Foxos. You mean different Fox genes? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know exactly how many, but the Foxo we have 3. We have 1, 2, and 4. Was it 1, 2, and 3? There was like a 1, 2, 4, 5. But their analog is 16. I remember that, right? Their Daff 16 is basically our Foxo. Foxo. Yeah. So, okay. Well, anyways, yeah. I'm not sure I'm getting confused with that. You know this better than I do. But okay. Yeah. But what is interesting is that the life spent extension was completely like a meal related to life. And did their health span curves? Because the experiment you're describing and no one can see what I'm doing. But you know what I'm talking about. Like the natural was a two week lifespan, where for the first week they're youthful. And then they have a declining health span curve. So at the time of their death, they're totally decrepit. In the experiment you're describing, if I'm thinking of the same one, you doubled the lifespan. And their longevity curve became a square function. It just went out. Kind of yeah. Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly what happened. But you get rid of the Daff 16 and they're like wild type. Oh, they're like wild type. Yes. I think so. And that largely has to do with, you know, so that the IGF1 insulin signaling pathway both inhibit Foxo 3. So if you get rid of that inhibition considerably, Foxo 3 is constantly active on those warm. I mean, it's just like super, you know, making super oxides. This mutate is they're making more stem cells. They're making just everything's active. You know, more topology, more strict. Like all these stress resistance pathways. I mean, Foxo 3 is a transcription factor. It regulates whole host of genes. Many of which have to do with DNA repair, autophagy stem cell function, production of antioxidants in anti-inflammatory pathway. So it's a lot of really good stuff. You want to act up all the time. So there's that component to the longevity pathway. And actually, if you look at the animal data from rodents, whether it caloric restricted, if you get rid of the Foxo 3, the median lifespan extension is gone. So the lifespan extension depends on Foxo 3. The cancer stuff was still like, it didn't matter. So the cancer reduction didn't depend on Foxo 3. Only the lifespan extension. So I think there may be an uncobbling between humans and IGF1, one of the major problems with IGF1 is actually cancer. And if you look at, you know, animal studies, if you look at humans, human studies, like humans that have polymer physicians that make them have more IGF1, they have much higher cancer incidents, vice versa. So if you look at people that have polymer physicians, I agree. Is that the case? I mean, we look at the opposites, right? We look at the ones that have low GH and by proxy low IGF and have less cancer. So you're talking about larynx syndrome. Yes, larynx syndrome, yet yes, they do. But I think there's also another one in IGF. There's heads and IGF1 receptor. So this is you're not talking about acromegally or people that are making too much GH. They also are more susceptible to cancer as well. Yes, I am talking about them as well, actually. The people with acromegally are more susceptible to cancer. Maybe I am, that's what I was referring to with that have higher circling levels of IGF1. So you're saying you can't uncople the growth hormone from, yeah, that's been one of the things I've struggled with. Is it's hard to uncople the GH, the effective GH on the liver? Yes, exactly. But animal studies that that has been uncopled. Like if you do any sort of tumor transplant animals and then make them have high GF1 through a variety of modalities, the cancer will grow rapidly. So how do we explain the human epidemiology, which, and I'm like, there are a few people that are more critical of epidemiology than me. I'm not a particular fan of it. But I find it to be quite interesting in the negative, meaning the contrapositive with an epidemiology can be quite interesting. So this is the next thing that caught me going, wait a minute. And that was, there's a U-shaped mortality curve that is skewed to the right for IGF and all-cosmortality, cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and neurodegenerative mortality. But when you uncople them by disease, you see a very interesting pattern. So all-cosmortality, as IGF goes up, it actually starts to go down. It natives at the 70th percentile and then it starts to rise. But it doesn't get as high as it started. I know for people listening, this is confusing. So we'll include the figures of all these from the papers. But the point is it's not that as IGF goes up, mortality goes up. It's the opposite for 70% of the ledger, only at the very end. In other words, only high levels of IGF, very high levels of IGF, seeing problematic. And as I know you've talked about, I've heard you talk about this on your podcast, you have to then disaggregate that by age. The older you get, the better IGF seems to be, presumably because of the preservation of lean tissue. It turns out that most of the uptick in the mortality above the 70th percentile is driven by cancer. But actually cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease seem to get they flatline by the end. So meaning there was no benefit to being at the 100th percentile, or the 99th percentile versus the 80th versus the 70th, but you weren't getting penalized for it, which suggested to me that low IGF might not be the ticket, maybe it's some combination of cycling high and low IGF, but living it around the median to slightly above that, the 60th, 70th percentile. And again, that's probably more a function of my misunderstanding of the literature five years ago, but I really came away thinking, IGF, we got to keep that as low as possible. It's funny, you and I kind of have, have evolved in the end. Very similar, because I now also think that, you know, so IGF1 does play a very important role, obviously in development, but also in the repair of muscle, in the growth of muscle, I mean preserving muscle mass. Also, it gets transport across the blood-brain barrier, plays an important role in neurogenesis and allowing existing neurons to survive, which kind of brings me back to that gray matter thing with the limmers. But, you know, so, and the thing that was interesting to me was the effective exercise on IGF1. And the fact that for one, it's been shown that the boost in neurogenesis after exercise in the brain via brain-drivener is requires IGF1. Animal studies have shown that mostly rodents have shown that that exercise causes IGF1 across the blood-brain barrier getting to the brain. But in human studies, I've also seen some showing that it does lower serum levels, I think presumably it's also going into the muscle and the brain. So I think that, you know, people that are exercising, they're putting that IGF1 to the places where it's supposed to go, muscle tissue, brain tissue, as well. But in addition to that, and this is kind of what's more recent work from Dr. Falto Longo, is that he does these prolonged fast and I think the prolonged fasting is extremely interesting for a couple of main reasons. And one is, I think that it has tremendous potential for the treatment of autoimmune disease and also cancer based on, you know, his work and what he has shown now in animal studies and some pilot clinical studies is that doing a prolonged fast and or in some cases, the fasting-mimicking diet causes this massive shrinking of organs where, you know, he doesn't know how much of it's due to cell-sized decreasing versus A-pop doses. He does know A-pop, A-pop doses is occurring and he has show that in multiple publications like there is a massive induction of A-pop doses after a prolonged fast, which makes sense because it's a very strong stress. And then after during the refeiting phase, the organs basically come back, they come back, they grow, regrow. And presumably selectively repopulate. Yes, so he's shown that these stem cells get activated, so that basically they have to be activated by the low IGF1. But then to proliferate and differentiate into whatever tissue type we're talking about, let's say we're talking about the immune system, then IGF1 is required for that proliferation and differentiation and repopulation of the tissue, which means you can't just keep the IGF1 low. The refeiting is just as important as that. And the IGF1's key in that. And so, you know, what he's shown now is that you can take, for example, in the multiple scrocers, animal model, you can actually cause stem cells to be activated through the prolonged fast and then during the refeiting phase, the stem cells make non dysfunctional, so they're making normal, non autoimmune cells. He needs done like a pilot clinical study with multiple scrocers, people with multiple scrocers, and it's helped with symptoms. But he's also done these cancer studies. And this is kind of where there's been some clinical studies that he's been involved with, like a 48-hour water fast that's been done in patients undergoing standard of care treatment. And he's shown that it was tolerable, not only that, there seemed to be less mylo toxicity, less nutrient-eateny and so, basically, there, and it sensitized cancer cells to death. So, not only were the cancer cells dying more, but less of the normal cells were dying. And then he's gone ahead and shown this in animal models, also with the fasting mimicking diet. And it's like, if you look at the data, particularly in the animal model, because they can, you know, do all the tissue harvesting and stuff. I mean, it's like, it's so phenomenal that I would not be surprised that in the next 10 years, it will be required part of standard of care, because it seems to be so incredibly robust, I selectively killing cancer cells, which, you know, makes sense. I mean, oncogenes, they screw up all sorts of things. One of them is the stress response. And, you know, cancer cells can't respond. Just read their prime to die. I mean, it's, I spent a long time me not studying cancer cell metabolism apoptosis with a dugine, just a few other minutes, Sanctutulins, research hospital. And that's kind of one of the primary ways that a lot of these chemotherapy-to-drugs, if they can get to the tumor site work, is that because it's a stress, cancer cells can't handle it, you know, they die. So, I kind of went off on the tangent here. So, to get back to the IGF1, let me say one thing going back to what you just said, that is also interesting, but in the same thing. So, I agree that I think that it would really be great if patients had a better insight into nutrition going into chemotherapy. And the few times I go and give talks at hospitals or go and talk at like a cancer meeting. I'm amazed at how resistant the oncologists are on average, obviously there are exceptions, but on average, to interfering with nutrition. Because in many ways, their primary concern, tragically, is preserving weight. And so, I always get a little reclammed when I walked through an oncology ward and I see patients drinking in shore. Like, I couldn't think of a worse thing you'd want to consume when you have cancer. And yet, the goal is, hey, we've got to fatten these people up. So, I agree with you and I really hope that this research is accelerated because I do think patients would benefit greatly from this. And the other application that I saw in this several years ago, this is quite old now, but it blew my mind. I'm not sure if I may have a J Mitchell's work up at Harvard. He didn't experiment where he took three groups of mice. So, the first group were considerably, colorically restricted for their entire life. These were probably like one and a half year old mice. So, they're about halfway through their life. Starting, starting, yeah. So, these animals were constantly at 70% coloric intake. The next group was your control group. And then your third group was at Libidham Diet until two days before an operation. And at which point they were calorie restricted to a near fast. And I'd have to go back and look, I can't remember if it was 24 or 48 hours of fasting. It might have been a 24 hour fast. 48 would be pretty extreme for mice. So, in summary, you've got control, this straight up eating, you've got 70% or 30% CR forever. And then you've got control and then fasted for a day. All the mice were then operated on where their femoral arteries were ligated, held for a period of time. And then they were reprefused. For people not familiar with that means that it means you open the animal up, you put clamps on the femoral arteries, which would basically stop all profusion of blood to the lower part of the body. And then after some period of time, just before you kill the animal, you release that. And then you reprefused the blood basically, the oxygen reprefuses the organism. That's considered a reprefusion injury, which is about one of the most stressful things you can do to an organism. So, that you can really rapidly kill someone by doing that. And that's something that in surgery happens quite a bit. For example, you end up having to clamp something off to repair something downstream of that. Okay. So, what happened was all of the control animals died without exception. Of the other two groups, the groups that were either calorie restricted for life or transiently starved before the surgery, a significant subset did not die. And I can't remember the number. And again, I know we're going to probably link to this study. So, people are going to listen to this and go, that idiot got all those details wrong. But this is the just of it. A non-trivial subset of them lived. And what's interesting is you could get the same benefit by an acute period of caloric restriction in proximity to an insult that you could get by a lifelong of caloric restriction. And the third piece with it was interesting was the group that were just starved transiently actually had a faster recovery. But again, they were fitter organisms. I remember the first time I came across that thinking, there's got to be something to cycling. And people used to always ask me, like, why are you on a ketogenic diet every minute of every day? Would there be any benefit in cycling? Now, I still don't know the answer to that question. But I'm more curious about it now based on what you just described from Voltaus work, plus this type of stuff, plus just the general ethos of the way we evolved. We've fasted. We fed. We fasted. We fed. We fasted a long time. We goreged. Like, it just seems we've evolved for cycling. Right. Yeah, I agree. It's really that with Voltaus work, I just am so excited about about the prolonged fasting and the potential benefits of it. I think that actually something that you and I discussed several years ago and I had your interview on my podcast that you brought up that I thought was really interesting how to do with like the failed clinical trials with binding IGF1 and cancer. And Voltaus brought up something interesting in a conversation I had with him. And that is possibly that we now know IGF1 having low and IGF1 is important. So if you're constantly having low IGF1, the IGF1 is important for the immune system or population, you can imagine the context of cancer when you're giving other treatments along with it, that would be important because your immune system is key in working off cancer. And I thought that was a really interesting point. Of course, we don't have evidence of that, but I think it's something that would be interesting to investigate and make sense. Yeah, I definitely am on the same page with you with, I'm not and like I started out with saying, I don't think that chronic color restriction and low IGF1 is the essential way for improving health span. And I do think that IGF1, you want it to go to your muscle, you want it to go to your brain. So I think people should definitely be active, especially if they're eating a high protein and or even high carbohydrate or something that's going to produce a lot of insulin, you know, they shouldn't be eating refined carbohydrates, but people do, they're eating them, they should definitely be exercising. That's another change in my belief system. I think today versus five or six years ago, I think five or six years ago, I didn't think exercise was that important to longevity, which actually sounds ridiculous for anyone who knows me, because I was probably exercising four hours a day, but not because I believed it would make me live longer. It was just sort of soothing my addictions. But I think today, I feel I am much more convinced by a lot of the data you've described, certainly the central stuff. When we published this paper earlier this year with Richard Isaacs and that you and I were talking about it before we started recording, we wanted to get a sense of like if you took a completely unbiased approach to and look at the literature, what was the single most compelling thing you could do to generate or preserve brain health? And we came away thinking that it was actually exercise. And I remember when the analysts were kind of going through this and showing me all the data, I was like, come on guys, there's no way exercise could be the most important thing for brain health. And again, I'm saying this is a guy who loves exercise more than anybody, but it just struck me as there's no way. And again, I think part of it was I was just thinking about it through the vascular lens. And obviously, you know, I think better than I do that when you start to think about brain health, you have to think about it through a vascular lens, a metabolic lens, growth factor lens. I mean, they're overlapping, but distinct pathways that are going to influence brain health. And so I was kind of humbled by that. And now, I guess in many ways, I'm a little more adamant about it with my patients, not that I wasn't, you know, adamant before, but this is like, boy, if you're not active every day, like we got to change that. I actually, the main reason I exercise is for my brain. It's certainly just not only for, you know, preventing neurogenophecies and atrophy and all that, but just because it affects my executive function and it affects my anxiety levels, it affects my ability to make decisions. I absolutely, if I have something that's bothering me, you're giving me anxiety or I have to make a really important decision going for a long run, really helps me. And there's been studies showing that it helps with executive function, a long-term planning, like aerobic exercise, specifically, you know, and high intensity, interval training, all that stuff, they all do different things. Well, that's the thing we couldn't tease this out of the literature, which again, probably is just a limitation of shitty human clinical trials, but that's the second order question, right, which is if you're going to take the Tim Ferriss approach, which is what's the minimum effective dose? Because there are some people, like maybe you or I, who I think just generally like exercise and also get these other benefits, these endorphin benefits, but there are some people who are like, look, what do I need to do? Like, I'm going to treat exercise like medicine. And I think in that setting, I'm still not clear. So if you were that person, what I say, Rhonda, as long as you are lifting weights, one hour, three times a week, like if you can only give me three hours, would that be how I'd want you to spend it, or what I rather you be doing an aerobic aerobic type thing? Like, I mean, that's to me, those are where these biomarkers start to become very important, because we're not going to generate hard-outcome studies, with that level of control. Once you, you know, try to control that many variables and be that strict about it. You're going to very much lose a hard-outcome prospectively. But if we knew what to measure, right, and that's, you know, would we be measuring an integral of IGF, for example, so how much it rises, how much it falls, and then what that looks like over time. But I guess that's the funny thing, right? Like, the more we learn the less we know. Yeah, absolutely. I think that we definitely don't know the answer to that question. But I think there's a lot of data out there showing the for example, strength training, you know, there's benefits on the brain that's been shown published, this benefits on preventing muscle, atrophy, there's benefits on preventing cancer, incident like, that's all been shown for strength training for aerobic, and, you know, this high intensity interval training is also, also, seems to be making its way as well. Like, like, there was a study that I found VO2 max, this is, you know, the ability of your body to transport oxygen during exercise, which also is a indicator of when you're not exercising. And obviously, transporting oxygen to the brain, for example, is extremely important. The O2 max declines with age, like 1% per year, I forgot starting at what age, but, you know, so 10% per decade. So that's almost parallels the muscle, master, clandestine. Yes, it does parallel, exactly. And there was a study showing that 24 sessions of high intensity interval training, where it was like a 45 minute session, five minute warm-up, five minute cooldown, and then, you know, in between the max intervals, which were like pretty long, like a minute, there was, you know, the 70% of max work. Anyways, so 24 of those increased VO2 max by 12 per cent. So you're literally taking an entire decade of decline and reversing it with the 24. Yeah, that's, that's actually a point. When I was more active as a sort of competitive, you know, encycling, you would get our VO2 max tested about twice a year. Rye and Flairty, who we were talking about before the podcast, who's one of my close friends, and you've got to know him as well. I learned from Rye and that actually VO2 max is not the most important indicator as a runner or cyclist. It's VO2 max or pvo2 max that matters. In other words, for a runner, vvo2 max is much more predictive of performance, which is the velocity you carry at VO2 max. And for a cyclist, it's pvo2 max, which is the power output at VO2 max. That said, every time you go to test, you want to test well. So, you know, over time, I learned how to gain the system. You know, I want to make sure my VO2 max is in the 70s, which again, to put that in perspective, like, that's not at the level of professional athlete or something. Like the guys that are winning the tour de France are in the high 80s or low 90s in terms of milligrams per mill per kilogram. But nevertheless, just altering my training for three weeks before OVO2 max test and dropping my weight. So, if I shed two kilograms and did those types of intervals, I actually had it down to a science where there was a workout I would do. You know, in Carmel Valley, you've got the 56 that goes out and it's got a bike path next to it. There's a section of that bike path that is 1.6 miles long and it goes up at about 4%. And just doing repeat intervals of that, which takes about four minutes all out to go one direction and then about six minutes to cruise back, four of those. That was it twice a week for like three weeks and your VO2 max exploded. Now, of course, the question is, is that like, you know, cramming for the test, getting the result, but not necessary? Like, do you have to keep doing that to get the decade long benefit? I don't know the answer, but I agree that like, if you can maintain muscle mass and you can maintain peak aerobic performance, it's not, it doesn't even matter at that point if you're living longer. You're clearly living better. Like, if you don't budge anything on maximum lifespan, you've dramatically improved median lifespan. Right. And that's a, you know, that's for most people, that's what matters. It is. Yeah, for me, it is. I mean, what's the, what's the maximum lifespan that, like, a human's like 120? 120 for something like that? Is it 120, 120, 120, 120, 120, yeah? Living beyond that. I mean, that's, I think the goal is really to, at least for me, I think that's a lot more achievable is increasing my, my median health span, my health span, you know, so, so basically preventing, staving off cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, those sorts of things. So that I'm, so that I'm living healthier. And also, you know, a little bit longer, but obviously not 125 or six years. Yeah, I don't really subscribe to the theory that we're going to meet some takeoff point where, you know, there's immortality. I'm really not convinced that that's, that that's sort of biologically possible. And I don't suspect that I'll be alive at a time when it would ever come to fruition. I don't remember the journal. It was a paper that came out of Japan. And the study looked at a variety of people of different ages. So elderly population, centenarians, which are 100, semi-super centenarians, which are between 105 and then super centenarians, which are 105 plus. And looked at a variety of biomarkers for health and aging. So telomere, senescence, kidney function, glycated hemoglobin, lipid, the whole lipid panel, triglycerides, kidney function, hematopoesis. Like all that stuff was looked at inflammatory biomarkers. And what was found is that aside from age, what was predictive of being able to basically stay alive was low inflammation. Like more than hematopoesis, more than glycated hemoglobin, blood glucose levels, lipid, all that stuff. It was basically the ability to press inflammation. Like that was a predictive of cognitive function and also basically staying alive. Do you remember what they looked at? Were they looking at C-Rective protein and things like that? A relatively general markers? They look at inner lookins and stuff also. TNF. They looked at a whole panel of, and also some immune cells that are indicative of inflammation. So there was a whole panel of biomarkers that were looked at for inflammation. HPV, tighter or something was also looked at. So the interesting thing about that study was that inflammation was so key for each age group, right? Like even more than all this other stuff, like that, I thought about like senescence and telomere and low-clucost levels and all that stuff. And so I really, and if you look at some of the rodent literature, for example, I remember the study where NFCAPA-B, which is classically thought about as an inflammatory mediator, which it is, it also has an anti-inflammatory component to it. And if you get rid of the anti-inflammatory component, rodents will have this sort of low-level chronic inflammation because every time it's activated, there's not that anti-inflammatory part that's kind of keeping it in check. And so there's kind of like this like lower chronic inflammation that's happening. And those animals live like 30% less. So they're life spans cut short by about 30%. So that's kind of interesting, right? You're just just getting rid of that little anti-inflammatory component of just one major regulator of immune system. It has an profound effect on life span. And then of course, if you look at SNPs and stuff, of course, you can always find, you know, well since naryins have a higher percentage of 10 in anti-inflammatory anyways, you know. So the inflammation, it's an interesting finding that keep suppressing inflammation seems to be important for at least, you know, according to that study for making it to every part of, you know, I don't know what you call it, every, basically progressing to the maximum level that maximum lifespan level that humans can possibly live. Well, there was a clinical trial published either earlier this year or last year that looked at an IL1 antagonist. And so this was a study that took people and made no change in their lipid metabolism lipid biomarker. You know, this was they, they didn't do anything to the patients as far as differentiating the groups by traditional biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. But one group was given a placebo, one group was given an IL1 antagonist. The question was could that impact cardiovascular mortality? And we've long talked about how cardiovascular disease is sort of this trifecta of life-approachings, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. But this was in many ways the most elegant first test of that in humans using heart outcome. So made your adverse cardiac event stroke MI death. The hypothesis was found to be correct. So the patients getting the IL1 antagonist despite having no difference in lipids or any other biomarker had an improved outcome with the spike of cardiovascular health. About a month ago, another trial that was using low dose of methylthrexate, which is an immune suppressive, was halted early. And the results will not be announced until this fall. But if you read kind of the fine print, it does not appear. It was halted for a bad reason. Meaning it might have been halted actually for basically early efficacy, which presumably would have been in the group getting the methylthrexate. So again, we won't know that until the meeting in October, I think when this will be presented. But if that turns out to be the case, that's pretty interesting because now you've taken something that we practically have great examples of the one you've given, and now potentially there's ways to think about using it. So taking a step back from all this stuff, I think about it at the level of like, I'm just a mechanic. It's like, how can you manipulate these things in people? Cycling, using nutrition and fasting to cycle IGF, maybe even using an exogenous growth hormone for all we know. Maybe, you know, I've always been quite skeptical of growth hormones use in the field of longevity, but maybe periods of oscillating, wrap a mice in a growth hormone and fasting where you're cycling high periods of antibiotic, high periods of catabolic phase, maybe there's something to it, and then cycling agents like methylthrexate and all these things. So I don't know, that's my hope is like in 10 years. We've got a complete personalized toolkit for how everybody could figure out exactly what drugs or hormones or nutrients to take and cycle and how to do it. And then of course, the key is you have to be able to measure stuff. You know, the, the, with the cardiovascular rate and mortality, the, the sauna is something that is interesting to me for that for that reason, because of the profound effects that it has specifically on lowering cardiovascular related mortality, and of course, there's some clinical trials showing that, you know, there's a variety of other biomarkers and potential mechanisms by that, but which that's happening. But if you look at some of the data by Dr. Yari Lauken and out of Finland, if you look at some of the observational studies, you know, where there's like a couple thousand men that we're doing, it's sauna, so you pick what is in Finland. But if you look at, for example, men that are using it two to three times a week, versus 47 times a week versus once a week, and you look at, for example, cardiovascular rate mortality, two to three times a week, it's lowered by like 27%. But when you jump to 47 times a week, it goes to 50% every year. All cause mortality goes to 40, all cause mortality, all cause mortality is also lowered, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, again, like 20% lowered if you're doing two to three. I'm so glad you brought this up because I almost forgot, and I wanted to talk about this. This is one of those things where I think three years ago, I was completely dismissive of this stuff, which is to say I still love going into a sauna because the one thing that I felt sauna really mattered for was sleep and not for the growth hormone level. But because I think there's pretty good data that a great way to sleep is to create a high gradient of temperature. So the faster, the more negative the derivative of temperature, dT by dT, when you sleep, the faster you'll go to sleep in the longer you'll stay asleep. So a sauna before bed, if you could jump in the sauna, then take a cold shower, then jump into a cold bed. You're going to sleep like a baby. I've done it. It's absolutely true. It's remarkable. Yeah. So I always accepted that, but I looked at all of that epidemiologic stuff, and I was like the healthy user bias here is through the roof. Like I came up with a hundred reasons why I just couldn't believe it, including sauna's are painful. So if you are fit enough to sit in a sauna seven days a week versus the guy who can only sit in it one day a week, like how do I know that that's not driving it? Now since that time, I've become a lot more interested because now the mechanism is starting to become more well understood. And so I'd love to have you talk a little bit more about this because I know you've talked about this a lot on your podcast, but in many ways your pursuit of this has become one of the more convincing arguments in my thinking on the actual health benefits of this independent of the healthy health user benefits of this. You know the healthy user benefits of course and with with the Yaris work he's tried to correct for all that physical activity that he's done everything like looking at lipid blood cholesterol numbers LDL number like just like really you know try to try to try this best to kind of correct for that healthy user bias and of course there's a dose dependence which always makes it more convincing. But he's then since published some clinical trials where he's looked at for example the arterial compliance and of course blood pressures and that's one of the main things that's effect is blood pressure but also just like the ability of the arteries to like expand and contract in response to pressure like that's improved which is really important. So I think that you know obviously the son at the heat itself does does affect blood flow plasma volume all that stuff is change. So I think that the cardiovascular aspects and Yaris trying to really kind of tease part more mechanisms because he's a he's an MD PhD he's a cardiologist by training but he's also got a PhD so he's he's trying you know really hard to to kind of understand exactly what's going on but I do think that it's really seems convincing. It's really convincing with the cardiovascular related mortality specifically it's very robust. Personally it's kind of interesting to think about how much of you know exercise also elevates your core body temperature I mean there's the overlap there you know and when I sit in a sauna my heart rates are to elevate like I'm doing cardiovascular and that's what happens like I'm doing cardiovascular exercise sort of to sweat I mean a lot of the same adaptations that happen with exercise or happening when you're sitting in a hot sauna and even a hot bath like more recently another study came out trying hot bath effected had a positive effect on a variety of cardiovascular related markers as well which again if but you have to sit in it long enough you know to to experience some of those effects of the elevation of the heart rate and all that stuff but there's also really profound effect on the immune system like part of the benefit of exercises that it is an acute oxidative stress burst an acute inflammatory burst you know there's then a response to that and the net response is a positive anti-inflammatory and antioxidant response but the inflammatory and oxidant response is required to get that and something similar is happening with with the sauna as well recently there was a study looking by Dr. Charles Rezon he had made this like fancy contraption where he elevated core body temperature and he had a sham control so actually the sham control also made people a little bit hot and they thought they were actually getting the treatment but it had a very strong anti-depressant how do they do that he explains it on my podcast and you can go this transcript you can just kind of that strikes me as one of the few things you can't placebo they did some crafty thing which I'm not going to try to explain I will absolutely botch it and they did it and they had a sham control and in fact about he said about 70% of the people they had the sham control thought they had the actual treatment so it were like there was definitely a they were trying to control for the placebo effect what's interesting is I even the reason I got into this sauna was the effects that I felt on my mood when I was in graduate school like I lived across the street from a website and so I started using this sauna and it was like very black and white like I was like wow this is amazing like I can handle all this was a wet sauna dry sauna this was this is a dry sauna do we have a sense of dry sauna versus IR versus all the different yeah so I mean the infrared sauna is there like they only get to like about 104 degrees Fahrenheit you know it's not very hot if you look at Yaris work it like their sauna is that they're using them Finland they do they have a lot of what they call low lieu or something which is like they throw the water on makes the humid which makes it really hot I've been a Finland and try that try the their sauna's before but basically the temperature gets to around 170 between 175 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit and most of the men in these studies are doing about 20 minutes to get the maximum benefits the 11 minutes had some benefits sitting in 11 minutes but there was a stronger effect they say to 20 minutes so if you're in a infrared sauna that only gets to 140 degrees Fahrenheit you probably would have to stay in a much longer to get the same benefit and I see so the IR doesn't doesn't get deeper penetration thereby alleviating the need to stay in at a higher temperature it doesn't I mean sometimes people talk about there's a lot of marketing involved in a lot of that you strip that out though if you strip that out the the infrared sauna's do affect the sweating mechanisms like something to do with the penetration there you do do sweat which is great because you actually do excrete things like BPA and falades and mercury and heavy metals and things like that from sweat so that that is that's what a lot of those mark those stuff straight up dry sauna to 170 degrees spend three or four nights a week in that my favorite yeah that's personally I would much prefer sitting in a regular dry sauna or even a sauna that you can throw water just not in infrared sauna yeah so that would be you know the obviously the the fire hazard risk is more when you're having a sauna like that versus just an infrared and the infrared ones are I think cheaper as well so it's certainly more convenient to have an infrared sauna but personally I prefer for the other like the barrel sauna are really nice there's also an effect on the immune system I was mentioning Charles Rishon he measured IL6 which is also it's part of the Janis side of kind because it does like it's got like multiple pleatropic effects and it's it's a cutely released upon exercise as well it has it's very important for you know an anti inflammatory response releasing myocines and all these things in muscle so it has it's important for insulin sensitivity a lot of the insulin sensitivity effects um exercise has so so the sauna does the same thing that the exercise does where there's just a rapid IL6 release at least according to Charles Rishon's data and he said that actually correlates with the different you know I've never looked at I wear a continuous glucose monitor a lot but I've never really paid much attention to it in the sauna and I don't have a sauna but I'm going to be this weekend at a friends place who has a barrel sauna and so I'll make sure that I document what my glucose levels doing um because you would think transiently would go up right but I know that at least there's an one animal study where the heat stress quote unquote animal sauna it it actually increases glucose transporters and a type two diabetic model that actually improved insulin sensitivity lowered blood glucose because the glucose was now being taken up into muscle butter so I wonder you know how much of the again it's like you're you're affecting the IL6 is is is really important for that IL6 is released upon heat stress without without the exercise so on coupling you know how much of the benefits from exercise there's certainly some overlap and I think that there's also their separate benefits that exercise has as well independent of the heat stress component of it but I certainly think there is a lot of overlap between those two things and so the sauna becomes very interesting and then there's the whole heat jog protein part where you know the heat stress is one of the major ways to increase heat jog proteins which do play an important role in neurogenogenic preventing neurogenogenic diseases and I do think it's also really hard to un-couple the effects on the the vascular system which is important right as well because it's having such a profound effect on the vascular system the heat stress it's hard to un-couple how much of the staving off of dementia and Alzheimer's has to do with that versus each other proteins in our own. This is to me the biggest challenge with Alzheimer's disease just is you know we're talking about it in a pretty nuanced way but I think unfortunately clinically it's still considered one disease but you know to the best of my understanding it's really several diseases that all have a very similar common final pathway you know for example like going back some of the ketone data you know why why does ketone enhance memory in some in some models certainly even going back oh god 10 years you see a lot of anecdote of people in early stage dementia who when given even MCT oil would see transient improvements in cognition now Richard Veech did some of the most elegant work on this Richard Veech by the way is the guy who along with Kieran Clark created the ketone Esther that T delta S licenses to human and you know they showed I think quite convincingly in this animal model that the BHB was basically bypassing pyruvate dehydrogenase and so all of a sudden you know you think about the energy deficit that a neuron would experience if you have insulin resistance at pdh so if you know glucose is going to pyruvate and pyruvate can't get in because pdh is resistant giving BHB would just bypass it you go straight into the crebs cycle you make all the ATP you want but that might only be a subset of people that are you know suffering right there's also going to be the micro-vascular variant and then there's going to be the sort of more toxin variant so the nice thing about sauna too just thinking about it is it if I mean as again like I'm becoming more and more convinced of this it's actually like a really pleasant thing that you can do to potentially live longer and certainly live better because many of the things we talk about I mean let's call a spade as fastening is not fun I wish I could tell you that you know not eating is fun but like I just love eating so anytime I'm not eating I'm sort of like there's a discipline that's required to do it but I don't know sitting in the sauna for 20 minutes before you go to bed is pretty enjoyable of course the problem is it's not it's not it's not accessible no it's not every month you don't like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's enjoyable until you like holy shit it's hot I want to get out but it's knowing that like you get to get out and then that that jump into the pool or the whatever it is is is is is is yeah and the discomfort you experience from from like the heat stress where you're really hot is actually I think key for the positive benefits at least for me it was on my mood where it was just like felt so good so what about the reciprocal of that cold so I used to you do a lot of cold therapy but all for Dom still the late onset muscle so that was my main interest was you know back in the old days I would go out and buy £100 of ice or £50 of ice I guess throw it in the bathtub cold water and I would immerse myself and that was unbearable but that really sped up my recovery from difficult workouts it's a pain in the ass so I started doing cryo and the data well I was pretty convinced that whole body cryo three minutes of whole body cryo at the right temperature was going to produce a roughly comparable effect in Dom's but had a fraction of the time and 10x the cost but I've also had people talk to me about and again I've never really looked into this but I'm guessing you have ice cold showers for you know increasing nor up and effort in levels things like that mood altering have you have you looked into this I've looked into the literature yeah that's something that I did that I did notice from from doing cold showers and sometimes I'll do them before like a big talk or something because it does help me focus and it helps with my anxiety kind of very some sort of so yeah I was going to say how do we square the two completely different things right you would you sit in the sauna to help with anxiety and then you could have the cold shower well I didn't start getting into the cold shower until probably a couple of years ago the sauna I started doing in grad school yeah long time probably about 2008 so long time ago so they're they're completely uncoupled in my experience I mean so do you think the sauna is working more through GH and other I think the sauna has a very profound first it affects the immune system and that inflammation has a major effect on rain and I think that that's worked from Charles Raison is pretty clear it's definitely there's definitely an antidepressant effect that seems to correlate with biomarkers of the immune system so so the more potent the aisle six response the more potent the antidepressant response in addition to that there's a very strong effect on beta door fins beta door fins are dumped and also this other system called dinorfen which is you know the opposite yeah and and what's interesting is that when you activate dinorfen through the the cap opioid pathway instead of new opioid you feel uncomfortable and it's the part where I'm we're talking about your leg I'm hot I want to get out it's the part when you're exercising where you're like oh this you know it's that uncomfortable feeling well that's you're making dinorfen partly because it cools your body down so it's kind of a response to elevating your body. I'm convinced by the way there are subset of athletes that don't produce that at the same level I mean seriously like there are people I think who there are because we talk about like why can that guy tolerate so much more pain than that guy yeah and at some point it's possible that they're actually experiencing less pain there they're definitely our variants in the cap opioid receptor pathway and all that so I'm surprised that hasn't become a performance enhancing drug which is you know blocking that receptor the pain receptor in the brain which is a you know a very interesting thought but now so so then on the cold front what do you think's mediating that neurotransmitters so so basically on the cold front the nor at the nephrine your it's that's been shown so animal studies have shown or no upper nephrine released in the locus coroleus reason of the brain after cold exposure and a variety of cold water exposure cryotherapy if you're doing a cold water 50 degree you know it's like 50 degrees Fahrenheit you got to stay in a little longer than like a couple of minutes and in a really cold cryotherapy chamber but in humans plasma norpone fefran's been looked at which does seem to sort of cool correlate with the release and so hard though to look at the plasma to understand that so I know it is it is so I do think that some of the mood is affected by the norpone effort as well have you experimented with the stacking which is go do the sauna for 20 minutes then go do the ice shower for whatever 10 minutes and you get an additive effect into the water I feel really good yeah I feel really good and and that's when I did notice that my sleep was really profoundly affected what's interesting is there's some studies showing that that heat stress at least in piglets does affect actually seems to elongate the REM sleep stage which I don't know how you know what what all that means but so there's there's certainly an effect of heat on sleep and then of course cold is you know lowering your body body temperature is important for sleep on set but I don't know there's something about the combination of the two absolutely like I sleep amazing after doing the combination of both I think cold is really interesting for the effects on mitochondrial biogenesis I mean exercise is probably one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis but cold exposures been shown human studies both an adpust tissue and in muscle tissue to to boost biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis well depends on why tissue we're looking at the so like you know PGC1 alpha would be would probably be one of the best I would say for a muscle tissue in in anapost tissue perhaps the same I would say PGC1 alpha is probably one of the best it's another downstream one I can't for some reason I'm drawing a blank yeah so that that that's interesting to me that the the effect on mitochondrial biogenesis but personally I like the exercise you know for my my my mitochondrial biogenesis I'm not like doing cold exposure all the time it's not like something that I they do often like I said I'll do it once in a while before a big event I have to talk at or something just because it does seem to help me with my mood and my my my my my my if you ever swim in water that's so cold that you actually feel like you're on fire yeah I have been yeah that's that's me is amazing I assume it's due to the vaso construction I don't know but it's the coldest water I ever swam and was in the Colorado River and was 42 degrees which is I mean that's that's unusually cold and the only reason I think I was able to swim in it was it was it was May and so the sun was it was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit was the air temperature so you could like I wouldn't be able to swim in 42 degree water on a cloudy day for example or cold day but I couldn't believe the sensation of feeling like I had jumped into boiling oil it was incredible which is very different from my normal exposure to cold I used to swim a lot in the ocean and you know if you do a three hour swim at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 52 53 you get a little bit of that effect but you know more or less you can still you still know you're in cold water but this particular time I remember and I probably spent 15 to 20 minutes in this 42 degree temp the entire time I felt like I was burning wow and again I I I I know no idea why I guess it's my assumption was that's such profound vasoconstriction in the periphery that you know the one thing that I wanted to mention when you brought this up for recovery is because there is some evidence that for whatever reason strength training when you do cold exposure like immediately after strength training if you do it within let's say before like sometimes with it sometimes within an hour before or before sorry after after strength training it seems to blunt some of the hypertrophy effects yes yes and and actually it seems to you say that that's the exact reason I would never take like ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatory agent I would limit it even that day I wouldn't take any of those agents because you're impairing that that rebuild yeah yeah so that so that's also interesting that the timing of it seems to be you know again there's it's been shown that about an hour after exercise is when the the anti-inflammatory response starts to peak and so it's like if you can you basically if you're within that hour window when the inflammation's happening to create that anti-inflammatory response you don't want to dampen that at least that's it seems to be what I think and and literature seems to suggest and there's of course mechanisms where it's like specific macrophages and muscle tissue are really important for activating all these things that you know eventually result in satellite teleportation you know and of course IGF ones in there somewhere so again you know the immune system activation is important for a lot of the benefits of exercise including muscle hypertrophy so so there's one more topic I just want to get to if we can spare a bit more time which is which is NAD the precursors the whole stick you've spent a lot of time thinking about this what is your current thinking on is having more NAD to NADH matter the the thing about the NAD I guess I should provide context for people why am I asking this question right so there's lots of supplements out there now that are you know either giving NAR or NAD and the claim is that these things can enhance longevity it would live longer and that also you live better you have more energy all of these other things and so in the mitochondria you have complex one which converts NADH to NAD and the idea is we do know that as you age that ratio of NAD to NADH goes down and so part of the thinking is well and this is outside of the Sirtun pathway but this is upstream of that but if that you give more of either the precursor or NAD you're basically fixing something that is getting worse as you age yeah so that I mean the the question is why does it go down and that's I think there's multiple reasons for that at least that's been shown literature NAD is a very important co-factor for mitochondria I mean obviously mitochondria are making NADH and that hydrogen the proton is used and electrons are used to basically generate energy through the electron transport chain and it's also generating the mitochondrial membrane potential by kicking out the the proton so that that's really important for mitochondrial function respiratory function energy production which is like the key of everything right but in addition to that you have as you mentioned Sirtunans which are histone deocetylases which have a whole host of functions that they're doing regulating tons and tons of different pathways they're also seem to be very important for health span and then in addition to that there's very important DNA repair enzyme part that literally sinks up NAD I mean it's like an NAD sink I mean you know so you know we're constantly having damage to it. Where does it reside that enzyme? Where in the cell? Yeah is it nuclear it must be yeah and the reason I ask is how do we know that these supplements that we take orally are going to actually reach their bioavailability in the place we want them. Right. Okay but that said we'll come back to that after. I think it's in the nucleus I mean it would be a sense to be there but yeah. Otherwise it shuttles there but I think it is so it's very important for repairing you know DNA damage and so that's one of the major sinks and actually inflammation all these things are kind of upstream of part activation so the more that's happening the more part being activated so you kind of have you have NAD going there. So one argument just to make sure I understand what you're saying is look if you're getting older you're going to have more DNA damage that's just stochastic and if your little guy that repairs it requires NAD as fuel that would explain one reason potentially why NAD would decline as we age. Yeah and it's certainly a sink for it yeah and the other so the other thing is well if your immune system is constantly you know activated too if you're more inflammation you have all that energy is required so NAD is being consumed more for that as well so that's sort of another sink basically NAD levels decline with age and it's probably because it's just getting used up more or the other the alternative is you know is there's something else going on in terms of like this whole salvage pathway there's another pathway that you can do to regenerate NAD and if that's kind of going wrong and I think there's some increasing evidence for that as well. Would that make metformin a bad idea from this standpoint because metformin inhibits complex one so metformin lowers the ratio of NAD to NAD to NADH. Does it has that been shown so you're saying it should lower it? It should lower it now of course that's counterintuitive because we know it activates AMPK so I probably have to sit down and think about this but we do know metformin inhibits complex one and we know that complex one turns NADH to NAD which makes me wonder does is it possible that metformin would impair DNA repair through that mechanism by reducing substrate? I have no idea. Well I'm gonna write that down that's a bit of an effort to look into because I wasn't aware of the and I didn't understand that link about yeah yeah I think that's a major one I literally think that's a major thing for it I think that the part is I think it's just like going there. Yeah so the animal evidence you mentioned some of this supplements you know precursors I can form NAD I think that the animal evidence suggests that it can at least enroll in improved health span particularly in models with like that are heavily dependent on mitochondria like muscle myopathy models or something like that I think that was one and also the brain so I think those are the two the two organs I've seen like major positive effects with with NAD supplementation and then there's some of course pilot clinical studies showing that yes you can take for example Nikotana Med Rice, riboside and it does seem to increase NAD levels in plasma and a dose dependent manner now again you raise that up. We have no idea if it's getting in the building. What is it getting in the cell? Is it getting in the mic? Now we do know in animal studies I think that has been shown because it's affecting the mitochond like I said those animal models of myopathy and stuff in mitochondrial function was improved and all that stuff so so in animal models it obviously is affecting mitochondrial function so it must be getting to the right place. I don't know why I have found myself kind of skeptical of this. I think it's good to start with skepticism I mean I think that NAD levels are you can you can increase them with fasting so when you fast you know as you mentioned you convert NAD into NADH in the presence of of energy because that's basically when you have a substrate like glucose or fatty acid that's when you produce NADH or FADH too. So in the absence of those substrates then you start to your NAD starts to build up so back to your metformin question. You said I know who to ask I definitely know I'm going to ask Nav Chendell he will know the answer to this question. I follow a lot of his work when I was in graduate of him, Ralph G. Bardinis I did because I was doing a lot of cancer metabolism, my mitochondrial function and stuff so I had followed a lot of this work. Do you have NADH's book Nav the Gating Metabels? No I don't. No I just used to read his papers back when I was a graduate school just. Yeah so Nav and David Sabotini were in town a couple of weeks ago and I was leaving town the day they were coming in the town so we hung out for three hours near the airport and I was just reminded of how much fun it is to talk about mitochondria. Yeah. For sure. What is the most interesting question you feel you don't yet know the answer to but you feel is noable that you're sort of actively putting in lots of your clock cycles on thinking about? I would really like to know if for example someone who is like myself who and I don't have a lot of body fat I'm active I eat a pretty healthy diet you know I don't smoke I don't have any of those bad habits if I were to do a prolonged fast a couple of days a year would that truly have an effect on increasing my stem cell production potentially you know getting rid of any dysfunctional immune cells dysfunctional liver cells dysfunctional whatever you know muscle cells and and repopulating them with like healthy new cells like basically this rejuvenation like could I get this like burst of rejuvenation a couple times a year and would that have in turn have an effect on delaying the onset of age related diseases improving my health span you know keeping my stem cells less damage that would be very interesting to me because to me that's something that's very doable for myself I mean the experiment to figure that out is different because it's you know in humans and so that's going to be really hard you have to figure out like if you can even look at certain biomarkers to know that but I feel like that would be something that's so easy for someone to do it's interested in longevity and you think it would be sort of once or twice a year doing like a five day water only mineral in the end well the question is how often yeah and how long of it like so you know we have a lot of the studies coming out of animal data which even these these rodents they lose 20% of their body weight after a 40-hour water fast yeah I find it hard to infer anything from rodents when it comes to fasting because of this exact reason it's like either even the J Mitchell stuff I talked about earlier I mean I think it's an interesting proof of concept but I don't actually know how you would apply that to humans right so the question is it's like okay so if you have a 48-hour fast in a rodent or a magnet that's human as a base sensor yeah so I guess I'll expand my sort of answer that question like maybe do a prolonged water fast like time what's the frequency what's the duration to get the maximum benefit yeah and I am specifically interested in this shrinking of the organs and then regrowing like this potential robust activation of stem cells clearing away you know we're not just talking about claring away damaged mitochondria pieces of DNA protein which is all really great you are getting that but well in theory in humans in addition to that I mean I'm talking about clearing with a damage to the whole cell like just getting rid of it and replacing it with a brand new young healthy cell like that's what I'm interested in you know I would I would love to you know even just the hope that that's possible you know based off of some of the pilot studies that multistending humans and certainly the the animal evidence like I'm convinced I'm going to at least try because it seems it seems very possible I know I know that he is trying to find the best biomarkers to look at for you know stem cell activation so it's not quite as straightforward can't just you know harvest a bunch of tissues and and look at things but I certainly have gotten some anecdotes from people that have had autoimmune like diseases and things said that fastings like completely reversed some of it like like X amount or something yeah you know no it's weird it's you know where it's anecdotal but certainly when you start to have enough people saying the same thing it's like wow that's interesting that you've heard that five five or six times now yeah I think that would that's a good one I guess I think of a very similar question with rap a mice and rap a mice and yeah what what does and what frequency to produce the best longevity seen at you know the interesting thing with the rap a mice and is the effect on the senescent cells like that's so interesting to me I didn't know really about that until I listened to your podcast with Judas yeah she's amazing she's really she's really she's really great very knowledgeable in the whole senescent field yeah I had no I had no idea either the life's expanding effect is is that males only or was it both males no male and females and it's across I mean it's it's everything from yeast to worms to flies to mammals I mean it's the only drug that's uniformly extended life across a billion years of evolution I mean and there's really interesting work I mean I think Matt Cable and talk about some of my spanner are we talking medium actually and the mice it was I don't think I'm back in the book I'd probably in it's most of the time it's medium but yeah yeah and it was interesting in the mice as they started late in life they started at 600 days which is you know that's about 60 years old yeah that's like starting is with a small that was really late in life for the for the mice yeah it was wow that is that is very interesting so Cable and's work do you know Matt at the University of Washington he is giving rap and mice into dogs but these are pets right so these are not laboratory animals which is what makes it really interesting is you've got animals that live in our environment that are and dogs sort of have a very predictable demise right they're either going to be you know dying in accident be you've been I have cardium iopathy or die of cancer that's basically how dogs die and the cardimiaopathy that they get is not an atherosclerotic cardium iopathy they get a cardimiaopathy where the muscles are actually just getting weaker and weaker and their rejection fraction is going down and in studies as short as 12 weeks they're seeing a 10 percent increase in ejection fraction of these dogs and so the question is how much of that is working through syncesses just selectively knocking out syncess and cells and letting myocytes regenerate yeah that study out of the myoclank where they they did some drug that selectively targeted syncess and it led to 20 percent increase in median lifespan certain sort of an interesting proof of principle how just well that was in I think an accelerated aging model so they had accumulated more syncess and so obviously they had to do something like that but um but it all comes back to this idea of specificity and selection you know everything we've talked about if you really stop to think about it comes down to how could you target this tissue and leave that tissue alone or how could you target this cell and leave that cell alone and the in many ways I think that's kind of got to be the next frontier here is you know even if you think about something as crude as chemotherapy it is not hard to kill a cancer cell with a chemical that's trivial it's hard to kill a cancer cell and not a normal cell and that's why chemotherapy obviously targets rapidly dividing cells and it's still very crude but the stuff we're talking about is like taking that to the next level which is how could you get this enzyme to work more efficiently but in this subset of cell you know just in the muscle but not in the fat or not in the liver and then yeah and that's again where the fasting is just so impressive to me the fact that you know all the normal cells is you're enhancing all these stress response pathways so the chemo drug becomes that most more less you know efficacious like it's like almost like a lower dose because it's like got these robust anti-apoptotic and anti stress response genes that are dealing with that sort of stress and so it's like it can take the toxic and so because of that upregulation that fasting is doing and the cancer cell just can so I'm I'm so glad that that works being done I hope that there is more funding that goes in that area I think that it is a really important area of research again like I said for the you know this is and this is all from from Voltares work and some of his colleagues that's I'm just kind of like the fan girl you know but I'm certainly I'm happy someone's doing that research and I would love to see that be used as a standard of care some day for sure so around it many people listening to this will know everything about where to find you but

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other as obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. In this podcast, I'm speaking with Dr. Ron Krauss. First and foremost, Ron is a very close friend and an amazing mentor. I was introduced to Ron probably five years ago and have worked with him closely in a number of capacities and he's always served as sort of one of the three or four lipatologists that when I get stumped on a really difficult clinical case, he's the person that I'm reaching out to along with a couple of these other folks that hopefully will also have on the podcast at some point. So he is certainly recognized globally for his research in lipatology. He wears a ton of hats. He's a clinician. Obviously, lipatologist, his interest in nutrition, genetics, drug research is quite profound. He obtained, I believe both his college degrees and medical degrees from Harvard. He's board certified in internal medicine, and her chronology in metabolism. And currently, he's a senior scientist and the director of Athosclorosis research at the Children's Hospital in Oakland. So in this episode, we talk about a lot of stuff, but obviously we're really focusing on Athosclorosis and cardiovascular disease. I was really excited to have this discussion with him because a lot of these topics, I've certainly covered in writing. As some of you may know, I have that sort of nine part straight dope on cholesterol series on the blog that I probably wrote about four or five years ago. Obviously, some of that's a little bit outdated. And I also was quite deliberate when I wrote that not to be prescriptive, meaning I don't really get into this is the drug treatment you would do for this. And I largely avoided a lot of that stuff, whereas in this podcast, Ron and I get a little bit into this. This podcast was pretty technical at times. So my hope is that both the curious patient will get a lot out of that. And hopefully the physician will get a lot out of this or the person that is also kind of on the front lines of having to make decisions about how to treat dyslipidemia and reduce the risk of Athosclorotic disease. I think a couple of really interesting things in this. I actually for the first time learned about Ron's motivation for this, both his family history and the five legendary articles that he read in the England Journal of Medicine that largely shaped his career. This is the stuff we talk about with Friedrichs and Levy and Leaves who I've written about in the cholesterol series because these guys are sort of the fathers of this space. We certainly get into one of the age-old debates about LDL particle size versus particle number, lots of controversy here. And I don't represent that we've necessarily resolved it. But I think that's the beauty of talking with really smart sophisticated nuanced people is they have the humility to say we don't know the answer sometimes. We really dive deep into the whole statin discussion. For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, this has become an increasingly controversial area and somehow it's turned into a binary discussion. Statins are good or statins are bad and very few things in life tend to be that binary. So I'm sort of surprised that it's turned into that. I don't remember if I even say this on the podcast but certainly have people who probably heard me say this before and I say it to patients all the time. The answer tools and the most important thing when you have a tool is knowing how to use it and knowing when to use it. So if you have a Philip screwdriver, it's really important to know that it's very good at putting Philip's screws into things. It's not good at putting nails into things. It's not good at cleaning windows. So I hope we can shed some light on that. We talk a little bit about the really interesting and recent stuff around chronic inflammation and the role that that plays in Athoscarosis even independent of cholesterol levels. And perhaps for me personally, one of the most interesting things we discussed was another very controversial topic which is around Niacin and Niacin, which is a branded version of that. Which those of you who follow this world will know that Niacin was basically kicked to the curb a couple of years ago. And I think that Ron's insights into that are incredibly interesting and actually have even made me re-question or reevaluate, I guess, my willingness to ever consider using it again. Ron does a great job explaining the HDL paradox, meaning why is it that all the pharmacologic efforts to raise HDL seem to also raise heart disease or at best make it no better. And finally we end with a discussion of PCSK9 inhibitors which I suspect will have a completely dedicated podcast to this topic at some point. And we touch on LP little A though later on in the release of this podcast, we're going to have a dedicated discussion on LP little A. Okay. So with all that said, you can find a ton more information including a lot of links to the papers that Ron has mentioned more information about Ron in the show notes which are at Peter at tmd.com forward slash podcast. So without further ado, here is my conversation with Dr. Ron Krauss. Well, I'm here with Dr. Ron Krauss today and this is a really exciting topic for me. People know I've written about this a lot. I talk about this a lot clinically, but the genesis of this discussion today is that about a month ago, I called Ron to have a discussion with him about one of my patients in particular. It was a patient who had a pretty elevated calcium score if I recall pretty significant LAD calcifications. That's an artery in the left side of the heart. But he was very hesitant to do any treatment and he wanted to second opinion. So I thought we should involve Ron and Ron, I remember I was sitting in my kitchen. We spoke for probably half an hour and at the end of the conversation I said, you know, Ron, I wish we recorded that conversation because this is exactly the kind of stuff that I think a lot of physicians and patients would benefit from. And so I said, you know, why don't we do this again more formally and that brings us here today. Let's start with a big question, but an important one for where we're going. And that's basically the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. A very recent review article I read described quite eloquently as a smoldering inflammatory condition fueled by lipids. What does that mean? Well, first of all, thank you, Peter, for asking me to talk with you today and address this topic, which is, you know, I have a deep and long standing interest in. Hopefully, I can address the issues that you're also interested in. And we'll have a good conversation. Well, as we're going to discuss, of course, is the underlying process that leads ultimately to vascular disease, particularly clinically-fenced heart attack and stroke. It starts in childhood as well known that there is early on the buildup of cholesterol in the artery wall that forms what's called fatty streaks. And that's a process that's actually a fairly normal condition, even in young people. And if it doesn't progress any further than that, it's really not hazardous. It's a way that arterial tissue can put cholesterol in itself and some of that cholesterol is actually used for various purposes. So that's not necessarily a pathologic process, but it can progress. And when it progresses, there is a combination of factors that conspire to make that fatty streaks into a much more toxic process. And it is fueled by lipids, the same lipids that lead to a fatty streak. But under conditions that many of us live under, there are changes in the lipoproteins that are taken up by the artery. And we'll talk about those in more detail in a minute. In particular susceptibility to oxidation and the change in the properties that allows them to stick more tightly to the artery wall. And when that happens, particularly the oxidative changes, it does trigger inflammation as a very early part of this next phase of the disease process. And inflammation is defined in one way as the accumulation of cells in the artery wall that deliver various inflammatory molecules, things that ordinarily, if one bruises oneself or has some sort of an injury. Those inflammatory processes cause redness and accumulation in some cases of clotting factors. When that happens in the artery, that can convert this fatty streak into something that is much more milder. And then there is a process that kind of feeds on itself. And it does involve platelets and clotting factors in an important way and involves a number of inflammatory molecules. And if there's continuing input of these bad, anthropogenic, if you will, lipoprotein particles, that can actually change the nature of the plaque and inflammation comes into play in a very serious way when that results in a breakdown of the surface of the plaque, which ordinarily protects it from any kind of serious consequences. So even fatty streak in development to a plaque in a plaque in this case is essentially a larger fatty streak. The plaque has a cholesterol, but it also has all these other cells. It's a much more complex phenomenon. So that plaque is ordinarily, relatively benign conditions encapsulated by a fibers layer. But inflammation in the release of various molecules can cause that fibers cap that protective cap to weaken an ultimately potentially rupture. And when that rupture occurs, that is the beginning of the end in terms of the process that we're talking about here. These cases of heart attack and stroke involve this type of acute rupture and ultimately formation of a clot that blocks the arterial flow. So starting from a relatively benign process, this can develop into something that's much more serious. Now when I was in medical school, I remember in first year pathology lecture, the pathologist said, let's see a show of hands. What is the most common first presentation of heart disease? And you know, everybody puts up their hands and says a chest pain left shoulder pain, shortness of breath, and he said, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's sudden death. Yeah. That was a little over 20 years ago. Is that still true today? The estimates I've heard and I think this is arguable because these are really rough rule of thumb calculations somewhere in the range of 30 percent, passing past the upper to 30 percent, which is still a huge number. It's staggering. It means that one third of people's first brush with the knowledge that they have at the risk of the virus is death. And I have patients, and I'm sure you do as well, who have died and come back. And so there is this process where there's an acute event that causes an irreversible change, but for some people, fortunately, we can bring them back. But together, that represents really the basis for calling this disease the silent killer. Because as you're saying, we don't, in those patients, have a mandatory symptom. Sometimes in retrospect, they are there. And that's the important reason for educating the public as organizations like the American Heart Association does as to the first signs of heart disease, because it may be, and it probably is true that a significant component of that 30 percent. Right. Upon further querying, there was some exercise intolerance in the right. And it's very hard sometimes. One of the things that we'll be talking about is ways of assessing risk. And those are still in perfect. We can't with 100 percent certainty use any kind of risk predictor to know if someone is destined to have heart attack with certainty. Yeah, you said something at the outset, which is this is a disease that begins in Infancy. And I, I, one of the, I have very few textbooks and or papers that are, I refer to so frequently that they actually sit on my desk in my office, so that every time I'm with a patient, I can pull them out. But one of them was a book that was given to me by one of my mentors. I consider you a great mentor, Tom Dase, bringing a great mentor out in Snyder, and a great mentor, and Alan gave me this textbook of pathology. I think believe it's story is the, the author. And while I believe that data represented there are somewhat dated because it was largely based on the Vietnam cohort and Korean. Yes, where obviously smoking would have been a higher prevalence than today. Right. The fact remains that when you look at autopsies of young people who died of unrelated reasons, homicides, accidents, et cetera, and you look at the histologic sections of their coronary arteries, it's amazing how many of them have lesions that are type three or beyond type three, meaning obviously a type of pathological region where you go beyond fatty street. Yes, indeed. That's right. So a subset of these youths will have more advanced lesions and the studies have been done. I have linked all of the usual risk factors, smoking certainly diabetes, hypertension, and dyslopidemia all of and the in a lipid disorder, all of those have been associated with the more advanced lesions and those individuals. So is your point out even even a more significant plaque development in a current childhood? I think the thing that's hard for people to understand, and I think it's true of most chronic diseases, but I don't think any disease is as clear as it is with atherosclerosis, which is the compounding nature of the disease. You know, another great example of one of those questions that the professor asks that gets everybody stumped, which is what's the greatest risk for heart disease? You know, is it smoking? Nope. Is it high blood pressure? Nope. Is it dyslopidemia? Nope. It's age. That's right. It's age. I mean, and why is it age because it's exposure? It's time. It's area under the curve. Yeah, that's exactly true. You know, age, regardless of a risk factor, or the cuts across many of the diseases, chronic diseases that we have to deal with, cancer, for example. And yeah, that's right. It's a cumulative process that can progress at various rates, depending the condition. So people, as you know, when we talk about, we have genetically elevated, severely elevated cholesterol levels, we'll have that process accelerate and have the disease so up clinically early on, sometimes with these severe genetic disorders and the teens, whereas others, most of the population, fortunately, who do have risk factors, show a gradual increase in the manifestation of disease as a result of those risk factors as a function of their age. You know, at last check, and I can't remember if it was jamma or another journal, but it was about a year ago, and they looked at some actuarial data for people out through being past centenarians. And the only disease, once you normalized for a few things, the only disease that increased monotonically by decade in risk was atherosclerosis. From childhood, yeah. Yeah, even cancer, actually, you know, by think by the ninth decade, it started to come down. Yeah, you know what, yeah, it's right. It's definitely the latency period for cancer also is the factor there as well. So there's this sort of latency period, nothing happens in all of a sudden in all of the research, it pops up. I'm sure a lot of people listening to this are going to say, okay, well, God, I'm really confused by half the terms you guys just use. So let's unpack some of them. Beginning with, we use the terms sometimes lipid, cholesterol, like the protein. We throw those terms around interchangeably, but I think it's probably important to give the average person a sense of an understanding. So what is LDLC versus LDLP versus APOB of things like that? Sure. The underlying concept that we are going to address is cholesterol because that's really the compound. It's the molecule that winds up causing plaques. So cholesterol is indeed an important component of the plaque and it gets into the plaque by uptake of cholesterol from lipoprotein particles. And so lipoproteins are complex, spherical macromolecules, big guys, which come in varying sizes, and are composed of cholesterol along with other lipids, such as tracliss ride, and most importantly, perhaps for distinguishing the various types of lipoproteins, is their protein content. So there's a variety of different proteins that form the package that actually it capsule around the lipid. So let me interrupt you for one second. Is it just a point at clarification? The reason we even need these lipoproteins is that cholesterol is hydrophilic. It's like a pertene hydrophobic. It repels water. And so therefore to move cholesterol through the bloodstream, you have to package it in something that is hydrophilic or dissolves in water. And correct? Yeah. And for the techno files here, it's the cholesterol ester. So there's a, yes, it forms a cholesterol and it's the fatty form of cholesterol is cholesterol ester. The other form is more waxy. So the fatty form is transported right from one tissue to another. And that is the purpose of lipoprotein not just cholesterol, of course, but tracliss or as I mentioned, perhaps more importantly for many functions and energy metabolism. And other compounds are just phospholipid. As well as passengers on the truck, certain vitamins, et cetera. So these are packages that serve an important biological function. They're not here to cause heart attacks. We divide them into various categories, but the common parlance that sort of the most typical way that we think about cholesterol as a pathologic factor is when it's on LDL. So that's called LDL cholesterol. And that measures the amount of cholesterol on an LDL particle. And LDL is low density lipoprotein. So this is a form of lipoprotein that is characterized by size. And it's also characterized by its density, which is related to its capacity to float. Because there's, when there's fat in anything, it causes the thing to float. And that's to very degrees defines different classes of lipoprotein. And it's the LDL that is the most strongly connected to cardiovascular disease risk. And the cholesterol in LDL, which is measured commonly clinically as LDL cholesterol, is what has been most widely associated with cardiovascular risk. And forms the basis for many of our recommendations for lowering risk. But it's important to recognize that this is a tag on a much more complex substance of a particle. And this will talk about, I think, very shortly. Particle is what causes the plaque to develop. And it brings the cholesterol with it. So the LDL particle, the low density lipoprotein itself, this spherical molecule, or macromolecule, which carries around cholesterol, fossil lipid, triglyceride, it has a signature on it, doesn't it? Something called APOB100. That's right. The key protein that holds this particle together that allows it to form a sphere and to encapsulate the lipid cargo is called APOB protein B. There are two major forms of APOB. The one that's found in LDL, particles is called APOB100. And oftentimes that is used as a surrogate for measuring LDL. Particle concentration, this will talk about. And this is a big clinical distinction. I think it is safe to say, at least in my, you know, relatively modest sampling of physicians. Most physicians let alone most patients are not really clear on the distinction between the number when they say LDL is 100. They don't necessarily realize what they're saying is the LDL cholesterol is 100 milligrams per deciliter, meaning if you took all of the LDL particles in the body, smash them apart, gather the cholesterol, ester, the mass per unit volume is 100. And free cholesterol. And that's, yes. And that's very different from saying how many of these particles do we have. That's right. And that's important. And so that observation really forms a very significant component of my history in this field because I entered the field as a young fellow, knowing about LDL cholesterol, I was interested in diet effects and drug effects and heart disease. But I learned about lipoproteins actually from a group of investigators in Berkeley, California, who were part of a team that initially identified lipoprotein particles. And over the course of the next 10 or so years, I dug into that knowledge and discovered that there are subtypes of the various forms of LDL as well as other lipoproteins which we can talk about perhaps in a few minutes. But focusing on the LDL, there can be variation in the amount of cholesterol that is carried on the LDL particle. But there's only one APOB per LDL. So APOB represents a pretty good signature for an LDL particle. It is found on some other particles, but it's primarily on LDL. But the amount of cholesterol attached to that APOB as part of this particle can vary as can other lipoprotein components. And that results in variation in both the size, as I mentioned, and the density. So that some forms of LDL have less cholesterol. And some have more cholesterol. The ones that have less cholesterol are smaller, generally, and the ones that have more cholesterol are larger. But they all have one APOB protein B. So there can be an important clinical consequence of focusing on LDL cholesterol to the exclusion of APOB because it's the particle that is really the agent of damage in the artery. And measuring LDL cholesterol can under represent the number of LDL particles compared with the measurement of APOB protein B or APOB, which is a much better measure than number of particles. And when individuals have smaller particles because of this variation in lipid content, they are actually at high risk of heart disease because those particles have that render them more pathologic, more toxic. So there's a double whammy. If you have small particles, first of all, clinical measurement of LDL cholesterol may under represent the number of particles. And furthermore, those particles themselves are considered by many, although there's still not total consensus on this point, to have greater pathologic properties. So let's use a specific example. So if a patient has a blood cholesterol level, and let's just assume it's LDL calculate a measure directly, not even calculated. And the LDL cholesterol is 100 milligrams per desoliter. At the framing hand population, that would place them at about the 20th percentile. But let's say that patient has an LDL particle number of 141300 nanomole per liter. And of course, in the units that tells you it's a number per unit volume, that places them at the 50th percentile. Now, at least to me, the literature is very clear on, in the case of discordance, which of the two is driving risk. I think both the Mesa population, the multi-ethnic study of Athoscarosis, and the framing hand, and framing hand offspring study, make it very clear that risk is tracking with the number of particles, not the cholesterol concentration. Do you agree with that or are my missing some? No, the data are out there. And just to take a step back, LDL cholesterol, that clinical measurement, has worked reasonably well for a significant subset of the population as a marker for LDL particles, because most individuals have particles somewhere in the middle of the LDL size and density range, and the cholesterol content in those particles, is fairly proportional to the number of LDL particles. But where things break down is the increasing proportion of the population who have different LDL particle distributions. You need to consider that higher LDL particles with normal LDL cholesterol, which I will answer your question. Yes, it was associated with an increase in risk. This is not reflected by LDL cholesterol. So that is the discordance we're talking about on the high end and conversely individuals who have high LDL cholesterol, but normal levels of A, B, will tend to have disproportionate the less heart disease risk than would be predicted from the LDL cholesterol. So that's the discordance, which I think is pretty well demonstrated in a significant subset of the population at both ends. But underlying that, and again, there's some debate on this issue, it certainly reflects the numbers of particles. And that is the bottom line, but it also reflects the types of those particles. So there's really two features that both ends of that distribution. Smaller, cholesterol, good particles associated with discordance, that the localest role that HIPAA protein B ratio and conversely larger LDL particles associated with less risk at the other end. And there may be systemic factors here at play, because you know, there's some pretty, I think pretty widely accepted data now. I think 10 years ago this was a little more obscure, but one of the greatest drivers of the discordance in the wrong direction, meaning the LDL particle is disproportionately higher than the LDL cholesterol, is metabolic syndrome. In fact, there's a very beautiful graph that I've written about at some point in my blog that talks about how based on anywhere from 0 to 5 of the characteristics that an individual has at metabolic syndrome, the proportion of discordance goes up. So it also could be that as discordance rises, risk rises because of the other factors such as hyper-insulinemia, which itself may contribute to entomal damage, inflammation, and other things. Is that possible? It is absolutely possible and likely to be true. So this brings up a pattern, like a protein pattern that I will take some credit for having to find in my own way about 25 years ago, 27 years ago, and now called the Atharogenic Dislipidemia, Atharogenic Lipoprotein phenotype, which is a constellation of lipid changes that includes higher triglyceride, lower HDL cholesterol. So that's the cholesterol in the protective form of lipoproteins being deficient and a predominance of smaller LDL particles. And so that triad, that lipid triad has defined average genetic dyslopinemia, and it folds right into the metabolic syndrome. Right, two of those three make up two of your five. That's right. Criteria for metabolic syndrome, which for the listener would be low HDL cholesterol, high triglyceride, high fasting, glucose, high blood pressure, and girth basically obese. Exactly. Drunkal obese. Yeah. So I remember being part of the discussions where that metabolic syndrome was defined. This syndrome acts. This is very interesting. Yeah, well, that started with insulin resistance, this is centerpiece. You can put various molecules in various processes, through the center. They all contribute. And as you point out, in hyperincinemia, associated with insulin resistance is likely another marker of another process related to glucose metabolism and its consequences. And then the blood pressure connection is an intriguing one, but that's also part of it. But a lot of that is driven by increased girth. I mean, it's sort of of the five conditions. The one that I think is the most prevalent underlying factor that these two, the development of metabolic syndrome, is increased abdominal fat, which is associated with increased. Specific ways of cholesterol fat. This is what we're going to do around the internal organs. And you can have metabolic syndrome without that, but the vast majority of people that certainly Caucasians. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And non-cocations, populations such as the Stations, who don't have increased waste, still can have increased fat internally, as part of the syndrome. But it's probably acting on an underlying genetic predisposition, which is very common. And so, and there's many other factors that come into play as part of the syndrome. But I would say that just the pedemia is probably both clinically and pathologically the one that I think has the most substance in terms of a direct causal connection to cardiovascular disease. Yeah. And you know, I'll tell you, it's a very interesting historical footnote, uh, Gary Tobs, a mutual friend of ours. And I don't know if this actually was any any of his books, or I might have read this in one of the outtakes. But it was an interesting footnote, which was basically at the time of the framing him study, which I'm talking about the very, very first framing him study, which was really a two-part study. Of course, one of the things that came out of that study was that low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides was four times more predictive of athroscarosis than elevated LDL cholesterol. Now, that rings true with what we just said about metabolic syndrome. Now, we're in the five criteria of metabolic syndrome was high LDLC. It's low HDLC and high trig. But it's interesting that the LDL cholesterol story really took off. And at least Gary argued, I believe if I'm remembering the argument, that part of that had to do with the fact that the kind of blank on the name of the trial, the first trial, there was the LRCCP, but then there was the one before it, uh, it had a funny name, like, improve it or somebody wasn't. It was like, no, it was a trial of fibroid, the fibroid trial was LRCCP. No, that was that was close to our meeting. So I think that's when you think, okay, okay, I think you're thinking of this LRC. Yeah, I was, I was, so part of the writing, yeah, that's where I got my training in, uh, but it's, uh, before I came out to Berkeley, actually, that's what I got my first dose. And that study was going on at that time and there was a lot of a nail biting. Well, and, and in the argument here was look, we kind of spent, we lost a decade and a half between say 1980 and 1995, when we missed the role of insulin resistance because we really went down this LDL cholesterol rabbit hole and didn't necessarily see the bigger picture. Yeah. And one of the things I hope we have time to talk about today because it actually something that I spend more time scratching my head about than anything else is you look at a drug like niacin, which lowers apoB, LDLC, and raises HDLC. So in theory, it's doing everything in the right direction and yet when it comes to outcomes, it's a very confusing picture. So maybe later on this afternoon, we can get to that because I think that's there's going to be some rich info in there. If you put that on a table, I'll be happy to pick it up when you're ready. I'm ready to lunch with that. I cannot wait. We're definitely going to do that. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about a paper that you were an author on this year. It was the European Athrosclerosis Society consensus statement. Now, you and I were joking about this a while ago that you almost couldn't believe this paper needed to be written, but sometimes there's a benefit in writing it in. What was the conclusion of that paper? Or more to the point consensus statement. It was more than just a paper. I mean, it was really a four to four. So this this paper assembled a multiple lines of evidence addressing the question. This LDL causes heart disease. It's LDL a causal factor for heart disease. And just to be clear, the counter argument is sure people with high LDL are more likely to get heart disease that can't be disputed. The epidemiology is clear. The counter argument is but LDL is not a causal role. That's right. And it's associated with that efforts to lower LDL cholesterol are not fully justified as a means of attacking the cause. I don't want to be responsible for having stated that incorrectly because I still can't quite believe anybody would hold that opinion. But that was my understanding that led to the coming together to counteract that perception that lowering LDL was not beneficial. But there are there are many people. I mean, not that I spent terrible amounts of time on Twitter, but it's a pretty commonly held view at least in the vocal minority that loved to write about this and talk about this that hey, LDL cholesterol is in myth. Right. Heart disease has nothing to do with this. And the problem is and it's a comment on the paper to some extent. But I'll tell you there is a second component to that effort that is still being written. It was planned and will be a two part series. The first part is assembling all the evidence from epidemiology, clinical trials, genetics, et cetera, the speak to the causality. And the second one was really relating all of this information to the role of LDL and the pathophysiology of Athroscrosis and that paper is working progress. But it clearly goes to papers assemble just about all the evidence when needs to support the use of LDL cholesterol. And when will that second paper be out? I can't tell you you don't even need to take on longer. Yeah. We'll certainly link to the first one in the show notes because that was published in early 2008. Yeah, we expected next year or so. But one thing I do want to say because there's a caveat and part of my life as a researcher as well as a clinician is recognizing the complexity of what we're dealing with. In discussion such as this, it's important to keep the concepts straightforward and understandable to the best to be possible. But the flip side of that is the risk of oversimplifying a complex situation. So when I just said that the evidence is at lowering LDL cholesterol as beneficial, that's not always true. And so when complete if one is so inclined to the evidence that under certain conditions and certain populations with certain approaches, only LDL cholesterol does not result in reduced heart disease risk. And to the extent that you consider that to be a fatal flaw in the argument, that can be a, I think, brain misleading because it's not the fact is that LDL is causal, but there are other circumstances that modify that causality of the extent that some forms of LDL under certain conditions and this may not be uncommon can be elevated without pathologic consequences. And so lowering LDL in those cases may not get benefit. And that we know what there is heterogeneity and the clinical response when one looks at how do they ask your protection with LDL lowering treatment. So I have to absolutely extend the simple notion of LDL causality to saying that when has to look very carefully at the arguments against LDL causality because the latch on to piece, but this is piece of information that are really misleading. It's just because lowering LDL cholesterol is not always beneficial. It doesn't mean that LDL is not pathological. And the second component of that is the focus on LDL cholesterol that goes back to our initial discussion here today as a marker for a causal mechanism, but it's the particles that are causal and LDL cholesterol. As we just talked about, it's not always mirror the number of LDL particles. Now, I don't think we should necessarily take the time to go through the paper and incredible detail, but it did touch on eight criteria for causality, plausibility, strength, biological gradient, temporal sequence, the specificity, consistency, coherence, and then the relative risk reduction or risk reduction within intervention. Among those, I found the Mendelian randomization to also be very compelling. So, you know, when I talk about this with people, I generally talk about the natural experiments, such as the people with PCSK9 mutations, both hypofunction or gain of function loss of function PCSK9, the FH patients, the Mendelian randomization in the intervention. If you were going to bring up three points from the paper that you think probably are most relevant, what would they be? Well, you've just touched on probably the number one strongest argument. And it's really where we, those of us who have been in the field for decades, started with being impressed with the role of genetic elevations of LDL, very, very strong evidence. I would put that probably right at the top, and you talked about this condition, familiar hyperclistolemia, when there's two doses of an abnormal gene, the LDL, levels from skyrocket, I referred to that little while ago, as the condition that can lead to heart disease early in childhood is unequivocal. In fact, the reason I got a little bit taken it back by the need to do this more extensively, which I think, by the way, was quite a good exercise for both for those of us who didn't, and people hopefully would be to. But all you have to do is look at a eight-year-old child with cholesterol levels that are either nine times normal, whose candidate for liver and heart transplant, to know that that's it, that's causal. But the genetic support it beyond that. Right. Now in those cases, the genetic defect is one in the LDL receptor. Correct. So closing the loop on how this works, right? The body makes cholesterol. The body, you know, so every cell in the body makes cholesterol, then cholesterol gets recirculated, ends up mostly back in the liver. It gets secreted. Some of it in bile gets reabsorbed, and this process continues. But it's this LDL clearance. Most leave the LDL receptors in the liver that seems to be where a lot of these genetic things go awry. That's right. Yeah, the liver really is the factory, as well as the disposal plant, if you will. Most of the cholesterol that winds up in the blood is released in terms of in the lipoportines that are synthesized by the liver. And then they come back to the liver. Ultimately, after they've done their thing, so to speak, deliver their cargo or interacted with cells in various ways, and come back to the liver. And a large portion of that return is mediated by these receptors that latch onto a pobe. It's able be that is the kind of the key that binds to the lock that snaps up the LDL and the liver. And it grades it and it's not a biome. And that's the way we dispose of cholesterol. There are other mechanisms involving HDL. But the receptors are a key determinant, and new represent a mechanism by which most of the drugs that we use to lower cholesterol act to increase LDL receptor mediated disposal of LDL particles. I'm just going to connect that concept to something you brought up earlier. And that is the duration of exposure to, in this case, high levels of LDL. We talked about it as a function of age, the longer the, the reviewers, the longer the exposure. But there's also a dynamic aspect to LDL metabolism that we just touched on. That is particles are produced actually precursors of LDL, which are called the LDL. It's carried mostly, right? This is an apoporty and BS. Well, those particles are being actively secreted. They interact with peripheral tissues receptors and other transporters that handle various lipids in various ways. And like in enzymes, centers a lot of processing that goes on. And then what's left comes back the liver throughout the LDL receptors. Now, if that process happens riskically, if there is a nice fast turnover, if you will, of those particles, you can just see that there is less time for the arteries to be exposed to any of those pathologic forms of lipoportyings. They can be scooped up. But what underlies, at least to me, a common concept, a common underlying factor that connects a various lipid traits to heart disease risk is the extent to which they influence the circulation time. That is the length of time that a particle is circling in the blood. So that particles are not being cleared by LDL receptors. Efficiently, they will circulate longer and have more opportunities for mischief. What is the typical half-life of a VL-DL particle? So very low-density lipoproking, IDL, intermediate density, and low-density. I'm probably going to get this wrong beak, and this is where I don't want to have to go back and look at the textbook and I love it. Directionally. So particularly for a larger VL-DL, a track list, the half-life is half an hour an hour and two hours. It's pretty rapid, because that particle is rapidly subject to enzymatic digestion. Let me just jump to the LDL. So the LDL that are formed from those precursors, more like 12 to 24 hours, or longer. So it turns out that smaller particles have a longer mess in its time, because they are less avidly removed by LDL receptors. So there's a range of circulation times for LDL. In some cases, you know, days actually, and then IDL are somewhere in the middle. The intermediate density of that propoteins are ideal, which we're referring to. That's the step between VL-DL and LDL that is involved in their metabolism. So it's these longer exposure times, and these intermediate particles can include and do include very pathologic forms as well. And so there are disorders and metabolic syndrome coming back to that is one of them, where the clearance of those intermediate particles, which also comprise what we call remnants, partial breakdown products of the LDL on the way to forming LDL. Those intermediate particles can have much longer exposure times, and they can be subject to various pathologic effects involving oxidation and the position of partial digestion products of various lipids that cause them to be more toxic. And those particles can be damaging even with a shorter residence time because they're so toxic. So that gets into what I was referring to earlier, as somebody created complexity of beyond thinking just about LDL cholesterol, thinking about LDL particles, thinking about the types of LDL particles, in terms of the pathophysiology, and then also thinking about the role of these remnant lipoproteins. They all participate in this potential risk. And it comes down and it might be in the end to the length of time that a particle with certain pathologic effects is circulating in the blood. And this LDL cholesterol, LDL remnant problem is one that is unfortunately very often missed even by relatively astute clinicians. Your textbook case is these type 3s, these hyper triglyceridemia who have normal APOB, normal LDL, see you think they're relatively low risk. You sort of miss the fact that their VLDL cholesterol is 75 milligrams per desiliter and they have these just devastating, atherosclerotic plaques. Yeah and that was again one of my learning experiences when I was at the NIH, the NIH at a time with working with Dr. Fredrickson and Levy when the very least for the listener, it's important for them. I think to understand the luminaries that you just described. Right, Fredrickson and Levy and Lees, I mean let's put these guys in context right. This is you had people that figured out that there was this thing called cholesterol, but it was really those three that did the pioneering work in the 1970s that laid the groundwork for fractionating, figuring out all of the different subparables. 60s, late 60s. Yeah, no, late 60s. I'll just give you a slight anecdote since you paused me on this. I was always been interested in heart disease because it runs in my family. As a medical student, I read a series of five articles that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and I think you're referring to the three authors, Fredrickson, Levy and Lees, that completely transformed me. It was a epiphany because those five articles describe lipid disorders in terms of genetic types, differing like protein profiles that had different metabolic effects, different consequences and very influenced differently by various diets. I thought this was absolutely the most important lead I can imagine. I made it my business when it came to deciding what I was going to do after my medical training is to come back Instagram, Dan Ayes from Work for Those Guys. I was fortunate enough to be able to do that. It was really in the era where what was called the Fredrickson typing system, identified these various forms and then when you just refer to the genetic forms of lipids that have been going off and always consider, it was called Type III and that was characterized by abnormalities in receptor mediated clearance of these remnants of particles through a mutation in April, protein E are varying in April, and that also was fascinating. I happened to be in California when the April E is where discovered. I sort of feel like one of these characters that shows up at the appropriate time. It was called the Ardridge Pep Diad initially. The history is just, I wrote a review actually of the early history of lap of protein research, which I would commend to the point that I was here last year. It was in a journal of the bit of research in 2016. If I just got a fan letter for that article because anybody that seriously interested in this field should probably understand the origins. In fact, I got a letter, we have to that paper was published. I got an email from Joe Goldstein who is the other one of the other livener icons in the field. He said, everybody that goes into the lipid research should be this paper. It's not a book. I don't make any money off of it. We're going to make sure that people want to get smart on that story. Anyway, piggyback to these remnants, I think particle for particle, the remnants are probably the most pathologic particles, because of this rampant ethoscrosis when there's elevation of remnants. Unfortunately, this condition of Type III is fairly weird. It's like one in 10,000. But it does illustrate the same analogy. I've seen certain, so I've seen you've seen something. Right. So yeah, what I was trying to say, actually initially what I was trying to say, when I was at NIH and my training, I saw all these things. All the types of them. You collected them. Yeah. I mean, patients who had the Type III, we had Type III, which was a serious elevation of triglyceride. Type II was familiar hyperclosed training. It goes on and on. Yes. And it's really striking. I tell my students, I've lecture on this to students at Berkeley. I show them pictures of what are called San Thomas, which are the positive cholesterol on lipids and tissues. And you have these very characteristic lesions that used to be rampant in patients before we had adequate recognition and treatment. As a manifestation of the underlying pathology that also affects the arteries, the cholesterol that winds up in the arteries can also break into the skin. And these are just very striking illustrations of the role of genetics. So it gets back to your earlier question, about causality. There are so many situations where genetics helps in establishing causality. And this certainly is one of them. After that, you asked me, what are one, two, and three, right? You asked me how many, what might my top three? I didn't answer that. And before we leave FH, I think the other nice thing about the PCSK9 mutation. You know, FH is only showing you the change in one direction. But with PCSK9, you see both directions. That's right. I believe the hyperfunctioning were the first people identified correct. Yes. So these people had an enzyme PCSK9. It hyperfunctioned. Therefore, it this enzymes one of its roles is to degrade the LDL receptor. And so they had fewer LDL receptors. They had more LDL. They looked a lot like FH patients. Correct? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just to begin for the technical who was in the phone. Oh, it's actually not an enzyme. It's kind of behaves like an enzyme. It actually drives LDL receptors into the garbage disposal machinery in the cell called lysosomes and causes the LDL receptors to be broken down. But it's the same end basaltus you get less LDL receptors higher LDL cholesterol. And then the mutations in the other direction are the ones that led to the development of PCSK9. The lysophunction, antibody is the PCSK9 mimic the lysophunction mutations which lower LDL. And that's one of my, you know, when I get to tell these stories one day, I'll look back and say that was my aha moment because I think that paper came out in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was either O4 or O6, but I remember this well, which was the discovery of those families with the hypofunctioning PCSK9. Yes. These people walked around with an LDL cholesterol between 10 and 20 milligrams per desol. Yeah. Two things about them stood out. The first they never got heart disease. The second, it didn't seem to suffer any other consequences that you might concern yourself with. Right. Yeah. One of those patients, classically, I was, I think a physical therapist, somebody that was very active and had an LDL of in the teens, which is, you know, one sixth normal and is doing fine. Yeah. So that's another use of genetics in a way to confirm that lowering a LDL. Not necessarily using all the ways that LDL can be lowered, but at least certainly that form of LDL lowering is healthy. And probably most forms of LDL lowering a healthy, we have very little evidence to the contrary. Do you want to say anything about the LDL and randomization? It's, you know, I think it's not at the most intuitive concept to people, but it is actually a very powerful concept. So the principle of medialian randomization, first of all, Mendel, regra Mendel was an 18th century monk who discovered the principle of inheritance of traits in P's actually. But the idea is that these genetic variants are randomly distributed in the population. So that assumption underlies this concept of medial randomization because then you can say that the occurrence of a genetic variant in the population or a collection of variants can be either single or multiple variants that are associated with a biomarker, such as LDL cholesterol, can be used to test the causality of LDL by looking at another relationship. And that is the association of those genetic variants with the disease process. So for example, and so I'm going to give you an example because it's really a little bit abstract without an example and we'll talk about PCSK9. So the PCSK9 loss of function mutation causes a lowering of LDL. There is independent evidence that that mutation is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Nothing to do with LDL, just the genetic association with outcomes. That relationship parallels very closely the relationship of that variant LDL cholesterol. The difference is that the risk associated with a genetic of variant of risk of heart disease is actually less than would be predicted from the LDL cholesterol using standard risk relationships because this is lifelong exposure. This gets back to the exposure so the genetic marker like this in the Indian Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended tells you that lifelong exposure to a genetic variant that either races or floors risk. Well, it has effects that can be attributed to LDL because that the LDL change is predicts that risk relationship. Yeah, whereas a lot of the conventional risk models are basically looking at maybe a decade of risk or something like that and they're always going to fall short, both under and over estimating long term risks. So in the paper that you referred to that the Kiemata of the European consensus, there was a heavy dose of Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended Mended either the main author or one of the key authors. It did a very good job of showing how the genetic markers for their connected to LDL receptor levels, both so PCSK9, others associated with higher receptor activities. Well, predict cardiovascular risk much more robustly than do the results of clinical trials. So that risk reduction, which is parallel, but is displaced because the magnitude of that effect is blunted because it's not a lifelong exposure. So it's very instructive. Yeah, let's go back to something else you said a few moments ago that I think is, I would say 10 years ago, I don't remember when Jim Otposes and Alice has came out, but Jim, who's an incredibly thoughtful person in this field wrote a paper that basically said, once you normalize for the number of LDL particles, the size doesn't matter. Now, I'm going to go, you said that your intuition is that that's actually not correct, that particle for particle, a small particle is more atherogenic. Is that a ferrocessment of your thought? It is, it is definitely an assessment of my thought. And unlike what we've just been talking about, we don't have a way showing in-controverably that that's true. So when tries to sort of dance around this question by using statistics, can you use statistics to factor out everything with which the particle size? And let me clarify one other thing before I go on and that is, the reason particle size got on the map was that I wrote a paper, I think in the 80s actually, probably three plus years ago, in which the only test we had was particle size measurement. And we showed the particle size, small particle size, which was related to risk. But we also said it was associated with lower HDL and higher track, let's say that, so that was the definition of this triad that was just talked about. And we never said that the particle size was independent. We never actually said that. I mean, I've never said it was related to independent of the risk. It was a marker for this whole syndrome. The particle size context that I was referring to early on in our discussion today was not the size of particles but the numbers of particles of different sizes. That's a somewhat different concept. So there are techniques that measure the given number for whether most of the LDL and the blood is larger. And we typically did bifurcate this, like something like 20.5 nanometers or something. Right. And the other thing I'm going to say because this is what I'm going to say because there's an opportunity to say it. If you measure those particle sizes correctly, the distribution in the population is by modal. That means there is a discrete subset of the population that has smaller LDL particles. Now that says nothing about their heart disease risk. That's just that says that there's something going on that tips in a quantum way towards the small LDL trait. And that is the marker for the metabolic syndrome. So that's not about heart disease risk. That's a metabolic marker. The heart disease risk depends on the magnitude of that small LDL mode. If you have a lot of LDL particles that are small, that's bad. Now the argument that our folks and others have made using statistics that will come back to an amendment is to why I think this is flawed approach. Is that if you do certain statistical corrections for interrelationships of various particles with each other, there is a significant relationship to risk of larger LDL as well. So that's not untrue. A larger LDL can be a matter of fact. As long as something is less than 70 nanometers, it can enter the sub-endithelial space. So any large or small LDL can enter space. So it can't be a to resonance time. Yes, how long are they stay? So it turns out. So this is going to be a little bit complicated, but I'm going to try maybe we have an audience that's willing to handle it. I'm going to work like a company work through this with you because I know what I want to say and I just want to make sure that I say clearly. Let's talk about larger LDL. So this in this large LDL mode, that signifies sort of the flip side of metabolic syndrome. Generally, identify people who have not only larger LDL, but higher HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride. So that's a low risk syndrome and often low insulin. That's right. And so quite a part from the question are these particles that are worse. They signify a metabolic profile where there's a pretty brisk circulation of those particles in the exposure to the every wall is very low. Now if you have an LDL receptor defect, it also causes large LDL. Right, FH patients have large LDL particles. So why is that that's because of the risk of the time as much higher? Right. And so neither I, well, there's some people that have taken some of my own work and taken it to an extreme that I don't feel is justified and that is to say that large LDL are not anthropogenic. It all, they certainly can be. There's no question about that. The question is, are they equally atherogenic to smaller particles or any other particles in the LDL spectrum? And I'm just, I'll just say this, the work that you're referring to did not address that. All it said was that you can, you can show that the large LDL are associated with risk. And then the second thing is that if you adjust the total LDL particles for the peak size of LDL, the peak size is not associated with risk. So those are two different statistical manipulations, neither of which, neither of which, this proof that it had pothices, that's smaller LDL, carry more anthropogenic risk. And we have an example of something, I'm going to tell you again genetically, which may or may not be something that your audience is familiar with. There's another genetic syndrome that involves a variant that affects the region of the genome, which is responsible for synthesizing a protein called sortle. So where TIL, I am. The genetic variant was discovered probably six or seven or eight years ago now. And was associated with both high risk of cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol. And in fact, the association of the genetic variant with cardiovascular disease was as strong, if not slightly stronger than the associations of genetic variants in the LDL receptor itself. So this was a new player in the spectrum of causal factors. Again, relating a genetic mechanism that raises LDL to an effect on cardiovascular disease risk through a pathway that doesn't involve the LDL receptor. This is not an LDL receptor story. What we published as part of the initial description of this variant in this relationship to cholesterol metabolism is that in two independent populations using two independent methods, it's specifically associated with small and very small LDL, not the Rgil LDL at all. So here's the genetic variant that as far as we can tell affects. So it's not connecting clearance. Well, we don't know about clearance. I can't tell you about clearance. I always can say it's not LDL receptor mediated clearance. There may be, we don't know. And this is, and it could be, could be, name and pick one like one player. So if you're going to ask me later on, what one of the experiments that I would do, if I had all the resources in the role that would relate to this mechanism, because the genetic association, it's not clear exactly what's being affected by the genetic variant. It's not clear how it works, but what's definitely clear is that that variant is associated, in terms of that, but protein changes or anything else that we can measure in the usual risk factor range exclusively with small and very small. It's even a subtype of small LDL, but it's that collection of smaller particles that is somehow affected by this variant. So those patients have elevated triglycerides or low HGLC? No. No. It's a exclusive encounter is the argument that I would say, gosh, maybe these small particles ultimately are just a marker for an inflammatory metabolic dysregulation. They largely are. But this example, this gets into what you might consider in the US. I'll tell you another anecdote. When I first discovered that people had all these different forms of LDL, this is again in the 80s. I don't know how many. This is 35 years ago now. I was invited to give a talk a couple of talks actually, various meetings, one of which was in San Diego, actually, and others were represented this data. And it was using not the current methodologies, but a very elaborate procedure involving the ultrasound refuge, which separates these particles into various fractions. I have a picture of what I showed on the wall of my office because it's so emblematic of the existence of these discrete forms of LDL. And I remember talking about this to very intelligent and experienced people in the field, and it was considered as a terech. And for about 15 years, nobody paid any attention to it because it was felt nobody else had methods to show what we had been showing in large populations. Unfortunately, they had around that was remedied by more widely available methodologies that we were possibly responsible for. But the bottom line is that the recognition of these various forms of LDL, we tended to simplify to avoid having people think it was too as a terech. So we talked about large and small as if they were only two forms. And these two modes, which is a terech. And all that's true, but within the small LDL mode, within both of those, but the small LDL, there's yet another sub-type. And it's this very small LDL. So the garden variety small LDL that is generally measured by techniques that are being used such as NMR and Amability method. Well, I actually measure this small LDL that you're talking about. It's part of this generalized metabolic syndrome. But this very small guy looks like it's another pathway. It's another pathway. And it's a pathway that has a strong genetic association with risk. And we are, I'll just say this to this audience. We are trying to do some studies and this gets back to the studies I'd love to do to test the hypothesis. These particles may be secreted directly. So this might be a mechanism that spits out a pathologic form of LDL without going through the VL-DL pathway. That's a hypothesis that we're now. So it sounds like almost like an L-P little A. In a way it is. Yeah, this is a good point. It's a particle that we don't know how to lower. I don't know how to go up. We were assigned to other, that's another topic I guess. We're not going to get to L-P little. That's another topic. But yes, it's a genetic factor that is associated with risk that we don't yet know what to do with. So let's go back to something that you've kind of touched on a little bit, which is canal-DL, cholesterol, slash LDL, particle, slash APOB, B2L. And I'm referring specifically to a pharmacologic intervention. So I think we've already established that the people so genetically blessed to have hypofunctioning PCSK9 seem to be completely fine. But if someone came along and said, look, I'm walking around at the 30th percent hell of the population, I want to walk around at the first percent hell of the population. I'm going to pharmacologically lower it. Is there a downside? Right. So I guess I'm hung up on genetics today because I think the best scenario to consider and evaluating the pros and cons of RAL-LDL, our genetics syndrome is associated with RAL-LDL. And we just talked about one of them. So PCSK9, lots of functional mutations are an example of which you're asking those individuals have lifelong exposure to RAL-LDL. And as far as we can tell, do fine. There are people who have abnormalities in the APOB protein that results in impaired production of LDL, ultimately, and most people do very well. And we have less heart disease, they think they live longer. So this is the genetic evidence for the safety and the benefit really of having RAL-LDL. That doesn't imply that we can extrapolate those genetic observations to all treatments. Now for the PCSK9 inhibitors, if we assume that the use of the antibodies, the lower PCSK9 therapeutically, mimic the genetic effect, then one would have the same confidence that this would not be hazardous. You know, yet no other that they're not other effects of these antibodies. It may not necessarily fully mimic the genetic effect. But by and large, I think it is a vote of confidence that those treatments that lower the that particular treatment with PCSK9 inhibition probably does. Not only lower risk, but have no significant downsides, but they're the LDL lowering. But we don't know the clinical trials of any of the drugs at LL, have not done long enough to know what the life-long effects might be. So if you look at the most widely prescribed class of drugs for lipid lowering, it's obviously going to be statins. And statins really do two things. You know, they have a direct effect, which is they inhibit the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis. And so that directly lowers the burden of cholesterol, thereby lowering the burden of lipoprotein. But in many ways, their indirect effect is at least as strong, which is the liver in response to this upregulates the LDL receptor and you get enhanced clearance. Now, the latter, we certainly have a genetic model to look at. Do we further form a do we know of people who have deficient cholesterol synthesis? Outside of the extreme, we know that there are certainly inborn areas of metabolism that are uniformly fatal. But outside of those people are people walking around with low cholesterol, or the defect is in cholesterol synthesis, that would give us confidence that, hey, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis can't be that bad. I'd have to say I don't know that there is such a genetic variant. There are genetic variants in the rate limiting enzyme, HMG query.tartase that is the target of statins that affect LDL levels in heart disease risk in the expected direction. But those variants have a modest effect size. They are not big time, players to knock down LDL to those same real good. That's what makes the PCS canine story so exceptional. There's just nothing quite like it. So the answer is to my knowledge, no, we don't have that kind of evidence that would apply to very low LDLs that are induced by genetic factors. And that's a scenario that I think I clinically struggle with. And I suspect there's going to be at least one other person listening to this that's going to share that struggle, which is, I do get a little bit nervous when I have a patient whose risk of atherosclerosis is so high for example, a patient with significant family history and a very elevated LP little A, just as an example. So you've got, and you know, I seem to collect these patients. So you've got these folks and they've got a clinical burden of disease. So they've, you know, they're CTNG gram shows soft plaque. They're calcium score shows that they've got calcifications. They're LP little A is through the roof. And they're tolerating their statins, meaning they don't have the myalges or CK elevations or any of those things. But to get their LDL where it needs to be in a patient like that, I'm going to put to the fifth or tenth percentile. I have effectively by all means that I can measure almost shut off cholesterol synthesis. In those patients, I panic because of a couple of papers that I've seen that look at the opposite end of the spectrum, which is, you know, they look at markers of cholesterol synthesis and patients who are medicated and then the risk of dementia. And particularly those are paper that looked at the testosterone levels and it found that if the level was below 0.5, which is, you know, generally very low on the scale we look at, and they use that as a cutoff on the receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under that curve, which again can vary from somewhere between about 0.5 to 1, 0.5, meaning it's a useless test. It's a coin toss. One is a perfect test. You know, they're coming in with, with AUCs of the ROC at 0.87, 0.89. That's quite suggestive of this. And certainly biochemically, there's a plausibility to this, right? We understand that every tissue in the body has the ability to borrow cholesterol from elsewhere that doesn't appear to be the case in the brain. Like, the proteins don't seem to, you know, be able to traffic across the blood-brain barrier. So I guess that's just one area where I certainly don't know an answer, but I've become, I think, clinically much more quick to move people to PCSK9 inhibitors when I get uncomfortable with the degree of cholesterol synthesis. Do you think I'm paranoid? You've opened up a big topic all by itself. I think that is the off-target effects of cholesterol. If we consider the target, that's not even the proper term. It's the off-tissue target because it's the tissue targeting of statins to the liver, inhibiting HMG-crabic ductase in the liver that is the therapeutic goal. That's right. That's actually all you're really trying to do. That's right. But we can't. We have to hit all of these peripheral tissues. That's right. So there's something called pharmacokinetic. So to last the 16 or 17 years, I have been leading a program in studying statin pharmacogenetics, which is... I just want to explain this again because I know you and I are sitting here in the social media service, but I want to make sure the listener understands that you just made it so important. In an ideal world, a statin would be a dream drug. If it only inhibited cholesterol synthesis, meaning HMG-crabic ductase activity in the liver, such that the liver would upregulate and you wouldn't impact peripheral tissue metabolism. That cholesterol metabolism, for example, in the brain and the muscles, etc. Unfortunately, that's not the case. So I like you can do this. So this has to do with these my exposure to this set of issues through the world of pharmacology. So I have been hanging out with pharmacologists for the last 15 years through this pharmacogenomics program. It's obvious even without that experience that factors that affect the disposition of statins like any other drug, are important determinants of clinical outcomes. So the disposition that term refers to getting it to the tissue, if any of the tissues, but he wants to get statins of the liver. For the most part, statins are very efficiently removed by the liver. So that tends to offset some of the concerns that you have. However, there is variation in the genes as well as other factors that affect a statin disposition. The nature of the statin itself, it's chemical composition, the presence of absence of certain genetic variants when in particular that's been well-structured, that affects the amount of statin in the blood that prevents it from getting it to the liver. Under those conditions, there is a way to likelihood that the statin will wind up somewhere else. And that can be muscle, which is the most common symptom, but it can be all the other tissues. And part of my research experience right now is delving into all of these other effects that go beyond the desired inhibition of HME-CoA, Dr. Tastin, the liver that are actually quote on target effects. So I'm going to come back to the brain in a minute because I've been extremely interested in the issues that you describe and I'll come back to that. But there's a condition that's even more, I think, clearly connected to an unexpected effective statin. And that is its tendency to increase blood sugar, and increase the risk of diabetes. That's been demonstrated now. What's the relative phrase? It's about, you know, if you talk to cardiologists, I'll say the relative risk is small because the benefit is much greater. Well, that risk is about 10% on average. We have published a paper over a what period of time, over in a duration of the clinical trial. So it's about 6 or 7 years. Yeah, up to 6 or 7 years. But we've published that risk can be a significantly higher in women than men. Perhaps this higher 30% or plus. And so, and do we think that that effect is due to disregulated glucose uptake in the muscle? There is evidence and we're deeply involved with these studies of direct pathologic effects on muscle energy metabolism. That's more closely connected with, obviously, with muscle symptoms than with diabetes, but insulin resistance is a certainly another factor that could be involved and the muscles could be involved. The liver could be involved. So that's one situation where there may be on target effects, even in the liver that might contribute to this. We think it's probably not liver. We think there is probably effects either beta cells and cells that produce insulin and or the tissues that insulin acts on such as such as the cell muscle being an important. Right. So the reason I haven't been more specific, had us, we really don't know. There is a number of theories all of which sort of collectively could be true in different individuals, but the net effect is not trivial. Is it dose dependent? Yes. Well, there are some evidence that are glyceozyclic, e.g. the effect is dose dependent. In fact, this was very limited information on this actually, but there is some evidence that seemed to be, so for example, when you look at Symbestatin, it seems to have a much higher incidence of myalges or CK elevation. When we look at the entire suite of statins, do we see some that seem higher risk for diabetes, some that seem lower risk? Yes. And again, this is sort of a collection of observations from various sources. One of the statins that's most recently been introduced is clinical pitavestatin. Liverlo. Yeah, liverlo. That group in Francis has shown pre-convincingly recently that this is not associated with diabetes risk. This is kind of my go-to statin, but before I move to a PCS K9, if this is my last line statin, it's not that potent, as you know. That's the problem. You sort of, you know, once in a while you'll save someone, you'll get a guy who can't tolerate anything, but he tolerates this and you're off to the race. Same here, exactly. So it's probably, or potency, and it's probably its chemical characteristics. Again, when I'm saying right now, it's still not established in a conclusive way, but it does suggest that there is differences in the statins, and that being one has less association of risk. And the one that's probably most commonly associated with risk, and we've seen this, and studies that we've not yet even published all of them, as a tour of a statin appears to be a higher barrier. I look at it. Yeah, have a higher risk. So there's interest. And we don't think that that's just due to the fact that it's so ubiquitous. No. So would that be a reason, because I got to tell you, I think when I'm confronting a patient for the first time with a statin, I am generally almost tossing a coin between Crestor and Lippator as a first line agent. Very quick to flip between them, if I see, you know, any CK bumper, LFT bump. But what you're saying would almost suggest that if it's a person who's not incredibly insensitive, where none of this probably matters, you know, someone who's borderline, you'd lean towards Crestor over Lippator? Yeah, this is sort of putting on my clinical judgment hat rather than my scientist hat. No, no, but that's, but unfortunately, like for many of us, we still, but we have to make decisions. You like you like to use evidence-based criteria, or this is one of the things that I struggle with with evidence-based criteria. We don't have the evidence that allows me to give an answer to that other than saying, yes, I agree that that's what I would do. And I'm also going to back up a little bit and make sure that I have not conveyed the impression that a terrorist statin is a diabetic drug. It's still a minority of the population and we think that this genetic factor is the contribute to that. And we can measure it. I mean, that's sort of the other thing. I sort of sell patients. This isn't going to sneak up on us one day. We would get with diabetes. I use plenty of a terrorist statin. Yeah. And I have to leave this big concern about it and the patient who's risked Barrett's statin treatment. And because as the cardiologists are quick to point out, the benefits of statin treatment with any of statin's cardiovascular risk and patients with diabetes far outweighs the risk of actually developing diabetes. And there's even some evidence that the microbiomeoscopic complications might be improved. So we can argue that statin is not causing damaging effects through this mechanism. But it does raise just a little bit of a caution. In fact, it's a caution. I think that should lead to more widespread monitoring of glucose on statin. It's just so that when can detect those individuals who may have an adverse effect. But it's still a minority of the population. And it's not something that should be considered a hazard. Yeah. I think for me, I mean, I sort of, you know, talk to patients that say look, I think there are short-term things that we're generally going to figure out in three months, which is myologist plus or minus a CK elevation. So either your muscles are going to get so or with or without an elevation in CK, which is a way that we can measure the breakdown of muscle. And changes in your liver function test. We look for those elevations. I don't know about you, but I see a lot more LFT bumps when combined with Zedia than just statin alone. I find a lot of patients I have the tolerate any dose of a statin than you add a Zedia. It seems to me like 20% of people just immediately have an LFT bump. I have a machine at that often, but I have a machine at that. And then I talk about the long-term stuff, which is actually, I think in many ways, what we should be more concerned with because the short-term stuff, like you figure that out in 10 seconds, right? But it's the, and the diabetes doesn't worry me as much for all the reasons you've stayed, which is it doesn't sneak up on you and you can measure the progress. But for maybe I'm being overly cautious and I've had many in argument with many cardiologists that I share patients with who, you know, we'll have a patient on a maximum dose of a statin. It, I'll give you one example. I've got a patient who came to me on 80 milligrams of lipitore. Still wasn't quite at goal. We added the 10 of Zedia. So then he was at goal and given his burden of disease goal for this guy is about a 700 nanomole per liter of LDLP. But, you know, he had no cholesterol synthesis that we could speak of. So put him on a PCSK9 inhibitor that took his LDL down to like 200 nanomole per liter. So I said, great, let's back off the lipitore and his cardiologist just thought like, this was malpractice. And, you know, it took many a discussion to just even get that back to 40. And my goal is to hopefully get him down to maybe 20 of lipitore so that I can actually see some cholesterol synthesis come back. It's interesting. But again, now we're also a little outside of evidence based medicine. And this is more the art than the science. That's right. And it's a fascinating issue to deal with because we are conducting an experiment in the global populations, certainly in the US, that has never been done before. And that is prescribing statins to millions of people as a lifelong treatment without knowing what the downstream effects are beyond the clinical trial data that we have, which is limited. And we can call in genetics. But it doesn't necessarily mimic the effects of using a statin drug for 40 years. And so I'm just going to say very briefly that I don't want to open the lid on the discussion that many of the naysayers have used to say that statins should be avoided because they can have long-term effects. But I will say, that's like saying driving should be avoided because driving has a negative effect. Right. Right. Right. But there are things that we don't know that certainly I would like to learn and hopefully our own research project will contribute to this as to what may be affecting certain subsets of the population with prolonged use by understanding the mechanisms that might be operating in tissues like the muscle, pancreas, and the brain. And so that bandastanding those mechanisms and perhaps developing markers for people that may have increased likelihood of these undesirable effects that we may be able to guide our treatment more effectively. That's the way the goal of this trauma question. We understand the mechanism of the myaldras. I tend to give patients a ubiquinol. But honestly, the trials are, I and I explain to them, I said, look, I use it as a practice, but I can't point to amazing data. What do we think is going on there? We just talked earlier about the European consensus group that I was on whether it was a second one that I was on and that was statin side effects. And so the first paper in that series came out a year or so ago and that was myopathy. The second paper is I think just out and it describes the data as they were like the diabetes, cognitive function, et cetera. The first paper attempted to address the question you asked among other things and that is what's going on here. And all we have is a diagram that has many points of attack. One of the things that we're actually working on, one of my colleagues in my research program is mitochondrial targeting of strength. There may be on target effects. That is a normal response to statins in some people or maybe in a significant percentage population may affect mitochondrial function in ways that generally are not clinically important, but which in some people could be magnified and lead to changes in muscle function and muscle number, muscle cell number. That's a hypothesis that I'm speaking to now is the lack of a clear single mechanism that we can point to. That's just one of several possibilities. The effects on a coinsam cube, you can all mention, has certainly been out there. But as you say, very high placebo, I find reverse that it's right has not been that successful. One of my patients, I said doctor actually, I'll say this for whatever it's worth. This is one of the sort of clinical pros I have a doctor who was really a very good observer who wound up getting a liquid form of coinsam cube as opposed to a capsule. A capsule that didn't work is muscle symptoms dramatically disappeared or it's improved for the liquid form. Maybe there's issues of absorption or yeah, who knows? Well, I do think there is actually, I mean, we've just empirically used a wheat test co-cute hand levels in the blood and I've noticed for what it's worth that virtually every version doesn't show up. The only one I have found and just to be clear, I don't get paid by this company at all, but there's a brand made by Jero, which I, Jero, I think is probably the best supplement maker. I've seen it. We've had some of their stuff tested, but Jero's ubiquinol is so readily absorbed because the clinical trials call for 600 milligrams. I don't think I have a patient on more than 400. In fact, most people at 200 milligrams of the Jero variant reach systemic levels that are above our onset and target. Again, does that mean anything? I actually have no clue, but for what it's worth, I've noticed that on most other versions and variants of ubiquinol, we just do not measure it in the blood. Yeah, that's really, you don't have that experience, that's very interesting to learn, but again, how that's what it's missing. Yeah, right. The other thing I just mentioned along the lines, again, it deals with diving deeper into the biology of the system. There's about 20 intermediates on the way to ubiquinol. It's just as complicated a pathway as cholesterol synthesis. And so we don't know whether there may be other targets in that pathway, just happens to be the end result. So there's lots to learn about how statins impact biology in ways that could affect health. It's in part because we have such a large population who is doing this experiment basically. And it's also because of the centrality of mechanisms that statins affect. So it's not just cholesterol synthesis. It's precursors of steroid hormones that are in this pathway. And it's these other pathways that can affect intermediates like ubiquinol and other phyndocields. There's lots of other downstream products that are affected by statins that may have biological effects that tell us something about what the drug is doing in the physiological way, but may also have pathologic consequences and some people. What do you make of the evidence for and against the case that, and this is not a common argument, but it is one that shows up enough, which is okay, statins do reduce events, but it's not by lowering LDL. That's an unintended consequence or an intended consequence that is true, and unrelated, but the benefits of statins actually come from the endothelial health and or inflammatory reduction. So this is another deep topic, which is obviously, clinically important to people understand what it is they're treating and why you get back to a couple of issues. One is the causality of LDL, which we discussed a while ago. LDL is causal. That's established beyond doubt. So the benefits of drug induced LDL going, let's say statins, have to be considered as operating in part through that mechanism. Otherwise, let's at least see that in part otherwise you're just ignoring reality. So that's number one. Number two is, is it the most important factor? Is it the only effect in the answer? It's certainly not the only factor. There's no doubt in my mind anyway. I'm not sure how much of this is opinion versus evidence, but well, there's only anti-inflammatory effects and there's a lot of work that the friend Paul Wickler has been involved with to help establish partners at NIH. No, he's at the, or he's a break of Zbriggum. Yeah. Yeah. Early in establishing the importance of C. We act of protein as a marker for inflammatory risk not just to practice these, but and we should detour on that topic, because it's so important. Right. There was a recent trial that looked at Lodo, said, meth, a trex eight. Which is an ant, no, it was an Iol. It was an interlucant one. Well, weren't there too? There was the Iol. It was a trex eight isn't out yet. Oh, okay. Maybe I just see other one. Okay. Okay. The other one's out. Yeah. These, and in Lodkin was a one or six. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One. And so that was a very interesting trial. I was a true. Because that, yeah, that was okay. That's right. So that was a trial that said, look, we can make no change to the lipoprotein. We reduce inflammation in a subset of patients. These patients had to have an elevated C reactive protein of a recall and you reduced events. Yeah. And we may see the same thing with this methotryx eight study. And I think that speaks to you. We're not. Yeah. Yeah. Either way, it's an important finding. Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, with the reason I asked the question, among others is, can you make the sentence? Right. Yeah. Okay. Because then you can say, well, what does statins do to this pathway? Well, they do lower inflammatory signaling down this same pathway. And again, risk error was a pioneer in studies such as the Jupiter trial in earlier ones as well that were analyzed, the predicted benefit or the associated benefit of the LDL lowering against CRP lowering some microprinflamation. So this goes back to using CRP as a marker for inflammation. And achieving a lower level of CRP and a higher level of LDL was associated with benefit, achieving a lower level of LDL with a higher CRP was benefit. So they both contributed to risk and so targeting both LDL to less than 70. I think it was and CRP less than 2,000,000,000,000,000 for deciliter. I think, but targeting those two risk markers together gave the greatest benefit to each contributed. And I think that model stands up pretty well. That it is a double whammy and one of the reasons stands are so effective. It's probably because of their unique ability to hit inflammation as well as as LDL metabolism and get spected PCS keynotes. Doesn't quite have that's an intro. That's exactly where I was going to go, which is I've got a number of patients that are coming to me saying, look Peter, I don't care about the cost of the PCS K9 inhibitor. Get me off this stat and I just want to be on a PCS K9 inhibitor to which I say the only issue I take with that is and I don't have a problem doing it in the patient who is completely statin intolerant. I have a couple of these patients where they absolutely need to be on lipid lowering therapy and they absolutely can't even tolerate you know, live alone. So we know there we just do what we have to do. But the trials don't actually tell us how well PCS K9 inhibitors work in isolation relative to non-treatment. So that's just sort of the evidence based reason for hey it would be ideal if we could at least keep you on some modest amount of a statin. And then secondly there's it's not clear the PCS K9 inhibitor attacks that other mechanism mechanistic aspect is and it's not just inflammation down the trilucon CRP pathway. It's also there's nitric oxide synthesis of the tetrachyric oxide being a basic dilator. So I think there is a good mechanistic case as well as the clinical evidence case for not abandings that if a PCS K9, unless of course the patient is statin intolerant. Where do you think the effect so one of the things I sort of try to divide this is men, women, primary, secondary prevention. That's a nice two by two square. I don't think there's any I mean again I'm not talking about the bloggesteria Twitter but like if you actually look at evidence is there any dispute in the efficacy of statins in secondary prevention for men or women? No. So those are not disputes. So we won't even need to talk about that. Let's talk about primary prevention. The variability in clinical trials when you look at primary prevention especially in women but I think for men to some extent as well. Both in the NNT so that means the number needed to treat so and you know the NNT of course being the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. So an NNT of a hundred means you have a 1% risk reduction you need to treat a hundred people to prevent an event. You know when you look at the summary data on this it's amazing how all over the map it is. So how would you rate the strength of the evidence? Just just a quick question for all of us. I'll just give you 30 seconds to answer this. Now the strength of the evidence in primary prevention for statins in either men or women. Okay well let me start with women and let me also specify that you need to think about a cardiovascular events and then mortality from cardiovascular events. Right so we'll talk about major adverse cardiac events so myocardial infarction stroke versus death. So the evidence again importantly from the Jupiter trial which has had a very large enrollment of women but collectively another trial as well for the benefit of statins for high risk primary prevention in women and the high risk caveat is really important here because it really speaks to this very fine radiation between high risk primary prevention and secondary prevention because if you're at high enough risk and haven't had a heart attack you may be five seconds away from the heart attack so yeah we may have had a silent MI that was already right so that distinction could be a little bit fuzzy but technically at least the evidence is there for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in women it's not it's not really there at least to my reading and I maybe wrong about this because I haven't gone back and double check but I haven't seen evidence for benefit on mortality for primary prevention in the women women yeah and in men it's kind of weakest for mortality but it's certainly present for events. And is it also possible that you know one of the things I try to explain to if I'm giving a lecture or something to students is you look at a paper and you see no statistical benefit the first question you must ask yourself was was this study powered adequately to detect a difference and it's very often the case that there could have been an effect but we didn't you know it was too small to see with the number of subjects I feel like in some of the primary prevention trials duration might be the bigger issue it's if you're only looking at seven years which is probably the outer limits of where these trials look it might simply be that when you're talking about a one percent absolute risk reduction over seven years it's not really that interesting of course a one percent risk reduction over seven years over 30 years is an enormous difference Alan Snyderman is actually working on a paper now that looks at 30 year risk because of course all the risk calculators are based on 10 year risk which I think has value but also has great limitation and I guess I think that's part of what I struggle with this clinically which is you know we never want to expose a patient to something unnecessarily and there's no substance you're going to put in your body whether it's you know vitamin C versus a stat and that comes with zero risk so how do you weigh that benefit you know this really speaks to need for much better markers that could help us predict benefit versus adverse effects so that we can identify not just the the high risk candidate for statins based on conventional markers but individuals in whom we have evidence for mechanisms that would be benefited by stat and treatment that would argue strongly for benefit and on the other side markers ideally they could assess risk radvers effects not just symptoms but underlying pathology for example and again without I because I want to come back briefly to your question about kind of defunction because I I sort of escaped talking about that because I feel this is because you forgot because you're cognitive functional no it's an effect that he's like he's like the opposite I fit it in a part of my brain that has made me not forget that there can be effects that are our long term that we simply can't assess easily and so one of them could be kind of a function but having said that there's no evidence in an arts consensus paper that just came out and sat in in time it's no evidence really well the population level I would say it's the opposite at the population level I think we see that the risk if anything goes down a little bit yeah and there's a cardiovascular that's exactly right and the cardiovascular element that even contributes to to classical Alzheimer's disease but again the data are really not compelling this is the challenge this is personalized medicine means at the end I don't care about the population I care about the one person sitting in front of me at this moment when we have to make a decision exactly exactly but what's intriguing and what you what's your question open up and that be careful because I don't want to go down the rabbit hole on this one to be sent to statin this influence mechanisms that interact with cholesterol transported the brain and apo protein eat which we mentioned is a variant that causes tights of rehab of the BDMA apo protein ease is a key protein that has a variant another variant that increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease but we're looking at ways of cholesterol metabolism intersects with that pathway and and conceivably that's just one example of a gene that could interact with statin and if the statin or getting past the blood brain barrier in some cases an inflammation might be a factor that could be exposed to that you could start to have imagine effects that could go either way but but perhaps potentially this function that's just a completely off the you know out of left no no look I mean that's exactly I mean that's that's sort of the hand waving that I use right so when I have patients that have one or two copies of an apo e4 gene I am that much more careful with them with statin use and until proven otherwise yeah yeah and we don't know and we don't know you know I mean I actually there's a there's a wonderful group of apo e4 carriers that has formed a sort of a support very large that I've interacted with they came to my lab there's about 30 members of the groups that came and we I gave a talk about apo protein and nutrition actually I had to sort of be careful because these people were just anxious for advice but we do it we've got this apo e4 variant what do I do with my diet and that's all you know we've done a lot of studies along these lines but we don't know what the effect and disease and yeah disease risk but there's one other cumulative fact that I'm going to mention without again turning the tables on the value of statins and that is getting back to muscle effect because if there is a adverse effect on matter how drill function which we can we can show that in others have shown that and if they're individuals who for one region or another are at risk for muscle wasting sorry it's called the sarcopyr pines muscle wasting conceivably that on target effective statin is the extent that it is an effective muscle tissue could over decades conceivably impact the rate at which this muscle wasting could occur and so there may be a time this is just I'm telling this out that the probably we're near the end of this discussion as a kind of just a thought is it may argue for after a certain age not worrying so much about high dose statin treatment unless the patient is really high risk and because the one may be adding and the elderly individuals and exposure yeah you're creating a new risk in the presence of another risk reduction and it's the experiment that we probably were never going to be able to do and so in just has to sort of be cognizant I've had patients and again I actually take care of a number of physicians actually my clinical work who asked me I've reached age of 75 or 80 and you know done well if you know it's family history meant to me find out and it's a difficult question to answer because because we don't have the evidence base behind age 75 that was really where the cholesterol guidelines that came out a few years ago stop because that's where the evidence stopped yeah we do have benefit and older individuals who are at high risk but we don't know what the trade office in terms of adverse effects that people that don't really need to be taking it any longer now you were involved in one of the ATP guidelines correct yeah well I was on the ATP for on the last panel that handed it off to the American Heart Association Merck College Cardiac I was connected with it when it was part of the NIH that you took issue with something didn't you well there were some concerns that I and others had regarding the scope of the effort originally and this is now personal experience with it when I was brought on I was expecting and we originally talked about having a wide range of topics to discuss not just LDL lowering but how we manage triglystriides who role of HDL emerging risk factors help you the lay we had probably 15 or 16 high priority questions and I was intending to be involved heavily on the discussion of some of these other risk factors I thought the LDL story was obviously important and when had to address should we update the guidelines that's what it was really designed to be and to turn out in the end that because of various changes in support of the whole program the number of questions was reduced down to just three and they all had to do with LDL lowering and the evidence for it and it was very heavily dependent on trials that were available to provide evidence-based conclusions so that means that the effort was really limited to a very strict interpretation of evidence-based guidelines and that led to an abandoning of the LDL targeting that we had the LDL levels that had been used to guide management of risk were abandoned because there was no study that actually addressed specifically that question that is does reaching a certain target reduce risk and I personally got rather discouraged at the limitation that we were under eventually it's sort of got a little bit softened actually after I left the committee I think there was a little bit more tolerance of potential role but basically by being that narrow we not only lost a lot of important questions and lipid management to just murder and address try to decide you know it's a letter to write where I met a box in room wasn't really touched down at all so it was it was disappointing to me and I'd help you little and I thought my LPA right and so I thought my role in the LDL lowering side was sort of limited I'd actually been involved with being consultants and companies that made the other way drugs I had to actually excuse myself from even the decision process so it was really a point where I just wasn't able to contribute the way I thought I could so I decided to step off. I could continue this discussion probably for six more hours but there is one other thing I want to go back to that we did talk about and I think it's the NIS in question. I think you're forgetting that. No I sure have not. So what is NIS in due right so first of all I don't think anybody actually really understands the mechanism by which NIS and lower ZAPOB do I mean is that is that generally yeah that's right I would say that's a fear statement but but NIS and as a drug that lowers LDL particle cholesterol it also raises HDL cholesterol quite significantly in fact I've seen it raised HDL cholesterol more than I've seen anything in those seat-teppenhibitors so it seems like the dream drug it's doing everything right now it does also create some insulin resistance and it seems to do that at a higher level than even statins do but do you think that that's the explanation for why the hardout come data aren't there and why NIS and has fallen so far out of favor that you know I actually called in NIS and for a patient about a year ago it was we're kind of doing an experiment he couldn't tolerate a statin couldn't afford a PCS canine inhibitor you know we were really reaching for straws and we couldn't even get NIS informed I mean we literally couldn't even get his insurance company to pay for NIS and so it is persona non-gradah. Help me understand that okay so my disclosure is I still use a lot of NIS so why do I do that in the light of this trial so let me just back up then and say that the trials the high profile trials that led to the dismissal of NIS and it's a therapeutic option when was a aim high and the other was it was in the previous PS2 both involved the following criterion and that is NIS and was tested as an HDL raising agent in the setting of LDL being at a low level as a result of intensive statin plus or minus set yeah to bring LDL cholesterol levels to a low enough level that would be considered a non factor that is that the NIS and effect of the LDL would be minimized whereas the HDL is how do we assess the level of NIS and exclusively on its HDL raising properties because we've maximized LDL lower that's right so it would they were designed to test whether the HDL increase with NIS and it's beneficial and the answer is from those trials I say unequivocally no that is the HDL raising effective NIS and is not protective that that's the conclusion to take away that in my view was beating uh it may not have dead horse but a pretty sick one because I never really was totally convinced that that raising HDL itself would be with beneficially even though I was part of the really a study that showed that if you genetically feed mice with uh it can be a gene that raises HDL you can reduce the outdoor scrosis I mean there is a protective effect but I was of the opinion that the association of HDL cholesterol across the population with risk fell into the same category as the LDL small LDL store in the transverse rates part of a interrelated metabolic syndrome and I felt that the most important pathologic features of that syndrome are not low HDL but the high levels of small LDL and track list rights and both of those components have been not just the LDL but the track list are I related risk have been pretty clearly shown to be causal and the HDL was a marker for that that that was actually my my guess just based on my behavior and there could be another issue here right which is to raise I mean there are there are known you know HDL like the protein EMEAS were very high HDL is actually athrogenic because they're so dysfunctional they can't actually deal epidains right exactly so the simple-minded idea that raising HDL by any means would be beneficial just like lowering LDL by any means would be beneficial was this proven by those studies plus all of the C-tep inhibitors that's right none of the C-tep inhibitors right and so there is something fundamentally pathologic about that effect on HDL that overrides any potential benefit that maybe due to other factors and in the case of the two major nius and trials you know there was some learning of LDL but as you point at the HDL increase was fairly substantial and and those particles are basically hung up in plasma it gets back a little bit to this resonance time issue that I was talking about regarding LDL well here's a situation for HDL well these particles are just it's sort of like the the toilet is plugged yeah you prevent them from doing their job right so you're not delivering cholesterol efficiently back to the liver for excretion and those particles are hanging around long enough that who knows what properties and may be acquiring that might possibly override some of the benefits of the LDL only effect so does that mean that nice and has has no benefit well there was a study that preceded those two studies that was carried out by Greg Brown actually was one that led to the impi study being funded by the NIH and that was called HTO HTH was grossed HTO HTH was grossed is treatments that HATS and that was almost as good as Mr. Fit which I realized now is the one I was forgetting oh that for the LRC that there's a multi-factor risk yeah yeah yeah yeah so going back to hats right so HTH was a statin plus nius and and there was other combination of pro-triach included nius and and that study showed benefit two levels one was the intended and point was quantitative and geographic progression measuring the narrowing of the coordinate vessels which is now not used we now realize that's not particularly right it happened to be correlate with the yeah point and in fact in that study even though it was initially underpowered to detect the benefit on endpoints it did that intervention did reduce risk of events it was a successful trial we analyzed data from that study using four different methods to look at live reporting particles as a part of this was to see whether we could learn something more than was in the standard lipid measurements would tell us and what it did tell us is that the small and very small LDO lowering cheap by nius and which it does do was associated with theascular benefit and that's study whereas HTO it to the extent of nothing else was explanatory and that was independent of all the standard lipids so we have this in the literature from just one study and I wish we would have access to other types of data that could support this but it spoke to a therapeutic effective nius and that would be lost in these larger trials because the statin hammer had lowered the LDO low enough so that additional benefit is probably just too small the tender power lost in the noise so the failure of those trials speak to the success of statins and the failure of HTO raising those are those are the two things take away so then but nius and I think in the patients which are small LDO particles I still use it and I like to see well that's not what I want to ask you let's talk me through the perfect nius in patient well perfect patient with nius and is actually twofold and we weren't going to talk about LPA but you did bring it up earlier and I'm sorry and so it's a it's a it's a genetic factor that is sort of the wildcard in an ethroscrosis it's certainly damaging and we like to lower it so nius and can lower LPA the lay by up to 25% or so and there is not conclusive but to me clinically impressive evidence that if you have a combination of high LPA and small LDO you're just a time bomb from Athroscrosis so if you have high levels of you know high particle number of the small LDO type plus LPA the lay elevations and there's there's always a strong family history of heart disease and the patients are going to be at high risk at a young age because nius and lorys LPA and because nius and lorys the small LDO particles so nius and you think specifically targets smaller particles over larger particles you know preferentially sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah lower that pathway it's not clear whether just that's the VLDL pathway or not I honestly we don't know get back to your earlier statement that we don't know the mechanism really as well we just don't know the mechanism but in that combination that that really is the patient that and I've got patients like that who have and you put that patient on that over a PCS can I name him or if they could afford it well there's another because you're going to get a 30% reduction on LPA that's right the PCS can't be right there's another that's right this another angle this PCS can I has a similar LPA lowering effect plus it has a gangbusters bigger effect than an LDL particle LDL levels so no I wouldn't use it over PCS can I and the argument there is largely financial yes and when insurance will cover you can buy nius and that the local you know shop off the shelf you know along with acting nius and you know safe both of you say it for him for pennies you know you're going to pay an air nire 14 thousand dollars for PCS I've had patients like you who have been willing to do that who have been willing to sort of over pay out a pocket and that is the same category of patient and I probably would consider that even more effective although one other thing little tweak here and that is that both statins and PCS can inhibitors because they work as you said by up regulating LDL receptors as in the case of PCS can end that's the exclusive one for the sense it's part of the mechanism that effect primarily lowers medium and larger size LDL particles and has a less of a therapeutic effect than smaller particles and and none and the very small LDL so there's a great nation of effect which relates to the structure of the LDL mean more or less capable of interacting with LDL receptors and the larger particles interact well and so up regulating LDL. And this explains why we sometimes see a widening of the discordance. It's right in the statinized patient because they're lowering lowering LDL c more than LDL p because you're selecting out the larger more cholesterol than yeah. That's right and so that applies to any mechanism that operates to LDL receptors which is what most of the drugs do even is that am I so what does that mean for nice it will nice and lowers the small and very small LDL very nicely so there's a complementarity there to statinize and I think that's part of what attracts me to using it again I don't use nowadays because of potency of the statinized ability to get LDL on a target and such I have proportion of patients the availability of PCS can I I'd have to say there's fewer patients than I'm starting on nice and but there's still candidates out there that I think would benefit from this come this hitting small LDL hitting L p the way he's the complement the benefits of statins. The only patient I put on nice and in the last four years is a really interesting case he's a guy with he doesn't have FH but he's clearly got some SNPs of FH because his LDL is incredibly high but normal synthesis normal triglycerides and normal absorption markers so you know his sterles are normal this is this is clearance problem unable to tolerate a single statin including one milligram of levelo so we went to Repaatha and there is no effect and we switched to Prowlulant no effect so he's missing this anepotope that I would like the DNA from that patient because I would be happy to introduce you to an anepotope that might explain that actually okay yeah so you use nice and yeah I mean it's it's like basically going to be what nice and anephoresis I mean it's this is really tough case yeah well again I mean you know I think it's legitimate to say that there's probably less if you were a candidate in the with the availability of this potential for using PCS canine certainly with in combination with statins but I would say the patients with moderate the elevated triglycerides in the 150 to yeah you give them a little phenophibrate yes I do actually despite that's another subset question that is a subset of patients who made benefit based on subset analysis subgroup analysis of clinical trials but unfortunately it's just not a very potent yeah but niacin I will use as an alternative approach to lowering the triglycerides and doing this model deal that's that's elegant that's something I mean if just on a personal level that's certainly an amazing an insightful pearl that I've gathered from our discussion today I appreciate you seeing that well and and with that Ron I want to say you know first of all just I consider you a great friend and an unbelievable mentor I feel so fortunate to have benefited from your knowledge and and and peers of yours over the last decade and your generosity is is unparalleled in terms of anytime I can pick up the phone and call you and run a tough case by you you're you're always there to do so so I greatly appreciate that I also think we need to do this again sometime because I literally have twice as many questions as we've got to I wanted to get into saturated fat fructose apoe there's all these other things that I know you are just an expert on that I know people are going to want to hear about so I'm going to have to come back to San Francisco and we'll have to continue this discussion hopefully during the Warriors off season have to do that Peter and thank you for your kind words and it's been a pleasure talking with you I I think the opportunity to help people understand some of these topics issues to something you've been very good at and I've been glad to be able to compete with you thank you so much Ron okay you can find all of this information and more at Peter at tmd.com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerds of barri at peteratiamd.com what's a nerds of barri you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjectively non-lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science, performance, sleep, et cetera on social you can find me on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook all with the ID, peteratiamd but usually Twitter is the best way to reach me to share your questions and comments now for the obligatory disclaimer this podcast is for general informational purposes only does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services including the giving of medical advice and note no doctor patient relationship is for him the use of this information and the materials link to the podcast is at the user's own risk the content of this podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice diagnoses or treat users should not disregard or delay in obtaining medical advice for any medical condition they have and should seek the assistance of their health care professionals for any such conditions lastly and perhaps most importantly I take conflicts of interest very seriously for all of my disclosures the companies I invest in and or advise please visit peteratiamd.com forward slash bount shape

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world. And this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. On this episode, I interview my good friend Dominic Dagestino. Dom, as he is known by his a professor at the University of South Florida, his PhD is in neuroscience and that's where he got his background. But Dom is probably most recognizable to people listening to this because he is certainly one of the experts on ketosis. And that's in all variants of it. So starvation ketosis, nutritional ketosis, and in particular the use of exogenous ketones. Gosh, Dom and I go way back, we met probably a little over five years ago and instantly formed a friendship around our obsessive end of one experiments. Although I will say he is closer to winning a Darwin award on the basis of his and of ones than I am. Couple notes about this podcast first. This is highly technical at times. And in fact, we'll timestamp it in the show notes, but I would say roughly the first hour is even a little more technical than I had intended to go. I think part of the issue is just once I get talking with Dom about this stuff. I couldn't stop asking him questions. And I think there were times when I guess we forgot we were recording a podcast and it was just us getting really technical. I don't think it's too technical to follow if you have some background understanding about chemistry, but we'll do our best in these show notes to make sure that we're given even the recreational user necessary tools to follow this. Now that said, if you get 20 minutes into this thing and you're like, I don't understand what the hell these guys are talking about, do not hesitate to skip ahead. There's a lot of stuff that gets later on into the podcast and this is a long podcast. It's nearly three hours. There's a lot of stuff we get into at the end that I think will be kind of the stuff people really want to know even if they don't want to get in the gory details. So in particular, we talk very specifically about all of the key tones. And I'm getting a lot of questions about Peter. What's the difference between a key tone Esther, a key tone salt, one of the monowesters, one of the die esters, where does MCT fit into this? What about the Caprylic acid? And how many should we be using this one versus this one? And what are the advantages and advantages? This is going to be your dissertation level course in that subject matter. The other thing that we get into at the very end and we almost end on this, but again, look to the timestamps for exactly where it is is we get into what I consider one of the most interesting discussions I've ever had on what I sort of loosely describe as a metabolic oncologist playbook. So when I asked Dom about this, he had just some of the most interesting insights and I was really impressed by the breadth and the organization of his thinking around this. Now, I want to point out something here and I say it in the show, but it's really important for me to caveat this here. This cannot be construed as medical advice. Dom is not a medical doctor. He doesn't pretend to be one on TV. He is a research scientist who focuses on basic and translational research. He collaborates with lots of physicians. He is involved in a number of clinical trials. But ultimately, Dom is not offering medical advice and frankly, nor is anybody or nor should anybody be on a podcast. So this information I asked because I get asked this stuff a lot and frankly, I don't know enough about this sort of outreaching and outlying metabolic therapies out there. But I hope that if people are listening to this and they're afflicted by cancer, which statistically speaking is obviously going to happen, given that one and six people are going to get cancer in their lifetime, I hope that if some of this stuff does scratch someone's sort of desired to understand more that they can use some of the resources we're going to link to to potentially identify the right places where either clinical trial will be taking place or they could at least pursue some of these things under the appropriate medical guidance. I could go on and on about other nits and nats in here. But honestly, I think the best thing to do right now is probably pay a little bit of attention maybe more than usual to the show notes. Treat this as a little bit like a buffet. Go to the places you want to go to. Of course, I would recommend the entire thing if you really have an interest in this subject matter. And I hope that this podcast is going to answer many of the questions that I see people asking out there. I actually learned quite a bit on this and I tend to know this subject matter reasonably well. So without any further delay, welcome to the podcast with Dominic DeGasino. Hey, Dom. Hey, Pete. How are you, man? I'm doing well. How are you? I'm doing really well and I'm really grateful for you making the trip all the way up here, I know that in part you're visiting family, but it's great that you've carved out time to come from New Jersey all the way up to the lovely city of Manhattan. I appreciate the envoy and love being here. Love this, isn't it? Well, there's going to be a number of people listening to this today who are already incredibly familiar with who you are, the work you've done. I certainly consider you probably one of the two most authoritative persons on the subject we're going to get into today. But for anybody who's listening to this, who is not entirely familiar with you, I suspect by the end of today, they're going to want to get a lot more familiar with you. So I actually remember the day we met and it's kind of funny. I was in Florida giving that talk at IHMC and I knew of you by name, but I didn't know who you were or what you looked like. So I wouldn't have recognized you when I gave a talk. This would have been 2011 maybe, maybe 2012. And at the end of the talk, there was like a Q&A. And it was a long Q&A and it just went on and on and on. And then you asked a question, now, I wish I could say I remember the question, but I knew from the question that that guy knows what he's talking about and then of course can Ford who knew us both had basically arranged for us to all have dinner that night. And so that was the night we met. And it was really at least from my standpoint not to embarrass you. It was like a love at first sight. Like I was like, I was just so giddy to be able to sit there and have dinner with you. Same here. Yeah, I knew who you were and I was looking for that talk and I made the drive up there. And I felt like we were connected before we even connected, you know, or definitely on the same wavelength on the stuff. Yeah, you've got such an interesting history that we're going to get into about how you got interested in this space. But also I think one of the things that many people might not appreciate fully that I appreciate it just because of the, you know, the convenience and luxury of how we met was just your interest in self experimentation as well. Sometimes when you're studying something or interested in something that is not entirely mainstream yet, you have to bootstrap it and you have to look at like limited amounts of animal data, limited amounts of in vitro data and then sometimes combine it with insights that you get through early experimentation on, you know, yourself. Absolutely. So I am Earth myself and what I'm doing. I think that's sort of what that's how we learn. Yeah, that's really that's the best way to learn. So you did your PhD in neuroscience, correct? Yeah. What is the biology? 10 physiologists. So you're finishing your PhD and you're planning to do a postdoc? Yeah, I did it in the neural control of autonomic regulation. So the brain stem mechanisms sort of sense O2, oxygen and CO2 and modulate respiratory rhythm generation and also cardiovascular sympathetic tone to the heart like those neurons and how they sense oxygen. During my PhD, I got interested in diving physiology and it was amazing to me that we don't really understand how our brains and our physiology functions in extreme environments as it pertains to elevated hyperbolic pressure, elevated oxygen, CO2, anesthetic gases, for example. We know the anesthetic potency of a gas is proportional to its lipid solubility but we don't really know what that means. Like why what's happening at the level of the membrane or the mitochondria. So my postdoctoral fellowship was actually developing technologies to study that and that would be hyperbaryctomic force microscopy and that was like that's what I just delved into for how does that work? So I know what hyperbaryct means, you know what my microscopy means. Tell me about the part about the force. The first term for atomic force microscopy was scanning probe microscopy and instead of using light or electrons it uses a very sharp tip probe that can be so sharp it's monotomic and it essentially raster scans across the sample and can detect very subtle changes in the topography of the sample that you're scanning. So it actually spawned the whole nanotechnology world. This particular instrument was used to characterize materials and really help develop silicon valley in many ways. It's a microscope that we took basically an off-the-shelf atomic force microscope that gives you the scanning resolution of an electron microscope but also has a capacity to image living cells. And took this technology and put it inside an environmental chamber, a hyperbaryct chamber. And part of my project was doing the electrical, the fluid and the gas penetrations to make the thing functional and also doing a series of studies and calibration tests to determine that we could reliably make hyperbaryctomic force microscopy measurements inside this chamber and with this technology it gives us insight at the nanoscopic level of what's happening to the mitochondria to the cell membrane. So I got a grant through the Department of Defense which they give these equipment grants to develop this technology and also grant to use it and then later another grant to put a confocal microscope. You might have heard up a laser scanning. I actually used a confocal microscope in my undergrad thesis to the computational optical sectioning of terms. I know because I was an engineer so I was interested in a question of did the direction of extrusion that you put on a tibial plateau. So when you do joint replacements does the direction in which you extrude what's called ultra-hymolecular weight polyethylene does that predict its fracture and it turned out it did. But the tool to help us measure that was this confocal microscope. So that was my introduction to high end microscopy. It's an amazing tool. Yeah. So the second. Yeah. You got it. Through the toys that we have in the lab. So that was the next phase of sort of my experiments was installing a laser scanning confocal. So we could optically section individual cells and look at the mitochondria inside the cells under graded levels of oxygen and hyperbaric pressure, essentially. Pressure of an inner gas like helium, nitrogen. So to simulate, for example, a Navy seal dive or a deep sea dive. In the context of developing this technology and imaging a wide variety of cells from primary neurons to the leoblastoma cells to human-dermal fiber blasts, smooth muscle cells, I noticed that cancer cells would produce proportionally more superoxide anion, which is the precursor oxygen free radical that comes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a consequence of normal metabolism. The cancer cells look to have what appeared to be their chock full of mitochondria and they were moving around very dynamic structures. And under normal levels of oxygen, they kind of produced a normal level of superoxide anion or oxygen free radicals. But when we hit the cancer cells with hyperbaric oxygen, the superoxide production went off the charts. And it was very apparent to me that they were producing excess free radicals and as we made measurements over time, it was very apparent that it was accelerating membrane lipid proxidation, which we use a variety of tests. One is a T-Mars test where we look at malady aldehyde production. And the technology, the atomic force microscopy, allows us to look at very subtle changes of the surface of the membrane. You measure the perturbations on the surface of the membrane and nanoscopic changes. We look at membrane roughness and you could look at the roughness of the membrane and calculate that. And that can correlate to membrane lipid proxidation. And it correlates the numbers correlate well. So what you're looking at is the physical correlate of membrane lipid proxidation when you capture that data with atomic force microscopy. Is that clear? Yeah, let me back up and make sure I can disagree with this in this step. So the first thing that you notice is lots of mitochondria in cancer cells. And shockful. And these are what types of cancer lines. The main one that I was working with that I ended up publishing the paper in neuroscience with was U-87, Gleoblastoma cells. And they were taken out of a 44-year-old patient. So humans are what we're doing. Human cell line. Yeah. A lot of people use it. You know, these are astrocytes. Right? These are not neurons. Yeah, of a Gleal origin. Yes, yes. So observation one, lots of mitochondria. Okay, good to know. Because obviously there's a understanding that more bird pointed out that says, hey, like, you know, these things largely are anaerobic, not a robex. So they shouldn't really need much mitochondria. Yeah. And then what you're saying is you put them into a hyperbaric environment. And how hyperbaric? How many times atmospheric pressure would you need? I saw the observation. So normal oxygen is 0.2 ATA. We say atmospheric absolute. And that saw a big jump up in super oxide anion production at 0.95. So that's almost five times atmospheric pressure. That's almost five times. Yeah. And actually 0.95. If you're breathing produces a P02 in the brain, if similar to breathing 2.5 atmospheres of oxygen. And then I actually went up to the experiment with 3.25 atmospheres of oxygen. And then that basically was cooking the cells from the inside out. The mitochondria were producing so much oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species. So superoxin anion can go to hydroxyl radical through the fenten reaction, the hydrogen peroxide. And that can be driven in different ways. And I basically saw the mitochondria exploding under hyperbaric oxygen conditions. And I never see that. Do you have a control in this of non-cancerous glial cells that are not doing the same thing? Most of my experiments prior to this with smooth muscle cells. I was looking at in primary cortical neurons, primary hippocampal neurons. At the time, I was just basically looking at, I was doing these experiments to validate the tool that we had just built. So no one actually had imaged living cells under hyperbaric conditions because no one had a hyperbaric microscope before. So I didn't actually know what I was even looking at. I was not a cancer biologist. I knew that cancer cells were rapidly proliferating so they probably had amped up metabolism. But it was just a very interesting observation to me. It was very interesting that they were also dying. And I figured cancer cells should be hearty. And you should be able to throw everything but the kitchen sink it them and they should live. And then when I saw them basically the mitochondria exploding and the membrane starting to become permeable and necrotic cell death, I became more and more interested in that. And we ended up publishing the observation. But I didn't actually know what it meant. Like I published it more like here I built this cool tool and we did this experiment. And I was actually just looking at the cell line as a model system to study reactive oxygen species and oxygen toxicity seizures because part of the military was funding me to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxygen toxicity seizures. And it's thought that high levels of oxygen creates oxidative stress. And that perturbs the brain in a way that causes these grand maltonic clonic seizures. And we're developing tools. You can't understand it unless you know fundamentally what's happening at the level of the cell and the mitochondria. So I want to come back to that because that now makes sense for why diving could increase that risk because if you're using an oxygen rebrother, you're getting a higher concentration of oxygen and then you're under multiple atmospheres of pressure. You know basically replicated in a person what you were seeing a cell. But going back to the cell thing for a sec, do the free radicals that get generated destroy other cells beyond the cell that is generating the free radical or is the problem largely contained to the cell? It's a dose dependent phenomenon. And we were studying cells in this particular experiment in a petri dish or on a cover slip. So yeah, it's sort of like an intact neural network or cellular network. So the cells are literally connected to one another. Unlike a tissue slice where you have an intact cytoarchitecture, which that's a little bit different. But the oxygen free radicals and the substances that the cells produce do actually influence other cells adjacent to it or juxtapose to it. That's obvious from some of the experiments we do in cell signaling. You know, if one cell becomes permeable and we could detect cell death with various molecules, like a thinium home and dimer one, when that cell dies, it can stimulate exitotoxic events in surrounding cells. Same thing happens with the cancer cells. It's obvious that cancer cells use reactive oxygen species for growth and proliferation. And I know this is something that maybe contradicting to many people. We view free radicals is something that's damaging that the cell needs to get rid of. But they're very powerful signaling molecules, especially for cancer cells and growth and proliferation and in normal tissues. Can you mean nuclear signaling? In nuclear signaling and activation of transcription factors. Basically, there are many ice study as neuroscientists. Ice study re-doc sensitive ion channels. So the re-docs state of an ion channel can dictate the permeability and the gating functions of that ion channel, which is intimately linked to cellular excitability by influencing the resting membrane potential. So as a neuroscientist, you can study a very particular and cells have hundreds of thousands of ion channels, specific ion channels that are redox regulated. But what was obvious is that cancer cells have elevated rates of reactive oxygen species that they use for growth and proliferation. It also fuels metastasis and invasive nissic cancer cells. And because they overproduce oxygen free radicals in the context of high oxygen, you can push the cells above their antioxidant potential and then trigger a popthosis. So it's like a double-edged. So it's basically a U-shaped curve or inverted depending on how you want to think about it where the cancer cell is not only optimized as a survivor, it's optimized to thrive at a certain level of elevated react levels. It's elevated level. But if you go too far, it becomes counter. Yeah, so they have elevated endogenous antioxidant capacity, right? But because their mitochondria are defective in many ways and that term is kind of controversial. Some people think the warburg effect definitely endows a cell's many benefits. But the aberrant activity of the mitochondria is creating this excess free radicals. And hyperbaric oxygen and chemotherapy, therapeutic drugs, the augment oxidative stress, our therapeutic modalities that can be used. It was very apparent to me seeing that in a hyperbaric chamber looking at a microscope, looking at these cells and no one had seen it before because no one had hyperbaric. My heart is too old. Yeah. And that kind of, at the same time, I was growing these cells under different conditions. I was very interested in lactate. And I became interested in ketones too, just not for this reason. I was not yet interested in the ketogenic diet. I was looking at it for a different reason, actually. But I noticed that the cancer cells were not growing as rapidly as they should in the context of one to end five millimeter of beta hydroxybuter eight, which I was growing in them in. And I thought the lab tech may have been doing something that was influencing, but she assured me. It wasn't. So we would pull the media off and put regular media on without the ketones and the cancer cells would start growing rapid. Why were you using ketones in the media? Well, I was looking at a variety of different substrates back in 2008 and nine. I see. So you were just a co-sciety glucose, B-h-b. Yeah, two deoxy glucose. Yeah, lactate. I was using a variety of different and ketones were like, well, let's just see what ketones do. You know, that ketones were something that the body would produce in fasting. But I didn't, I didn't even know the anti-seizure properties of the ketogenic diet. I was just sort of it is like, what do you bring in? In a couple odd papers, I came out like ketones could be used as fuel. I was very interested in alpha-l polylactate, various forms of lactate that could be used to preserve brain energy metabolism in the face of oxidative stress. And the ketones just, they sort of shine. So basically what they were able to do was allow the neurons to preserve their membrane potential and normal cellular function even in the context of extreme oxidative stress. And it made sense, right? Because the ketogenic diet, you know, I started looking more into this and discovered that the ketogenic diet was a very effective anti-seizure strategy even when drugs fail. About two thirds of patients. Respond favorably, you get, you know, 10 or 15 percent of super responders that never have seizures again. You can get them off your meds. And it was probably working through a mechanism independent of any anti-seizure compound. Because the ketogenic diet worked when drugs failed, you know, suggesting it was working through a different mechanism or many mechanisms kind of in synchrony. So the tools that we developed really sort of started to allow us to understand from a cellular and molecular mechanism how ketones were working. And I was looking at other compounds at the time. But it's just as I kept studying, I was looking at sigma receptor agonist. I was looking at other antioxidants, many different antioxidants and combinations of antioxidants that were catalyst, mimetics, super oxide dismetates, mimetics. You know, all these things that were in theory, they should work really well. But nothing was really working as well as ketones. And it also motivated me because when I discovered the ketogenic diet was a grossly underutilized anti-seizure strategy. I was like, wow, I could go back to my nutrition roots because when I was undergrad, I majored in nutrition science. But I didn't pursue a PhD in nutrition because nutrition was not like a real science. Like there was no jobs in nutrition. And the 90s was a decade of the brain. So it was like, let me try to get into a cellular neuroscience program. So I kind of just left nutrition. And this was my opportunity to bring nutrition back into my research projects into the lab. Going back to that BHB in the media. Yeah. Did you have the same amount of glucose in as you had in the BHB free media? Yeah. So we did everything in the context of the same amount of glucose. Another about five million benefit was from the addition of BHB, not the reduction of glucose. Absolutely. Yep. And as I started to get into the literature and read into this a little bit more, we started doing glucose subtraction and adding ketones and saw that normal healthy neurons functioned and thrived in a low glucose environment if the ketones were present. But the cancer cells would die. And this was also replicated and published in various neuroblastoma cell lines. And I think Skinner was one person that published and I found that he was at University of Florida. But he was a fellow and just had to left the school at the time. And then I went up there and gave a talk. I think in 2010. And that further that got me more and more interested in studying cancer even though it's not funded to do so. It was like this pet project that was completely very intellectually stimulating to me. And something that I could not just shelf and come back to it a later time. I had to. I felt like the environment was kind of hot for this. So I just kept reaching out to different scientists and showing them my data and asking them to explain it. Like top level cancer biologists. Then I stumbled across Tom C for actually speculating why do you think Tom was one of the few people that latched onto this was it simply because he'd already been thinking the same things or because it's really it is interesting when you think about how many really interesting and impressive people in cancer have not sort of come around to thinking about this stuff. Now in 2009 I think it was 2009 and I'm sure you have read this paper a thousand times. It's sort of I think it was the first obvious mainstream view of this was the Matt Van der Heiden Lou Cantley Greg Thompson science paper. Is that 09? Does that sound about right? Which reminded me of that a couple papers around that time. Which one was this is the one that offered an explanation for the war burger fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was working on energy synthetic. That's right. Or expanding the biomass directing metabolites to do that. Yeah, and that was interesting because that's a different explanation than presumably Tom would offer. Right. It's accepting the war burger fact as a very powerful. But the question that Tom has really set out to address no one is arguing the war burger fact is present. But the initiation of the war burger fact that damaged mitochondrial respiration causes an energetic crisis that kicks on the oncogenes that basically turn on the genes that are the essence of the war burger fact. Let's describe it. I should I'm going to take for granted that everyone listening knows what the war burger fact is. So for someone who doesn't know how would you explain the war burger fact? The war burger fact simply stated is insufficient. Might a condrel oxidative phosphorylation or what we call respiration. With compensatory fermentation in the form of establishing the cell establishes. It's energy. It's production of ATP. Our energy currency through glycolysis and substrate level phosphorylation. And it's well recognized that cancer cells 90% of them I would say have a war burger phenotype meaning that they have highly accelerated like holocys and substrate level phosphorylation. So let me simple write that a little bit more. Our cells can turn glucose into something called pyruvate and that occurs outside of the mitochondria and that's not a highly energy efficient process. It doesn't generate much ATP. You then have a decision to make as a cell which is basically how quickly does the body want ATP and as a general rule when it wants it quickly it's an anaerobic environment. You think about things that drive quick ATP requirement. And so then it will just say look what does it turn this pyruvate into lactate? That's the glycolytic pathway which is not particularly efficient either. It doesn't generate that much more ATP but it has the luxury of saying I can guarantee to do this quickly and I don't need to be limited by cellular oxygen. Under ideal circumstances you would want to generate the most ATP you would shuttle that pyruvate into the mitochondria as a seedal co-a and you have this other process. So what you're saying is the war burger effect is hey, even under conditions at rest a cancer cell seems to disproportionately do this glycolytic thing and it generates its ATP that way as opposed to going into the mitochondria. Exactly, even in the presence of normal oxygen it utilizes glycolysis and pumps out lactate. So under no other conditions do normal cells ferment and pump out lactate. So then the war burger did he want a Nobel Prize for this observation? He want a Nobel Prize for his work in metabolism cancer cells. Yeah and it was more kind of appreciated a little bit later what the implications of this was but it was part of his Nobel Prize. You know I remember reading an article about this once that has since escaped me but then maybe I'm wrong so correct me but one of the reasons that the hypothesis was because this was in the 1920s if I recall. Yeah, the war was yeah. So one of the reasons that this sort of got discarded for lack of a better word or at least ignored was people tended to focus on the exceptions and there were exceptions right certain lung cancers certainly seem to pose an exception to the war burger fact and so the idea was will look if you have an exception then the rule is not so much a rule anymore and is there another reason why the war burger fact was largely ignored for you know a generation and a half to two generations. Travis Christopheerson wrote a book called Tripping Over the Truth that nicely sums that up and I think there's a lot of reasons for that but I think the the big focus was on understanding the gene pathways that were associated with carcinogenesis and then if we can understand the gene ideology of cancers and different types of cancers then that would explain cancer in a much more fundamental level and that is the case there's a dynamic interplay between metabolism and genetics so now we have an appreciation that metabolites you could call them on cometabolites are epigenetic drivers and metabolism is just not something is just not producing ATP there are so many different intermediates and read-ock signaling and so many different signaling molecules from metabolism that have epigenetic regulation and I think that has become when I got into this there was no cancer metabolism conferences you know and now there's a dozen or more where Lou Cantley is the keynote speaker and Craig Thompson is getting and this has all sort of exploded shortly after some of these observations that I made and it's just you know it's I don't think it's coincidence anything remember that night yeah yeah remember when we had that dinner in DC at that conference yes I still look back at that as that was almost remarkable rooms to be sitting in as a fly on the wall because there was only about 12 people there and you know you had Lou Cantley you had Michael Bishop Steve Rosenberg David Sabotini who else was their Michael Pollock a vendor hiding yep that you can divide I mean you basically have some of their most thoughtful cancer scientists in the in the world certainly in the United States in one room and that was amazing conversation yeah yeah that's if I go back to the time exactly that's it's gold we'll talk this guy's into getting in a room again yeah I mean I think what you're basically saying is look part of its reason for being discarded or at least forgotten about was a new sexier idea emerged which is hey we started to understand the role of the genome and there's this weird sort of debate you hear and then the observation that things like viruses you know which could you know encode and change our DNA but but the viruses that cause cancer are the very same viruses that damage the mitochondria that damage the DNA and mitochondria and causing respiratory insufficiency which triggers an energetic crisis which can trigger the activation of oncogen through retrograde response so that needs to be appreciated too but those this explosion of technologies that allowed us to understand genetics and that was sort of being leveraged to really delve into the cancer I think it was do some politics influencing that too so is the first thing you did from that point because there's really two separate problems that you're talking about the first is why are these seizures occurring and I'm referring very specifically to your DARPA funded work which was why is it that when these social forces guys are doing their ultra secret dives which require rebrie there's why are a subset of them having these fatal seizures well it's the at the office of Navy research oh it was there's also not that okay okay okay they were doing more fighter performance like with ketoneesters just prior to you know what I was doing so so that's one problem yeah the other problem that's that you've also articulated is hey what's going on okay yes yes so oxygen toxicity seizures are limitation for Navy seal divers and we don't know how to predict them or prevent them it's also a limitation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy right so if you have carbon oxide poisoning right and you need to live as much as you need to get that that carbon oxide off your hemoglobin you need to basically increase the PO2 and your tissues oh do that carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity than oxygen for hemoglobin so you have yep basically up-competed yes so if you were to take a ketone ester which we know now increase your resistance to oxygen toxicity by like 600% and take a ketone ester and get inside of a hyperbaric chamber you have a much greater chance of living if you have wounds there's 14 different applications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy we think that therapeutic ketosis strategy would make it much safer and more efficacious so in the context of an oxygen rebreeder the advantage is that there's a stealth component because you don't produce bubbles you can dive in a quiet lake and go all the way across and surprise your enemy but it's just 50 feet of sea water within 10 minutes at 50 feet of sea water you run the risk of getting oxygen toxicity seizures that's pretty shallow I would say that again at 50 feet 50 feet of sea water 10 minutes you're on a dragger rebreeder according to the oxygen dive tables that has been enough to trigger a seizure in many guys so the produces a PO2 in your brain of about roughly 2,000 times higher than what your your oxygen level in your brain would be right now 2,000 percent higher yeah so that needs to be sort of appreciated and of course this could all be averted if you just stick to the dive tables right but if you have you know enemy fire with 50-kower machine guns coming down on you and you want to stay down if the water's clear you got to go down deeper if you have a plan of mine and get to the bottom of the ship or a bridge you you might be underwater for three or four hours and the enemy is still up there and it's you got to get down there and do your job and dive deep and avoid that and then you know after a time you have pulmonary oxygen toxicity too if you're down there long enough but generally speaking these your breathers are for shallow diving but situations where they need to go down deeper do you have an estimate of how many navy divers just in the United States both in training or combat would would die in a given year from this or be injured it's pretty rare fortunate is pretty rare and if they do get hit with oxygen you know our friend Kurt Parsley will tell you that navy seals notorious about not telling what their issues are with her health right so if they do have a seizure they would be kicked out you know a lot of these guys because that may make them a weak link that they're vulnerable so we know recreational divers that push the limit who've been hit a couple times you know with this and we're doing some studies right now recreational divers so it's very under-reported but studies have shown I always show a video in one of my talks of a guy in a chamber where he has a mask on and the mask is breathing 100% oxygen and the guy inside the chamber is breathing hyperbaric air and within at 2.7 atmospheres of oxygen he gets hit with a seizure and has a really violent tonic clonic seizure and it stopped as soon as you remove the oxygen mask and start breathing air even if it's at the same barometric pressure the seizure stop so one of the beneficial things of these seizures if you want to if there's a beneficial component to it is that they quickly stop as soon as you remove the hyperbaric oxygen source or you go from breathing 100% oxygen to hyperbaric air so what's happening is that the high levels of oxygen are creating oxidative stress and actually in peating various metabolic processes in the brain and the brain is becoming hyper excitable and the neurons are firing so many action potentials that the cells essentially can't maintain their membrane potential and you get excitotoxicity that causes mass firing and the neurons and a seizure right and this is obviously under a very super physiologic super physiologic it only happens you know in these extreme environments of pressures and and the reason for it now is kind of you have S nitrosylation of glutamic acid decarboxylase there's two different ises ions and then what we think now is that you have more glutamate to GABA ratio so the enzyme that converts our GABA immunopotric acid it is actually created from glutamate right so you have much more excitatory than inhibitory neurotransmitter so that ratio changes and it's a re-dox dependent reaction actually it's a you have S nitrosylation of this enzyme that converts more glutamate to GABA so you have increased neuronal firing and increased release of glutamate and also less conversion of the glutamate to GABA which has a brain stabilizing so this is going off topic for just a second but we know that as people age we see greater and greater oxidative damage so we see you know this susceptibility to ROS going up does any of what you learned in this super physiologic environment where in a very short period of time you're going to generate a ton of loss by exposing someone to high pressure and high O2 does anything you learned in that environment offer an insight into non-super physiologic or normal aging and disease progression yeah I think in many different ways so it's almost like exercise right if you exercise intensely your reactivation species are going to go up inflammation all these things kick on so high pressure oxygen increases oxidative stress and that kicks on many different processes that can end out of the cell with greater cellular protection so it can for example cause an increase in super oxidative mutate it can enhance enhance our antioxidant defenses so the oxidative stimulus is a trigger for adaptive processes that can allow our systems to be more resilient against the same level of oxidative stress this happens very robustly in a young animal and is significantly attenuated in an older animal and I think that needs to be appreciated so the adaptive response to stimulus is varies genetically probably between the individual there's a lot of individual variability between people and even if you take the same person under different conditions whether it be if they're sleep deprived what they ate that they there maybe if they're dealing with a little viral illness or something their susceptibility to oxygen toxicity seizures can be greatly affected by a lot of different variables but that adaptive response so we know hyperbaric oxygen stimulates the production of stem cells as much as something like GMCSF like a new pigeon or lukine like it's that powerful it causes the production and the release of stem cells which kind of hone in on sites of injury and aid in repair so that's why it's it's most utilized application is actually for enhancing wound production or wound healing effects I see you mentioned that there were 14 approved applications I wasn't aware that there were that many I certainly I think it's 15 now so what what are some of the others not to put you on a spot for rattle off all 15 but we can look it up but you sure just on top of your head what other ones do you know yeah radiation across us so for cancer if you are getting radiation therapy for cancer it is FDA approved for that so if you have patients you know who's have radiation therapy of course there's decompression sickness so we're recreational diving if you get bent another term for bends is decompression you know it's the same deal it's basically get the nitrogen out bi-basically you're just nitrogen out yeah beating it out with oxygen yeah carbon oxide obviously diabetic wounds all the hyperbaric the UHMS so hyperbaric medicine society approves the facilities and I would say 90 plus percent of their revenue generated from that is diabetic wounds which is a huge problem like you probably in your practice you probably see people with wounds that just don't heal well I don't see my practice but I certainly cut my teeth on it during residents yeah no pun intended significant problem yep so that's I mean that's a few different applications and there's a lot of sort of rare things there's noise induced hearing loss if you use that's one of the newer applications look that could be so some things that are kind of counterintuitive so when we think of high pressure oxygen a lot of times you think of retinopathy of prematurity right if you put a newborn and give them high levels of oxygen you could cause them to go blind right a newborn so that's an interesting meaning a newborn is more susceptible to susceptible to to oxygen it was a very common I guess you could say to put newborns on high levels of oxygen if they're born premature and why what is it about the newborn that makes them more susceptible? is it the angiogenic component of this? it yes yes that could be a component too and maybe they just don't have the robust and dodges the antioxidant you know capacity but probably it might be the angiogenic component too do you know off the top of your head if elevated mercury mercury toxicity is an indication for hyperbaric because I've heard of a lot of people doing this but it strikes me as a little bit off lately there's so much off label stuff being done so one of the things that I'm really interested in testing is for traumatic brain injury and I do think that low levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy if used shortly after a traumatic brain injury I think the faster you restore oxygenation the more likely you are to salvage those neurons so ideally you want to treat with something that's going to re-establish energy in neurons decrease inflammation and increase oxygenation to hypoxic pockets and I think from my perspective giving something like a ketone ester with lower levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy would probably work that's probably the by far the most controversial application because there's some remarkable responses from people who have even a regeneration of brain cells after the hypoxic injury for example in kids who are very resilient anyway I know Dr. Paul Harch you know has been on pretty much all the major news networks with the with the girl that sustained a incredibly severe hypoxic injury and brain death and regenerated some of her brain brain function and brain tissue. How old is the girl? She was pretty young I think five or six I believe and I met her actually one of the conferences and it's very clear that nothing was working for her until she did hyperbaric oxygen therapy so but kids are completely could be another story you know we don't know if we could replicate that but there are a lot of stories out there anecdotal reports but it just has not been studied appropriately and the studies need to be done and what do you see as the resistance I mean when you look at what's happened in the last five years in the NFL that has brought along with I think just the returning vets TBI is I mean I don't think you could walk down Madison Avenue and hit someone with a rock who hadn't at least heard the term TBI so everybody knows what it is we've got you know these two completely different demographics who are highly affected by it athletes and soldiers what's the hang up I mean you and I have spent a lot of time behind the scenes trying to get organizations like the NCAA interested in studying this I'm struggling to understand what the hang up is you know they're looking for devices to quantify TBI's in concussion so that's a lot of funding is going into that that area at least when we talk about the NFL had challenged and something that you know we submitted to you know I don't really know I don't really know I think the scientific rationale for a metabolic based therapy for the brain makes a lot of sense in restoring oxygenation I think the waters are very muddy though when it comes to hyperbaric oxygen with TBI because I mean we even did some rat studies where repeated doses of hyperbaric oxygen in a concussion or a brain injury model or a rat caused more injury can exacerbate the effects whereas a single dose of hyperbaric oxygen right after at least in our rat model decreased the infarct size by maybe 30 percent something like that so this is dangerous I mean we we don't want someone listening to this who's suffered a TBI thinking I'm going to go to some off label clinic and just max you know repeatedly expose myself to hyperbaric I mean we the point here is this has to be studied it has to be studied rigorously it has to be studied empirically and then we haven't even gotten to something we will get into later which is the potential augmentation of the exogenous ketone yeah yeah I would not do hyperbaric oxygen therapy if people are going to do it within without you know what I say I would definitely do hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you're going to do it in strong nutritional ketosis because a consequence of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is could be a CNS oxygen toxicity so you do not the last thing you want if you have a brain injury is to have a seizure and we know 85 percent of all penetrating traumatic brain injuries lead to seizures and people who have had penetrating what about blunt it's less than that but how much yeah so I don't know I guess you would have to quantify the blunt the severity yeah but when it comes to penetrating but it's it's upwards about 85 percent of penetrating traumatic brain injuries have seizures and that's because you have excess glutamate you know and that's a very thing that's actually contributing to oxygen toxicity seizures right so I think the biggest thing to do is to augment your brain energy metabolism to burn energy more efficiently the ketones do that and lower neuro inflammation and I think there's a variety of ways to do that but you don't want to throw more fuel on the fire and I think high levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be doing that I think maybe these soft chambers that go to like 1.4 1.5 maybe a better means to implement that let's get into ketosis a little bit I want to come back and talk about cancer I want to come back and talk about the exogenous ketones both the salts the esters and even different molecules but one of the most interesting experiments we've seen in the physiology of ketones like you know as far as old school experiments was the George K Hill starvation experiments right so it's highly motivated by that steady we're going to link to it here but what's why don't you give people the readers digest version of what George K Hill did that could probably never be done again yeah yeah and I was I was very lucky to connect with him before he died he passed away in 2012 by connect with him a few years before that and just to figure out you know did he really do this his studies and there was a lot of studies that also didn't get published that were pretty remarkable too that somehow they got past ethics review at Harvard Medical School but essentially what he did a very elegant study to look at brain energy metabolism the AV difference in blood and metabolites in subjects that fasted for 40 days and most of the subjects were divinity students I believe or maybe conscience and subjectors to the war or something like that but each person had like a different story behind it and he fasted these subjects for 40 days and just to be clear is water and mineral only water no calories yeah yeah but they took mineral sugar they had magnesium yeah sodium they did I I think they took a mineral supplement and they also were they weren't lean subjects so they were subjects who from their perspective were overweight if not obese subject so they had some weight to lose and it was very well documented and well controlled study where they monitored free fatty acids insulin glucose beta hydroxybutary to citoacitane and acetone and let's all just pause you there for a moment for the listener will come back to this because I want you to explain the difference between beta hydroxybutary or BHB acedosate or acedone how they produced which ones are metabolic theactic which ones aren't but hopefully by me just saying this between the two of us will remember to come back to that okay yeah so yeah essentially three ketone bodies beta hydroxybutary being the primary ketone that's elevated and more stable in the in the blood and probably more likely to be a brain fuel so and if we just focus on that ketone body after seven days it reached the level to where it was at or above the level of glucose in the subject so glucose came down from five to six millimolar down to three and stayed at three millimolar throughout the duration of the experiment throughout the duration of the fast from day seven essentially to the remainder of the 40 days so for the Yankees listening to this who finally read the metric system three millimolar is about 55 milligrams per deciliter so that's pretty darn low but what's interesting is it gets down there I think it was between day seven and day ten it hit three millimolar and then it just never went down again yeah yeah and just what the heck is going on these people don't eat any glucose how are the how do they sell and what that tells you by definition is their liver still had glycogen because that you have to be putting that glucose out from the liver yep so the maintenance of glucose is under very powerful homeostatic mechanisms so we have we're hardwired from an evolutionary perspective to maintain glucose and the glucose can be coming from gluconeogenic amino acids so we are breaking down some muscle and then the glycerol backbone of triglycerides too also contributes to the production of um so triglycerides being the storage form of fatty acids you have a three carbon backbone that's called a glycerol backbone it has three of these free fatty acids that are well they become free once they're cleaved they become the substrate that you're going to explain to us in a few minutes is how you make BHB or beta hydroxybuterate but you don't just throw that glycerol out you can actually deliver and turn that back into glycogen within itself to then slowly trickle out into the bloodstream exactly so when K-Helled did this if I recall insulin levels also got very low by with about day seven the insulin levels were you know rock bottom and sort of stayed there yeah yeah they're really one of the interesting things about the experiment what in addition to the stuff I want to hear about which is the brain metabolism and how did the brain partition those fuels is was this experimenter a different one where he was able to give insulin lower glucose levels but not generate CNS trauma through that yeah so the subjects were asymptomatic for have a glycemia and they felt really fine and in another round or level like one millimeter yeah so they infused IV infusion of 20 I use of insulin and pushed glucose from three millimeter or there balts down to roughly one millimeter which is like less than 20 milligrams per decilator yeah which would be fatal that would be universal fatal level even two two becomes like coma and essentially fatal if it's maintained I hit two very briefly during an insulin suppression test I had it stand for and I was no longer in ketosis because I was doing this in some recent tests so I started at about two and a half or three millimeter but 90 minutes later my ketones had weathered down to like point three point four yeah and then my glucose hit about 38 milligrams per decilator and yeah I really I that was the day I thought I was going through this area oh yeah no I thought I was going I have a little self experiment I can mention after this but essentially what they did which was a very bold and gutsy demonstration they injected insulin which facilitated glucose disposal in the patients essentially and brought blood glucose down to you know roughly one millimeter which is universally fatal and the subjects were relatively asymptomatic for hypoglycemia which was remarkable their ketones were maintained about above five to six millimeter that is out freaking rages like that when you just stop to think about how you could take a normal healthy volunteer and do something I mean we're all in the spirit of learning but when you just think about that from an ethical standpoint like how do you close mice I'm not allowed to do that in mice the eyeocook the Institute for Animal Care and the Committee you know would not approve fasting for more than 48 hours I think it's for 24 at our institution yeah so that's from mice and maybe rats might be 48 but yeah and the use of insulin to further you know that would I'm my serve on the eyeocook I mean these things would be quickly rejected I mean this is this was the wild wild wild west yeah and yeah and and then just the last thing on this topic that I remember which I'd love you to expand on is what did we learn about how the brain partitioned fuel how much of the brain's energy once you were in that steady state after about 10 days came from glucose beta hydroxybutarate and acetoacetate yeah so beta hydroxybutarate accounted for approximately 60% of the energy and probably 10% acetoacetate and roughly at that point after about 10 days only about a third of the energy was coming from glucose right and basically what's in your blood as far as ketones and glucose is what your brain is utilizing you know your brains in a hungry state and it's effectively utilizing and clearing those those metabolites you can do that it was it was very elegant demonstration and it kind of changed our understanding of brain energy metabolism as glucose being exclusive predominant fuel so in a fed state they were consuming for 100% of their brain energy metabolism was from glucose but only after being fasted did that change and he went on to write a number of reviews and went on with Dr. Beach who actually created and did the terms and they published together like he was a hostock with K-il wasn't he? A postdoc yeah he was a student of Hans Kreb actually and then yeah he was one of his best students from my understanding yeah from word of mouth yeah they went and they worked together in different capacities yeah I think you might have been a fellow with him I think most people listening to this if they can dig back to high school biology that that name Krebs will sort of ring a bell right should yeah yeah so you mentioned that that K-il shared with you stuff that wasn't even published do you remember anything that that was that struck you is super interesting that was unpublished yeah you know some things maybe not worth talking about yeah I don't know if he I do is some stories and then I heard some stories through other people too well I don't want to make you see anything that you're not comfortable saying about I would say some of the work that was done in animals definitely suggested that glucose could go lower even lower and that you could really transition your metabolic physiology to be fueled off fats and ketones and and that that was against what we knew these were remarkable observations that changed the whole context of what we knew about metabolic physiology and brain energy metabolism do we know today if the brain can use lactate directly as a fuel without it having to go through the choricycle yeah most certainly can I I think I think lactates actually a great fuel okay and that's one of the first fuels I got interested in when I was studying hypoxia and then later even hyperoxia was thinking about using lactate different forms of orally available lactate like polio lactate you know I think it's in the product cytomax if you remember for cycling I still use cytomax so so so so I was actually interested in that and that actually led me to ketones and then once I got more into studying ketones and discovered somehow it slipped past me all the years I thought I knew what a ketogenic diet was but then I went ahead about the history of the ketogenic diet being used for almost a century and it realized that it was like the standard of care for seizures and then understanding that these ketones can largely replace glucose as the energy source and then they have these signaling properties that are even independent of metabolism that are remarkable over the last five years a lot of these big labs are looking at the epigenetic effects of ketones functioning as class one class two histone just amazing yeah the functioning as a suppressor of the NLRP3 and flammazone producing less inflammation in a metabolic independent way so you obviously pretty quickly come to this idea that these ketones are interesting molecules and they're interesting for a couple of reasons at the very least what you just said which is they have signaling properties that make them kind of unique outside of the exogenous ketones though you have to also undergo a pretty extreme physiologic change at least in a Western culture to make enough of these to matter and you have to restrict carbohydrates and protein to get there so did you first personally get interested in this from a nutritional standpoint and then eventually through this exogenous pathway or vice versa yeah so ketone esters to my knowledge in 2008 didn't exist they actually did but I didn't I didn't know of them I discovered them on a DARPA website as some work that was being funded you know in developing of the ketone esters for warfighter performance but at the time when I just decided to go down the route of the ketogenic diet I reached out to Johns Hopkins and the crew there which is where the anti seizure therapy was pioneered right yeah it may occlinic first and then they work together with Hopkins I would say the bulk of the the work that was done to develop the protocols for the ketogenic diet which are in use today was developed at Johns Hopkins and I got Eric Kossoff books his book with the public's with John Freeman which was I just went out and did the classical ketogenic diet the four to one ratio so four parts fat and one part being protein and carbohydrates it equates out to 87 to upwards of 90 percent fat maybe 10 percent protein and like one or two percent carbohydrates so I mean it's like basically eating super low carb and then adding mountains of fat on top of that plate making like a super low carb meal with protein restrict and then add some butter and a couple cups of heavy cream with that and that's I started weighing everything out and what year did you start the 2008 I think in nine I think it was 2008 or nine that Eric Kossoff published the modified ketogenic diet which was more liberal and protein and increasing protein from 10 percent to 25 and 30 percent or 25 percent is a huge difference like you can that's actually a diet that I mostly adhere to now and I followed the ketogenic diet and I bought the strips were very expensive at the time there was a couple different kits that I got to measure my own ketones and you know I immersed myself in it I got obsessed with it and I wanted to know what it felt like to have a brain that ran on ketones and how high did your levels get measured in the blood I kind of struggled to get up there even with the classical ketogenic diets two and 2.5 I would typically with the classical ketogenic this is before MCTs so I wasn't quite using MCTs yet in 2009 I started incorporating the same time I discovered the modified ketogenic diet was the same time I started using MCTs and a modified ketogenic diet with MCTs got my ketone levels probably higher than the classical ketogenic diet which was just mostly you know a dairy-based long chain fat sort of derived so let's tell everybody how we make ketones and then we'll tell them what an MCT is for that yeah so let's talk about starvation ketosis and then if there's differences between that that are worth highlighting with nutritional that would be great but evolutionarily I'm going to deprive you from eating for a few days how do you survive well you start burning up your liver glycogen okay so it was 24 hours later you've got that down to about half of its half to let put a quarter of its supply through the suppression of the hormone insulin we start mobilizing fat from adipose tissue which are cells pretty much all cells in the body especially muscle in heart cells burned fat like a superior energy source long chain fatty acids don't effectively cross the blood brain barrier so through accelerated fat oxidation beta oxidation and fats in the liver that stimulates the accumulation of acetylcoe which forms acetylacetate and ultimately beta hydroxybuterate so you start spilling these ketone bodies through accelerated fat oxidation and the liver the liver lacks succinyl coa transferase so it does not actually use the ketone bodies for fuel and they become available for your brain essential nervous system and peripheral so the liver is secreting beta hydroxybuterate and the acetylacetate some extent okay so is the BHB being made and then being converted into acetylacetate or is the liver making both acetylacetate first and then beta hydroxybuterate and it's interesting that some people have a ratio beta hydroxybuterate to acetylacetate of two to one and some people five to one generally speaking about four to one so acetylacetate is unstable in that it can spontaneously decarboxylate to acetylone which is volatile and we blow it off in our breath. Does it have metabolic activity can we? It was thought that it didn't but more recent work is suggesting that the carbons of acetylone do find their way into sort of lipid biosynthesis and some other things but it's kind of rare for the fatate. It's not a great ATP or not no not really. It has some effect on neurons so it has an anti-convulsion effect through I believe opening a potassium channel which could hyperpolarize a membrane potential and actually help attenuate some hyper excitability in the brain so there are people that study you know the effects of acetylone as a sub-narcotic levels of acetylone right acetylone can be pretty narcotic and be problematic but acetylone levels that are 0.5 millimolar and even upwards of one millimolar can have a neuroprotective effect. Once you get above one millimolar you start to dissolve some of the membranes and you can have sort of a dozen of some. Yeah you have problematic you know acetone as a pretty powerful solvine right it's a nail polish remover but small levels of acetone are neuroprotective and that's actually something that we study. So how do acetylacetate and beta-harder acetylute enter the crebsycle in other words where do we get ATP from them? It depends on the cells so different cells have different we're looking at this now different catalytic enzymes right so they can feed in through a number of different pathways like I said the liver is the production site of beta-harder acetylute and when it comes to skeletal muscle they have a range of catalytic enzymes that can allow them to enter the crebsycle at different different areas. So succinate for example so you can replenish TCA cycle intermediates with succinate you can acetylacetate can break down and provide acetylcoa for the crebsycle. So what we're finding is that the crebsycle is not the simple cycle that we thought it was especially as it relates to cancer cells. So it's almost like we can't even look at the biochemistry book and kind of pinpoint different pathways with substrate level phosphorylation there are a number of different pathways like the malade, aspartate, shuttle that are associated with cancer cells if we go back to those pathways. Did you see that paper that came out in nature two days ago about aspartate being a rate limiting step in cancer metabolism in the mitochondria? And in Cia? I haven't bothered I were just talking about it today. It's interesting because the paper was part of it was written through a lens of hey this might be how metformin can exert some of its anti-cancer benefits by interfering with aspartate. I think it was interfering with degradation of aspartate but again I haven't read the paper yet just sort of the abstract but was yet another like I didn't know that. Wow every day I feel like I'm I feel like I'm getting dumber because the rate at which I'm being exposed to new information is exceeding the rate at which I'm assimilating it. So it just it feels like I'm on a downward spiral to stupidity. There are textbook pathways that I used to just rattle off and it all seems so simple and then you know I read three or four papers and I realize that I probably shouldn't talk about it in simplistic terms like that. We're kind of going down the rabbit hole of glutamine allysis right so glutamine is the fermentable fuel so ketones are a non-framentable fuel whereas cancer cells we use glucose and glutamine as the two primary fermentable fuels. It's funny I mean I know that biochemically I'd never thought of it in those terms though. Yeah. Yeah. It's not fermentable. That's interesting. So that's kind of what I'm thinking about you know in terms of ketone metabolism with glutamine so glutamine glutamine can make glutamate right and alinean and aspartate and lactate and glutamine elysis is kind of driven by the malleuspartate shuttle and that has become a major focus now of many cancer researchers are looking to target glutamine and it's not it's not easy. I mean because you have if you have a glutamate inhibitor that has tremendous side of that. Huge toxicity right yeah so we need to approach this in a very nuanced sort of way when it comes to targeting glutamine. Yeah so let's go back to the mct so you talked about how you started out in a four to one ratio which is interesting I started out four to one I spent three years on just four to one I never deviated from four to one but then you mentioned you went to two to one which is obviously much easier to do but you augmented with mct so mct of course stands for medium chain triglyceride there a type of saturated fat and they're of a certain length and I don't even remember anymore is it eight to 14 carbons is what we define as mct. Yeah eight to ten I think eight to 14 from in that but when we talk about the key to genic ones the they're more close to capitalistic capitalistic. Yeah so why it is spring? Why it isn't taking those make this process easier? When you consume them orally they are transported to the liver via a hepatic portal circulation and they're not packaged into Kyla Microns and you know long chain fatty acids when we eat them they're packaged in the Kyla Microns and then they go through essentially enter the lymphatic system and have a different route of entry they're metabolized totally differently whereas medium chain fats go directly to the liver through a patic portal circulation it's like a bolus of fat going to the liver and it's a type of fat that's rapidly oxidized right the liver is chock full of mitochondria so if I want to study mitochondria I'll take out a chunk of the liver and isolate it from that because that's the easiest thing to do so the mitochondria really burn up medium chain triglycerides very quickly and there's very high rates of fat oxidation the liver from an oral bolus of medium chain triglycerides so they're much less likely to be stored as fat there are source of calories and they can be incorporated into meals and into foods to further enhance and boost the ketone levels of the ketogenic diet or even if you're not on a ketogenic diet they can be consumed with a high carbohydrate diet and actually elevate ketones in the blood yeah I mean I've heard that but I've never actually measured it probably because I've only done this with liquid MCT which you end up getting to sort of GI tolerance becomes an issue probably before you get a high enough level but yeah if you're on a high carb diet and you consume I don't know two to three tablespoons of MCT how high could you reasonably expect your BHB to get depending on your absorption anywhere between 0.5 to 1 million molar. Vax high say yeah even on a high yeah if it's pure C8 maybe so with C8 you get about a 20 maybe 30% elevation above like a mix of the C10 CA which is generic there's some work being done that C10 may actually have some beneficial effects I mean that's kind of the idea behind the product exona that was on the market you know while back I don't know if it's on the market I don't know what it is yeah it's a basically C8 it's powdered C8 that was sold this you were C8 yeah you can order it like from Sigma or something like that yeah well I Dave Astro is brain octane is is Caprylic triglyceride and Peralo Nutrition makes captree which is a C8 oil so if you buy pure C8 not in triglyceride form the Caprylic if you just just straight for like acid yes that'll kill you I mean you you consume I bought I made the mistake early on and bought from Sigma Caprylic acid but not you had you need to buy out of Caprylic Trichester and hatch that mistake before investing I bought it from Sigma and I think I was going to use it in experiments and we're going to mix it you know with our ratchow and I wanted to go through legitimate source and I put a little bit on my finger and it kind of burnt my tongue off and I realized wait a second I think I need to try glyceride form of Caprylic acid I need to acrylic triglyceride yeah I almost killed myself you almost want a Darwin award yeah yeah you know I never released it if any time recently did that before accidentally killed himself have you had any experience with the powdered MCTs yeah yeah so powdered MCTs allow me to increase my ketone levels higher than and I used the quest powdered MCT formula there's a couple on the market now maybe yeah I have that of this stuff at home because I feel like anyone who's ever made a ketone product just somehow figures out my address and sends them to me so I have a pantry full of every type of ketone you can imagine but I haven't yeah you probably get more than me I just haven't got around to trying any of the MCT powder but I'm getting ready to do a long fast in a couple of weeks and I was thinking I really ought to get make sure I'm back in ketosis the week before I deprive myself of food for a week yeah so I was actually just thinking about this last week which is I got to fire up those powdered MCT and kickstart this thing because I don't have like a couple months to get fully adapted yeah they are great I mean MCTs are kind of like the poor man's ketone ester right so they are they're found in nature they're versatile you can incorporate even the powder the middle classes man yeah yeah given how expensive ketone ester is not enough that's right that's right yeah so I tinkered a lot with MCTs early on and increase my tolerability from maybe 30 milliliters a day to 150 milliliters a day well really nice hang on a second but that's ridiculous yeah when anytime I went to 30 and one sitting 10 tables been full yeah that's it's hard to fathom you need to incorporate it with food so I was spreading it what I found I needed to do was instead of doing intermittent fasting now which I pretty much do now I inquire I spread it out over like four meals and maybe would have a little bit of MCT in the coffee too and not including that in a meal so I was eating a modified ketogenic diet but spreading that MCT out with salad dressings putting it on vegetables and things like that and I was able to because if anybody's listening to this and it's trying to like they're just sitting there thinking how what could I do to do it to have a bowel prep like yeah the answer is just just just drink MCT it's you know it's better than fleets phosphosota you will you will spend the day in the bathroom and you'll you'll have a great call but you can work your way up to it so there's a number of transporters obviously that are up regulated and you are enhancing the breakdown and transported these and MCT's actually do cross the blood brain barrier so we did studies and rats where we took out their getting absorbed portally how do we know okay some of them I forget the percentage but I think in some people say it's like 50% of MCT is converted to ketones but I think it's something like about 20% of MCT's and it depends on the energetic state of the liver you know which is the master regulator and your your physiology in general but you have a fairly significant portion of the MCT's being converted to ketones but the MCT's do enter the blood and they can cross the blood brain barrier unlike the long-chain fats and they for example if you take out the hippocampi of rats that are eating an MCT-based ketogenic diet you'll find MCT levels are significantly elevated so they're crossing they're getting into the brain and the brain is utilizing MCT's as fuel and do we know if that has any anti-seasier effect independent of the ketone that might be produced alongside it? That's a big area of research right now that MCT's is functional fats and as you've never heard that term before functional fats. Yeah like well fats with drug like properties so I think there's a number of patents around C10 actually that I know they have in the UK I think it might be a pharmaceutical now so C10 actually has anti-seasier properties so there's some people argue that the effects of the ketogenic diet at least with MCT's is not due to ketones but actually due to the MCT's and not the ketones so there's a little bit there's a couple of groups out there that are sort of arguing that and I think they have a case but I think it's probably a comment it's definitely a combination of the ketones and the MCT's so MCT's do have interesting properties. Do you know Elizabeth Teal? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I remember having breakfast with her about six years ago and asking her a question that at the time I don't think she knew the answer to and she was gracious enough to explain that and she was there with someone else in her lab so it was a very spirited awesome discussion but I wonder if the answer is known today the question was basically do you believe that the anti-seasier properties of a ketogenic diet are more the result of the brain having another fuel to display a glucose or due to the reduction in glucose that invariably accompanies ketogenicis and at the time she shared with me very compelling data that would could argue either of those points potentially suggesting it was the combination of them. Do you have a point of view on this or is there more information today that steers you one way or the other? Well I know she's done some work with the low glycemic index diet and so a so carbohydrate reduction but without the production of ketones. Yeah so a reduction it's carbohydrate restriction but only to the effect of maybe 20 or 25 percent you know. Yep. And then carbohydrates that are low glycemic index and what are the results of that intervention? For different types of seizures it can have a positive effect and for certain certain types of seizures. That's not the first line of therapy for you know very powerful tonic clonic seizures and pediatricers you want to go right to the Classical ketogenic diet but it does have a number of applications for different types of seizure disorders. And what about if you take someone on a fully carb diet who's having recalcitrant seizures and you give them ketone exogenous ketone does that have anti seizure benefit? Yeah so those studies have not been done yet and there's a study being recruiting right now for something called angelman syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder that has seizures where the exogenous ketones are the therapy independent of the diet so they're just being added on top of the diet. There are people out there because exogenous ketones are commercially available that are using this in place that the ketogenic diet because the families are either unwilling or for various reasons unable to use the ketogenic diet and they you know use arguing using exogenous ketones and the feedback that I'm getting could be biased but it does seem to have an effect. It obviously has an effect in animal models. The animal models that we work with we give exogenous ketones on top of a standard rat child which is high carbohydrate child and it it works very well for CNS oxygen toxicity but also for things like phenyline tetrazole seizures, PZTC seizures even for absent seizures we use a particular animal model with absent seizures or absent seizures or a workshop it works for that so it works for a variety of different seizure models independent we are circumventing sort of the dietary restriction that's typically associated with getting into therapeutic ketosis and just simply giving exogenous ketones and elevating exogenous ketones but a consideration is that exogenous ketones lower blood glucose so you have and in some cases it lowers it really low like the high dose ketone esters that we do in our rat models it pushes and rats typically maintain a glucose around 140 to 150 and it'll push it down to 40 so milligrams per decimal yeah and that's approaching the maximum tolerable dose of the ketone ester and it's interesting when we go above the maximum tolerable dose we actually see glucose levels spike up and this is the phenomenon that we see it's almost like it's stressing out the liver just regulating the liver in some way it's the data we're trying to figure out but if you titrate in ketone salts or ketone salt MCT combination or various ketone esters it's inversely proportional to as you elevate ketones you have a very predictable reliable decrease in blood glucose that's above and beyond the decrease in blood glucose that you'd observe with something like metformin and we use metformin for many many studies in a lab I mean we we've we have a lot of experience so what do we think you know it's funny I was up in San Francisco like a month ago and I was talking with Steve Finney who you know at the outside I said you're one of the people who I would say now is more about ketosis than anyone alive and certainly Steve would have to be in that category so I would if I were gonna just guess I would say that between you and Steve Finney if the answer isn't really known on ketosis the answer might not be known yeah so but and Steve and I were having this really fun discussion with a few other folks about why is it that the ketones are driving down the glucose levels and conversely and maybe this is a different question of course but why is it that when we do these experiments of you take somebody in nutritional ketosis and you make them do really really aggressive exercise you know do a two minute all out effort on the rowing machine that the ketones go way down and the glucose goes way up is it solely a consumption and hepatic glucose output issue is there something else going on you know and and I was like well I kind of always assumed that we knew the answer to that and that it was the explanation I had but you know it wasn't at the end of that discussion I was like actually I pretty much now don't think I know the answer to this question. I don't think we do I have three potential explanations one could be an exogenous ketone induced release in insulin that facilitates glucose disposal so where that happens you do get I mean it's not like consuming a protein bolus or carbohydrate bolus but you do get an elevation of ketones that's where that's how we moderate our ketone levels right so as our ketone levels if we're on the ketogenic diet and our ketones become elevated there's ketone area we pee out some ketones and there's a number of product but one is a ketone induced release of insulin which then feeds back on the liver to like a reostyle really and lowering beta oxygen which totally makes sense because that's the reason that someone with the hypone diabetes can get ketosodosis they they lose the checkpoint yep yep and other researchers like if you ask Richard Veech you'll tell you that insulin sensitivity is increased so the insulin that you have available and associated signaling is being enhanced in the presence of ketones so is that an immediate change or is that a change that takes place over a long period of time that that sounds like a long standing issue I think there's a number of regulatory things that happen I know in his study where rats were fed standard rodent child but 30 to 20 percent ketone ester I think within that child their baseline insulin levels went down like 50 percent so that's just simply by you know just the addition of the ketone just the addition of the ketone over time over I think it was like maybe a three week I got to look to see the study but it was it was consuming ketone ester that was integrated into the rat child over a number of weeks decreased baseline levels of insulin significantly I mean it was like a huge effect and the implications of that you know it was a rat study you know you can argue rat study but I can tell you experimentally that are just you know testing on myself that the same observation happens I can actually if I get a significant amount of my calories from exogenous ketones and I do that over several weeks and I measure my insulin it gets below the reference range whereas if I get back to regular ketogenic diet I'm always on the low end of the reference range but I did find if I can assume and the maximum tolerable dose of a ketone ester or ketone salt and then I measure insulin you know an hour or two after that I do get a little bump up an insulin but it's nowhere near the bump I would get up if I ate an equivalent amount of calories from protein or carbohydrates which would shoot me up to like you know eight or ten or something like that you know with a big dose but it's usually somewhere around I bump it up from like 1.5 to like 2.5 or 3 or something like that. Wow those are still super well and that's my baseline and it's usually between one and two. So is your IGF level changed in the years that you've been on ketosis have you tracked it much? I have not I've gotten it measured a few times but not reliably like I do insulin quite often like every two months or so like I'm doing that and if I'm doing experiment I may do multiple measurements of insulin like throughout the week but I haven't measured IGF one recently I did it a while back and I was just in the normal range but I wasn't fasting I didn't that's the one variable I wish I would have tried insulin was a second assume IGF one might have been oh yeah so just for listeners and stuff how do we measure ketones I mean people talk about urine strips versus blood what are you measuring in each and breath for that matter you've got three ways to theoretically measure these things which one do we prefer and why for a new beginning into this I think the urine ketone strips will at least tell you if your in ketosis or not in ketosis what is it measuring or you're measuring on it and what does it tell you urine acetoacitate is measured and now there's a urine beta hydroxybuterate kits that are available so you could do that so the Abbott Labs precision extra and the keto mojo are two devices that will measure basically an assay a home assay kit for beta hydroxybuterate and we have used both of those things and kind of measured it against various assays in the lab and blood that we send out for analysis and it's pretty close pretty close plus or minus maybe 10 or 15 percent what does the urinary level even though it's a qualitative assay but you know everybody says hey my urinary ketone thing lit up bright purple can we infer anything from that about the blood level of BHB or acetoacitate usually you know unless you're running kind of dehydrated you know if you have a normal hydration state and your urine acetoacitate is 40 milligrams per deciliter above you're probably hitting one millimeter or above if you're anywhere between 40 and 80 to I think 160 milligrams per deciliter so your in a state of ketosis I would if you're a 15 that's like a light pink or something you're usually probably not in a state what I would say ketone that might be a normal state if you wake up in the morning and sort of a fast-it-state you might be hitting that but generally speaking you need to be at about 80 milligrams per deciliter on the urine ketone stretch and the one thing I didn't do rather when I was doing my sort of long for a ketosis is I didn't use the urine meters at all I was just you know I was yeah I was keeping habit in business basically about how many of those precision extrude strips I was so I don't know if my urinary excretion actually declined over time when my body became better and better at retaining this potentially preferred fuel have you done anything on that either personally or in the lab so what we use in the lab is the clinic-tech status device and that device takes the c-mins 10 SG kit so the multi-stick so you can buy for a similar cost as the keto stick you could buy the c-mins 10 SG multi-stick and that measures 10 things including urine acetoacetate and you could take that urine strip and stick that in a device that will give you more of a quantified number I see so that's how you were giving me quantitative information on the urine because I've only seen the qualitative stuff well it's a color change on the strip that's measured in the device yeah so over the years I rejected urine ketone strips is something that just wasn't very accurate and the more I use them making hundreds if not thousands of measurements the more I gain an appreciation and that it can be a pretty useful device but I think it's it's kind of useful for the individual your hydration status definitely changes it I mean been in Ben and situations where I'm dehydrated where I've come out of the water after like a six-hour dive and I've beaten on those things and it's like it's like screaming and I knew I mean I did some diets where I purposely wasn't in ketosis for some of the research that we do and I was deep into into ketosis just because I was you know very very dehydrated I didn't know someone could dive for six hours I was on the NASA Nemo Extreme Environment Mission Operations trip so I was a crew member on that where I maintained I was lived in saturation for ten days and I had an hyper-American environment and that that involves like an 18-19 hour decompression to come out. It's a NASA sort of a Mars analog mission where you work with astronauts underneath the sea and I I maintained a state of ketosis throughout that whole mission and and did lots of lots of measurements on myself down there and I saw really when I one time I got out after maybe it was a six-hour EVA so essentially you're in a hyper-baric habitat on the bottom of the ocean and then you go out into the water and then you come back inside the hyper-baric habitat but when you're out in the water even know you're down in the keys the water water pools heat from you like 200 times faster than air so even though it's like you know upper 80s I come out of that hyper-thurmeric and dehydrated my blood glucose always was in like the 30s sometimes in the 40s when I was on a ketah I was testing some of the ketos supplements. Wow yeah. What were the other people experiencing under those circumstances? Well we'll find out with this my wife actually is a was selected as a crew member for NASA Nemo 23 I was on 22 and I did not get the IRB protocol approved to do all the metabolic studies that I wanted to do but I became an end of one on that and I collected a lot of data on myself so with this new mission we have the Nemo NASA Nemo 23 we'll be able to make some pretty comprehensive metabolic measurements including things like hemoglobin H1C we're going to measure inflammation HSCRP glucose ketones all these things on all the crew members. Interestingly this year it's a it's an all female crew so you have like Samantha Christopher Eddie the famous European Tracy Caldwell Dyson who I've known at NASA and my wife and it's all female so we'll have love some female data to go along with this. What surprised you the most in your end of one? What did you see that you least expected? I saw why predicted that the habitat would really trigger inflammation that was probably from the elevated CO2 levels and the elevated oxidator stress. I chose to stay in a state of ketosis with the idea that that was my baseline state. We're doing studies on sleep we're using the orring you're probably from over that on sleep and also the polar V800 to collect heart rate variability data gut microbiome we're doing body composition measurements we're doing stress so we use the NIH toolbox and and juggle to look at cognitive psych parameters so that data has not been shared to me so I don't know my wife collected some of that data and that's being analyzed you know later on for publication but from a metabolic perspective from a hormone perspective some of the things living in that environment for 10 days decrease my testosterone at a 25% decrease into testosterone from the time and so we're fairly maybe fairly sleep deprived I average about six hours of sleep per night but I was getting like two and a half hours of deep sleep which is more deep sleep very typically yeah I was like I don't know if it's something in our mind of how the sleep is being estimated in other ways you know if you think you're assuming you're giving that off the orring right yeah that was orring so the orring is measuring but I usually get about 90 minutes sometimes like last last night I got one hour and 53 minutes of deep sleep but I usually get about one and a half hours of deep sleep but I got over two hours every night and instead of seven hours sleep a night I was getting consistently just you know five to six hours sleep a night so where are you going to mostly shortchange done REM yeah on REM but my REM was even not that bad you show is getting about an hour you know an hour REM which is not as much as right yeah that's too low usually two is optimal for me I think so yeah we measured sleep the things that really stood out were being in the water really pushes my body into and being hypothermic really turns me into a fat burning machine my ketones go off the chart and my glucose goes way down and almost looks like a six hour EVA when I came back into the habitat look like I fasted for a week so I have all that data for that too that I need to compile and now should we be looking at that we meaning people as a potential way to replicate fast under a more stressful state looking at what just underwater yeah do you think it was a combination of temperature and pressure primarily that was driving that effect so over the holidays we went to Thailand and we did I did a lot of nightrocks dives something like thirty nightrocks dives and I made these measurements too and I did see trends for decrease glucose and nightrocks dives were doing like an hour maybe hour hour and a half dives at the most and I saw trends but nothing like the trends I saw in the saturation environment when we did these long EVAs so do you think that the temperature was different from the temperature the temperature really has to have a difference because you come out and you're kind of shaky you know even know you feel very comfy when you're down there the first two or three hours and then by the end the last you know four or five six hours for a longer EVA you start like shaking a little bit uncontrollably you know but it's kind of subtle even though the water's kind of warm like it feels warm but it's just you know your body temperature is going down and they were on the days maybe I wasn't getting as much calories as I as I needed I came out of that mission later than I've ever been before I came out when we got back to mainland and I stepped on the scale I was two zero seven which is super low for me ended up losing about maybe I went in kind of late because I was training for it I'm not a very good swimmer like you I had the really trained to meet like you it would be like a total day in the park for you to meet all the criteria for that but I had to train really hard to meet the swim requirements so I ended up losing a little bit of weight but when I came out I would definitely what did you mention I lost nine pounds and it came out seven so I went in two sixteen so I went in pretty late I'm like two twenty one now so last year I entered the mission at two sixteen and I came out like two seven which was like I thought the scale was wrong so even though I ate a lot of calories during that mission I met a ballad yeah my metabolic rate was really high you know and that that was a consequence of that is so interesting because it's those are two completely contradictory concepts to me on the one hand you're saying hey my glucose levels went down my ketone levels went up it looked like I had fasted for a week yep but of course if you fasted for a week you're metabolic rate would be going down and not up in fact you would expect to see a topo G skyrocket where as I'm sitting here as I'm listening to you thinking would a topo G have increased during a period of time or decreased I think anything that pushes glucose that low and ketones that high and I think not really without knowing it we're pretty task-loaded so you don't have all the time you know that much time to eat I mean part of the mission is that they're training this is part of if the only NASA analog where astronauts are actually part of the crew members like other things like high-c's mission or NASA hero mission actually uses everyday folks and they push them to the limits to see how they they can break them but the NASA Nemo mission is actually training sort of astronauts so they task-load you to see what you're doing and you don't have a whole lot of time to eat but I was I was consuming what my normal calories would be but I was under I underestimated my calories for this and I think it put me in a calorie deficit which probably decreased my testosterone may have it in my cortisol level increased but it was still within the normal range and you're away from the light so your circadian's probably a bit screwed up too being in the episode you have you're only at like 60 feet so you do see some of the light come down but but it's probably a little bit different then I'm a very light sort of sun worshiper like I always try to get some light in the middle you know in the beginning of the day and that that's part of something that I always do so it was a bit disruptive in so let's talk about ketone esters salts et cetera so yeah to your knowledge what's the first exogenous ketone that was ever manufactured is that the tally one or exogenous ketone manufactured so one three-butane dial has been around a long time since the 1950s actually MIT did some research as a space fuel so that kept there was a publication in 1975 where they were trying to identify and alternative energy fuel for long duration space flight and the best candidate was one three-butane dial which is sort of a synthetic compound that breaks down completely to beta hydroxybuterate meaning the liver is not required to transform it into BHB the liver is required yeah through a couple simple steps so sodium beta hydroxybuterate would be the first sort of ketone exogenous ketone that was used clinically and that there was a number of papers that utilized that for rare metabolic disorders actually so that would be the first one and a lot of the IP and you know sort of the patents that came out were sodium beta hydroxybuterate and then maybe explain for people what the difference is between a salt and an ester so we'll leave acetoacetate out of that for a moment yeah but if you talk about beta hydroxybuterate but you can have a c-l-state salt too so I can mention that so I didn't know that I thought it was only a dye ester so that's well definitely want to hear about that so on the BHB front people are sort of inundated with ketone salts ketone esters and then a whole bunch of complete like weird stuff like rastery ketones and stuff but let's just leave the nonsense off the table yeah but if you just talk about comparing a ketone at BHB ester to a BHB salt what's the chemical difference? yeah so a salt is just an ionic bond right between the ketone molecule and beta hydroxybuterate a monovalent or a dye valent cation or an alkaline amino acid like arginine, citrline, histidine, lysine so you can literally ionically bond beta hydroxybuterate to a number of different things the easiest thing to do is to bond it with sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Now calcium and magnesium have two positive charges. You could put two to BHBs on them. That's the advantage sort of an advantage. And disadvantage I guess with magnesium BHB which is actually is very bioavailable magnesium I measured my magnesium after taking it. It went up quite quite high. Disadvantages that your GI tolerability to something like magnesium beta hydroxybuterate may be only somewhere between 1 to 3 grams. You know, 3 grams max produce. Wow, just not that mine. 1 gram, 3 times a day, at least for me had no issues. I could probably tolerate 2 or 3 grams per day. So it's nice. I mean it's something that's contributing. But ideally what you want to do with a ketone salt is because salt has a stigma I call them ketone electrolyte formulations. Yeah. It's to spread the beta hydroxybuterate out across monovalent and divalent canons. And they're the four that have the most utility. And then an ester of course is a covalent bond, not an ionic bond, right? Yeah. So you can take 1 3-butane dial and you could create a monoester with beta hydroxybuterate, right? And just add it do a transestrification reaction and combine that beta hydroxybuterate to 1 3-butane dial or acetoacitate. You can combine it with 1 3-butane or you could take glycerol. So with glycerol you can come up with a triester of glycerol which we have. Amazingly you're creating a triglyceride that is instead of 3 fatty acids with 3 BHP. It's pretty cool. Monarchal, yeah. So we have some experience using that. Yeah, I told a story like many, many years ago, I've heard about how I drank this jet fuel and almost thought it was going to go blind. Of course what I may have, what I may or may not have emitted from that story was that you gave it to me. So the key to honest today tastes to heck of a lot better than that earlier gen stuff. And I even when I told you that I just took the 50 ML Vile you sent and chugged it in one sitting even you were sort of horrified. You're like, way, way, way, way, way. You didn't read the note. I wrote you explaining how to dilute it and make it. We had talked about it. I mean, I had assuredly talked about it. You were very enthusiastic about getting started. Yeah. I couldn't resist. I was too. That stuff's unbearably bad. Yeah. So what I mean, whereas the keystone salts actually don't taste bad. They're they could be correlated. But they're awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So why does the ester, is there an obvious reason from an olfactory slash taste perspective why they are so staggeringly horrible? Yeah. At least they were and I mean, I'm told they're better today. Yeah. I would say the key to genic potency is inversely proportional to taste. So it just seems like, you know, the more the more potent these compounds get, even the the triester beta hydroxybuter aid, the, you know, is pretty nasty stuff. Meaning that glycerol triglyceride that? Yeah. It's a great molecule. I mean, it has like lots of, you know, tremendous utility. Well, making a ketone ester with one three-buting dial is really cool because the one three-buting dial is getting more substrate broken down. Yeah. So that goes into another question, the whole anantimer. So if you use the R beta hydroxybuter aid with the R one three-buting dial, then you can really get ketone levels up pretty high. And that would be sort of the delta g or the human, you know, ketone ester that's out there. It's the R and antwer. That would be the R. Yeah. The R. It's R. So you have, you can get recemic one three-buting dial, but that's the R anantimer of one three-buting dial with the R beta hydroxybuter. We explained to everybody what the R versus L means and the, yeah, the anantimer world. So beta hydroxybuter aid, not a pseudo-astate, but beta hydroxybuter aid has a stereoisomer. So if you put your hands together, the R beta hydroxybuter aid, or let's do D and L, let's do that. So the D would be equivalent to the R beta hydroxybuter aid would be the mirror image of the L beta hydroxybuter aid. And the pre-dominant form of beta hydroxybuter aid in the body is D beta hydroxybuter aid. We do have a rassimase enzyme that in various tissues that can convert the D to the L. So but when you're in nutritional ketosis or starvation ketosis, ketosis, you are making D anantimer of the BHB. Predominantly, yeah. So we do have the capacity to make the L, but it's pretty, pretty minimal. So that brings up the question. I think 99% of all the ketones salts being sold right now are rassimic. So they are the D and the L. When you give equal, yeah, yeah, they're equal amount. And there may be a concern there, but we don't know. So most of my research has actually been with the rassimic compounds and they were great, they're a cuticle. In pharmacology, there's a sorted history of getting the anantimer wrong. I mean, one of the famous famous stories I know of is fenomened. Health is a little might as well. Yeah. So that's right. Philitomide and fenphen were both examples of using the wrong anantimer. Yeah. Many pharmaceuticals like, I think ibuprofen and a like a fedron, you know, is rassimic and many of the drugs out there. So and things like ringers lactate, I think lactate is rassimic. Is it D now? It used to be rassimic. Oh, really? Thank you. I think you can get both. Okay. So you're saying look, physiologically exist at 90 10 D to L. And then you're buying something rassimic. You at least have to enter, shame the question, hey, am I ingesting something that might have a negative side effect? Yeah. And so the ketone esters, they're mirroring the physiology or they're just going mostly D presumably. Well, the human ketone ester for minor standing is completely D. So it's produced the D beta hydroxybuter A. Interestingly, elevating just beta hydroxybuter A and r c's your models. Even with the D does not have an antisusure effect. So that's actually why we went to the one three-butane dial. Sorry, say that again. Yeah. Do you say that if you use a pure D salt? A D salt or D D ester. Pure D salt or pure D ester. No antisusure effect with beta hydroxybuter A. We need it. And the animal model even suggests this if you just look even studies beyond our study is that you need to elevate acetoacitate has the antisusure effect. And we don't know exactly why that happens. The ketone ester that we work with, which is one three-butane dial acetoacitate diester, elevates beta hydroxybuter A and acetoacitate in approximately one to one ratio. Is that what you used to give me? Or was I just gave you a bunch of things. What was the one that was one asshole that tasted even worse than the BHB? Ester. Actually that yeah, that was the diester of acetoacitate. Yeah. And that's really potent. And it was bound to what? It won through the D dial. Yeah. That shit was from another planet of bad. I still have some because I've done shots of that. I like to just give it a few more. I put many gallons of that through me and done quite a bit of blood work and know pretty reliably at least in my body that it's not toxic and pretty much all the biomarkers go in a remarkably positive direction. But even know I know that it's not enough for me to even know it has that and that's no matter how great substance can be if it doesn't taste good. You know even me, I'm not going to take it. You know, even on a cast. I just think it's an aftertaste. Exactly. Well, I also remember you telling me because you sent them and I was like, oh, sweet. It'll be capsules because I had seen your animal data and I was like, I want that. And then you said, okay, well, I'll send it to you in capsules because you can't drink it. It's too bad. And I was like, perfect. Situation resolved and you said, and then not entirely, you'll still taste it through the capsule. Yeah. And I actually find it to be a great dinner party trick. Like, like who's the biggest, you know, tough guy here that just wants to show me how much of this stuff they can ingest? Yeah. I mean, we've done a lot of work with that Esther and it has remarkable effects, but we think it's probably more suited for like a medical food and something that could be sort of a parental, you know, IV therapy. So who first synthesize that? So I reached out to Henri Brunin Graver at Case Western, who was the director of the Metabalomics and I each funded, I think, Metabalomics Corps at Case Western. And I reached out to everybody, but I, to who had any experience, you know, either researching with ketoneesters or synthesizing them. And he kindly gave me the recipe on how to synthesize it that was above and beyond the patent. It was actually a detailed recipe on how to use a Cougarode distillation apparatus where to get the very few present. You didn't already know how to do that? I knew it was too. I'm sure past it. Well, actually, so Patrick Arnold, as you know, kind of helped me with the art. So an organic chemistry really is an art, you know, to be able to do this. And Patrick is an artist. Patrick is an artist and he thought this was like shady stuff in the beginning and I kept sending him papers and then he realized that this could be something big, you know, he realized that the science was there and there was a lot of big players in this field who had done remarkable research, but this didn't really have what it took to like actually make it a product like synthesizing and the stuff that you actually consume. I became obsessed with Patrick after all this stuff happened and he's actually introduced him to Tim and in the show notes to this, I'll make sure that we link to Tim's podcast with Patrick. Which I'd love to have Patrick on the show at some point too to talk about this. This should be shown to be shown to be shown to be persisting, but that episode with Tim and Patrick is so interesting. It's like if you have any interest in endocrinology in sort of like how the hormones work, how steroids work, it's yeah, it's just what I character. I owe a lot to Patrick. I don't think I probably wouldn't have gotten tenure without PIO so much to him. So I need to acknowledge him for that. That there were academic icons out there who could not do what Patrick did for me and he was pretty persistent in doing it. So he synthesized first the monoster and then it was a mix of monoster and diester, but he nailed it down to you know ultimately getting the art of the organic chemistry to where it's pretty much pure diester. He's such a wonderful human being anytime I email Patrick a question which invariably I do have like clinically I have a question about a hormone or there's no text book that knows the answer. There's no paper that knows the answer. I'm like Patrick. I got a crazy question for you. Even if he doesn't know the answer I mean he'll have a more thoughtful insight than you can get anywhere and it speaks to his capabilities. So first of all you've shared to me something I didn't actually know today that's really interesting which is this notion that if you are purely using the D and Antimer you do not get any of the anti-seizure benefits. Whereas if you're at 90-10 presumably you're getting them. So you don't need a lot of the L but you need some of L. Yeah I don't think there's any studies that show using an exogenous ketone in the form of pure beta hydroxybuterate is beneficial. So what we do know is that when you deliver exogenous ketones in a beta hydroxybuterate to a c2acetate ratio of 1 to 1 that that has pretty remarkable anti-seizure effects and there was some studies that were done with the c2acetate and also some studies that were done with acetone showing anti-seizure effects. So I do think it's the c2acetate is necessary. So what we don't know I don't think that resemic salts or resemic esters or esters that produce both D and L beta hydroxybuterate are a concern. I have not seen data to suggest that these would be a health concern. There are companies out there that are selling 8 million sort of doses per month of salts that are resemic in nature and there have been sort of no consequences from that that have been reported. So how are so many companies able to do this? Is there no IP in the salt world anymore? I don't think there is IP for the key. I think some of the early patents may expire so I don't think there's actually there's some intellectual property with formulations of acetone salt and acetogenic fat and MCT and that's some of the stuff that my university has and there's some composition and matter patterns and maybe some use patterns around the D salts I think and maybe the D ketone esters. So at this point in time do you think that the ketone salts have more physiologic benefit than the ketone esters just as a function of having a higher amount of the L and anantomer? So I think when it comes to purely a metabolic fuel I think the D beta hydroxybuterate has some advantages, right? So we also know that in regards to some of the signaling effects, especially the inflammation, the NLRP3 and flammazone is suppressed by beta hydroxybuterate both the D and the L form and we know that when we consume resemic ketone salts in the D and L form the L form tends to stick around longer and gets metabolized slower so conceivably that could be having a stronger anti-inflammatory effect because you have a ketone body and endogenous metabolite that's functioning as a very powerful signaling molecule that's suppressing an inflammatory pathway so the concentration just tends to get higher. You know that that's my view of it so we haven't really studied that in detail but the lab that did some of the work on showing the nature medicine paper that showed the NLRP3 flammazone was suppressed by beta hydroxybuterate it occurred both in the D and the L form. We do know that the L form gets metabolized slower so the concentrations and the tissue may actually reach higher levels so what we have observed is that the recemic beta hydroxybuterate has a glucose lowering effect so we're trying to figure out but we're not so pretty bad. We also see that in the pure and the pure and the pure tumor. I've seen that with the human product which is obviously a pure D BHB I think they're seeing about a 20 to 30% reduction in glucose do you see more than the it tends to be the case yeah it tends to be the case especially with one three-buting dial you see it and maybe it's a redox shift in the liver that's what honorary brunin grabber thought but it's pretty remarkable and when we compare so I have some products in my bag I'll give you I have I've been doing a lot of work with D salts so I've been consuming D salts and pretty high levels that bring my ketone levels up pretty close to an ester so you can formulate sort of D salts how high if the elevation of my ketones gets more than three millimolar I just start feeling a little bit weird you know which is interesting because you've experienced naturally occurring ketones that much higher than that level yeah but I don't actually am a pretty good ketone burner so you could you could do a glucose tolerance test I do a ketone tolerance test the ketone tolerance test is consuming a known amount of ketones and looking at that pharmacokinetic curve so you measure so you'll do fasting level of B.H.B. Glucose insulin fatty acid and just your ketone and then measure at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes and athletes have when you challenge them with a ketone tolerance test I'm creating like a new test year they actually dispose of ketones and utilize it remarkably if I when you take a couch potato and this the same as the couch potato rats you could push a couch potato rat into keto acid doses if they're older their tissues are not effectively utilizing the ketones for fuel and I've seen that in some individuals and some people I've get hundreds of emails and people show me their data and one packet of even a commercial ketone product on the market can shoot some people up till like five or six which is like that in just a bit clear in the ketone tolerance test which by the way I freaking love this idea how have you not told me about until today holding out on your best amount it's just materialized in my brain what am I going to call it you know next time you get one of these ideas just pick up the phone you know my number you call me and you tell me this stuff this is your it's like your hold now I want to make sure I understand something is this independent of whether or not that athlete was in ketosis before or after in other words how much of that utilization is a function of the metabolic machinery in the muscle utilize ketone versus hey athletes are just better at oxidation to begin with. Fatadapted athletes are very good ketone utilizers and have a hard time elevating their ketone levels with the ketogenic diets. The ketocytone carbathlete who's still fit as a fiddle. Yep. Yep. You do this test. Yep. How do they behave? Not as well. And I do think that high-performing athletes probably are bouncing in and out of ketosis right you have post-exercise ketosis just from the energy or depletion that you get during exercise. So their bodies are probably used to seeing ketones using them as fuel but if you take someone who's a real keto adapted fat burning like ketone machine and you you hit them with high doses of ketone they tend to dispose of them very quickly. So they've upregulated ketone transport across membranes across the blood brain barrier through the MCT transporters which are upregulated we need to. And this of course is not the same MCT that we talked about earlier. No, no, these are monocarboczilla acid transporters. It also transport things like lactate and pyruvate and because the MCT transporters are much higher and more dense in the membrane you could probably clear lactate faster. So I think that may contribute in part to why keto adapted athletes produce less lactate. It's funny you say that I hadn't thought of that actually. I didn't realize that in ketosis you upregulate MCT. I've always suspected that that might play a role in the genetic differences between athletes. Why do some athletes seem virtually unparallized by anaerobic activity and it's like look if you can shut a lactate out of the cell quick enough you can recycle it and reuse it. We actually tried to get an IRB of an N of 1 and getting Ryan Flarity who I don't know if you know Ryan. Yeah, you'll know of him. Yeah, so Ryan and I and a couple of other guys tried to get an N of 1 IRB at UCSD to do muscle biopsies on ourselves pre and post a certain type of nutrition exercise routine. We wanted to implement that Ryan has sort of pioneered with with a number of endurance athletes and that was our that was one of our endpoints was could we see an abregulation of MCT because the hypothesis was the certain type of training stress was going to lead to that which would obviously increase our performance at a certain level of output but super interesting to think about that through the level of the ketone potentially enhancing that signaling. Yeah, it is a lot of things to think about there. So I'm going to caveat my next question with a really serious caveat but it's also a very serious question and I was sort of on the fence about whether I'd ask you this or not but I'm going to say screw it I'm going to ask you anyway. I'm going to caveat this by giving the disclaimer which is your PhD scientist you do basic research you are not an MD you are not an oncologist and nothing you say is going to be construed as medical advice. So with with that said I still have to ask you a question which is if tomorrow you your wife someone you cared about deeply was diagnosed with cancer and it was a cancer for which all standard therapies had been exhausted and you were now left to the best insights you have with respect to your knowledge of cancer metabolism tell me what pulling out all the stops looks like and again what I'm this is in the context of you've taken and you are complying with all chemotherapy, the radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, surgical therapy etc but you're losing right so something else needs to be done what what is that combination of that something look like so I guess I mean when we think about the worst cancer worst case scenario who would have pancreatics pretty bad but probably glioblastoma would top the list of things right and would your answer be different if I was asking you about pancreatic adenocarsinoma versus GBM? I think you know it would be there's things like with pancreatic cancer can make it hard for someone to fall the ketogenic diet right because and liver cancer and things like that so they need to approach it a little bit different and you could have a lot of unexpected consequences metabolic consequences by someone with liver cancer if they have heavy liver meds or let's make it similar and bring cancers let's talk about GBM and metastatic breast cancer okay so start with GBM you're loved one or you have GBM? Yeah I would say it would be useful not necessarily you know absolutely necessary to ask for an FDG pet scan do a pet CT and especially I mean with GBM it's gonna light up lighters no tomorrow right so just for the listener so FDG pet means you take glucose you label glucose with a molecule and then when you do the pet scan shows by lighting up anything that absorbs that and the most rapidly metabolizing tissues of glucose light that up which is almost always any cancer and then a brain normally lights up so a brain with cancer takes that to another level yeah so you're doing that to document that this is a high glycolitic tumor yeah okay so even now there's a lot of experimental things going on for GBM but pretty much the standard of care is not offering any survival advantage when it comes to this so we did GBM is uniformly fatal I believe the five the five your survival is almost zero yeah yep and the mutation rate in GBM is very very heterogeneous in regards to the number of mutations so many of the standard of care therapies that target specific pathways just are not efficacious because you have a grossly mutated cells throughout the tumor so I'd probably my answer would default back to this press pulse idea that we published in nutrition metabolism is that the one in 2017 which uh no actually so the the 2017 paper was in seminars in cancer and that was with oncologists at the Mothac cancer center where we discuss how the ketogenic diet essentially targets the warburg effect and in doing so really targets all the home marks of cancer so any cancer biologists you know is writing a review on paper like you know you talk about the home marks of cancer there's enhanced proliferation evasion of immune system and geogenesis all these different things evasion of apoptosis the ketogenic diet nutritional ketosis actually targets all those things and even the aberrant metabolism and the increase in inflammation that it's you know is now a hallmark of cancer so from the press pulse the the simplest way to describe it at least it's implementation which I think is probably most important for the listeners is to achieve a glucose ketone index so press essentially means you were providing metabolic stress to the cancer cells that can stop their rapid growth in proliferation it's like taking the your foot off the gas pedal of cancer cell growth and there's a number of things that we could do to slow down cancer growth in proliferation and metabolically stressors cancer cells and that can be done continuously and pulse protocols you have a wide expanding toolbox of modalities that can be used in an intermittent fashion that can be sort of tactically used at different time points to kill off the cancer cells that you have applied the press stress to so press protocols which are done continuously would be something like a calorie restricted ketogenic diet perhaps with intermittent fasting perhaps a low dose met foreman and what was the ketone to glucose ratio you want to see I would want to see anywhere between a maintenance of one to two meaning that's the glucose to ketone ratio I daily maintenance of one to two yeah so so glucose should never be more than twice the ketone level when both are measured in ideally in a perfect scenario three millimeter ketones three millimeter glucose so that's kind of hard to achieve but not not with a number of tools so there's a number of tools that you can use to achieve that and that needs to and there are things that we could talk about too so the fastest way to get to a glucose ketone index of and maintain that of one to two would be what I would call supplemented ketogenic intermittent fasting right so when you eat within a restricted time window say of like six hours a day you start eating at you know 2 p.m. and finish at 8 p.m. scenes relatively easy to do and within that fasting window if needed you could consume calories in the form of perhaps exogers ketones and that would further lower glucose and elevate ketone levels like within a range and they are commercially available ketone products on the market millions are being consumed and there's no kind of adverse effects you know when you compare it to something like a red bull which you'll find lots of adverse effects so there's fairly good safety data but this needs to be said but the difference is red bull sponsors a formula one team so it's exactly yeah yeah so these things are relatively safe and their utility are that you know they can help you achieve a glucose ketone index and when you do have a glucose ketone index of one to two you are limiting for meantable fuels to the cancer cells and also most likely suppressing the hormone insulin tremendously to get there and and because I'm sure you'll be asked or I'll be asked is the reason you are applying an intermittent or time restricted feeding algorithm to this because during the fasted time you increase ketogenesis or because there was something specific about having complete liver and gut rest in other words is there a reason that an individual should or should not consume exogenous ketones and or MCT during the fasting window yeah I think if it's difficult for them to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two one of the tools in the toolbox could be to consume exogers ketones during that fasting period I think it can be help and you can also consume them during the feeding period too and they provide an extra source of calories that's a non-framentable fuel and I think have a benefit in and of itself you could just talk about the anti-inflammatory benefits you know I think there's a number of different so that's press protocol is pretty aggressive yeah and and it could also have things like meditation and yo I mean and exercise of course low intensity exercise I think but the most important thing from my perspective of the press so we're just talking about the press is to get that glucose ketone index to one of the better or one to yeah yeah one to two or better and then once that is achieved or concurrently so you could think about different modalities for the pulse protocol so changing your metabolic physiology with what we just described will have a huge effect on targeting the warberg effect and also will be already targeting all the hallmarks of cancer so you have a different person you have just changed that person's metabolism you know I mean the glucose ketone index of the average Joe out on the street is probably the only something like 25 or 50 it's like nowhere near that right right so you are literally changing the metabolic physiology of that person so modalities that they may be resistant to or completely failed may have an effect now so chemo radiation may be immune based therapies may be working now but it's an important point right we view this as in as an edge so you could do a neo-ag event concurrent or adjuvant approach so and I think that what I just described can be used as a neo-ag event concurrent and an adjuvant approach yeah so people talk about cancer approaches as look you you want to think about the legs of a stool so you take a chemotherapy to approach you take a radiation approach you take an immune based approach and you take a surgical approach those are really the four pillars of cancer treatment today yeah you're basically saying look there needs to be a new type of oncologist which is the metabolic oncologist so you have a surgical oncologist or radiation oncologist you have a medical oncologist you know have an immunoconologist why don't we have a metabolic oncologist yeah things will lead that way and just by the research that's being done now the huge amount of research being done even on oncometaballates and all the genetics people are now focusing on the how metabolism is influencing genetics metabolism is a driver for our biology and influencing epigenetic expression so you know the work I'd like to also point to the work of a friend of mine and colleague Adrian Sheck who was did her work at the Barrow Neurological Institute which demonstrated in a mouse model GL261 I think model of Gleoblastoma that using Tema's olamide and also radiation with really focusing on radiation that being in a state of nutritional ketosis made radiation therapy many many times more efficacious and that mouse model which is kind of a gold standard model for GBM it actually cured the GBM in that mouse model using the ketogenic diet combined with whole brain radiation so that was a pretty significant finding that actually spearheaded some of the ketogenic diet clinical research that's being done research this was done with dietary or nutritional ketosis not exogenous supplementation not it did she went on to do some work with exogenous ketones and looking at how ketones can reprogram the metabolism and ketones can actually have they are like cox2 inhibitors they inhibit reactive oxygen species which is driving growth and proliferation so that work spawned research just on ketones by themselves in her animal model so what is in your pulse pulse protocol can be varied so hyperbaric oxygen therapy at what frequency three generally speaking so with the GBM you have to so a consequence of the GBM could be seizures right so getting hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a GBM is going to be true so yes you have to start very low probably like somewhere around 1.5 at a and then work up gradually from there based on the individual person but generally speaking the research that we did showed that not five days a week which is typically used for wound healing but I do think there needs to be a day off for adaptive effects to happen so three days a week 2.5 atmospheres for 60 minutes three times a week and that produces well reverse tumor hypoxia for one thing so hyperbaric oxygen increases tissue oxygenation not by hyper oxygenating hemoglobin but it actually gets oxygen into the plasma and that's a very important thing because meaning you solubleize oxygen within the plasma yes because you can't really super saturate the hemoglobin. Yeah you're in the top of the curve yeah you and I are sitting here I don't know this air here but your your hemoglobin is essentially saturated you know probably 96 98% but the hyper oxygenation that occurs with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and this is why oxygen therapy does not work independent of an increase in pressure right so the increase in pressure is needed to dry the oxygen into the plasma and once it's in the plasma tumors have a radic vasculature right and then the red blood cells get caught inside the capillaries and the vasculine the oxygen doesn't get into the tissue inside the tumor but if the oxygen is in the plasma it can get past and all into the nooks and crannies of the tumor and then reverse tumor hypoxia which is tumor hypoxia is driving hip one alpha and veg F and causing oxygenacrisation. Ironically you're taking something that is initially a deficit of cancer which is its hypoxia but then it utilizes it as it's an advantage by saying hey I'm going to work around this it's going to make me more resilient it's going to allow me to exist my vasculature boom but you're saying hey buddy that little advantage you had that was a disadvantage we're going to reverse it we're going to hyper oxygenate you know we're going to take away your hypoxia and also in class for your radicals. Yes so you have a dual effect right so you are silencing the oncogenes you're turning off some of the oncogenes and also by hyper oxygenating a tumor which it's baseline is to be in a in a state of hypoxia by supersaturating the tumor with oxygen and that tumor tissue has damage mitochondria because hypoxia damages the mitochondria so basically your hyper oxygenating a whole bunch of damage mitochondria and essentially what that does is skyrockets superoxid anion which then through fentany chemistry so when you have a lot of free iron and all that you got a whole bunch of heement stuff that's being broken down the tumor so you have a lot of free iron driving the fentany reaction and which is producing hydroxyl radicals and that causes a massive oxidative stress specifically to the tumor and you're delivering a massive oxidative stress to the tumor while it's relatively non-toxic to healthy cells that have normal metabolism right because the tumor is thriving in a low oxygen environment and you're reversing tumor hypoxia and hyperoxygenating it and you have this environment which is just fueling redox stress you can then trigger a poptosis and endocrosis really driving the crosis in these tumor cells so hyperbaric oxygen delivered at the maximum tolerable dose three times per week and you could further enhance the oxidative stress of the tumor by something that's a lot of people haven't heard of this but I v vitamin C so vitamin C if given intravenously you could have brought up to about 100 grams about you could yeah 25 to 100 grams is kind of pushing it but vitamin C ascorbic acid also functions as a glucose antagonist you gotta make sure you have dextrose on hand if it's yeah but not if you're in a state of ketosis right so if you're in a state of ketosis so I did a pretty high dose vitamin C but being in a state of ketosis you can tolerate higher amounts right do you know what your glucose drop to so when you measure your glucose when you're getting vitamin C you get a false positive on the meter falsely high you get falsely high well at least the habit precision extra yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just you know when you measure that meter that assay on the meter is also sensitive to the pH of your blood to and there's a re-dox shift and right a scorbic acid is a powerful reducing agent and then that might be altering the the assay so it's not able to get my glucose like skyrocket I know I went into a hypoglycemic but my ketones were elevated and I took a pretty big hit you know a vitamin C and I was just doing it just for the you know the self experimentation that right so but what's the thought here so so lots of people thought about stress so vitamin C driving the fenten reaction to produce more oxidative stress so vitamin C is a pro-oxidant when you get blood levels of vitamin C in the millimolar concentration then it becomes a pro-oxidant it's not an antioxidant so we're not using antioxidants or definitely you don't want to use it yeah I was going to come back to that but the next thing is I'm sure somebody listening to this is going to say well I don't have access to i.B. vitamin C if I want to through that you can't do it you can't do it or really because of what it's not you can't get it out of the gut enough you can't you can only get like a very small amounts and then you know you're got auto-regulates it too so you just let's get to the next thing you said which is again highly counter intuitive to most people we're hardwired to think that there's nothing better for you than anti-oxidants yeah but paradoxically once you have cancer that might not be the case yeah so I think antioxidants may be blocking some of the efficacy of some of the the some of therapies too right because many chemotherapy-drucks their function works through enhancing oxidative stress radiation sure does so radiation maybe 20% of the cancer killing effects of radiation are due to damaging the DNA with double you know double strand nicks but 80% of the tumor killing effective radiation is by the generation of reactive oxygen species now does that mean you can't have blueberries and things that have low levels of antioxidants I would say no but you don't want to kind of saturate your body with a cocktail of antioxidants like you don't want to do a glutathione push right after you do same with an AC see you wouldn't have an AC I personally would not I don't I don't think none of the cancer studies and animal models or humans are supportive of the use of the antioxidants and that was a big focus of me I mean during during my PhD I wanted to do a postdoc research in antioxidant cocktails that were going to save the world and none of the research on antioxidants really paned out in my mind there's a couple things you know maybe for mitochondrial antioxidants for like free drinks a taxid maybe a ls and some research there but it's pretty subtle benefits but in the context of cancer no I don't I don't think antioxidant should be avoided anything else in your pulse protocol yeah I mean there's a lot of things that you could add so with the press protocol I think a low dose of metformin could be helpful too so that will activate amp kinase maybe decrease insulin a little bit maybe increase ketones a little bit too and it's just a readily available cheap drug that has a very good safety profile 500 milligrams to 2000 milligrams a day are usually well tolerated probably starting with 500 milligrams and working up but when it comes to the pulse protocol hyperbaric oxygen IV vitamin C and there are a number of drugs that we're working with now one would be 2D oxyglucose which in and of itself from a seizure world and I've I've been a reviewer in for the government for different grants and stuff and this is in the context of epilepsy 2DG is sort of like the ketogenic diet in a drug so by inhibiting glycolysis it has this gets back to the question right you have no ketones but you inhibit like a litic pathways perhaps even like reduce sort of m2 or signaling or some glycolytic and that may have anti-seusure effects so 2DG is something that we're working with now I think it was 2DG originally developed for pharmacologically I've been around for a long time for a long time I think maybe it was just in the realm of experimental compound but I know there's phase 2 trials in cancer the problem is it becomes cardio toxic above say 50 milligrams per kilogram I know can be I know there's some evidence that cardio toxicity but at 25 milligrams per kilogram at least on some of the grants that I reviewed that was how to pretty good safety profile for epilepsy so you know not making any recommendations out there but I think 25 milligrams per kilogram seems to be within the realm of therapeutic efficacy and this is being studied in humans and they're out of phase 1 so this you have phase 1 day and the epilepsy world yeah and I think there's some cancer trials going on too and I do think that synergizes really well once you create the environment where you put the press protocol into action then the cancer cells become even very selectively vulnerable to other things like 2DG will inhibit a glycolitic pathway that drives the pentoth phosphate pathway and that pentoth phosphate pathway is responsible for enhancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity of cells so it makes the cancer cells even more vulnerable to oxidative stress the more you can inhibit the glycolitic pathways so 2DG to dichlorocity is something that we've worked with to inhibit its pdh complex and that can DCA drug that's been on the market for a long time it's a small molecule as yeah it's been on the market for a very long time and what's it's normal use it's normal use is lactic acidosis actually so one of the side effects of metformin right is is once you start increasing the dose of metformin and escalating the dose the problem that you run into it's still it's it's a very powerful activator of amp kinase it's effects are primarily through the liver you know inhibiting gluconeogenesis and it's a mitochondrial toxin through we published a paper that it increases loss production from the the complex one of the mitochondrial so it's a himid in complex one correct it's inhibiting yeah mildly inhibiting complex one and it's triggering what the cell experiences as an energetic crisis and that you know it has an activation of amp kinase too so you are creating a scenario where that's putting a lot of persistent metabolic stress on the tumor cells and then you come in here with different modalities that have overlapping but independent mechanisms at producing oxidator stress so hyperbolic oxygen IV vitamin C and then cancer specific like the lytic inhibitors 2D oxyglucose 3 bromo pyruvate and low nidamine low nidamine is also hexicanase 2 inhibitor and those 3 drugs that I mentioned right there they are very powerful and they need to probably be used in two weeks on two weeks off and somebody's listening to this and they're thinking well how the heck could I ever do this are there physicians out there who are obviously doing this under the full and legal umbrella of ethical medical practice is everything that's talking about purely theoretical or their ways to actually have these things implemented I think there are some physicians out there that are probably not making it public but I think they are getting success with doing 25% of what I just talked about you know they're not doing all these things but everything that I just mentioned is readily available I mean you could most of the compounds in IV vitamin C hyperbolic oxygen therapy can be costly if you don't have a hard shell chamber but I like that with radiation if you're giving radiation to your body or it's like going in there with a flame thrower and you have a lot of collateral damage whereas hyperbolic oxygen naturally elevates the precursor for oxygen free radicals and the cancer cells selectively produce more oxygen free radicals so it's a very gentle approach and instead of thinking that we should just go in there and eradicate the tumor I think it's it's more appropriate to give sort of a gentle stress to the tumor so the therapy that I'm describing if the patient goes into it they're going to come out of it stronger than they were going into it and when you've fatted down and keto adapt your body so many metabolic biomarkers start to go in the right direction when you go in for chemotherapy and radiation and you measure things after your body's work in flammatory mess I mean you're metabolically deranged your insulin resistant you are pushing things and you have chemo brain on top of that that may not be reversible the suppression of your immune system with chemo is setting you up for more cancers potentially other cancers so the scenario that we envision is a comprehensive metabolic based therapy where you go into it and it's a more gradual approach and you start adding these modalities sort of as you go you know get the patient acclimated you know with that glucose ketone index of 1 to 2 and then start utilizing some of these other therapies you could potentially put someone on an IV right and pulse a low dose of insulin to make them hypoglycemic even one or two millimolar and then deliver some of these agents where you've really restricted the different mannable fuels so I was you know I'm a reviewer on different manuscripts that are coming in and some of these academic and clinical oncologists are actually suggesting this in you know medical hypothesis papers now and that's kind of counterintuitive because you'd think well we don't the last thing you want to do for a tumor is give it insulin because this is so because this is pulse a tile and it's acute and the amount of insulin it's not like 20 I use it's something like one or two I use so the patient comes in fasted and you give them just a little bit and that's facilitating mostly facilitating glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle so making it less available for the tumor right and that creates its scenario where you produce severe what would typically be fatal hypoglycemia and you could deliver ketones you know as an insurance and and also deliver some of these agents that would you'd probably dramatically sensitize that tumor tissue to the other modalities and and I know so I mean what I didn't talk about when I did this seven day fast like years ago I brought my glucose levels down really low and I got to a glucose ketone index of one or maybe even a little bit lower than one so you were about what three to four on each of them yeah well my ketones were about four five and my glucose got down to three so that was the lowest I ever like captured and that was just a seven day fast yeah after seven day you know after a bris walk at the end so I never got like ketone seven or a like I got it like four you know after like a long fast but then I did inspired by the k-hill study I used various strategies to bring my glucose level down you know pharmacological strategies and I did it slowly and just do me a favor dumb I really would be kind of pissed off if you like off to yourself doing dumb shit because I think the world kind of needs you to stick around so yeah see if you can just maybe get an IRB to do this in the mice or something yeah anything that would break my heart more than getting a call from your wife saying yeah dumb died of some freak hypoglycemic crazy accident what's the longest fast you've ever done well that was it and I was pretty adapted and the point I was kind of getting to that I brought my glucose down to where it was not even measurable but with exogenous ketones she's I was the meter didn't even read it so that to me and I did that years ago that motivated me more to basically focus on this area of research as sort of like my life research because it validated to me that this should not be happening and the ketones are an alternative energy source that can be utilized in these metabolic based therapies that can be game changers for for and we also study glucose transporter type 1 deficiency center which is the inability and people who have let one D don't get cancer to my knowledge I've talked to the doctors and they've never came across anyone with glucose transporter so that's kind of motivating too that you can carry a therapy for that that could sort of be a magic well what's interesting is this is sort of in many ways old school science right where scientists would begin by sort of experimenting on themselves identifying unnatural or extreme physiologic conditions that are not predicted by the current understanding and then that sort of provokes further investigation remind me again at the end of that seven day fast how much did you deadlift yeah I did 500 pounds for 10 and then I did sort of a one rapper at the end was six plates or a 585 but that's below my you know normal but it was it was amazing to me that you know I didn't want to push my body too hard but it was amazing that that amount of fasting does not really impact your how much of a verdict so what was your max at that time at that time what was tinkering around with like you know ketogenic diet and fasting a lot but within a year of that time I forget it was before after I did 675 for 5 and maybe 5 I did 555 for an 8 to 10 so so I did you know an extra plate for 8 to 10 but I went into this basically I felt like it did more I could have done more but I just wanted to stop I didn't want to hurt myself because I knew I was pushing the at that point and I didn't get sore at all so I did that and it wasn't like my body was broken down and sort of in a depleted state where I was wasted the next day I felt I didn't even have to recover from that like I had no lower back soreness the next day after that so I probably was like I probably could have not heavier but it was just validation to me that if you're in a keto adapted state your body is very resilient and from a military standpoint too which we work pretty closely with the military I'm trying to sort of get them to understand this idea that if you are fat and keto adapted and your faced and all steer conditions with limited food availability you could maintain your physical and cognitive resilience in those conditions which is pretty clear to me I was pretty much obsessed with eating like 6 meal a day for many years and it was very liberating not to have to do that now and I'm amazed at how little I can eat once you're a keto adapted and maintain you know your your size and your strength I'm not trying to be big anymore anything or try to do any records in the gym but it's amazing how easy it is to maintain once your body is adapted. You've been so generous with your time I want to sort of let you get on your way and you've got a long drive potentially tonight but I want to ask you a question or a couple maybe what do you believe today to be true that five years ago you did not believe to be true let's keep it within the purview of your ketogenic life what today do you think things that really I would say when I got into this field I was really fascinated and immersed in this idea as ketones as an alternative energy source so is even like space food you know we're still working on that front but then over the last five years the observation that beta hydroxybuter 8 is a powerful andogenous metabolite that's also a signaling molecule through its H-dak activity histone deacetylase. More recently we've been working with an organization that the name of the organization is called All Things Kabuki so there's a there's a rare genetic disease called Kabuki syndrome which is a gene defect in the K-M-T-2-D which is essentially an acetylase enzyme and a defect in that gene or that protein creates an imbalance between gene expression and gene repression right and in the mouse model of Kabuki syndrome two things have worked in this mouse model one is a histone deacetylase inhibitor H-dak inhibitor called AR42 which restores neurons in the dentate gyros and kind of silences the pathological features in this mouse model and another thing is nutritional ketosis so nutritional ketosis functioning as a histone deacetylase inhibitor basically salvages or rescues the phenotype of this and circumvents this gene mutation the K-M-T-2-D mutation the animals have a normal neuronal density and the dentate gyros and even from a behavioral characteristic and enhances sort of a learning and memory so this idea that an endogenous metabolite can epigenetically sort of control gene transcription so I believe it's probably not unique to beta hydroxybutary I think metabolites we know that's true for acetylcoe and other things are epigenetic drivers and I think they are really they call the shots so you can even take a step back and say the mitochondria kind of call the shots too right because I think mitochondrial health the mitochondrial vitality would be the ultimate tumor suppressor so if the bio-energetica capacity of a cell in tissues are maintained to a high degree that bio-energetica efficiency is going to preserve genome stability and be far less likely to trigger oncogenes at the level of the DNA so when it comes to something like kabuki syndrome you have a persistent molecular genetic pathology that's silenced by the elevation of beta hydroxybutary functioning in a more volent-inpendant way yeah through their it's H stack activity so that to me is like mind-blowing and I think that's the direction kind of our lab is going into now I'm always fascinating with developing alternative energy substrates and alternative fuels as a form of nutrition for tactical applications, space applications maybe but this idea that you could develop an even engineer nutrition to have powerful effects on gene transcription and epigenetic regulation is something I would have never predicted that's an amazing answer actually because I know that was probably a little hard for some people to follow so which you're basically saying is look five years ago you were completely intrigued and blown away by the metabolic properties of these key tons primarily as an alternative energy source and with that comes a lot of interesting stuff we've talked about but at this H-dack pathway this inhibition of something that can result in epigenetic change or activation of in this case you can basically take a germline acquired mutation and silenced it with an epigenetic overlay that seems to be signaled by something as simple as key and Dr. Verdon at the Buck Institute has spoken quite a bit about this as well I mean this really is one of those moments where you think holy cow we are really at the just at the cusp of learning about this stuff and if there's one reason to make sure we don't off ourselves with self-experiments it's to make sure we can stick around long enough to do this done working people follow you socially and then maybe more importantly see what you're doing from a research perspective sure so the site I maintain for informational purposes it would be ketonutrition.org that's a dot org not dot com and on that website I have a list of you know podcast there's nutrition consultants resources like the Charlie Foundation which is an incredible resource that I've helped them do some educational work and gym Abrams of the Charlie Foundation it's really created an amazing resource there I have a blog and we test various ketones supplements ketogenic foods I'm self-experimenting and I've collected a lot of data and we'll be putting some of that data in the blog so I think that would be sort of like the one stop shop website for anyone interested in hearing more about what I talked about I'd also like to mention that our lab in collaboration with Epigenics Foundation is sponsoring the metabolic health summit that's occurring in January 30th to February 3rd in Long Beach, California and it's going to have an amazing array of basic scientists for example like Luke Cantley will be there be a keynote speaker Thomas Saferid there's going to be clinicians there influencers there and a lot of entrepreneurial people will be there representing companies that are really changing the shape of this industry so I'm very interested in technologies and foods and supplements that can make nutritional ketosis accessible for people that want to use it not only therapeutically for metabolic management of a disorder but maybe also for prevention or longevity or just as a lifestyle so you're going to find there's something for everybody at the metabolic help summit from basic science will be sort of what our lab is focused on but from clinical application to moving the science into human applications is really the theme of that and can people register for that already yes I think you can go to the website and register if you want to be a sponsor I think you can sort of download the sponsorship package there's going to be a lot of high profile representation there that would bring sort of more awareness and more reach to your product if you have a product there so we're looking for sponsors and I think we've nailed down most of our speakers but if you're interested in speaking to it might be good to contact us through the website. Donna and on Twitter you're pretty active what's your handle? Yeah before I realize how important is to have a handle you can remember it's Dominic, a Degosity 2. Well linked to it. Yeah yeah linked to it it's not the easiest to remember and also Facebook I'm fairly active Dominic, Degosity 1 I think that's my handle on Facebook too so I kind of cross post on each and try to use Instagram a little bit more because they tell me I got to use it more but not too active on that but. Alright well we'll make sure we link through all of those things I want to thank you again I owe a lot of what I know in this space to you and I can say the same thank you yeah. Well I credit my blog. It's been a great resource for many. You are arguably one of the most generous people I've ever met when it comes to his insights, Dom I don't know that you get enough credit for not only the work you've done but for how much work you do behind the scenes as far as sharing your knowledge with people I'll just share one very quick anecdote personally one of my best friends from medical school. His wife has breast cancer and you know without any hesitation you were more than happy to speak with them about some of these things that they could do above and beyond what was she was already doing which was participating in a clinical trial where by the way she is the only woman to still be alive in this clinical trial so the trial has closed that agent will likely not be approved though she will have a compassionate exemption but you know she is someone who has been on a ketogenic diet now for six years and has and remains incredibly indebted to the work that you've done and her oncologist and Boston sort of amaze that she's alive. That's all. Interestingly next year Lou can't Lee will be explaining a very plausible mechanism for why she is still alive. It's a paper that I'm sure you're aware of that was just approved and will be out in nature very soon. Anyway I could sit here and spend another hour thanking you for everything but I know nobody really wants to hear that so I'll I'll be quick about it and just tell you again that Dom you're an amazing guy you really are one of those people that I think fits in the category of just being kind of a treasure and so on behalf of many people I want to thank you. And thank you thank you for giving me this platform I know you're podcasts will be an amazing resource for so many people it always great to catch up with you it always very stimulating and in so many ways thank you Peter for having me appreciate.

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top-performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. This podcast, I'll be speaking with my good friend, DA Wallek. I've known DA for maybe five years now, maybe four I can't recall, but he is truly a Renaissance man. I have been accused of being a Renaissance man on occasion, but I am not. DA however is, and if you look up Renaissance Man in the dictionary, I think you'll just see his picture with his curly hair sitting there. He is a recording artist, a songwriter, an investor, an essayist. He was discovered while I undergrad at Harvard by Farell, among others who signed him to a deal. He went on to become one half of the band, Chester French. They released three full-length albums, and he also has a solo album called Time Machine, which was released in 2016. We'll link to all of that stuff. Well with Chester French, they toured with a number of legendary bands and artists such as Lady Gaga, Weezer, and perhaps my favorite of them all, Blink 182. Beyond music, however, DA's sort of in a class of his own in terms of his intellectual curiosity and his ability to assimilate information that seems so far outside of his area of expertise. In fact, some of the most interesting discussions I remember ever having with DA is sort of what prompted this podcast. I remember one day he came over, he was passing through San Diego, on his way down from LA, came by, and we were sitting out at a park on the swings, having a discussion about liquid biopsies. And I was thinking to myself, how is it that I'm sitting here with this guy, my body, whose a musician, and a very good investor, having this discussion about liquid biopsies at a level of detail, but I don't get to have with pretty much anybody else outside of people who are knee deep in this field. And that was sort of when it clicked in my mind. I was like, you know, DA would be a great guy to have on the podcast. He's advised a number of startup companies, including SpaceX, Dr. On Demand, Ripple, Emulate. And of course, he was an artist and residents of Spotify, and we talked actually quite a bit about Spotify on this episode, for anyone who's kind of interested in how it came to be. The other things that we talk about, of course, is his background in music and his start. My daughter is a great drummer for a little kid, and I've always been interested in how one can continue to encourage kids to be involved in music. And we talk about some fun times that we've had when he's been over and that's jammed with her. We talk a lot about cancer screening, which anybody who's kind of ever heard me talk about this stuff privately. I really think that when it comes to the major metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease and the other arthritis, the sporadic diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, the big tool that is really missing is these liquid biopsies. By the time cancer becomes visible on an imaging study, you can make the case you've lost the war. I don't know that that's true, but I do believe that if we can catch these things when they are not yet fully determined to be cancers based on either looking at a DNA signature and RNA signature, even a protein signature, that we might have a shot. We also get into some really kind of nerdy stuff that I think is very important for anybody thinking about screening, such as positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. We'll link to some information here that we use internally in our practice to help patients navigate that. If you're interested in music, if you're interested in liquid biopsies, cancer prevention, general cancer screening, and just interested in listening to a really smart dude who seems to know a lot about a lot of things and can speak very articulately about them. I think you'll really enjoy this podcast. We'll be able to find the show notes for this, that Peter at tia md.com forward slash podcast and we'll link to a lot of the stuff that we talk about that will hopefully allow those of you who are interested to follow up and learn a little bit more. So without further delay, here's my conversation with the amazing DA wallet. DA Peter, thanks for having me over to your lovely place. You're welcome. You're welcome here anytime. I like how you saw that I was in the driveway before I got here and I was kind of just hanging out. Well, we have this thing called the door bird, which is kind of the evolved version of a ring. And you since you're interested in all esoteric technical things would be interested to know that this is the only web enabled cloud recording doorbell system that can hook into a electric strike, a strike being the thing that opens a gate remotely. And so I'm able to see who rings the doorbell and then if I want to let them in press a button from the same app that opens the gate. Remarkable technology. Yes. Technology is LEDG would say. Yes. So we have known each other. I don't even remember how we met. I think we met through Gary Tobs. We met through Gary Tobs and I met Gary Tobs because I called emailed him, which is how most things started my life. Yes. And I called emailed him because I became sort of obsessed with obesity and nutrition research. This was maybe six years ago or there about six, seven years ago. And then I had gotten coffee with Gary up in Berkeley and he thought it would be worth our meeting. And now I talk to you more than I talk to Gary. Yeah. No, it became a, it was a love at first sight actually. And you know, one thing that's really funny, we're going to talk so much about sort of your musical career and things like that. But I will forever be grateful to the one night that you and Adam were over for dinner. This was just after my daughter Olivia started to play the drums. And you guys got up, Adam's played the piano, you played the drums, Olivia then played the drums. And it was really exciting to see, she got to see an action, what like improvised music can look like. And I really think that that's part of the reason she still loves the drums. Well, that's good. I mean, part of the drums that's fun is that you don't necessarily need to know the musical material as well as other instrumentalists do in order to play along with people. You know, you don't need to sort of learn the song. You can kind of, as long as you can learn the beat of the song or figure it out quickly, you can play, which is as someone who doesn't necessarily love practicing something that's always drawn me to drums. And I remember her teacher when she was five and I started saying, you know, it's really really hard because the music's really hard to read. So the only shot she'll have it starting this young is if she sort of has an intuitive feel for the music. In which case, she can get by on that until she learns to actually figure out that, you know, two, six, Dean's is actually an eighth and that kind of stuff. Right. That's good point. And I think the best way to learn instruments or to learn music in general is kind of to start without any framework, play around and explore yourself and then learn a little theory because what you don't want to do is become imprisoned by theory. But it does answer some important questions that you'll arrive at if you allow yourself to get lost in the first place. And so I've always said that, you know, when we have kids, my vision for piano training would be you just have to sit there for half an hour every day and you can do whatever you want. You don't have to touch the piano if you don't want. But of course, anyone sitting at a piano for 30 minutes will and you can figure out how it works. And then theory, if you have spent tens of hours messing around is like an amazing gift because it goes, okay, well, that makes sense. That's how it works. It's just like if you were trying to reinvent mathematics with no orientation. Like Ramonusion. Yes, like Ramonusion, which, you know, I'm not. You're almost a Ramonusion of music. I wish. So speaking of which, how did you, how did you get started in music? Were you always musicals a child, were you playing instruments when you were young? I don't think I was particularly musical. I always liked listening to music and my dad would take me to jazz shows occasionally when I was young, which sort of infected me with an interest in jazz. The first instrument I tried playing was the saxophone because I thought it looked cool. And I remember we rented one. This was in the middle school band. So it might have been fifth grade. This would have been all to sax or a tenor. I don't even remember. And in any event we rented it, I brought it home and I tried to learn how to just make a sound with it, which is not trivial because with a read, you have to purse your lips in a particular way in all this. And I was so frustrated in the first hour of trying to play the saxophone that I gave up and became a drummer. And then played drums throughout middle school and high school. And I had sort of bands with high school friends and that sort of thing. And then in college became a singer, which was something I had never done. Oh, so I didn't realize that you had never sung until you got to college. I had never sung and I met some cool guys in the dining room at my college. And then they said, you want to try out for this band, we're thinking about starting and I said, sure. And I tried out as the drummer, but I got beaten by my friend Damien, who then became our drummer. And as a consolation prize, they asked me if I wanted to be the singer. And I said, well, I've never sung before, but I'll try. And I've been trying ever since. So I didn't realize that. So you went into what became Chester French as the drummer. Trying to be the drummer. And then Damien, who became the drummer later quit and became a filmmaker. And as now one, like 10 Academy Awards, he did Whiplash. And then he did La La Land, which I have a small cameo in. But Whiplash, if you've seen it, is about a drummer and he's somewhat autobiographical about Damien. Oh, I didn't realize. I mean, Whiplash is there's only probably five movies I have stored on my iPad. Because they take up a lot of room, right? But the five that I have are such that if I'm on an airplane and everything goes to how on a hand basket and the Wi-Fi is broken and I don't feel like doing work, and Whiplash is one of those five. Which means it's a movie I've seen more times than I can count, but I especially like the last scene. Well, it's a high-octane movie. I mean, it's about human performance, basically. So I get what you like it. It is unbelievable. Yeah. But I had no idea about this notion that it was not just purely fictional. But there was some autobiographical component to it. A little bit. I don't think there was anyone as sinister and Damien's life as the teacher in the movie, but Damien, both as a drummer and now as a filmmaker, is incredibly self-critical and hard-working and perfectionistic. And so I think those elements are definitely a reflection of his personality. I'm always amazed when you look back, it's sort of the Annel's Iraq and Roll. How many musicians didn't come into it as singer? So for example, I remember hearing about Bob Dylan and Jimmy Hendrix and people who really never thought of it as their voice was what was going to do things. And yet we still think of them as completely iconic. Can anybody learn to sing? I don't know if anyone can learn to sing. I mean, you need a certain amount of physical instrumentation that you just can't escape. I mean, so there's things I wish I could do with my voice that I'll never be able to do, just like I wish I could dunk a basketball. That being said, I think there's probably an enormous range of refinement that can be pursued because I started as a pretty bad singer and I think it'd become an okay singer. And a lot of that, just like any physical activity is about learning how to mentally control a part of your body to get it to do what you want it to do. It's just that controlling your vocal folds and the way that you express air is a relatively fine-tuned set of physical processes. And so the sort of detailed control that you need to physically command over your anatomy is kind of difficult to obtain. But I became a much, much better singer. I think the thing that is probably more natural that you either have or you don't have is an ability to know when you're making a noise, whether it is on pitch. And some people clearly don't have this, but I think most people have a decent sense of pitch. And if they didn't, then they wouldn't be pleased by harmonious music. I mean, we have a natural ability to hear whether someone's hitting a sour note in a chord or something or whether someone's singing off tune. That bothers most of us. So if you can be bothered by that, then chances are you can hear the difference between that and the right thing. And that's what a lot of it comes down to. When you're singing, it's very important that you hear yourself because that's the feedback loop. Yeah. So do you remember the first time you sang on stage in front of people besides your bandmates? Well, it would have been a fresh manure in college and we began by doing sort of weekly performances in the student commons at Harvard. And the audience was 20 or 30 of our friends. And the band always had a sense of humor to the music, although that trailed off in our final album, which was not really funny. But earlier we had always kind of been humorous at some level. And I think that masked how poor my music and ship was for a long time because we could kind of play it off as a bit of a joke band. So sort of like bear naked ladies, like what was it? Not that they were a joke band, but you know what they were always having fun. They were silly. We were irreverent and somewhat subversive in the notion that what we did was meant to almost be ironic. So we would do songs about medieval nights. We would do totally absurdist music. And I think totally possible to hear it and either think that it was self-consciously funny or to think that it was totally clueless. And so that made it easier to sort of cut the tension a little bit and break the ice or so to speak, you know, that it wasn't like you were scared to death getting up there. For me, like if you said to me, Peter, you have to either go and climb Mount Everest or K2. And there's, you know, like a 30% chance you're going to die, or you have to sing in front of a thousand people. I'm tracking. Like I'm gone to the mountain. Like the thought of actually singing in front of any human being, like including people, like my kids, like there's no way I'm singing. Yeah, I don't know why there is some sense of shame that a tense singing. I mean, I know what you're saying. I don't feel it, but I wish I could. I mean, like part of it is, I think realizing that singing is just musical speaking. So we're really singing all the time when we're talking. We're just not using tonality and as deliberate away. I mean, there's a pitch to every time you speak. So singing is just controlling that pitch, which is actually a helpful thing that I learned from vocal coaches who, when I went to go touring, I went to see literally because it became more of a sport for me. It was now something that I was going to have to do for an hour to every day. And I didn't have the physical endurance and the muscle control to endure that without hurting myself. So I would go to some coaches to sort of get ready to tour. And they would make this point that singing is just musical speaking. And it really changed the way I thought about singing and made it quite a bit easier. So let's talk to the transitions. You guys start this band. Tell me about the name Chester French. Where did it come from? Chester French was the name of a sculptor Daniel Chester French who did the Lincoln Memorial. And then he also did the John Harvard statue, which is in the center of Harvard's main quad. And we didn't know that when we chose the name, but we had a dining hall there that all freshman eight and that sort of looks like the Hogwarts dining hall in Harry Potter. Big wood paneled room with soaring ceilings and busts all around the wall. So we were going into lunch and we saw one of these busts and it had a little plaque under it that was we thought the name of the person who had been sculpted. And so he said, oh Chester French, that's kind of a cool name. And we picked it then and there. And then we later of course learned that that was the sculptor of not only that bust, but also these other great American sculptures. Got it. So when did you guys start to get some traction? And I mean, because most college bands don't end up going on tour. So what was that transition like? We basically got no traction doing what we initially set out to do, which was to build a live performance following. So the conventional wisdom, if you started a band on the East Coast in college, which a lot of people did actually, they were musicians, was start playing on your campus, start playing at surrounding campus, parties and sorority, caggers and whatever. And then ultimately get a van and start driving around the East Coast and going to other colleges. And you can build a following among college students. And we tried to do this, but we just totally ate shit. I mean, we could barely get people to come to our shows on campus. And then we, I remember booked a gig at a club called Great Scott in Boston, which was kind of the, or Harper's Ferry was the, was the specific one that I'm thinking of here. Great Scott was another club. We booked a show at this Harper's Ferry. And we both tried to recruit our friends from campus to, to make a 10 minute journey to this club. I think three of them came. And then we also for the three nights prior to the show went and stood on the street in front of the club, figuring that people who lived in the area probably walked by the club. Or people who went to the club might come and see multiple shows, handing out flyers, trying to promote ourselves. And when we got there to do the gig on a Thursday night or something, I think there was an audience of like five or seven people. And you know, that's particularly depressing when you've spent two and a half hours setting up and sound checking and hauling all your gear. So anyways, that strategy failed. I'm not sure why. Maybe we just weren't good live or something. But we took a turn at the end of sophomore year in strategy. And our focus became just making recordings. And the thought was ultimately the product is a recorded music product. That's what we're really making. We're songwriters and we're producers. And so our focus shifted to essentially just living in the recording studio, making stuff. And the idea became let's try and make an album that we think is a great, complete representation of our musical ideas. And if we do that and it's really good, it will speak for itself. And no one in the record industry will care whether we have this big live following or not. Luckily that turned out to work. I mean, it was not certain by any means. But we made this record over the subsequent two and a half years. And then in the middle of senior year, started sending out that album to as many people as we could send it out to. And ultimately, it got to Kanye West, who gave us our big break and flew us out to Los Angeles and offered us a record deal. And then that spurred a number of other people attempting to sign us to record deals. We ultimately chose to work with Farrell and did a deal with him in a guy named Jimmy Ivene who ran interscope records. And as soon as we graduated, we moved out to LA and that became our career. I mean, just put that in context from him. But that strikes me as like a fairy tale, right? I mean, what's the probability that Kanye West, I mean, how many times is he getting something pitched and having to pick a knee, a lot of a haystack? Is that how that works? I think it was a little typical that other artists supported us. And now that I'm sort of not doing music full time in a ratrice back to when I look at the bands career, it's kind of cleared to me that we were an artist's artist. In other words, our fans tended to be people who were quite musical, whether they were famous musicians or whether they were just random people who played guitar at home. But we were making a style of music that I think spoke to musicians specifically. Part of that was the result of trying to make music that we wanted to listen to. And so we were our own customer in a kind of weird way. So it certainly wasn't typical that other artists would be the ones to jump start our career. On the other hand, it was at a time when the music industry was changing. And so all of the paradigms by which artists got discovered were being destabilized. There used to be these armies of ANR people who worked at record companies and they went to concerts and scouted. And what was changing when we came on to the scene was that the internet was becoming the primary distribution channel for music and also the primary place where people discovered new artists. This is what like 2003-07. 2007, okay. And so Facebook was a couple years old. My space was kind of at its height. And we were one of the first artists to primarily build our audience online. So that was unique. It was Facebook a better channel for that than say having your own site that you're hosting, like how, how were you? Facebook was and remains a bad channel for that. But my space was an amazing channel for that. And my space had all of these features that allowed culture to kind of virally permeate civilizations. So tell me what my space did better than Facebook with respect to that or what it enabled. Well there were, let's say, two or three distinctive things about it. The first was that it essentially was a place where spam was totally legal and standardized. And so it was kind of like my space felt almost like time square in the 80s or something. You know, it was like a little unsavory. There were all these weird people on there. People had avatars so you didn't know if it was really them or not. Identity had not been formalized in the way that Facebook ultimately made it. So on the one hand, you could spam people. So for us, we could go on there and just randomly send our music to random people who we thought might like it. That was highly useful. The second thing was that they had this thing top eight. So on everyone's my space page, you could pick your top eight friends. And that became kind of like a prize to be one of the top eight of a famous person or one of the top eight of a famous band or something. And so you could kind of go on my space and try and find artists who you thought would share an audience or whose audience you wanted to steal. Essentially, it's not stealing because it's not a zero-sum thing. People can like a lot of artists. But we would identify these artists who we wanted to steal the fans of and then we try and get our music to them to get in their top eight. Because then tons of people would discover you. And then the third thing was that my space allowed each user an incredible amount of freedom in designing their page. So you could go in and change the HTML or the CSS on your my space page. And this from a user experience standpoint made it a very difficult place to navigate. But I think what it brought out was that everybody, when you give them a creative canvas, likes to paint on it. And what you saw was that ordinary people who were just my space users, consumers of content, themselves would really wear their identity on their page. And so you could kind of navigate this universe of my space and understand the cultural orientation of every person on it. And it made it really easy to figure out who were your people. You know, I mean, if you were like a Goth band or some of them are a metal band, it was very clear who the metal people were. And so for us, we could really take advantage of this and kind of hack the system to find our people quickly. I don't want to go to down the rabbit hole on this, but it's so interesting because I've never haven't thought about my space in probably 10 years or something like that. When the history books written and it can probably be written now, I'm assuming, why did Facebook win my space lose at the risk of oversimplifying things? I think there are few reasons I perceive and then there are probably many I have no idea about like you just strike me as having a better sense than the average person based on a pretty robust understanding of how both of them worked. My space was even if they maybe thought they were being scientific, it was not a sort of science project. In other words, the people building it were in LA, they were kind of more inclined to understanding culture and the thinking about personal freedom and expression. Whereas what Facebook was built around was the idea that if you created an accurate map of people's real world relationships, then the behaviors that they exhibit in the real world would end up mirrored in this digital environment. So social values like trust were going to be essential in the Facebook universe, whereas in my space, like I said, it was like time square in the 80s. It was like there were CD people on there. You didn't know if people were who they said they were. It was a fake place. And the early internet was much more like that. Everyone was in chat rooms with aliases and stuff. You never really knew who was who. Facebook became a digital version of the real world. And so it was kind of more valuable from the outset because things that you only previously could do in reality, like talk to someone or share with them photos or something, became something that you could do in a highly managed way through Facebook. That's really interesting. I have never, I would have assumed just as a guy who knows nothing that Facebook won because they figured out how to monetize this stuff better than my space. But it sounds like there's much more cultural, emotional sort of philosophical differences that may have decided which direction was going to have greater massive appeal. I think that's right. And you sort of see this resuscitated in the rise of Snapchat. Because Snapchat is also kind of back to that LA mindset. It's much more expressive and irreverent and kind of culturally contextualized. It's got a lot of character and personality. It's logo is a funny ghost drawing and this sort of thing. And so I wouldn't give up yet on the idea that the future of the internet may allow people to be much more expressive than you see them being on Facebook. Facebook is a little totalitarian, not necessarily an abad. I mean, that's a word that is pretty loaded, but yeah loaded. But I'm looking for anaseptic or anodine or I don't know what the right word is, but it doesn't have a lot of flavor. It's a reflection of the engineering mindset behind it, which itself is really ingenious, but it as a digital place lacks culture. Mark Zuckerberg, who I think very highly of and who's a friend, is a genius business person and technologist, but he's never I don't think been especially interested in culture. And when he talks about Facebook being a community and a global community, I think he is potentially always, you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think he's maybe always thought that Facebook shouldn't have too much of a culture that it imposes. It should basically be a blank canvas for all of the diversity that is in the world. And when you allow people to express themselves more, it's unclear whether what you're doing is loading a place with some cultural precepts of your own, even by the intent of the way that you design what those expressive tools are. Or if you're actually giving people more freedom. And so I think Facebook has always taken the approach of limiting people's expressive capacity, forcing them to make comments or post things in these very structured linear formats, where some of these other tools have been a lot more liberal in the attitude that they take to personal expression. When you went to college, what do you study? I did African American studies and I have a minor in Kiku, which is a canyon language that I no longer speak. Were you thinking about going to grad school after? I mean, were you just pursuing your bliss? Like what were you thinking you would end up doing before you ended up in LA? Of course. I wasn't thinking much about it at all. I mean, I think I've been very interested in public policy and so politics interested me. And I think academia maybe interested me. The arts certainly did. And I think halfway through my freshman year, I decided that the goal I wanted to shoot for was becoming a musician. But part of that was a response to finding when I got to college that Harvard was essentially a vocational school for investment banking and management consulting. I never, I didn't know that those were jobs in the world. I had never heard of either of those professions. And when it became clear to me that 40 or 50% of my classmates would end up in those jobs, I was kind of horrified. And I thought, oh my gosh, is that the adult life that awaits me. And maybe as a bit of a rebellion against that, I went full bore into, I want to be a musician. That is hilarious. The vocational school for investment banking and management consulting. I didn't realize it was that high. So roughly, I don't know. But whatever, even if a third of people end up as investment bankers and management consultants, that's pretty interesting conversation. And there's anything wrong. I mean, I know you were management consultant. Yeah. But there was a sense in which I felt that my college and elite universities in general, I've mentioned it a couple times, but I'm not someone who's a big booster. I'm not involved in alumni stuff. I don't take a lot of pride, particularly in having gone to Harvard or anything. Part of why is because I'm very suspicious of these institutions, both because they essentially serve a function in the society of reproducing inequality and social hierarchy. And they've been doing that for hundreds of years. And second, because they homogenize all of these talented young people. So they do an extraordinarily good job of finding interesting unique people in high school. And then turning them into boring, high achieving technocrats. And that's kind of a tragedy for the world. Because it's a waste of the formidable resources that those universities do have that what they choose to do with it is essentially pump out functionaries in the financial services. But somewhere along the way, you learn to think. And is it safe to then assume that you learned that before college and that college of anything didn't diminish that ability? Rather than augmented it. I'll tell you where I'm going with this. And we're going to talk a lot about biology and our mutual interest in hacking and life's been on all that sort of stuff. But I remember after even the first day we met, maybe it was like after our second meeting or some time, remember thinking, How does this guy know so much about this stuff? You had more than just a superficial understanding of stuff that suggested like you'd read a couple of things about it, which obviously just suggested to me that you learned how to learn. And as a result of that, when you decided, hey, I really want to understand this area and I want to understand the science of this stuff. You at least had a toolkit that you could use to do that. Where do you think you got that? I think I maybe just always been curious. And that is a personality trait or disposition. Just wanting to understand things has always driven me to some degree. When I went to college, I was interested in race and the history of race in America and how this set of ideas about who we are influences what the world is and who we become as people. And I was essentially interested primarily in these very complicated phenomena in the social world. So I wanted to remember the first time I read Marx and whatever. It was so engaging to discover a set of these totalizing ideas about how history works or something. You know, whether I agree with them or not, it's a separate issue. But the idea that one could theoretically describe reality was always compelling to me. And what has happened intellectually as I've gotten older is that I've realized that science is essentially the best methodology that we have for describing reality. And I've realized that I think the things that most interested me, like social phenomena, government, public policy history, are very difficult to address with the science currently at our disposal. So ultimately, I believe we will be able to have an empirical understanding of some of these sorts of things. But I was going after them back then, I evenly thinking that we already had those tools at our disposal or that I could by reading a lot about history, develop a accurate picture of how it works. And one learning how to think is about understanding the limitations of our own biology, our own cognition. But then it's also about figuring out what's knowable and how you can understand things and what processes you can use to understand things. And so when I encounter a subject, I'm instantly tracking on what's the theoretical framework behind it. The details don't really interest me. It's what's the skeleton behind it, what's the structure of it. And for that reason, I don't think, you know, I've never been good at facts. I'm not good at dates. I'm not good at memorizing names of biomolecules. But what sticks in my brain are these kind of theoretical constructs. Yeah, somebody asked me on Twitter a while ago and I decided it would be a good question for an AMA at some point, which was if you could change something about the medical school curriculum, what would it be? And I wouldn't describe it probably as eloquently as you, but it's basically, I remember the first day of medical school they said, you know, the average college graduate has a vocabulary of X words. And I don't actually remember what X is, but I feel like it was about 10,000 or something like that. And they said, you know, in the next two years, which is before you go into the clinical stuff, you're going to learn, and it was a little more than that. So if it was 10,000 was the college grad, they said, like, you'll learn 12,000 new words. And obviously, you do need to learn a new vocabulary in medicine, but when I look back at medicine or in medical school rather, I think the biggest deficit was no attention paid deliberately towards how do you think. And that of course becomes relevant because, you know, all facts have a half life and some facts like anatomical facts have very long half lives. So in an area like that, it's probably reasonable to know stuff, but another thing is like by the time you're done medical school, the information is wrong or irrelevant. And yet nothing's really put in place to teach that skill of how do you go about, you're now out there in the real world, you're taking care of patients and yet. Maybe what you learned about cholesterol or maybe what you learned about subject XYZ is kind of not right or at least should be revisited or the probability of it being correct is lower. So do you and Liz think you'll have kids? Yeah. And so how do you now I'm asking this as a curious parent, but how do you think about creating an environment to produce that type of curiosity and that skill set? What do you think a parent can do deliberately? I'm asking this based on you having been the kid not the parent so far. Well, you certainly have more experience with this because you've got kids. What I've heard people say and what I sense maybe real is that you actually don't need to teach kids this. They're born with a lot of it and what the world tends to do is squeeze it out of them. And so I guess I would invert the question and frame it as how do you not kill a child's curiosity and how do you feed it? Certainly one of the things I think my parents did was not sanction in a negative way asking questions or asking why questions. And by contrast you can inculcate a child in religious ideologies or strictures about how to live that are so imprisoning that becomes a fundamental part of their brain. And so I think just not making those mistakes is probably the most important thing. But the example you gave earlier of your piano lesson is 30 minutes of sitting in front of a piano for some period of time before you start to re-cheat music and start doing drills and things like that. I like that idea that's absolutely I mean, look, there's a balance between the sort of road discipline that is required in anything. And then the creative and exploratory potential within that area. In my mind, I tend to wait the latter. And so what's difficult for me is the brutal, repetitive skill building. And I've had to figure out ways in life of not making my success depend on that aptitude and figure, you know, that's stuff that I look to other people to help me with. And my band as an example, my partner Max is an, I mean, he's good at everything. He's a musically brilliant person at a compositional level too. I mean, he can write great music and he's very theoretical. But he also has that OCD capacity to sit there and practice guitar for 10 hours. And that's really, that's his happy place. I go crazy doing that. And so I think to come back to your question about children, I think the struggle for me will be figuring out how to impart to them a greater capacity to do the part that I don't like doing, because if you can really have both, that's the superpower. But it sounds like to me at least, maybe part of the, the secret is knowing how much emphasis to put on each of those two, again, they're not mutually exclusive, but you understand that this is a kid that if pushed too hard on the wrote stuff will actually dampen the creativity versus sounds like in Max's case, that's not the case. He can live in both of those worlds and be quite successful in. I think that's right. You know, the one metaphor I use to think about this, because a debate that comes up in all contemporary art, be it painting or writing or music, is essentially whether amateur work can be just as valid as quote unquote professional work. That punk rock, the whole idea is screw learning these instruments, I'm just going to pick up the guitar and express myself. And so, of course, there's a level of vitality that can be produced through that type of artwork, both the absence of formal rules, gives birth to a lot of expressive freedom. And you can get a kind of visceral version of someone, but there are only so many ways to smash a guitar on stage. And so if you're not a drummer as good as Jimmy Hendrix, it's a monorail. And Jimmy Hendrix can, he can still smash a guitar on stage, but he can also do a thousand other things that the remones can't do. And so the metaphor that I've been thinking of lately is almost like granularity or resolution. So, you know, if you imagine a photograph of something in low resolution versus high resolution, it's the same thing that's being expressed, but the greater the resolution, the more detail there is. And when someone is making music or singing or writing a poem or doing anything, what you're associating, and what you're getting is you're getting sort of a photo of their brain. And the more technical skill they have in this metaphor, the greater the resolution of that picture they can produce. And so I once remember being in the studio with Feral and her B-Hankock came by. And Feral is a kind of folk musician. I mean, he's incredibly successful and he's very very talented, but he's not a trained, he didn't go to music conservatory. He can't play you a box and not a, he can write amazing stuff. He's a theoretical musician, right? He's a great songwriter, and he's got great taste. And her B-Hankock came and he was showing us a bunch of piano exercises that he and his friends used to do in Chicago in the 60s. And Feral kind of expressed that he was scared to learn that stuff because he was worried it would eat into his roughness or his authentic expression. And I remember her B-Hankock saying, it's just going to give you more colors to paint with. It doesn't cost you anything. It just gives you more things that you can say with those ideas you've got. And I thought that was a great argument. You know, I think it was convincing to Feral too. When you were in high school, who do you in retrospect look back at and say, you know, those were really those musicians shaped my, either my taste or my philosophy or my way of writing or performing like who just broadly speaking who were your influences in that regard. There are a little bit mundane, but there's sort of the obvious suspects, the Beatles, Bob Marley, Curtis Mayfield, those are the big ones. Steven Wonder, maybe those four, Motown, you know, all the, all the Hollandos are Holland were the three great songwriters. He did a lot of the Motown stuff, a lot of the four top songs, the temptations songs. Any James Brown? Yeah, I like James Brown, but I would put, I'm more of a songwriter and James Brown, I think, is most important as both a performer and as a groove guy. So, you know, different music is good at different things. And there's a tradition in black American music that I think ultimately begins in Africa and in the African diaspora of music that is not really linear. It's not about a narrative story being told through something like a song. It's much more about setting a musical mood and almost being a place that you hang out in the music is also like this if you think about Indian Raga's, for example, it's sort of a tonal place and the piece of music may be half an hour long, it may be two hours long, but you kind of go there and you're just hanging out there in that vibe. Whereas the sort of music that influenced me much more that I've sort of work in is more about, it's again, it's kind of more theoretical, it's more about a story. It's a linear story, it's a three minute song, there's a beginning of middle and an end. It has some conventions about the way that it moves through those places and people I cited, I think, are emblematic of that style. Now, you're a drummer, so what drummer would you have identified with most? I'm sort of now going to double back on what I just said because the key function of the drums is most highly expressed in those types of music that are essentially groove music. So, Clyde Stubblefield who played with James Brown is one of my favorite drummers of all time. That style of music that James Brown made is all about the drummer, give the drummer some. And other people who are, you know, giants of that format are Bernard Perti, who's just, he's still still around and he's incredible. I think he claims he's the most recorded drummer of all time or has maybe played on the most hits of any drummer of all time. And, you know, then there are great rock drummers like Keith Moon or John Bonham. In jazz, the drums are much more of an instrument. You can sing through the drums in jazz music because the drummer is not just hitting hard and fast and loud. The drummer has an incredible dynamic range of tonalities and expressive options. So, in jazz drumming, you know, Elvin Jones is probably my favorite who played a lot with John Coltrane, but there are an almost unlimited number of incredible jazz drummers who I look up to. I think in the show notes for this podcast, we should link to some performances that you find particularly notable. I remember once you gave me a nice list of stuff for Olivia, which was like, here's some great Michael Jackson songs, here's some great James Brown songs, here's some great Boom Boom Boom and it was like, this is a great way for a kid to start thinking about music. That's such a helpful thing to provide. So, okay, let's go back to Elis. You get to Elis, you're living the dream, right? Like it's you've hit a home run here. It's hard to imagine, given what the denominator is on the number of people that are trying to accomplish what you guys have accomplished. And, are you primarily now still a studio band or are you, once you've got this break, are you becoming kind of more performance based as well? Well, by that time the band was just me and my bandmate Max, so it was a duo, really. And we, as we made music, were a studio thing still, but we quickly realized. And you were playing what, so you were doing vocals, you were doing drums, and were you keyboard as well? No, I was primarily writing the songs with Max and singing them. And Max in the band was the primary instrumentalist. He can play pretty much everything. And he can learn new instruments in a week. So, Max on the recordings was playing almost all the instruments. Occasionally we would have studio musicians come in and do stuff that he couldn't do. You know, if we needed a viola player or something. But my function in the band was largely to write the songs with him. I was writing all the lyrics. I was typically writing the vocal melodies of the songs. And then singing them. So how did Spotify come into the picture? Was that true true and unrelated? Was that just a did Sean start that or how did that? No, so let's fast forward a few years. So we basically, because there's, there's not a lot I think that is super interesting about this period in my life, although you may disagree with. I don't know if you're hearing of your life, it's not interesting. This is 2007. We get our record deal. We move out here. And then we spent three years making records in touring. And a lot of stuff happened in the previous. We went to a link at one point, right? We toured with all sorts of people. Lady Gaga, Blink 182, Weezer, huge number of really cool artists. And then I concluded that I didn't like touring. And it was around that time that I discovered Spotify. I think at the time I already had an interest in investing, but I didn't really know which direction to go. I had met Ashden Kutcher, who became a really good friend. And he and I got along. I think right away, because we were both from the Midwest, we were both artists. And we both had an interest in business and technology. But he was a decade ahead of me in terms of being a famous entertainer. And he was three or four years ahead of me in terms of thinking that Silicon Valley venture capital could be an interesting canvas for his artwork. And so he gave me a little bit of a template for an artist who was going to get into the technology business. And the question became, for me, how do I go from being a musician who neither has capital nor investing experience and become a professional investor? And Spotify ended up being in retrospect to the pivot that allowed me to do that. You know, historically the music industry has not birthed many good businesses. And so it was a pretty happy accident that right at this time that I wanted to make this transition, this company that would become now a $28 billion public market behemoth was starting to become ubiquitous in Sweden. And I had friends who knew about it. And when they told me about it, the appeal of that product, of this idea that you could install a thing on your computer and have all of the world songs ever at your instant recall was an incredibly cool thing to me. I was just thinking of it as the customer basically. You know, I was someone who collected tons of music had hard drives full of it was always struggling to manage the data. You know, I'd get a new computer now I have to copy all the songs and I have to put them in folders and I it was such a pain in the ass that when someone showed me this I thought, whoa, this is what I've always wanted. And it was Pandora on the scene at that time. Pandora was really popular and it was just streaming. But it was streaming algorithmic radio. Right. In other words, you couldn't choose the song. What was so cool about Spotify was that it recreated the experience of having bought every song ever. You had MP3s that you buy through the iTunes store, for example, and they'd be on your computer, but maybe you'd bought 200 of them. That was your library of music. Whereas when I first saw Spotify, I thought, wow, for $10 a month, it says, if I bought everything ever. I mean, that was such a shocking value proposition to me that I thought this is almost certainly what everyone should have if the powers that be allow it. And the business question, which was much more difficult than the product design question, was can this company get everyone who owns music to be a part of delivering this experience to the consumer? And so was the hardest sell with the artists or with the studios? And the thing was a hard sell. Spotify was, I'm not going to take much credit for it because there were thousands of people working on this from the beginning almost, but everything about building that business was difficult. The first thing it was difficult was that record companies and music publishing companies own the rights to the music. And they had seen their business destroyed in the 90s. The record industry went to a quarter of its former size in the 90s because of piracy. And so you'll remember the record labels were suing in the 90s. Is that because the customer CDs had become so ubiquitous that it was easier to copy a CD than say a vinyl or a cassette. I mean, not that it's not hard to copy a cassette, but the quality is not as good. What was coincidental with CD-ROMs? So two things happened. One, sites like Napster arose that allowed people to trade music freely without paying for it. And then what they did with that music after they traded it on the internet, which was so difficult to control or put a lid on, was then they would burn CDs and copy the CDs and whatever. Not only did the format of CDs get unlocked with the ability to write CDs. I mean, you remember getting your first CD-R. That was really cool. But also, you had this unfettered digital environment in which people could share music without anyone getting paid for it. What preceded this in the 80s and 90s, really in the 90s, was the CD revolution. And so not only was piracy painful in its own right, it succeeded a decade during which the music companies resold the entire history of music in a 10 year period. In other words, they not only sold in the 90s on CDs, the new music that was being made in the 90s. But everything that had been made today. So they sold you an entire library of the world's history of music in a 10 year period. They were rolling in cash. And when they made new music, they would sign an artist, they'd make one hit song that they'd play on the radio. And then you had to go buy an 1899 album with 14 other songs you didn't want just to get the one you liked. So they were raken in the cash by completely controlling the consumer's experience. Piracy blew the lid off that and the consumers were bald and everyone stopped paying for music. And so the industry that Spotify came into was one that had been eviscerated by piracy. And then to add insult to injury, the legal paid download model that Steve Jobs pioneered with iTunes, Unil laterally recaptured the distribution system of what before then had been fragmented. So the record labels used to in the good old days of the 90s both control the radio stations. So they could make things get popular. But then they had a variety of physical retailers, Sam Goodie, Vergin Mega Store, all these different CD retailers that they could play off each other. They had all the leverage. They could make the thing big and then they could tell you at the record store that you had to give them this promotion or else your artist wasn't going to show up there into a CD signing. Well, when Steve Jobs invented the iTunes store, he became the only retailer that mattered. And so the record labels had this one-two punch they'd been subjected to of the industry disappearing and going to a quarter of its size. And then this one guy who didn't need them, Steve Jobs who made all his money selling hardware, gaining total unilateral control over them because he became the only place they could sell music. And so they were desperate, never to let either of these sorts of things happen to them again. They were incredibly paranoid about a new model that they viewed as threatening the paid download business. So Spotify was showing up telling consumers for 10 bucks a month, you get all the music ever. The labels at that point were still embedded in a model where what you did was you sold people downloads for a dollar a piece. They were used to selling you 10 songs a month for $10. And Spotify came along and said, let's give them 22 million songs for $10. So selling the record labels was incredibly difficult. And then the artists were ardently against this as well because for them, their lifeblood was selling downloads. They too were in an environment that was severely nutrition restricted from the past decade. And they were struggling to make money. Most of them were only making money touring and recovering a little bit of income selling their recordings. Spotify came along and what we said was, we're going to fix this problem. We're going to convince most people in the world that they should pay for music. And the way we're going to do it is we're going to give them an experience that is every bit as good as the free illegal experience. And we're going to get them hooked on it. And then we're going to charge them 10 bucks a month. And if we can get a huge percentage of them paying 10 bucks a month, that is far more than the average consumer at that time was currently spending on music. I still don't understand the economics of Spotify. So if you're spending that 10 and by the way, I couldn't just sign up for 10 bucks a month today. Could I, isn't those of you who aren't 10 bucks a month? I thought that was like a student deal or some you can sign up for $3 a month for the first three months today. And then it'll go to $10 a month. I'm ashamed to say I still don't use Spotify. I still add to iTunes. You got to get on there. And I don't know if it's just like the hurdle rate of switching out of iTunes. But it strikes me as ridiculous because I pay a buck 29 per song. I probably buy an average of 10 to 20 songs a month. So I'm obviously spending more money than I would. But let's just talk about the remuneration for the artist. So when I spend a buck 29 on iTunes, where does the rent go? 30% goes to Apple. 70% goes to the record label. The record label pays out roughly 10% of their 70%. So 7% to the music publisher, which owns the song note that the song, which is called publishing, is different from the recording of the song. So if you and I write happy birthday and people sing it all over the world, we own the song. No matter who's singing it. But if Tony Braxton records a version of happy birthday, she owns the recording. The song owner gets about 10% of the 70%. And the artist will typically get somewhere between 15% and 20% of what's left after their 15 or 20% cut has fully paid back the record label for all the money that label has spent promoting them. So Apple is getting a straight 30. That's pretty straightforward. Of the 70, the label is getting the majority of it. The label is getting the majority of it. And the artist is getting anywhere from zero to maybe 10% percent. Yeah. Something like that. No, that sounds grossly unfair. What makes it less obviously unfair is that the record label is the one taking all of the financial risk in financing the music and very often paying for the artist's life. So in this economy, they are still the only companies that take a financial risk making original artwork. And they certainly deserve to be paid for taking that risk. So how does it work at Spotify? So now you paid your 10 bucks a month. How is that rent spread out? Sure. So what happens is you listen to music all month. At the end of the month, Spotify looks at the amount of time that you spent listening to each of those songs. And your $10 gets split pro rada to the originators of that music. And roughly the same distribution is the 70% out of iTunes got split. Yes. How much does Spotify get to keep of the 10 bucks? 30%. Okay. So Spotify keeps 30 and the other 70 goes the same way. But now it's pro rada. Yeah. That's correct. And so for a consumer like you who maybe before Spotify was spending more than $10 a month, it results in less financial benefit than it might have before. On the other hand, depends how much you listen to those songs. So if on Spotify, if you buy the song on iTunes and you listen to it one time, you're paying a dollar 29 for one listen. But a lot of people when they fall in love with the song, they're paying to it thousands of times. And they listen to it for years. And if you take a dollar 29 and split it among thousands, effectively, they're paying very little each listen. So the paradigm shift is towards a pay for listen model. It's a consumption based payment on. Now back before any of this stuff came along, if you had a radio station and you played a song, not satellite radio, just straight FM radio, for example. Did you have to pay a royalty for that? The radio station had an agreement with an organization called a Performing Rights Society. These are societies that manage a particular type of right in music. So if you and I write a song, we and record it. We've just generated a whole basket of different types of legal rights, all of which we begin by owning. And then we can sell those rights off to different third parties that will help us collect the income that attaches to the exploitation of those rights. In the case of songs that get played on the radio or performed at a basketball game or these sorts of things, that right is called a public performance right. And the radio stations do deals with these rights societies in the US, the two most prominent ones are called Azcap and BMI. And those organizations are responsible for monetizing that right on behalf of artists. So the radio station at the end of the year will give Azcap a million dollars and then Azcap will do something like Spotify does, which is tabulate what that million dollars corresponded to and they'll pay out the royalties to artists, pro-rata in accordance with that. And Sean Parker was involved with Spotify and with Napster, right? So he had kind of a, this was the evolution of what he and Sean Fanyning had done. It was they had intended Napster to become a legal service. And what they wanted 20 years ago was to go do deals with the record labels to legalize it. But the industry was so defensive towards them and so aggressive that it couldn't happen. It took 20 years and it took the industry being decimated for everybody to be desperate enough that they were willing to entertain solutions. To the internet. And that's what Spotify was. You know, it's interesting when you look at all of the businesses that have been disrupted by the internet and contrast it with those that have not, right? So you've just given us a very eloquent description of how the music industry was disrupted. But you also pointed out something interesting, which is it wasn't just the internet that disrupted it was the desperation that followed the decimation that permitted the restructuring. Of course, then you can write off all the glib and obvious examples, right? What Amazon has done to retail, what Netflix has done to blockbuster and you know, stores on the side of the street, what Uber has done to taxis, what, you know, all of the travel sites have done to travel agents. I mean, it's been incredibly disruptive. And yet when I think about medicine, it's like one of the least disrupted industries by technology. And you know, you basically still have hospitals eat all the rent. Payers, although most people generally perceive them as bad guys generally don't get paid that much. Providers get less and less on a per encounter basis. And it's, you know, overall a pretty much similar system to what it was 20 years ago. And that's, I don't know. I mean, I guess I'd have to think about it, but I can't think of too many industries that are as unchanged in the presence of this revolution as healthcare. No, I think you're right. The appeal of investing in healthcare is exactly what you just expressed. And that's what drew me into it several years ago. And what I've learned since then has been slightly disillusioned, but I'll give you my take on it. The first thing I would say is that healthcare is still an industry that largely gets paid through labor. So most of the money ultimately goes to labor. Goes to doctors, it goes to healthcare personnel. The hospitals don't make that much money. They're not that great of business. You know, if you look at Kaiser, for example, which is an integrated payer provider in California, I think they have a 3 or 4% gross margin. It's not a phenomenal business. The payers to your point have very low margins. They, in fact, have legally imposed limits on the amount of gross margin that they can generate, which, you know, you can argue about the ethics of the pharmaceutical companies, who everyone hates, seemingly extract enormous profits. On the other hand, it's a very competitive industry, and apart from the legalized monopoly given to them via patents on new drugs, they are the only companies sort of, as I said about record labels, they're the only ones who are out here designing new solutions and taking an enormous risk. Taking an enormous risk and their shareholders are taking that risk. Now, whether they're being overpaid or underpaid to take that risk is totally debatable. The other thing is that it's unclear where technology can deliver dividends in terms of human health. And so worth thinking about medicine at a moment in which we as a species have already made an enormous progress. I mean, whatever we've doubled or tripled lifespan, and, you know, these numbers better than I do, but even if you get rid of the infant mortality factor and these other things that distort the numbers, people are living quite a bit longer on average than they were even seemingly 30 years ago. And that's especially true of affluent societies until they get afflicted by the diseases of affluence. So, where can we get more life from or where can we reduce suffering in disease by way of technology? Is a little unclear. There are all sorts of things that we could of course do to make hospitals more efficient and to spend less than we do on things like end of life care that maybe aren't a good use of capital. But there's not so obviously a spotify of health care waiting to happen. It's more like there are a million little IT operating efficiencies that McKinsey consultants will over the next several decades implement in large health organizations. And then the big promise is around new types of medicine that I think will arise in the biotechnology industry. And that's where I'm now spending a lot of my time and attention. Yeah, it's sort of interesting because I think one of the challenges of health care, and I think this was most evident during the debates many years ago, not many, but what I call it, 10 years ago around the ACA and around complete revisiting a restructuring of health care. And one of the things I found a little painful in listening to politicians talk about health care was they spoke about it like there was just one problem to be solved. But the way I sort of think about it is there are at least three completely separate but highly related problems, which is quality of care. And that can be broken down into two levels. You can sort of have it as just keeping people from dying versus like generating alpha. So, you know, really improving quality. There's cost, which is just the cost to the system and about 90% of the dollars are basically spent by three entities. The government, the employer and the payer, depending on who's at risk, the consumer is on the hook for about 10% of that cost. How could you reduce the cost? And then the third leg of that stool is access. How do you ensure access? And so, when we talk about technology disrupting health care, it's like, where do you start, right? Because, you know, for me, I can see things where technology can be quite helpful on quality of care. Not entirely obvious to me how to leverage technology to lower cost. I'm not entirely clear at least at a practical level how it can drive access. Although, in theory, that should be the first place you'd want to go after leveraging technology. But I think I'm trying to think about what you said about how Spotify went about it and trying to see is there a parallel there. Because the thing with Spotify that was hard was you had multiple constituents, right? You have artists, you have labels, you have consumers. They all kind of want something a little different. And that speaks of an optimization problem, which is clearly what health care is. But going on what you said a moment ago, it sounds like today you're a little less encouraged than you would have been four years ago, and you're thinking on this problem. Well, let me try and recapitulate your three legs of the stool in one simple framework, which is something that we should all be aiming for is to generate universal access to the current best available health care that anyone in the world receives. You know, one of my favorite quotes, I always forget who's quoted is, but venture capitalists talk about a lot, which is that the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed. And I think that's almost always true. Look at what rich people are doing. And assume that in 20 or 30 years, everybody will have that. And so what are rich people doing right now? Well, they're paying doctors like you. A lot of money to do very bespoke types of medicine that leverage all sorts of deep biometric analyses of their bodies. A lot of thinking by you and your team. And a lot of spend on the usage of what are currently expensive machines. MRI machines to do preventative screening for tumors every year, things like this that if you're really rich, you know, you might as well go get an MRI every year. Get a full body MRI every year. I mean, just see if there's anything going on. Why not? And so what stands between today and orphans in Somalia receiving that level of care. And what stands in the way I think is to some degree a level of technological leverage. What is happening in your head when you look at a patient's blood tests and try to gel that with your biophysiological mental model. So mental models is something that I believe computers will be able to do in the future. And so right now, we use physicians for thinking and for bedside manner and for guidance. And then we use some physicians like surgeons for physical procedures that they're essentially athletes at. And so I want high performing athletes who don't mess up or very precise who've done it a million times. Well, the roboticization of physical medicine like surgery is something that I believe will just continue to get better and better. It may take longer may not be replaceable immediately, but that will, you know, we will be primarily doing robotic surgeries a hundred years from now. The cognitive work that physicians do will I believe largely be replaced by computational systems that can leverage the same types of theoretical frameworks that our minds are utilizing to make good decisions. And what you're left with is all the touchy, feeling personal stuff that you as a physician and any other physician knows really matters. It's not superficial. The ability to help someone make good decisions about their own health, to make someone care about their physical health, to help them navigate difficult decisions that aren't straightforward, that involve trade offs. Are the sort of things that physicians right now don't have the time to do that they did when they were taking their medicine bag around to people's houses and hanging out for a couple hours. And so in a certain way, we may go back to an older style of medicine, but the people who do that may look more like highly skilled nurses than like physicians. So I believe that what you'll see is globally a lot more technology involved in the deployment of medicine and a shift in the composition of the labor market around medicine. And so, towards something that looks more like a large population of highly skilled nurses, fewer overpaid or appropriately paid, but maybe over trained physicians that right now are very scarce, that only rich people can access. And then most excitedly, you're going to see a lot of new medicine. That's the stuff I'm focused on now is an investor and that's the stuff that I think is going to be the most game changing. That's the stuff that's going to buy us years of additional life. So when did you make that transition where you sort of your your big foray into this was obviously Spotify as far as like transition one so DA 2.0 to DA 3.0 and then DA 4.0 doing the investing. So the bio text of specifically, when did you make that transition? Well, I'm still making it because it's a hard transition to make and there's been so much that I've already had to learn and so much more that I have yet to learn. I think the starting point was this realization that what mattered most in healthcare as a capital allocator meaning the the most useful place that I could help direct money was to. What goes through the pipes of the healthcare system as opposed to the healthcare system itself the healthcare system in America for the reasons we've just discussed is a. Prekey old infrastructure and it's important to fix it just like it's important to fix the government or the broken bridges that we have all over the country. But it's not the most interesting thing to do and it also doesn't have a global impact because fixing the US healthcare system doesn't do a lot for folks in Sudan or in Saudi Arabia or in Japan or anywhere else you're just dealing with a human system where what's broken. And are the human structures that we've constructed to deliver the thing. So that was my starting point was was realizing that the medicine itself was the thing that mattered more and ultimately despite all of the valuable things that physicians do. The biggest game changers in human health in the past 50 years have been pills. They've been pills that very brilliant people invent and that we can give to people through any number of channels and that actually fix the problem sometimes. And we're moving into an era of medicine that people call preventative medicine or precision medicine or whatever you want that really boils down to addressing illness at the level of mechanism. Understanding that diseases have a functional concrete explanation and that we can develop interventions that actually fix what's broken in a very precise way and without a lot of collateral damage and our ability to do that better and better is what's going to give people much more health in the future. And we're in any two or one of that journey. So as an investor there couldn't be a more exciting place to hang out and the advances that we're making on a monthly or yearly basis are staggering. So when I noticed that that was happening in the world it just became clear to me that this was not only an exciting and interesting place to be, but also one that could be enormously profitable both financially and in terms of the benefit to humanity that delivered. What got you interested in the problem of living longer personally? Well, I guess I am not primarily preoccupied with living longer or with longevity as I am with the reduction of suffering that already exists. So people who are really obsessed with longevity, maybe you are one of them, we'll make the argument that death is the great tragedy of human life and that you know we basically don't realize it's so bad because we take it for granted and can't see any alternative. That may be right, but I also think there's a lot of evidence in nature that death and the turnover of populations has some utility. Steve Jobs talked about famously that this is nature's way of clearing out the old ideas and bringing in new ones and creating an urgency and creating an urgency. But I don't want to downplay the credibility of the argument for longevity. I just think that there are enough people dying obviously prematurely from things that should be preventable and there are lots of people dying in the second half of their life or suffering from things that should be preventable that we should start by focusing on those things. Now, it may be the case that longevity is the skeleton key to all of those problems that the number one risk factor for all diseases is age and that if we could just figure out what's happening with aging, then we could get out in front of all these other diseases as opposed to playing whack-a-mole with all of them. That may be the case and I think it's a legitimate hypothesis to explore, but it's not the one that I'm starting from or else all of my investing would be in longevity. Whereas most of my investing at this point is preoccupied with individual diseases and whether we can arrest them and detect them earlier. So what are you most passionate about right now? Not necessarily from the investment thesis perspective, but from the technology or promise that the idea holds. Well, the holy grail for me is approaching what I think of as a singularity like moment in biomedicine. People throw around the term singularity mean all sorts of things, but I actually believe it's a who's who can do. You know, it may have been Kurzweil, Ray Kurzweil, or I'm not sure, but it may have been some of those old cybernatics dudes like I first heard it from Ray's work. I don't know enough. Why don't you explain briefly what how he's referring to it? Well, I think Ray Kurzweil is referring to the singularity as this moment when human minds merge with machines. And so we, for example, download our brains into computers and then are effectively immortalized because our consciousness exists now in a digital format. That's not the singularity I'm talking about, but the concept of a singularity is that this is a moment at which sort of everything changes and there's an almost infinite acceleration in our capacity to do something. The singularity that I envision in our understanding of biomedicine is the moment at which we can digitally represent complex biology. And therefore study it at zero marginal cost. So let me explain this right now what we essentially do in biology and what medicine is always tried to do is understand how the machine of a living system works. And in the work you do on metabolism, for example, the ways that we try to represent how the machine works are incredibly complicated. They're these flow charts with all these arrows and pictures and this connects to this and this connects to these 10 things and if you pull this lever, these four things happen and how do we even make sense of that. A way station to the singularity I'm talking about is the field of so-called systems biology in which what people do is they observe these biological systems and then they try to translate the mechanistic connections that they have uncovered into code into formal representations into a formal language that captures how something works in a way that a computer can understand. And in a way that is unambiguous and not sort of stifled by the inherent ambiguity of human language by which we describe a lot of these things in everyday life. And this is the system's biology I think will allow us to simulate biological systems in their full glorious complexity. And when we can do that, which we might be 20 years away from or we might be a thousand years away from. I don't know. But once we can do that, then we can effectively run intervention based experiments on digital systems at zero cost. And we can do the moment at which we will start to understand biology in the ways that we can intervene in it at an extraordinary rate. Until then, unfortunately, we have to do tests on humans or mice or dogs or monkeys. And unfortunately, we can only learn one thing at a time that way. We do controlled experiments where we hold everything, const and mix up one variable and in so doing we try to understand how that variable works. And this is a very slow way of learning and it's a very expensive way of learning. And although the people who participate in clinical trials are heroes to whom we owe most of our medicine, clinical trials are a brutal form of learning that cause many people to die from experimental medicines or that cause many people to endure enormous suffering without any benefit. And so that's the thing I'm most excited about getting to that singularity of digitally representing complex biology. Most of the things that I'm focused on as an investor, I view as somehow being stepping stones towards that singularity. If you look at other fields that could benefit from the ability to do digital experiments, consider macro economics. Wouldn't macro economics be even more complicated than biology. In other words, this sounds like the hardest problem I've ever heard of. All of these systems people put in the same bucket of complex adaptive systems kind of ground zero for studying these things is the Santa Fe Institute and organization in which I'm involved and I'm very passionate about. And part of the reason I'm passionate about all of these types of systems is because they share certain characteristics. So in a kind of vague way, they're all complex in just the colloquial sense. They're really complicated. They're a lot of moving parts. But it may turn out that we can come up with theories that actually describe all of these types of systems. So there's some sense in which these problems of economies and the weather and physiological systems are all kind of similar. And we may be able to come up with theories that are predictive that help us make predictions about these different types of systems. So that's a kind of intellectual promise land that I think is worth chasing. Whether or not it's going to happen or not. I think even trying for those sorts of theories is going to generate useful information. Whether we'll be able to simulate these things or not is sort of an open theoretical question. But I'm optimistic about it because it seems like it's the logical endpoint of all of our digital technology is to create digital representations of reality. And on the one hand reality is really complex, but on the other it seems to be driven at the bottom from relatively simple theories. And so to the extent that the laws of physics are ubiquitous and are driving everything from the bottom up and that everything that happens subsequent to the laws of physics are these emergent phenomena. It's not clear to me that we won't come up with simple parsimonious descriptions of these types of systems. And the physics of the universe before Newton probably also appeared interactively chaotic. So the way that anything looks to us before we understand it is I think pretty imposing, which is why when we have breakthroughs they feel almost like this enormous relief because something that seemed really complicated becomes really simple. Yeah, I mean the obvious example right would be the coding of the human genome which is now approaching 20 years in its anniversary. Do you feel that that discovery has underperformed overperformed or met expectations on what we would have thought prior to that codification? The pithy aphorism that I think applies to genomics and a lot of things in technology is that it is probably short term over estimated and long term underestimated. So certainly when the human genome project reached its initial milestones in Craig Ventures genome being sequenced. There was a extreme optimism that was unjustified that now that we've cracked this code we're going to figure out everything in five or ten years. Clearly that has not happened and so to that extent those predictions have failed. The other hand the sequencing technology that underwrote that is now being used to sequence mRNA to sequence methylation of the genome to sequence neoantigen in cancer patients tumors. This has become an extraordinarily useful set of tools for reading all kinds of biology. And so long term I believe the impact of the human genome and our understanding of it is almost impossible to overstate. Because it represents a basic part of a tool kit that is now integral to everything at the cutting edge of medicine. Yeah, so in other words the tool might actually be more valuable than the initial application. Absolutely, but the only way that people were able to justify pain for that tool was in this. In the hope that's what I say about Bitcoin and stuff by the way as well because this is now part of my theory of technology which is that. You take something like Bitcoin and all these blockchains and all of this I was an early investor in this company Ripple that six years ago now and so I've been interested in all of this for years. But I don't take the view that there's any end point I predict and know with any level of confidence all I can tell you is that having the smartest computer science. In the world in mass shift their attention to an area of technology is going to produce something. So whether Bitcoin becomes a replacement for the United States dollar is almost irrelevant. What I'm interested in is what's going to happen now that millions of people are working on this thing. Similarly, the human genome project was this kind of catalyzing event is very vivid built Clinton had a press conference with Craig Venter and it got everyone excited. And that sort of moment is what inspires a lot of 18 year olds there are a lot of 15 year olds to go into molecular biology undergraduate programs and then to become genetics researchers and you know so this is how history happens and a lot of things have already come out of genomics and we'll continue. Have you been paying a lot of attention and you alluded to it and I'm going to go but have you just on a personal level been paying what attention to the liquid biopsie space. A lot yeah I've been following the liquid biopsie space now for about four years. Yeah you and I spoke about this a couple of years ago and I wasn't sure how much you'd still been into it. This is something it's very interesting to me you know one of the things I talk about with patients is. Even with my most best attempts at providing the most bespoke insights into how to prevent diseases when you take a big step back and say. Let's look at the three main diseases that are going to kill most people in a civilized society where you're basically taking care of the blocking and tackling that you've alluded to earlier. It's a thricelharotic diseases, it's cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. And my personal viewpoint is that the atherosclerotic diseases in the neurodegenerative diseases we have much more insight into how to prevent cancer's tough. And I sort of explained to people when you look at a blood test and let's talk about the best blood test money can buy. It's probably offering you 70 to 80 percent of your predictive value on the atherosclerotic side probably offering you 60 to 70 percent of your predictive value on the neurodegenerative side. It probably isn't offering you even 30 percent of insight on cancer because of course the mutations that kill are somatic not germline so we're not measuring those. We don't have great assays for measuring adoptive immune cell function. We can measure an a to immunity but that's so crude and it's irrelevant in cancer. So we talk about something else you alluded to which is how aggressive can we be in screening whilst solving for our optimizing around minimizing physical harm and emotional harm. Physical harm from the actual screening tool, emotional harm from risk of false positives because the harder you look the more you'll find. And the open gaping open hole in this is we can't do a liquid biopsy. So we got interested in this together you and I mutually around this inox two protein which was quite interesting but unfortunately that company that technology doesn't really seem to exist right now. It also had a number of issues with it but basically it was a western block it was a protein assay they were looking at a protein this inox two protein. And the belief was that that protein was found exclusively on malignant cells and could only be shed off not just cancer cells but cancer cells that had the potential to spread and attached to other cells. Now a company that we both know pretty well grail is taking a different approach that seems slightly more logical. Tell us a little bit about grail. Grails an interesting company it's a spin out of alumina which is the behemoth genome sequencing business they make all the machines that do sequencing that most people use. And the premise of grail is that by sequencing peripheral blood you can find all sorts of cellular refuse from somatic tissues and that this refuse. If you are able to amplify it will tell you about the cells that it's coming from and so one of the proofs of principle of this concept in general was non invasive prenatal screening pregnant women have in their blood. I think potentially 10% of their peripheral blood is actually coming from the fetus and so you can detect a lot of things about the fetus by looking at the mother's peripheral blood. And in that case maybe what you need to effectively do is separate the 10% from the 90% in order to look at it. When you're talking about early cancers you might be dealing with sub half percent or sub 10th of a percent concentrations of tumor DNA that are showing up in the blood. And so the premise of grail is that if you sequence the blood with enough depth meaning you sequence it over and over and over again you can detect just that DNA that's coming from the tumor. And by doing so you can identify things about it that give you a guide to where the tumor is and what its genetic characteristics are. And this is this is much harder than what you just said a moment ago because the problem you described earlier has two things going for it, which is one you've got much more of it there. Let's just assume the number is 10%. But the other thing is half of that DNA is foreign. That's right. 50% of that DNA is from the father, 50% from the mother. So you have half foreign greater quantity. If you have colon cancer and we are lucky enough to get the RNA or DNA of that colon cancer it might have 20 mutated genes. It's effectively self DNA. Well, it is self. Exactly. It's tumor DNA which is which tumor. Yeah, exactly. So I mean, that's a double whammy. It's not just a needle in a haystack. It's like a needle of hay in a haystack. That's correct and it's also difficult because I just came up with that by the way. I'm really proud of that. That's the first smart thing I've ever received. It's a good amount of the needle of hay in the haystack. I like that. You can use that as much as you want. I will. I'm going to start right now when you're looking for that needle of hay in the haystack. The premise of your search has to be that you know what you're looking for. In other words, you have to identify a series of potential oncogenes in which you're seeking aberrant genetic variants that would indicate the gene has essentially been co-opted by the disease and is now working for the cancer as opposed to working for you who want to defeat the cancer. And there are so many different ways that this technology is going to be difficult. That is matched by billions of dollars that people are investing in this because solving this problem is as the company's name suggests sort of a grail. I'm not an investor in grail, but I've looked at them and I've also looked at many of their competitors. There's another approach that's really cool that I'm investing in right now. A company out of Boston called Glimps is a business that was founded by San Guita Batia who's an extraordinary researcher at MIT. San Guita is a hepatologist, but a bio-engineer whose work has uncovered two really interesting ideas that I think are useful in cancer screening. One is that when cancer is setting up shop in a tissue, it remodels the microenvironment so as to build defenses for itself against the immune system and against the other physiotherapy. And against the other physiological processes that would stand in its way. And it turns out that there are in the human genome, 550 different endoprodeases that are in some combination utilized in the remodeling of tissues. In different processes, they're used primarily in healthy processes. But when cancers are beginning, these proteins get recruited or these enzymes get recruited rather to do this remodeling work. They're sort of the construction workers of the disease as it gets set up. And San Guita's work and the work of several other researchers that she's leveraging has identified what proteases tend to be implicated in the early formation of different diseases ranging from fatty liver disease. To liver cancer, to lung cancer, and a set of others. And if you can it turns out identify 10 or 15 enzymes that you basically only see, upregulated enormously when a particular disease is beginning, then there's another way of detecting it that San Guita's working on, which is to engineer nanoparticles that you send into the body. And you call them a synthetic biomarker. You let them circulate and you design them such that they break apart if they encounter those enzymes. And when they break apart, they fragment into smaller nanoparticles that can be detected in the urine. So San Guita's approach is rather than look for these trace amounts of refuse in the blood. That send essentially a team, a SWAT team into the body to circulate and hunt for a thing. And if that SWAT team finds the thing, get a much larger signal in the urine. I think that's a very out of that. Well, that have tissue specificity. It'll have tissue specificity to the extent that the disease you're looking for has a different enzymatic signature when it's in different tissues. Got it. So in the context of, let's say you get the signal and you would have to believe then that you're going to have different enzymatic pathways in the, you know, mesenchymal system of colon cancer versus lung cancer. I see. So it's not, you know, when you were saying this, I wasn't, I'm not familiar with the limb. So I was wondering if what you're going to say was it got taken up in residence and then you basically would do, you know, it was labeled with gadolinium or something and you do an MRI and you'd see, well, hey, this stuff is being broken apart in the lung. Therefore, that's where we want to look, but that's not what you're saying. No, this is all happening in the periphery in the blood itself. The breakup of the nanoparticles is occurring at the site of the disease, but the refuse from that interaction is going through the kidneys and into the urine. Who'd be interesting if there was a way to see if there's a way to capture the local signature at the tissue site of origin. There may, in fact, be ways to do this and there are several nanoparticle-based approaches that follow the lines that you described where it's an imaging agent that is meant to bind specifically to the tissue. What's cool about this though is you don't need to target. You just use the circulatory system to get these things everywhere. And if they detect the thing that you're probing, they change. And that's what you measure. I think this is a really clever workaround for some of the problems that I think have been be devolent liquid biopsy. But I do think liquid biopsy will probably work. And the other reason it may work and there's a company called freedom for instance that's taking a different angle on it. Freedom's approach is don't look for the tumor DNA in the blood. Look at the entire genome and see if there is any sort of smoke from the fire. If the cancer is the fire, try to detect the body's systemic response to the cancer and recognize that. As aberrant. In other words, even if the cancer itself is sending off a very small signal, maybe the systemic response to it is a much larger signal. And you can detect that. So people are going to try and get after this in many different ways. My prediction is that within a decade we'll have one or more of these that work quite reliably. And each of us will at our annual physical have a routine blood test that is pretty good at detecting cancer now. That gets another problem that people have raised, which is you know, what if we're all getting cancer all the time. And most of the time the immune system is disposing of it in short order. If that's happening, then we'll have another problem to solve, which is how do we know when we should treat people who are detected early versus when shouldn't we. But that's fine. Problems create solutions which create more problems. And that's what we do. You know, that's the problem that I probably worry about the most. I mean, I guess the second most. The problem I worry about the most is can we crack this. But that problem I got this glimpse into with with all the deep dive I did into Uncle Blot three years ago, which was. I was asked by a company that was interested in acquiring them to help with the due diligence. I actually thought I was complete buffenary total quackery, complete and utter nonsense. But after about a year and a half, I thought there really was something there that unfortunately had been sort of bastardized by unsavory characters that were involved in basically creating kind of a profit center around selling alternative products that were complete nonsense. But when we did our own analyses on raw data that they gave us, we saw something pretty interesting. There's two questions you have to ask right when you're doing this is the first is. And rather than describe them in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive value, just describing this stuff in English. You want to understand something which is if you do a blood test on a person and it comes back and says nothing. How confident are you that they have nothing. That's the concept of negative predictive value. And then conversely, if the test comes back and says you have something, how confident can you be that you have something? That's the idea of positive predictive value. Now, if you look at how Uncle Blot was created and you look at how the FDA gave it a type of approval, which is not an FDA approval, but there's, you know, and I don't want to get into the weeds on that stuff. But basically it was approved, quote unquote, only for patients presenting with metastatic cancer with an unknown primary. Because if it's remarkable ability to create a differentiation around 27 different types of tissue. So someone shows up with a lung nodule that's not lung cancer. It's actually important to know is that breast is it thyroid is it what? Because they could have a primary that's so cult, but it's still metastatic cancer. And this is a life and death decision is to how to treat it. And that's where Uncle Blot was actually very useful. And so Uncle Blot became really, really good if someone had cancer and you did a blood test on them. You had about 99.4% likelihood of correctly guessing, not just that they had cancer, but what kind of cancer it was. But the flip side's really important, which is if you take a whole bunch of people that don't have cancer. And you can only do this out of a blood bank, prospectively, you can't even do this in the population. What's the likelihood that you're not going to be over calling cancer? And when we did an analysis and it was not a huge analysis, we were limited by the amount of data we had. What we saw was by about 5x it overestimated the prevalence of cancer at a given age for a given histology. And our interpretation of that was either this is categorically useless, or it's picking up a bunch of cancers that don't go on to become cancers. They get went out by the immune system, which is exactly what you just described. And that raises a very difficult question as a physician, as a patient, which is, what do you do if it's your annual physical? Now sometimes you'll get lucky, right? What's getting lucky? Getting lucky is it says you have colon cancer and you can go into a colonoscopy, which is a great way to assess that. It's not a great way though if a colonoscopy costs the system through your $4,000, and you now are giving people a thousand times more colonoscopies than we're giving today, because we've got some screening test that suggests this. I'm reading right now a phenomenal book that everyone listed in the podcast and you should read the book of why by a Judea Pearl or you day-up Pearl, who's a professor at UCLA. And his area is causal inference, and he goes through in the book some of the fascinating math that corresponds with diagnostics in particular. And frankly, I'm always confused by sensitivity and specificity measurements in which is the inverse of which. So do you want to send you my primer on the Senate? Please send me it. We've put so much work into this. I believe I understand it now, but for your listeners, I'll just from the book. I'll just from the book give you one example of it, and the conditional probabilities that express it. People will probably remember a few years ago the guidelines on mammography changed to suggest that women I think what under 40 should not get mammograms as a screen. And I was always a little bit skeptical of that conclusion because there's there's a certain intuitive way in which you think, well, if it gives you a false positive kind of who cares because just go get a CT. Whatever, you know, I mean, what's obviously don't go get your breast caught off, but if all the cost is to a woman is that she goes and gets another test. Maybe that's not good for the system from a cost standpoint, but if you're the patient, you certainly don't want to not get screened if you do have breast cancer. And so, pearl, though, in his book walks through the actual statistics of this, so if the incidence of breast cancer in the wild population is one in 700, that means that out of 4,000 women say five of them would have breast cancer is what you'd expect. If the sensitivity of the test is 73% which sounds high, that means that's deplorable. But still means, which is what the sensitivity is of a mammogram, 73% it means that if you get a positive test result, you still have a sub 1% chance of having breast cancer. Now, Bayesian statistics adds another level of complication to this in that Bayesian statistics gives us a way of updating probability estimates that we make. So there's a difference between you being a member of the random population and you being a woman who say has a broken mutation that radically increases your chances of getting breast cancer. So if you are someone who say has a 50% chance of getting breast cancer in your life, then a positive mammogram gives you a much much higher likelihood, because it effectively updates your estimate that you began with of your likelihood of getting the disease. And so what we probably end up with in any of these tests is a way of stratifying populations based on their genetic risk of getting different diseases. And it's only within each of those cohorts of relative risk that we can consider the importance or usefulness of a screening test like a liquid biopsy, because it's utility to each person depends upon the extent to which that person is already at risk of the disease you're surveilling. Yeah, the other thing I add to that is the way we think about this problem clinically is if I give you a piece of Swiss cheese and I said, how many pencils could you drop through here, it's a lot. But what if I put four pieces of Swiss cheese on top of each other and rearrange them in such a way that one and only one hole could accept the pencil. And so where I see the real application of the liquid biopsy is as follows. So let's use them aography example. So mammograms are good for some things and bad for some things and let's ignore cost. Because I think once you layer cost into this it becomes way too complicated a problem so it's highly relevant. But as a physician, I'm trying to solve the problem of the patient not society. That's my cop out. So then it becomes a question of is the radiation significant and the radiation mammography is trivial. MBI of course, which is a more elaborate type of mammogram has very high radiation, but we almost never do that anymore. So now we've taken away physical harm and we've decided to just discount cost. Well, mammography is good for seeing calcified lesions, but it's not good for seeing non calcified lesions. Conversely, MRI won't pick up a calcified lesion, but if you're using something called diffusion weighted imaging, it's infinitely better for picking up pretty much everything else. So then the question becomes what happens if you layer the mammogram with the DWI MRI with the liquid biopsy? Those are three pieces of Swiss cheese. And then the fourth layer would be the Bayesian piece, which is what is the woman's probabilistic likelihood of breast cancer based on her family history, known mutations and known mutations of unknown clinical significance, which was basically the types of mutations we have. And now all of a sudden you've got a much smarter way to think about it. So my only take on this one is, if and when the liquid biopsies become viable, I don't think they should ever be leading candidates. I think they should only be used as confirmation. So once you do X, Y, and Z, you then come back so for example, if you do, you know, you go and get a whole body MRI and there's a little shadow in the pancreas. Well, what's the next step there? That's a big step. Are we going to submit that patient to an ERCP or a biopsy of that? That's the real deal. Well, I think you're right to some degree, but I would push back to lead with it. You still push it. I would back against the a priori assumption that we wouldn't lead with it because that does really hinge on sensitivity and specificity. You know, I mean, if we have 99% specific sensitive and 100% specific liquid biopsies over what time frame though. That's see, see, I think that that's the challenge with the liquid biopsy is your right. I mean, technically there's no test that can have 100% specificity, 100% sensitivity. That's sort of like having a rock receive rock or any characteristic curve that's a square. No such thing exists. What I think is you take something where you can, can you generate a liquid biopsy that has 100% sensitivity, even if specificity is only 95% which a lot of people think is great, but 95% No, I actually think you want the inverse. I think you never want false negatives. In other words, you want 100% specificity. You never want it. Yeah, yeah, sorry. I miss about you. You never want to have negative predictive value to be 100%. You never want someone who has cancer to be told they don't have cancer. You can tolerate some people who don't have cancer being told that they do. That's right. The other dimension here, I mean, I know we put costs aside, but you can't really because the question is, what are the relative costs of these different surveillance measures. If liquid biopsies are trivially inexpensive, which is the goal, say this glimpse test, you know, I'm forget all the health economics of it. If just the cost of doing it might be five or $10 or $20 or something. If the sensitivity and specificity are both high enough, then of course you would rather use them as a universal screen and then follow up with much more expensive interventions. Yeah, and with things like fecal occult blood testing or fecal DNA as a precursor to colonoscopy, it makes tons of sense because we have a pretty well understood pathway for the tumor. Again, not having an answer to this dilemma. My big concern with everybody shows up in Willie Nellie gets a liquid biopsy that shows you've got pancreatic cancer is what do you do next? Well, that's the question of sensitivity. Yeah, so you go and you get the MRI and the MRI shows nothing. To me, that's a great outcome. That's the best outcome is the MRI shows nothing. And if the test is vetted and you're positive and you can be confident that that was not a false positive, but rather it's a preclinical tumor, then you're in a pathway of what's the righteous path of surveillance going forward. And equally important if not more important is what steps can the patient take in that moment to ward this thing off to aid their immune system. Is that something as quote unquote simple as you got a sleep more, give your immune system a boost, figure out ways to destress yourself, which of course is pretty hard, given that I just told you a pancreatic cancer. But you know what I mean, like, that's that's the art of how to think about using these things, which I look forward to being able to think about these problems. I think what we're getting at is a really interesting framework, though, that is almost certainly going to become standard, which is the utility of the genomics and family history, which is, you know, genomics tells part of that story, but it doesn't tell you what happened with your ancestors. It's a family history remains incredibly important, but you'll start when a baby's born with a whole genome and a family history, and that will generate for you the prior probabilities of different diseases being the diseases that afflict that person in the rest of their life. Those prior probabilities will in a personalized way determine the utility of a wide array of low-cost screening tools that we're going to have at our disposal. And we'll also lead you to make personalized estimates of the sensitivity or rather the diagnostic power of those tests for that person, which to the Bayesian point is different for every person. This is a fundamentally different way than how we think about using diagnostics today. There's one detail of it that I don't have enough knowledge about, but you've made me interested in in your Swiss cheese metaphor, which is what from a probabilities and statistics standpoint is the right way to think about that Swiss cheese metaphor. Does adding tests on top of each other, how do you mathematically combine the sensitivity and specificity of the different tests? And can you even do so without running clinical trials on the combined usage of the tests to have some ground truth to reference them against. My intuition is directionally you can do it, but you will not have a number. In other words, you can't say that mammography plus DWI MRI plus liquid biopsy will have this sensitivity in this specificity calculated from the three pairs that you layered on. But I think philosophically what you're trying to do is arbitrage each strength and weakness of different screening tools. I think that's right. It's a conceptual model more than it is a theoretical and precise 100% where it gets interesting though is in the math because that's what you make it. Very counterintuitive. So if you think about the example that I'm citing from Pearls book, the sensitivity of the 73% test says that if you have breast cancer, there is a 73% chance. This test is positive. Much harder probability is what is the chance that you have breast cancer if this test is positive? These are two different conditional probabilities and the shocking result is that if the test says you are positive, you have less than a 1% chance of having breast cancer. So what's counterintuitive is if we thought, oh, we have a 1 test that's 73% sensitive. We have 1 test that's 90% sensitive. We have 1 test that's 85% sensitive. You would assume that if you layer the three pieces of Swiss cheese, the possibility that if you are positive on two of those three and you have the disease is quite high. It may turn out though that it's not very high. The thing I was cautioned people against is you never want to talk sensitivity without remembering the specificity and vice versa. So in our little primer that we use with our patients, we use two extreme and very glib examples. If I mail a letter at random to a thousand women and tell them all that they have breast cancer, I have 100% sensitivity. I have zero percent specificity, but I have 100% sensitivity. Because let's just assume three of those women have breast cancer. We told them all they have breast cancer. Never mind the fact that not. Never mind the fact that 997 of them don't have breast cancer and I incorrectly told them they do. But you can have 100% sensitivity and you're still it's a dog shit test. If the specificity is really low and similarly you can send a thousand letters out to women at random and say you absolutely don't have breast cancer and you will say that with 100% specificity. Now what's cool about and this may be true of incumbent diagnostics as well, but what's kind of cool in the liquid biopsy companies I'm looking at and I'm you're exposing my lack of statistical knowledge is that. Because the test is effectively a computer analysis of data, you can manually trade off between sensitivity and specificity. And that's like a PSA. Where do you decide the cutoff is? So for the liquid biopsies, whatever everyone is doing is they're saying we have to have 100% specificity. We can't tell anyone who has the disease that they don't have it. That's the way it should be. I think that that's so what you know if you picture one of those and maybe we'll link to this and show notes so people know what we're talking about when we talk about a receiver operating characteristic curve. But that's you picture pulling to the upper left tightening that curve getting it as close to an area under the curve of one. And that was the thing I could never get those on co block eyes to understand was they couldn't understand. They thought of this exclusively as a binary yes no and it's like no no no there's no thing is yes no. You could say PSA is prostate cancer if it's higher than one. And you will catch every single person who had prostate cancer and a million people who don't conversely you can make the cutoff 20. And you'll miss a million people with prostate cancer but you'll be guaranteed that everyone who you say has prostate cancer has prostate cancer. That's fissitious and not even true but directionally that's the problem that you face and I like the question you posed the a which which I've never thought of which is could you take my sort of hand waving Swiss cheese approach and mathematically map it out without doing the clinical trial. And that also goes beyond my pay grade I would have to consult with the statistician you could certainly do it retrospectively. The way that these tests are developed is that a researcher gets lots of tissue and blood samples from patients and they know which of those are coming from cancer patients or not. And then they build a set of assays and analytics pipeline that look at the samples and try to class them correctly. And so you could certainly run multiple of those types of tests on the same samples from the same patients if you had large enough sample volumes and you could develop these tests in a layered manner. I don't think that the statistics would hold if you developed them separately from one another. But that effectively is a controlled experiment that I'm describing. Yeah if you did it as a biased and unbiased sample so you'd have to buy for Kate the sample. Do all of your learning on the biased piece and then only verified on the unbiased piece. That's correct. And that's how they had the data. You know that's how they develop these is they they teach an algorithm essentially what the differences are between healthy and disease. And then they feed it new samples and they ask whether those new samples can be classed algorithmically into either of the buckets. I don't know the liquid biopsies space is so interesting to me. I really you know I tell my patients that I think this is the single area that will most influence our care. Hopefully in the next five years is right now like you know we're learning a lot about cardiovascular disease. We are still learning especially in the inflammatory side of that disease. We're not learning a hell of a lot around the light but proteins that you know we're just trying to educate people to actually know what's true and what's not true. But where we're learning geometrically is around inflammation and potentially with these two clinical trials that were published this year or one that was published this year one that was halted likely the the method of trexate study was halted early likely because of a positive effect. And that won't be announced until the fall. But that's two really interesting proof of concept so the anti-IL one study and then the method trexate study. We're making no change in life of proteins you're improving cardiovascular outcomes. In my mind the next frontier on cardiovascular is what can we do to strengthen the endothelial resilience because if you have a strong endothelium and muted inflammatory response and you can control light the proteins. You're taking the only inevitable disease our species has ever faced and knocking it at the honest heels. But cancer man like we're no better at curing cancer today and we were 40 years ago with five exceptions. Well cancer like aging seems to be an enormously resilient set of processes and you know biology and evolution have been pretty thrifty. So the mechanisms as you know of many cancers are mechanisms that are used in early fetal development by the body. So these are tools that our organism has for developing in the first place and unfortunately they run some risk of getting reactivated later in life and doing crazy stuff that's contrary to our interests. And so this trade off between the apparatus that we've been given to become healthy and mature and the processes that ultimately are undoing. It seems quite difficult to overcome. And the whole process is a less obvious one although the sort of endothelial damage that is at its core and the function of the immune system in the processes that ultimately degrade that juncture are also used. I mean the immune system seems to be at the core of much of this that you know if you do view at the school is just ultimately as a sort of auto inflammatory disease. Then you can think of it as a trade off against the immune system. Yeah. Just like allergies. Right. Yeah exactly. And you know we I'm getting allergy shots right now which funny enough I guess have always been referred to as immunotherapy before it was high. But you know I mean I would still rather have to get allergy shots than be susceptible to almost certain death if I didn't have this immune system. Do you have any anti-flectic reactions or your allergies? Thankfully no. And thankfully I haven't had any anti-flectic reactions to the immunotherapy. Yeah. Which is still which is still which doctor science. One of the things Sean Parker's working on is allergy and it's one of the things that led him into immunotherapy because he has horrible allergies. And so has always been fascinated by the immune system. And when he perceived that there was a crossover between his allergies and cancer biology he got obsessed with the idea that immunotherapy was going to be the root. But allergies themselves as mundane as they are still can't be addressed in a particularly rigorous or precise way. So precision medicine for tree pollen allergies is still beyond the frontiers of current medicine. Although the work that doctor may do who is the you know the largest sort of recipient of the work that Sean's doing up at Stanford. I mean she is amazing and the work that they are doing. I mean I've sent multiple patients there carries always very kind and takes my referrals. I mean I have seen before my own eyes people who once would have died from peanut dust and they can eat peanuts again through this sensitization. So it's yeah I sometimes wonder if Sean gets enough credit for the amazing stuff he's done both in terms of funding cancer research. But also this incredible center at Stanford that you know little by little we're seeing you know Mount Sinai is doing this in New York. Chock is doing it in Philly. I mean other centers are still are taking this research forward and I don't know. I mean I think for people out there listening to this who have children or who themselves have an athletic reactions. I am way more optimistic about this than I was four years ago. Well and this is you know comes back to the earlier point about the future's already here. Yeah, now how do you make that accessible to everybody and how do. Things that make sense and have been proven in a sense become standard of care. Unfortunately in the United States and this is something that I discovered very slowly. It's not as if there's one arbiter of standard of care. You've got all these different medical societies that govern physicians and standards in clinical guidelines in every specialty area. You're a doctor of care conferences and they're board of directors and the payers sometimes respect their clinical guidelines and the government sometimes respect their clinical guidelines. So one of the things that in terms of human systems we should absolutely put more energy into is. So once something like Dr. Nathu's work is sort of definitive science, do we rapidly make sure that it becomes standard for every patient, everywhere. And right now it has to go through this long cascade of human minds and bureaucratic organizations, which is an enormous detriment to patients. And it's something that has nothing to do with science, it just has to do with people. And it's the sort of thing that physicians should care much more about as a community. It's the sort of thing that people like I think at Tual Goanday rightly are always reminding us to think more about, you know, it's very easy to get drawn into the science and technology frontiers. And I think that's a very important thing to do with the research that we could make such an enormous impact with just the simple changes in our own behavior. D.A. I know I could sit here and have this discussion for another two hours, but I want to be respectful of your time and you've been super gracious to open up your home this morning. Where can people learn more about you? I know you've got a huge following on Twitter so they can obviously see you there. It's D.A. Wallach, that's D.A. W.A. L. A. C. H. And I have a website, which is equally simple, D.A. Wallach.com. And I'm on Instagram, also D.A. Wallach. I tend not to do that much social media these days, but I still occasionally post pictures. And I'm very easy to reach to. So I presume that in your audience there is a mixture of crazy people, geniuses and smart, nice people who think their geniuses but are not. And I'm particularly interested in meeting the geniuses. So, anyone listening, please put yourself in the bucket of crazy genius or smart not genius. Correct. Get to, can you reach out to D.A. If you're smart not genius, but do have an interesting novel idea that itself could be deemed genius. I'm also interested. That's great. Do you still perform? Not regularly. The most recent performance I did was after a dinner party, when I was embarrassingly asked to play a song on someone's piano and their living room, and got peer-pressured into doing it. But most of the time I don't perform because I don't have a great way of performing. If someone was going to buy just one piece of music, would it be your most recent album? What would you recommend? I think so. I would recommend my most recent album, which came out in the audition. October of three years ago. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, was 2016 it came out. Was it 15? It may have been 16. You're not good with dates. You told us. I think it was 2006. I was thinking the other day that it felt like it was a year ago. And then when I sort of realized it was three years ago, I thought, oh, shit. I should probably finish some of these songs. I've been writing. You know, because I can't go like a decade between it. I don't have the axle-rows credibility to wait that long between albums. All right. So time machine it is, which I believe came out in 2016, but I could be wrong. Of course, like a fool, I bought all your stuff on iTunes. So I overpaid for it. I could have just been on Spotify. If you're not listening to it much, I made out like a banded on that. So thank you. No, I tend to, when I listen to music, I just listen, I'm like a big repeater. Right. It drives everyone around me. See, you've got that OCD focus. Yeah. Yeah. I could go, I can go five songs on repeat for an entire five hour flight. Amazing. Yeah. Usually is that one. Right. I don't know if I mentioned bottom before. You did. Yeah. I wouldn't have let you get this front of conversation. If you hadn't at least mentioned John bottom. What's cool about both bottom and Elven Jones is that they both play behind the beat. They're always kind of catching up with the song. And when you play behind the beat, it sounds cool. I don't know why, but just like you can recognize cool if someone dresses cool or is cool, playing behind the beat sounds cool. I, to this day, listen to good times bad times at least once every couple of days. And I think to myself, how is it possible that this was the first song on the first Zeppelin album? And Bonham's opening riff. It's like incredible. And I think to myself, what would it have been like to have heard that for the first time on vinyl as like a new sound? I, I just, I mean, I would have worn that record out. Well, and they had a level of mystery too. I don't know if you know this, but they were never on the album covers. Pictures of them. So people would go to the concert to figure out what they looked like. Yeah. So this, I do somewhat regret not having been, oh, yeah. I've been around in a time where there was that level of magic around who is making some music you heard. I mean, it must have been even crazier with wax cylinders and stuff like this. People famously thought when they heard the phonograph that they needed to pull the curtain back and see the source of the audio there. Because it sounded so realistic. Now, if you hear a primitive wax cylinder recording, it's like shocking that anyone could have thought that was in the room. Because it's so scratchy and simplified. But the magic's happening in people's brains. So they just couldn't piece together how that was coming out of the speaker if it wasn't there. Do you ever listen to vinyl anymore? Yeah, I love vinyl. And vinyl's great. Vinyl's a peak technology in music reproduction. So you get a level of accuracy with digital music that you don't get with vinyl. But analog media are pretty cool. Yeah, godly. And last question, just because we're bringing it back to music. If you go back in time and see three or four concerts, actual pick the date, pick the band, pick the venue that you just otherwise wouldn't have been able to have seen because you weren't old enough or whatever. What do you think they'd be? Well, I would have liked to see, I saw Prince one time. And it was the most virtuosic live performance I've ever seen. So I might devote two of those concerts to Prince or something. People say Chuck Berry was pretty awesome live and pretty unhinged. I bet, you know, I don't love early rock and roll and I don't love blues. But some of those early rock folks, you know, if you had never seen it before, probably would have been incredibly shocking. So I would have liked to see that. And watching the documentary on Nina Simone that I saw a few years ago, I concluded that she must have been one of the greatest live performers ever. She just virtue us a live performer. So I would have liked to see her. It's like one of my favorite games to play. In the time machine. Oh yeah. All right, the A, well thank you so much.

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top-performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way, to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. In this podcast, I'm going to be discussing LP Little A. Little while ago, we put up a little questionnaire on Twitter that said, if I'm going to do a solo podcast, interviewed by Bob, what topic would you want to hear? We put up two options. The first was LP Little A. The second was hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women. Survey ran for about a day, and the results were unambiguous. 80% of you wanted to hear about LP Little A. Though many of you did want to hear about HRT, and we will absolutely get to that. On this podcast, we structured it as an interview. Originally, I thought I would just do it as a quote unquote lecture, but I realized that would just be way too boring, and it would be more fun to play patty cakes with Bob and have him interview me. That's what we did. Bob put together an interview, and he just asked me a bunch of questions about LP Little A. We're going to talk about what the heck it is, why you should care, why it's problematic, like the protein, what some of the potential treatment options are, and what's on the horizon. I got to admit, this is a bit of a technical podcast, but I also know that this is kind of a technical loving audience. So don't be discouraged. I also think this is one of the podcasts where you really have to be able to look at the show notes. I find some of this stuff really complicated myself, and I find a picture is sometimes worth a thousand words. So especially when I get into stuff like cringle repeats and cringle four subsection two zone five, that kind of stuff, you've just got to be looking at a picture to understand. So if you can't be able to look at something while you're listening to it, that's fine, but maybe go back after the fact and look at it or look first and then listen something like that. The show notes here will be very helpful and hopefully this answer is a lot of the questions that people have been asking me over the past year about LP Little A. And again, if this format is helpful, let us know because we're really happy to kind of do one of these every couple of months where we just put up a general topic and Bob grills me on it. So without further delay, here's the discussion with Bob Kaplan on LP Little A. Hey Bob, Peter, how are you? I'm doing well. I noticed you have a coffee there. Of course. What number is that today? Seven? At least. Yeah. I've watched four. Well, seven doubles. Probably seven double espresso's. That's true. Yeah, that's impressive. It's a low day. So this is the first of what I suspect and assume we might do more of where we through a question out to people and said pick one, have a vote. I don't know. We gave him a day or so. And the choice was, do you want to know about LP Little A? Or do you want to know about hormone replacement therapy in post-medipausal women, which by the way has a more politically correct name now that I can't remember? Peter Kron modulating therapies for women in menopause or something. I don't know. I was going to go with golden years or something. Something to that effect. The point is HRT versus this. And it was about 80, 20 in favor of LP Little A, which kind of bums me out because actually really wanted to talk about HRT. But next time we throw HRT in, we're going to put it up against something like Bachi Ball. And hopefully HRT comes out ahead and we can talk about it. I think you have been accumulating a bunch of questions that people have also started sending in about LP Little A. And I think that's what we're going to talk about. Absolutely. So a lot of questions are around what is LP Little A. And I thought in a what are to explain that. Maybe we might need a quick primer on lipoproteins to kick things off. Do you know anyone who can do that? I think I'm looking at them. Oh, okay. I was afraid you're going to say that. Starting from the basics, if you go to your doctor and you get a cholesterol blood test, they're going to probably show you a couple of numbers. A total cholesterol LDL cholesterol. And if you're really lucky, they'll put bad next to it. HGL cholesterol. And if you're extra special, they'll put good next to it. Triglycerides and non HGL cholesterol. That is a standard lipid panel. Those numbers are largely unhelpful. But more importantly, they're largely misunderstood. So when people look at LDL and think it's bad cholesterol, that immediately tells you that they're missing what the L and the D and the L stand for, the LDL stands for low density lipoprotein. And admittedly, if you don't have a background in biochemistry or something, you might not understand in looking at that, that implies that it's a macro structure. So cholesterol, which is the principal molecule that is carried by these lipoproteins, is something that is made by the body. So every cell in the body makes cholesterol. And most cells in the body make enough cholesterol to meet their own needs at the cellular level. And the single and most important need of cholesterol we have is cellular membranes. So cell membranes must be fluid. They must be able to move. They must be able to facilitate the attachment of one cell to another. They must be able to hold transporters across their membranes and things like that. And of course, cholesterol makes up the bulk of those membranes. So in addition, you turn cholesterol when I say you refer to a two certain organs, like the adrenal glands, the ovaries, the testes, turn cholesterol into hormones that are either sex hormones, glucocorticoids, gonadotropans, these things. So if for no other reason than just being able to have cells that work and have hormones cholesterol is pretty important. Because we're not going to get too far into that. The point I want to make is that you can't traffic or move around cholesterol in the blood stream because blood approximates water. And so the things that move freely in the blood have to be things that are what we call hydrophilic or things that would be soluble in water. So something like glucose can move around the blood stream very easily. And cholesterol cannot. And therefore it needs to be packaged in something that is itself water soluble. And that something is a lipoprotein. And the two dominant lipoproteins that are found in the blood stream are the high-density lipoprotein and the low-density lipoprotein. And their names are referring to their densities in a type of assay called a gel electrophoresis, which has to do with how far these things move on an ion gradient. Other lipoproteins that don't stick around that long. So VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein and IDL or intermediate-density lipoprotein, which is almost non-existent. It has such a short half-life. And the longer residents of the LDL is probably what explains its average density. And that's why LDL is considered the most average genetic particle after LP LLA, which we're going to talk about today. So when you're looking at your blood test, what you're seeing is the cholesterol concentration within the various particles. So when it says total cholesterol, it says, well, if you break apart the HDL particle and the LDL particle and the VLDL particle and if you can find it the ideal particle, how much total cholesterol do you have. And that's a number, 200 milligrams per desoliter. OK, when it says LDL C is 120 milligrams per desoliter. That means if you break apart the LDL cholesterol, that's the concentration of cholesterol contained within them, et cetera. Now, in the past we've talked about the importance of knowing the number of particles, you have, and how that is a more accurate predictor of your atherosclerotic risk. And so the LDLP, which is similar to the APOB in terms of its predictive power, which is the number of particles. And the reason you can use APOB is a surrogate for that is that each LDL particle has an APOB, which is an APO-like protein that wraps around this spherical lipoprotein. It's APOB 100 specifically. So by counting those, since each LDL has one and only one APOB, you can quantify the number of LDL particles. And again, we care about that because it tracks more with risk. The VLDL, the ideal, the LDL, I'll have the APOB 100. The HDL does not. The HDL has something called APOA1. It's a different lipoprotein. And it probably explains in large part why HDL is not atherogenic. And LDL is atherogenic. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is one that's predicated on. And we should probably attach and a link to this, the post on heart disease where I go through this in great, great, and gory detail, the process by which the light lip proteins get through the endothelial space between cells, which is actually not that hard to do. And LDL particle is somewhere between 20, 21, 22 nanometers. It's probably not an order of magnitude, but several multiples of that is the space between the endothelial cells. So it's the size of the LDL particle really doesn't determine the ease with which it gets through the cell or not. Or between the cells, what's much more important is, because most of the LDL that gets into the sub-endothelial space gets right back out. It doesn't cause any trouble. One of the trouble comes is when they get retained and when they get oxidized. And when they kick off an inflammatory response. So it is certainly the case theoretically that you could have a very high LDL, but by hooker by crook, if your LDL particles don't get retained in the sub-endothelial space and don't kick off an inflammatory cascade, you're not going to suffer the effects that you otherwise would. But all things equal, we would love to see a lower LDL particle number because the process by which those particles enter the space seems relatively stochastic. So in a few minutes, that's kind of the overview of these light deprotemies. Okay, so I think one of the reasons why we've had so much interest in LDL is a New York Times article by Onohado Connor. I think it was January this year that was entitled a heart risk factor, even doctors know a little about. And he tells a story of Bob Harper, who was one of the biggest loser, OGs. I think it was him and Jillian, or the two trainers. And so Bob had a heart attack at a gym at age 52. And according to his annual checkups, he always checked out very healthy. And as it turned out, according to the article, Bob has, quote, perilously high levels and, quote, availability of the little anus blood. I think that was, I don't think it was ever measured prior to his heart attack. So I think this article was an introduction to this particle for many people who read it. Not only that, it's reported that a small percentage of physicians actually know about it. So kind of going back to the original question, what is L.P. Little A? Well, in full disclosure, Onohado is a really good friend of mine. And I know he'd been working on that story for about two years actually. I guess I'll take a little bit of credit for getting him interested in APOA and L.P. Little A. And Onohado, because he's just such a curious dude, was sort of like blown away at this. He's like, wait, wait, wait a minute. Tell me about, you know, we walk through everything that we're about to talk about today. And he just couldn't believe that something that was so ubiquitous, probably somewhere between one and five and one in ten people walking around with this elevation. And of course, it's a long tail to the right distribution. So where you define the cutoff as perilously high is a function of how many people will be perilously high. But he just couldn't believe it. And then I introduced him to many of my mentors and he did his own research. And the result of that was a story that I thought was excellent because I can't count the number of patients that sent it to me saying, oh my God, this is that thing you're always talking about. Yeah, so what is this thing? So we talked about the LDL particle number. So it's this spherical thing. Call it 20 nanometers in diameter. And it has a outer spherical structure that is made of lipid cholesterol, phospholipid. Inside it has a core that consists of cholesterol, ester. So this is none. This is like the cholesterol without its bulky side chain and the triglyceride. And on the outside, as I mentioned, it has this one apolipoprotein called apo b100. So we'll just refer to that from now on as the garden variety LDL. Now a subset of these and it's mostly, as we'll probably discuss genetically determined, an inherited and a co-dominant fashion. A subset of these have something else attached to that apo b. And it's attached covalently. So that means that it's not an ionic bond. It's an actual, in other words, it's a much stronger bond. It's a disulfide bond, which in amino acids and in biochemistry tends to be a pretty strong bond. So the apo b has this disulfide bond that attaches it to a totally different bipoprotein and it's called apo little a. And this lipoprotein is made in the liver. And it has a property that it resembles another molecule in the body called plasminogen. Now I suspect that everything about to say is going to not make that much sense until you look at the pictures. This is one of those things where a picture says a thousand words. So what we'll probably do is, and that defeats the purpose of a podcast. I realize because people want to listen to this, but they don't want to have to miss it. Like the picture, but I think this is one of those things where it's worth looking up the picture. But this apo lipoprotein a has a repeated folding structure. These domains are referred to as cringle domains. So we're sort of lost in a nomenclature of apo little a and cringle potato chip folds. And all this stuff and it's just like it's super complicated. But these repeating structures are organized by cringle domains. And there are five of them. Plasminogen that is has five of them. apo a does not have the cringle one, the cringle two, the cringle three. It does have a cringle four that very much resembles plasminogen. And it has the exact same cringle five that comes from the plasminogen. So to distill that again, apo a looks like plasminogen in that it has cringle domain five and a cringle domain four that is similar. But it's the cringle domain four that has 10 sub segments. So you have cringle four one, cringle four two, cringle four three, although you have to cringle four nine and cringle four 10. And if that doesn't have your look at me and you're laughing, it's like it's hard to believe we're talking about it. If this little d-tail, but the cringle four two is where you see the greatest variability. And you can have a cringle four two with just a couple of folds in it. You could have a cringle four two with 40 segments that are repeating. And that determines the mass of LP little A and that's going to become, I wouldn't be telling the story if it weren't for some reason in anticipation of talking about something else. And with the plasminogen and the cringles in the homology, in other words, how similar are they? You're basically saying that if you were to look up, like if you were to look at the structures of both of those, you could very easily confuse one for the other. They look very similar. It probably depends on the similarity during the cringle four because the cringle four tends to dominate it. So I don't want to give an answer that could be incorrect because I suspect it depends on the individual. I think there are some individuals whose ApoA looks more like plasminogen. Because everyone's plasminogen looks the same, but the ApoA is where we see the difference. So we're really dealing with two things, which is how many of your LDLs have those ApoA's attached to them? And then what do your ApoA's look like? And the what they look like is basically what do your cringle segment four subsegment twos look like? Now it turns out that between those two factors, the one that probably matters most, is the number of your LDL particles that also have this covalent bond to the Apo Little A. In other words, it's probably the number of the LDLs that serve the Apo Little A particles bound to the LDL particles through the ApoB or the number of Lp Little A's that matters more than the mass of the Lp Little A. So on that note, I was thinking about ApoB and that there's one ApoB per LDL. And then with ApoA, there's one ApoA per Lp Little A, but not necessarily not every Lp Lp L, but it's for every ApoA is on an LDL. Every ApoA is on an LDL, but not every LDL has an ApoA. And that's the difference between individuals when you look out a population is the how many of their LDLs are rolling around with ApoA's. Now, I don't think we'll get into it today, but if there's ever an appetite to go ultra deep on Lp Little A, we could probably talk about the relationship between ApoE and ApoA. So it turns out that as people may know, you have three different variants of ApoE, you have ApoE2, ApoE3, ApoE4, of course they combine in all six combinations that I'm sure everybody's familiar with. But as you move from the two to the three to the four, you see Lp Little A go up. You see ApoB go up and you see triglyceride go down and this is a pattern that has been demonstrated over and over and over again. And what's interesting is why that's happening with respect to the ApoA, but I get I think that's that's probably more the senior's course rather than the freshman course. Yeah, on the note of the freshman course, just looking at it and thinking, so for we're asking what is Lp Little A? And if you're to look at how it's spelled out, it's capital L lowercase P, parenthetical, lowercase A, and close parentheses. And it's basically saying it's a lipoprotein with an ApoA attached to it. Yeah, and if you were going to come up with an equivalency, you'd do like three little parallel lines as an equal line and say that's equal to LdL, hyphen, little A or little ApoA. It would be like the long hand way to write that. I don't know that anybody's ever written it that way in the literature, but that's just another way to think about it. Okay, so piggybacking on that, can you explain the difference between Lp Little A mass, then there's Lp Little A cholesterol, and then there's the Lp Little A particle content. And then as you mentioned, there's the cringle domains, the number of cringles could also be called the different ApoA isophorms. Can we quantify those? How are those measured? Yeah, I believe the first way this was quantified, and again, this will be the type of stuff that I think would be really fun to explore with a guy like Sam Tamikas, who's probably the world's expert on this topic, and we should definitely make sure we get Sam on the show. I believe Lp Little A mass was the first way that this was quantified, and whether it was the first or not, I don't know, but what I can certainly say is it's by far the most ubiquitous. I'm sure that 19 out of 20 times when a patient is having their Lp Little A checked, it is the mass that is being checked. Certainly, if a patient comes to me and they've been at least fortunate enough to have had their Lp Little A checked, it's a mass. I almost never see the cholesterol checked anymore. I think there used to be a company I believe called Athra Tech that did the test. I think they got bot, or at least that ASA got bot by VAP, and now VAP does it, but I'll explain later why I don't think that's such a great test. And then of course, there's the Lp Little A particle number, which is just the counting of it. So the Lp Little A mass is directionally a reasonable test, but it's not a great test. And the reason is it's measuring for particles that carry ApoA, it's measuring the mass of everything, which is the ApoA. The ApoB, the phospholipids, the cholesterol, the triglycerides, the dogs, the cats, whatever. It's measuring the mass of the entire structure. Now, the larger the cringle section 4 subsection 2, the more that mass is dominated by ApoA, but you can see very quickly how you could be misled. You could take two people that have the exact same Lp Little A mass, but if one of them has a very long segment 4 subsection 2 repeat binding domain. Guess what? He's going to have a much fewer particle number, or more to the point, the person that has the smaller segment 4 subsection 2 is going to actually have more particles. And so those people are not at equal risk. It turns out that the guy that's got more particles is at higher risk. But when a patient shows up and their Lp Little A mass is really, really low, like less than 5 milligrams per deciliter, the likelihood that their Lp Little A particle number is very high is really, really low. And back in the olden days and by the olden days I mean like 4 years ago before Lp Little A particle number was measured, I used to actually look at both. I'd look at Lp Little A mass and Lp Little A cholesterol, acknowledging that neither was perfect, but basically coming up with a 2 by 2, which was if both were high, I knew you had a ton of particles, case closed. If both were low, we were off to the races and high-fiving. And then when one was high, one was low, we would just sort of follow up and test for reasons that we'll probably discuss later around things that could actually change Lp Little A as you marched down the field. But luckily most patients were either double positive or double negative and therefore you had a pretty good sense of where their risk was. You then asked about Lp Little A cholesterol. So that basically is an allegous to measuring the cholesterol content of an LDL particle number. Except here it's measuring the the cholesterol concentration of an Lp Little A particle number. And that again, in isolation is not very helpful. I am not an expert in clinical chemistry, but I've spoken with people who are and it turns out there are some other technical issues with that test that renders it not entirely helpful and also misleading in its own way under certain circumstances. And it's for that reason that I really prefer looking at the Lp little A particle number, which even though it's reported in an animal per liter to my knowledge is not actually measured via NMR, the way LDLP and HDLP were pioneered by light-bus science. It's a different assay, but nevertheless it is counting the apo little A's that are attached to little apo B's. And so you're getting a number of those. And for that test we like to see people less than 50 NAMOL per liter. When people are sort of 52 a hundred, I put them in kind of a gray area when people are over a hundred or certainly over 125 NAMOL per liter. That's when I start to get worried because I often get asked this question. The highest number I've ever seen on a patient is about 650 to 700 NAMOL per liter. And I've got a few patients that walk around it 400, 500 NAMOL per liter. So the Lp little A cholesterol, it sounds a lot like when we're measuring LDLC. So Lp little if you're measuring Lp little A cholesterol, you're measuring the amount of cholesterol that's carried within the Lp little A particles. And similarly with LDLC you're measuring the amount of cholesterol that's carried within the LDL particle. Similarly you would rather know the LDL particle. Yeah, and this is actually what makes it so problematic. It's even worse than the discordance between LDL, P and LDLC because at least when you're dealing with LDL you know the molecular weight. You don't know the molecular weight of LDL. This is actually the point I forgot that I wanted to make a woman ago. I remember once having a patient come to me with everything but the LDL Lp little A P. And I remember thinking, well, I used to be a smart little organic chemistry whipper snapper, I should be able to convert this from milligrams per death's a liter into an animal per liter. And of course anyone listening to this who knows more about chemistry than me will remember that all you need to know is like apricotos number and the molecular weight and you're ready to go. But of course you don't know the molecular weight. That's the problem. Because the APOA is don't look the same. The whole calculation goes to hell in a hand basket. You can't actually calculate the molecular. You don't know the molecular weight because of that cringle sub-segment, the cringle 4 segment 2. Because it's got such variability. It's not like you can say the molecular weight of sodium is x or the molecular weight of testosterone is y. So with the APOA and how it comes in different isophorms, can you measure the APOA? Yes, but it would be for a given individual. That's the point. Yes, you could absolutely measure the molecular weight of an APOA, but it would be like yours and mine would probably be different. So therefore, at least to my knowledge and again, I don't want to speak out a turn because I'm sure someone listening this is going to go, no, no, you know I'll head this is being done. But to my knowledge is not something that's done clinically. Whether it will be or not, again, that's probably a great question for someone like Tom Dasepring or Sam to make us or one of those guys. But I think that today the best test we have is the LP little APOA particle number. And there's a proxy for it, but I'm guessing we'll talk about that later, which is you can also measure the amount of oxidized phospholipid. If you normalize that for APOB, you're getting almost a one to one mapping of that, because there's another interesting little, it's not a trivia point, because trivia tends to be irrelevant. This is actually quite relevant. APO, little A, has lots of lysine, the amino sublicing and lysine really binds oxidized moieties. Now APOB does not contain much lysine at all, and therefore APOB is not particularly effective oxidized moiety scavenger. But APOA is. And so if you think about your rolling around as an LDL, now you got a tail thrown on you, which is called an APOA, right? You got your little disulfide bridge, it attaches to APOB, you got your APOA tail. Only you can see what my hands are doing right now. That's a great idea. This is awesome. We're going to have the worst smile. Yeah. I mean, the pictures are definitely worth a thousand words. As you can see, the the cringle domains, and if you have a longer, you can see like longer tails and shorter tails. Yes, we all make sense. And then once you've got your tail in place, now you start to fill that tail up with all these oxidized phospholipids, you can start to measure. If you measure those phospholipids, normalized for APOB, you're getting a pretty good proxy. Also of that. And by the way, this may actually explain, and this is one of the questions like, you know, when we get Sam on the show, this is one of the questions I want to ask him is just taking a step back from all of this. Sometimes you clinically know when a person has an elevated L.P. little A before you take any blood out of them. These are the patients who don't seem to fit the classic picture of someone with premature heart disease in the family. Nobody's overweight. Nobody's diabetic. Nobody's smoking. Or even if they are, the disease seems to come prematurely. It seems to come out of nowhere. They also tend to, you know, if you ask enough, you might even see that somebody has aortic stenosis. And you just know the answer before you get there, especially if you have their family tree and you can trace it and you can realize that whatever is happening here is coming through dominantly. Is that something, it's a premature cardiovascular disease? Is that a clinical term? Is there like a cut off when you call it? Yeah, I mean, I think loosely we would say someone who's having a major adverse cardiac event before 60 would be premature. Of course, I have a different definition of that. I would think of major adverse cardiac event both before 80 is premature. But I think someone who's having any major adverse cardiac event in May before the age of 60, I think anybody would consider that premature. So what I've never been able to figure out is, you know, that patient of mine that had like an LDL, an LP little A of 650, family history is not outrageous. You know, when people get heart disease, they get it in their 70s. The patient of mine who has the 500, I've tested this patient's family. I know where it came from, I know which parent it came from and the burden of disease is modest. So there is something else going on here. And it's just like the case with, we know that LDLP alone is not the issue. We know that it's just one factor. And similarly, not all LP little A's must be created equal. And so the question I'd want to get into with the next part on this is, does it have to do with the lysine binding domains, the affinity for these oxidized moieties? Is there some feature of one person's versus another? Is that lens to a more aggressive oxidation within the sub-emithial space or greater retention or something like that? I think that gets into why do we have LP little A. So what would be the evolutionary basis? What's the function of LP little A? Like it can't just be some hell particle that's just trying to kill us? I mean, in theory, it could because it kills us through basically three mechanisms that don't tend to kill you young. So if you were taking a purely evolutionary standpoint, I think sometimes bad things track, but it turns out that even like APOE 4, which in today's environment doesn't seem particularly protective, APOE 4 was quite protective against parasitic infections in the CNS. And hell up until a few years ago, that would have been a pretty good thing to have. Of course, now that we can live long enough, that upside isn't worth the downside of an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. So LP little A clearly does two things, but are separate. And I think we could argue at least theoretically that it would have provided a benefit evolutionary. The first is, if you go back to what we talked about, you have this great homology to plasma anogen. And plasma anogen being a clotting factor means that people with elevated LP little A tend to have what's called hypercoagulability. So they have an ability to form blood clots better than someone who doesn't. Now, in today's environment, that's not an advantage because most of us are not in an environment where bleeding to death is a major concern. But you can imagine 50,000 years ago, bleeding to death would actually be a significant concern. And so I think these people would have had a trauma advantage, you know, with respect to, and I'm sure you could probably pose many benefits during childbirth. You know, when I think about what I saw in the OBGYN rounds, how many times was a woman bleeding so sufficiently that she required blood clotting products? It's not unheard of. And so you think about the benefits this could have had all the way from birth, the, you know, the brilliant matured right up until, you know, getting scratched by an animal or whatever. The second benefit is more of a speculation, I think, but it's probably that going back to those lysine binding domains that if you're in a relatively low oxidative environment and you're LP little A's know where to go when they're done, which is to the liver and where not to go, which is the coronary arteries in the eordic valve. There are actually amazing scavengers. So I'm sure somebody out there's got better data on this or has data period because I'm obviously speculating, but you could make the case that being able to have more particles that can scavenge more of these oxidized phospholibids and oxidized moieties and take them back to the liver, which is the ultimate place of clearance for the LP little A, which is a totally safe place to take these things, that would pose an advantage. And it would be the case today that maybe we're in a higher inflammatory environment and maybe we've gone too far. In other words, maybe we're overwhelming the system's ability to clear it. And on top of that, we may have other risk factors, hypertension, hyper-insulinemia, other drivers of inflammation that are now giving these LP little A's another place to go, which is, yeah, you're ultimately going to end up at the liver, but like 6% of you are going to get stuck in the sub-endothelial space and wreak havoc. And on top of that, you're doing a way worse job than the LDLP because the LDLP when it gets there is bad enough, but the LP little A is now dragging all that oxidized crap in there with it. So the next question is what is the problem with elevated LP little A or what are the problems with LP little A elevated? So basically, they fit into sort of three categories. The first being enhanced attherosclerosis. The second, I don't know which by magnitude would pose a bigger threat, but probably aortic stenosis given the severity and then the third being enhanced, venous thrombosis. So what does those things mean? So so basically, more attherosclerosis, more aortic stenosis, I believe about two thirds of the cases of aortic stenosis are explained by elevated LP little A. So you have four valves in the heart and one of them is called the aortic valve. That's the valve that separates the left ventricle from the systemic system. So the proximal aorta. So that valve is under more pressure than the other three valves by a long shot because it's the one that's directly in front of the most powerful chamber of the heart. That valve has three leaflets. It's a tri leaflet valve and it seems that LP little A has a particular affinity for going there and inducing bone-forming proteins to create calcifications. And when that valve loses its suppleness and it becomes calcified, you get basically a blockage of that valve called the stenosis. And so this condition of aortic stenosis is very problematic. One of the earlier signs in the blood that somebody has aortic stenosis would be signs of swelling or enlargement or dilation of the heart. And there are blood markers like brain-naturedic peptide, BNP or pro-NTBNP that are actually used quite frequently in ERs to assess patients very quickly for cardiomyopathy or cardiac failure. And so that's one of those things that we like to look at. And if I see a patient with LP little A, I'm always screening them for aortic stenosis out of the gate. I don't care if they're 30 years old. I mean, many of our patients are in their 30s and 40s. But if they have an elevated LP little A, we're doing echo at a minimum and preferably cardiac MRI, which is much more accurate, to both look at the morphology of the aortic valve and get a very accurate gradient of pressure. And then sometimes you'll get patients, I have a patient who has a bypassed aortic valve, which is going to be eaten by itself. That's predisposed to aortic stenosis. And he also has a very elevated LP little A, about 250 or 300. So even though he's only in his 30s, he gets a cardiac MRI annually and he's already showing a pressured gradient. So, you know, I've explained to him that he is going to need an intervention at some point in his life. But the good news is we're going to do it long before he experiences any strain on his heart muscle. And the good news again for patients today is this stuff's going to be done interventionally and not via open heart surgery as it once was. On the atherosclerosis side, I think the Mendelian randomizations, the GWAS and the Epidemiology, all televary similar story, I suspect that it's both its ability. It's probably an all of the above when it comes to why. Meaning it's, are these particles more likely to enter the seven video space? I don't know why that would be the case. Are they more likely to be retained? Probably because they have that whole big cringle oxidized moiety thing there. Are they more likely to kick off an inflammatory response? Very likely because of what they're dragging in with them. And then on top of that, to have the pro- thrombotic component, I suspect is what's driving the increase in the risk of atherosclerosis. But in truth, we don't have definitive proof that LP little A is as a more atherogenic particle. And you and I were talking about this the other day that there is this paper that actually was looking at patients with post MIs and even suggesting that, well, everybody who has an MIs has a rise in LP little A. And we'll probably get to that later why we think that might be the case. But the question posed as, well, maybe LP little A is the result of atherosclerosis and not the cause of it. I don't agree with that because many post MIs patients don't have an elevated LP little A. And I think a better explanation for that is that LP little A also acts as an acute phase reactant rising with inflammatory responses. But probably not until the anti-sensalago nucleotide trials complete, will we actually know the answer to this question? Because really without a clinical trial, you can't actually infer cause and effect the way we can with other aspects of atherosclerosis like the LDL particle or inflammation, where we have elegant prospective clinical trials that create a relationship between cause and effect. The last thing that I guess I mentioned was the thromboembolism. So I used to have a practice of putting everybody within elevated APO, LP little A on a baby aspirin just to combat the effect. It turns out that that was probably an oversimplified approach and that there's only a subset of people for whom aspirin counteracts the effect. So unfortunately, this is still one of those things where I don't think we have a great answer. I do take DVT prophylaxis, so deep vein thrombocies prophylaxis and prevention. I do take it more seriously in the LP little A patients and there are certain strategies you can take around flying. There's actually a commercially available product called flight tabs, which you can buy on Amazon. I was, remember when we did the research on this? I was blown away that you could buy these things on Amazon because they're actually quite potent. But I do recommend that people with elevated LP little A if they're on really long flights and again, I'm not recommending that for people who are listening cause I can't, but it's really recommend to my patients to a subset of them that we're particularly worried about that we look at either pharmacologic agents or even an OTC agent like that as a way to reduce the risk of these types of events. So do we know how much elevated LP little A is associated with these increased risks? If we're looking at the epidemiology, what are the associated risks with cardiovascular disease? So with the Yordics to Noces, the hazard ratios are anywhere from 2 to 4 depending on the studies and I think they probably median ends up being roughly 2 and a half. With VTE, with the Venus Thrombo Emboism, I think the hazard ratio is about 3x. And again, it's important to put this in perspective. We've talked about absolute versus relative risk. So when you talk about a 3x risk of something that occurs like 1% of the time, that means you're going from a 1% absolute risk to a 3% absolute risk. So in other words, it doesn't mean like if you're listening to this and you have an elevated LP little A, you need to call an ambulance to drive you home because you're afraid you're going to have a pulmonary embolism. And similarly, a hazard ratio of 2 and a half, 3, even 4 on a Yordics to Noces. As I said, it probably explains about 2-3rds of the total volume of a Yordics to Noces, but it doesn't mean that every patient who's got this is going to get it. I think in the case of that one patient of mine, his buy-cuspid valve is just a setup to make things worse because he's now got a double whammy on that. And when it comes to atherosclerosis, basically you see odds ratios of about 2 to 4 depending on the amount. So it's, it looks like a pretty good dose response where it sort of below about 30 or 40 milligrams per desoliter because unfortunately all of these studies are done with LP little A mass and not particle number and I can't really convert that, but we believe that that's probably about 50. That's probably, you're going to get comparable in the 50 to 75, nanomole per liter is this sort of safe zone where it's relatively flat and then it starts to uptick pretty swiftly. So by the time you're at call it 200 milligrams per desoliter, you're at about a 60% increase. Now, if you stop from moving and think about that, what should you be more afraid of? A three X hazard ratio for VTE or a 1.6 hazard ratio for atherosclerosis or a 2.5 X hazard ratio on aortic stenosis. This is like the advanced clinical epidemiology question, right? I think the answer is the 1.6 on atherosclerosis is by far the most disconcerting because atherosclerosis is infinitely more prevalent. So a 60% increase in risk on something that is going to kill a third of people is a big effing problem. Whereas a 3% risk on something that's going to you know, ding 1% of people, yeah, we'll manage it, but that's not what we stay up late thinking about. And even for that particular individual that has that risk profile, that if they look at their absolute risks, that probably bumps up their absolute risk the most with cardiovascular disease. Yeah, we're screening for aortic stenosis, not because I necessarily think it's even, you know, at the population or societal level cost effective, but at the individual level, we're not going to let that kind of stuff slide. But if you were to think about this at the population level, the thing we have to be most concerned of is somewhere between 1 and 5 and 1 and 10 people, and in some cultures it's even higher, and Southeast Asians it's even higher, are walking around with these little time bombs, and to the point of Anahad story, I'm still shocked at how many doctors don't understand this. Now look, if you're a radiologist, great dermatologist, that's okay. I don't think you need to know this. But if you sit anywhere on the front lines of medicine, if you're a family physician, if you're a GYN even, because for many women, their GYNs become their PCPs, the primary care physicians. If you are anywhere in the crosshairs of taking care of a patient where you have some input into how they lower their risk of cardiovascular disease, and you don't understand most of what we're talking about on this podcast, I worry that you're missing an opportunity to help patients. Okay, so another question that came in, I think you touched upon it very quickly, is what is the prevalence of elevated LP little A? Probably what is elevated LP little A? How is that determined? Well, to my knowledge, everything that's done on this that's published is based on the LP little A mass, not the particle number. But the US levels define normal as less than 30 milligrams per deciliter. The European Atherosclerotic Society defines normal as less than 50 milligrams per deciliter. And I believe both the UK and Germany consider anything over 60 sufficient for state covered A for recess. A for recess is a type of treatment where a patient has a very large IV put in one arm typically about a 14 gauge and blood is taken out, run through a machine that spins at a certain frequency to generate a separation of the plasma and you can basically fractionate the plasma and identify something that you want to remove. So back when I was at an IH, I used to volunteer for a for recess every four weeks to donate lymphocytes. And then they basically put everything back that once they strip out the piece they want. But you can actually do a for recess and remove the apolittle A. The problem is the frequency with which you have to do it is staggering because the half life of these particles is a matter of days. So these patients would undergo a for recess potentially twice a week. So that's obviously a very difficult way to be so we got into it a little bit there. How is abnormal LP little A treated or dealt with? So you just got into the A for recess. Other therapies currently available. So A for recess is that's something that we just really never resort to or very rarely resort to. And then certainly now that PCS can't even inhibitors are on the market, I think that A for recess is becoming probably less and less utilized. Historically the agent for treatment has been niacin. A niacin's got kind of a checkered history because it's known to lower APOB. So you take niacin, your LDL goes down. And this is a super contentious topic in lipid circles. But the question is does niacin save lives? And depending on how you look at the trial data the answer is maybe or no. It's like a wonder drug theoretically right at lower LDL. It HDL goes up. LP little A might go down. Yep. So on paper it looks at least up to that point. It looks great. Right. That's exactly right. It does three things that we historically know when they happen. Good things should happen. LDL particle and cholesterol. APOB all go down. HDL cholesterol goes up. Although I would argue that that's not a good thing. I think we have a pretty good sense of why raising HDL cholesterol in organically meaning pharmacologically is not going to be good. And it lowers LDL pylidolai by probably a third. So see it's up inhibitors? Yeah exactly. It's times the charm. I think we're waiting for number five. Yeah. Yeah. But it turns out that in the trial that basically doomed niacin the trial probably wasn't designed that well. In that they were giving niacin to patients who were already on a max dose statin and looking for the HDL increase to see if that was adding benefit. And so you basically get lipidologists in two camps. And actually it's not. It's quite evenly split at least in my narrow sampling of smart lipidologists where you get some who say niacin should never be used. And then you get others who say look it's probably not a great drug. But if you have a patient who can't take anything else it's still a good drug. And I know lots of lipidologists who are still putting LP LL A patients on niacin. Even though there are no data to suggest that that will save their lives. But I got to be honest with you. I'm not convinced that that's an extraly a bad thing. I generally don't. I now move to the third thing which is the PCS can 9 inhibitor. But I guess before I do that I should explain statins because everybody is probably saying where to statins fit into this. And it turns out statins don't clear LP LL A which is kind of counterintuitive if you know how statins work. So statins work via two mechanisms what we call sort of the direct and indirect mechanism. So the direct mechanism is that they inhibit HMG coA reductase which is an enzyme that catalyzes one of the early steps if not the first step I believe of cholesterol synthesis. So if you're making less cholesterol you would have less cholesterol there would be less cholesterol the carry around you could require fewer lipoproteins. But that's not really the main way it works. The main way it works is that the liver in response to the statin upregulates something called SREBP2. And when that thing gets upregulated it puts more LDL receptors on the surface of the liver. So this SREBP2, which I'll just abbreviate for short is called the sterile regulatory element binding protein. It basically says hey the liver is getting less cholesterol and it wants more cholesterol so I'm going to put more of these LDL receptors on my surface to pull more in. Now I didn't know this until recently but one of the other things that SREBP2 does is it actually produces more PCSK9. Now PCSK9 is a protein that degrades LDL receptors. So it's actually a bit of a check in a balance. So you have more LDL clearance because of more LDL receptors but you also speed up the rate at which those LDL receptors are degraded. So the statin is causing these two indirect effects but the net tends to be an enhanced clearance of the LDL particle, the APOB particle and therefore a lowering of the LDL cholesterol. But it doesn't lower LP little A and if you're listening to this and you remember what we talked about at the outset you're probably thinking that doesn't make sense LP little A is just an LDL with an APOA on it. Why wouldn't the LDL receptor clear it? Because if the LDL receptor clears it, it should also go down. I asked Tom Dasebring about this because I really interesting paper came out a few weeks ago that actually tried to explain this and like all good papers it ended up leaving more questions than answers. The best explanation that I understood from Tom was that LP little A will get cleared by LDL receptors eventually but it's just the last in line. So after the LDL is cleared and the VLDL is cleared yeah then you might get to the LP little A. But the problem is you never get there. So maybe in theory if you increase LDL receptor expression enough or if you could knock out PCSK9 and offset the second piece of what the statin is doing the statin would work and it turns out that that is largely what this paper showed and what we've always known which is when you combine a PCSK inhibitor with a statin you actually do get a reduction of LP little A whereas statin by itself is anywhere from no reduction to in some studies and actual increase in LP little A and PCSK9 alone also lowers LP little A. So to be clear PCSK9 inhibitors are not FDA approved for the use of lowering LP little A but those of us who prescribe these drugs both for patients with other indications and with LP little A generally acknowledged that we're seeing about a 30% reduction in LP little A sometimes as high as a 50% reduction in LP little A when patients are taking PCSK9 inhibitors with or without statins and that also probably speaks to the fact that we know that LP little A is cleared by different receptors. So it's primary receptor is probably LRP2 but it's also probably cleared somewhat by VLDL receptors and even something called SRB1 although I'm not sure of that and frankly I don't know that anybody is so that what the PCSK9 inhibitor is doing is it's inhibiting PCSK9 and therefore inhibiting the protein that degrades not just the LDL receptor but these other receptors that clear LP little A interesting. Sure. Yeah. I was just thinking about something on statins. So oftentimes I'll read in the papers just to back up for a second too. I often read in the papers LP little A the words mysterious unknown like in some ways we're in our infancy and understanding this but I think in one of those papers Samika's looked at the effect of statins and not only just statins in general but different statins the Torvastatin, Pravastatin, Petivastatin live a low it resubestatin and Simvestatin. I think maybe that covers all the statins. If I'm just looking at his data the LP little A actually looks like it's trending up on statins not only that the oxidized phospholipids to APOB are also going up. Is there any explanation as to why the thing is to be elevated? Yeah because the APOB is probably going down. It's probably that you're lowering the the nominator. Got it. That's my guess. What's clearly acknowledged is that when you give a patient with elevated LP little A a statin which we do absolutely it's not to lower the LP little A it's to lower the LDL so actually I'm glad you brought this up because I didn't I sort of missed the punchline in all the detail. At least one of the punchlines is how do we treat patients with elevated LP little A? Well we're probably not going to give them for recess if they can't afford to buy a PCS canine inhibitor because it's certainly not going to be approved. You have only one other choice which is to actually have two other choices but I'll get to one in a moment. It's it rarely works but it works occasionally but your real issue is you have to give them a statin because you now have a new LDL targets. Am I LDL target when I say LDL I'm always referring to LDLP? My LDLP target is the 20th percent dollar lower for every patient but how much lower you go than that is a function of other risk factors. So are we talking about secondary prevention? What's the family history? Are they insulin resistant? You know all these other factors but a patient who's at got an elevated LP little A immediately falls into the category of all things equal they're at the 10th percent dollar lower and so you will often need a statin to get them they're not not always. I have some patients who don't need a statin to get their LP little their LDLP down to the 10th percentile but they're the exception and not the rule so that's where I don't want to I don't want people to get the impression that if you have an LDLP little you shouldn't be taking a statin. No it's quite the opposite you probably should be taking a statin but just understand that the statin is there to control APOB and not LP little A. Okay and I don't know if we have enough ammo to cover this but hormone therapy estrogen I think has been shown to lower LP little A. I didn't know that actually. This is an up-to-date which is a nice service that compiles a lot of this information almost like a review systematic review and they have a section on lip reporting little A and cardiovascular disease and lip it lowering and one of the things that they noted was estrogen replacement therapy reduces LP little A levels by up to 50 percent and they have a couple references there and effect it was somewhat mitigated by concomitant, pregesterone therapy and some reports. I don't know if that's a women's health initiative so we're probably dealing with different variables but not the Peppy trial. However the clinical role for hormone replacement therapy isn't certain and it does not recommend it for cardiovascular disease risk reduction so if that HRT topic wasn't compelling enough to go over I think there's another reason another just wrinkle the throw in there. Yeah I'd like to understand that better that strikes me as a bit too good to be true frankly because certainly there are I mean if that's true that's one it's suggested might only be it so I guess the question I would want to know is does that imply that women who go through menopause wouldn't they see an increase in LP little A all things equal if they did not receive HRT that belief so yeah I'm going to go look at the LP little A levels of my patients who have gone through menopause while under my care but nothing jumps out at me. There was one other thing we we didn't talk about which is what's on the front lines here in terms of really interesting stuff which is these things called ASOs which is really the first treatment that is designed specifically to lower LP little A so the ASO stands for anti-sense all you go nucleotide so these are molecules that disrupt protein synthesis so I can't remember exactly where they ask I think they act after the messenger RNA between messenger RNA and translational RNA but maybe they act between DNA and messenger RNA I should know this I'm sure there's like I'm sure that's a very well known obvious fact that I'm just forgetting but the point is they disrupt the synthesis of APOA which is occurring in the liver so this is a drug that goes right to the heart of LP little A and I didn't say this earlier but it's worth pointing this out when you go through my whole ringer role on why do statins probably not decrease LP little A it doesn't appear that anything that's going to lower LP little A is going to do it on the catabolism side meaning the breakdown side it appears to be on the synthesis side the making side and so while the monoclonal antibody is like the PCSK9s also increase degradation they reduce the synthesis they're actually reducing the synthesis of APO little A and the liver as well so these anti-sense all I go nucleotides go right to the heart of that and they directly stop the synthesis of APO little A and therefore you have your garden variety LDLs these drugs have have been shown to have safety and efficacy so they have concluded phase one and phase two trials and they are slowly enrolling in phase three trials I think three years ago I said they'd be done in five years three years later I think will be done in five years consistent yeah the frequency distribution figure that will include somewhere it shows effective anti-sense all-ego nucleotides it says around 70% up to 99% so could potentially wipe out virtually wipe out LP little A yeah no even somebody who's got an LP little A of 200 can be normalized I'm a little area of wiping out something entirely it's certainly suggested if you have this ASO you can test a hypothesis in terms of LP little A lowering therapy for sure well that's what I was referring to at the outset which was until this trial is done I don't think we can definitively know the answer of what is the true risk how do you quantify the true risk of LP little A I think we got through a lot of the major questions this is awesome we like didn't have to go for four hours there's a bonus question we're in the bonus round others some other stuff we can talk about too as well I think getting into the oxidized fossil lipids how that works in the LP PLA too we could get into but one of the things that I was thinking about is that with lipoproteins with LDL with HDL even triglycerides like you have some tools in your arsenal just in terms of let's call them behavioral modifications or things like that if you challenge somebody or somebody said I need to lower my triglycerides in like in 30 days or else you could probably do that through diet absolutely I mean triglycerides by far the most sensitive thing in the blood as far as lipoprotein lipid related amolicules to dietary intervention yeah in theory it sounds like you can play around with a lot of the lipoproteins actually a lot of the markers by our markers but it seems like with LP little A doesn't seem like it can be modified all that much by lifestyle is that right or is it correct thinking no that's absolutely correct and probably the reason for that is as we just learned from the PCSK9 statin comparisons directionally speaking there are two things that are driving LP little A how much you make and how much you clear but the game seems to be one and lost on the how much you make front the how much you clear seems to be a second order thing now when you look at LDLP just a contrast it never mind triglycerides when you look at LDLP you go back to four things that determine the number of those particles three of them have to do with how much you carry one of them has to do with how much you clear so three about the cargo one about the port how many triglycerides do have how much cholesterol do you synthesize how much esterified cholesterol or nonesterephide cholesterol rather do you reabsorb in the after it passes through the biliary system in the inner site and then what's your LDL receptor profile look like primarily in the liver but also in the gut now we just established you can clearly lower triglycerides through nutrition so you got somebody walking around with the triglyceride of 200 and an LDLP of 1600 and you do nothing but lower their triglycerides to 50 while I can't predict what their reduction is going to be it's likely going to go down and so that's a lifestyle intervention and that clearly does things and it turns out that we know that diet is also going to lower or raise certainly it has an impact on LDLC that is known but it also can have an effect on LDLP through cholesterol synthesis and absorption now I think that that I think the the relationship there is much less clearly understood I've speculated about what what I see occurring there seems to be a subset of people who when they consume high amounts of saturated fat see a really significant increase in cholesterol synthesis I think Tom Dasebring has written a really eloquent piece on this so if we can find it if it's publicly available we should link to it because I think it's a great piece on the hypothesis around why certain people in the presence of high saturated fat just start making much more cholesterol and then of course the contentious topic is doesn't matter right we know the answer to that question but that's a point I was among them at one point I think it's you get an NMR and it gives you your LDLP count is it in nanomoles and it actually reminded me of a fletch and Gillette collecting rent I believe and he picks up one of Gillette's letters and he says oh a letter from the Oakwood Potency Clinic we're sorry to inform you we can't process sperm counts as low as yours so in the case of this NMR I get the test back and you you probably know the number maybe it's like 2500 or the upper cut office 3,53500 and it has a one of those awesome greater than signs it's great than 3,500 so we're sorry our machines can't process LDL particles is high as you and I think during the time I was doing an experiment we're as eating a lot of my calories were coming from saturated fat it was probably a supposedly a well formulated ketogenic diet but a coconut oil maybe some of us coconut oil but are etc but it was heavily loaded with saturated fat but I would love to read that article and because it's one of those things it's gone around the circles is it good is it bad but it is definitely something that's seen I think yeah I mean given how amazing we've made progress on this and how we've barely been out for an hour and we're almost done I mean I'm happy to expand on this just based on my observations because I'm sure someone's gonna end up asking anyway I've probably seen this now it doesn't times where either someone comes to me already on a ketogenic diet or we put them on a ketogenic diet and they develop this this change in their lipids now there are some people who will argue that it's transient and it's gonna go away in you know a year or two years or whatever maybe so there are others that argue that it's irrelevant that the increase in the cholesterol synthesis and the LDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol is actually a good thing and there's some reason that they offer for that that I don't quite buy or understand but my view is all things equal until I know better I'm gonna assume at high LDL is probably problematic and more importantly the point is are there ways to reverse the diet and reverse the condition and figure out what was the component within the diet that was doing and was it the total fat was the subset of the fat et cetera and in God all but one of those cases of maybe a dozen when you just replace the saturated fat with mono-unsaturated fat even if they stay consuming a very high fat diet the problem goes away which has not that that's proof of anything but that really suggests to me that in those patients they're getting more saturated fat than they can process because you know I had one the first patient that I ever went through this with my first thought was dude we got to take you off this ketogenic diet man like I'm not we can play keto camp all day long but I'm not that comfortable with these numbers and he was like but you know I'm not going off a ketogenic diet like you know and he had all his reasons for why he you know felt better and performed better and all those things so I said okay well then we could keep you on a ketogenic diet but we got to I want to see what happens if your saturated fat goes from 75 grams a day to 25 grams a day and to do that you're gonna get really familiar and friendly with olives olive oil and macadamian nuts and he's like I don't care you know he was a young guy and he was he'd do anything he was kind of like a robot and so sure enough and like eight weeks of that change his LDLP went from greater than 3500 to you know 1200 same thing I had a lot of guacamole macadamian nuts that replaced the saturated fat and the numbers came down and everything else guiber take H.D.L. triglycerides all that stuff for sort of in the same ballpark as before but that LDLP came down yeah and I got to tell you I mean I'm sure that this will kick up a storm of people with you know very very strong religious like views on oh there's nothing wrong with an LDLP of 3500 and you know again I don't buy it because the other thing I don't buy is a lot of those times you'll see the oxidized LDL go up as well and and and how are we in the middle of it and some knuckle head dressed like rag racing on 79 I don't get that like it's not as grittuited as it was going to be so nice to think we should we should get involved wrap up the engines he likes cars we just need some jack cameras right now so yeah when I see the oxidized LDL and CRP go up as well which I often see with that then I think you know there's something else going on here this isn't just a cholesterol synthesis problem it's an inflammatory problem something is not I mean and look I wasn't that guy I mean I probably ate when I was in ketosis that's probably eating 200 grams a day of saturated fat maybe not quite that much maybe one 50 but I was eating a lot of saturated fat but I didn't have any of those response you know my CRP was really low my Triggs were not exist in my LDL particle number was probably around the 50th percentile you know 12 to 1300 animal per leader like I just didn't have any of those findings and again I see a lot of people who don't have those things so I don't know why some people have these paradoxical reactions but I also don't think it's safe to ignore them just because insulin levels have gone down and going back to oxidized LDL if you saw oxidized LDL going up my new be understanding of this is that oxidized LDL is in a sense L P little A so that L P little A well that's when it's oxidized phospholipid yeah so the L P little A picks up the oxidized phospholipids frame the lipoprotein from the LDL yep and then that L P little A particle itself is now carrying the oxidized phospholipids but that's not a oxidized LDL no the ox LDL assay is different from the ox PL assay the ox LDL assay works independent of how many apoAs you have okay I like to see that number below 40 again I think the lab likes to see it below 60 but I like to see that along with the L P P L A 2 which you alluded to earlier these are really local markers of inflammation and those are important because if you see a patient with an elevated C reactive protein should you be concerned about it I mean yes probably but the question is is it cardiac specific or not you can't really tell so that's why looking at fibernogen and C reactive protein and homocysteine and L P P L A 2 and oxidized LDL help you get a better picture of if there's inflammation how much of this do we think is going on locally at a vascular level you know versus some place else this is you know you see this all the time and people who have food insensitivities and things like that with respect to the fibernogen is CRP yeah it's a well probably throwing those figures you just mentioned that the L P PLA 2 and L P little A and then ox then there's another thing called it's the ox that is phospholipids over the apoB and in that paper it's a 2007 paper and I think Samica says the last author on it as well he's all over the place they show the hazard ratios and it's a J curve so that the very the lowest they call the sex style so they have they partitioned into six different groups on the lowest if you look at the hazard ratio the hazard ratios about two so the risk doubles if you have very low L P little A does he explain why he thinks that's happening I'm not I wonder if it's an artifact of apob being higher possibly the denominator going up which shrinks the total number I'll have to look at that and there are any other L P little A questions that came through the inner webs not through the inner webs well then I think we can bring to a close our inaugural chapter one chapter one vote on what you want to hear about any final words Bob it's interesting I knew about L P little A a little bit prior to Bonnaud's article in January and after doing some digging there's there's some other thoughts about this stuff that I'm sure we'll get into down the road but it's that proverb I think this seemed to lab quotes it says he says it's a Venetian proverb it says the further from the shore the deeper the water and so the more you dig into this the more you learn the less you know in a sense it's you sort of expose yourself to a lot of unknowns so it's absolutely fascinating and I think it it also gets to how most physicians don't even know about this stuff and you alluded to it and one of our conversations previously that there's this lag in terms of the medical knowledge and what's the accepted wisdom and the guidelines and things like that so I think L P little A is one of those cases that's just it's fascinating and it's the more you learn the less you know but the more you want to learn yeah and we're really as you pointed out earlier in our infancy of this thing yeah if we were just gonna put numbers to it I think five years ago I had 50% understanding like one unit of understanding to two units of perceived total volume of content today I'm at 10% understanding 10 units of understanding to 100 units of perceived total content so has my knowledge gone up in five years yeah it's gone up tenfold the problem is my appreciation for how much information is out there on this topic has gone up 50 folds so my relative insight has actually gone down fivefold what is that it sounds like the done in Kruger effect a little bit it's that when you know like just like the surface level that's when you're the most confident you think you know everything and then as you learn more it's like that done in Kruger it's like a you and then your confidence in your knowledge goes down hey welcome to the 24 hour news cycle cable TV and Twitter man I don't know if that's done in your Kruger but it's on the left side everybody's very confident well in summary I'd say the following if you're listening to this as a patient you should demand that you're LP little AB now and it's non-negotiable especially if you're a family history of a thosocratic disease if you're physician and this is your first exposure to it I hope that we've invited you to learn more and I hope that we've provided you with enough information that you're sufficiently curious and and we'll certainly make a point to link to this some of the what we think are more relevant things worth noting I think about three days ago a nice CD 10 code was actually just issued for elevated LP little A that's a pretty big deal that's like one of the signs that it's not some little nerds only thing once you once you get your iCD 9 code issued or iCD 10 rather and if you are neither a patient nor a physician I don't know what you are and therefore this podcast probably is not for you you can find all of this information and more at peteratiamed.com

Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top-performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at PeterAtiaMD.com. In this episode, I interview my friend Tom Billew. Tom is the co-founder of Quest Nutrition. Many of you have undoubtedly heard of this. They make obviously quest bars and a number of other products, but I think quest bars are sort of what put them on the map and keeps them on the map. Tom is one of three co-founders, and I know two of the three quite well, including Tom. He's also the host of something called Impact Theory, which we spent quite a bit of time talking about. I knew a lot less about Impact Theory and his work there than I knew about Quest. His mission in creating this was to create this sort of idea of what he calls an empowering media-based platform for accelerating mission-based businesses. Tom is incredibly driven, and I think that comes across in this discussion. I've sometimes been accused of being a little too hyper, but when I'm around Tom, I actually sort of feel like I'm on Quay Ludes or something given how much he's just sort of salivating. And just so passionately jumping out of his seat to basically tell you about something that is generally really interesting and really, really helpful. He's just a completely driven mission guy. I learned a lot about Tom on this episode that I didn't know. I've known Tom for probably five years, maybe six years, but one thing I didn't know was that in the history of Quest, he basically interviewed virtually every person that was hired. And this is a behemoth company. And I'm not just saying that he was interviewing people who were applying for jobs in the C-suite. I mean, if you were applying for a job on the production line, Tom wanted to interview you, and he would always ask people the same sorts of questions. And there was one question in particular that he asked everybody I was actually kind of surprised by the answer. That in this sense, his time at Quest became a little bit of a laboratory for what he ended up doing later on and what he's doing today and where I think he's going. So in this episode, we're going to talk a lot about Tom's history with dieting and how he changed his views on fat and fasting. And he had quite a radical transformation there. His Quest for immortality, which if you've ever heard me talk on this subject, I'm not convinced that that's desirable or plausible. But I certainly love hearing about others talk about it. His background and what led to the co-founding of Quest probably one of my favorite stories because it really speaks to following your bliss versus following the dollars, which I think many great entrepreneurs will tell you is their secret. What he describes is a growth versus fixed mindset. I think this is a really important concept. And I think it is worth paying attention to that. Why he would interview everyone. He talked to or hired at Quest. And again, I was surprised by that. That was a completely new fact. We talk about why he started impact theory and we talk about what fulfillment means to Tom. Now you'll be able to find a lot more information about Tom and some of the things that we talk about on the show inside the show notes, which will be at Peter at tiamed.com forward slash podcast. So without further delay, here is my discussion with my friend Tom Billy. Tom, yes. Thank you so much for inviting me to your lovely place. My pleasure, man. I wanted to get you on my show forever. So I know I feel like a real kind of jerk because you've been asking me for so long and I've been saying, yep, you up. And then I pulled the bait and switch and got you on the line. But good. I promise you if you still want me, I'm going to do it in a heartbeat. It would be amazing. Well, just before we started, I met your wife for the very first time, which I'm shocked by. I still can't believe we've known each other this long and you've never met my wife. And that's what prompted me to remember that it was about five years ago. That Dom, Dagestino, and I came up to meet with, I think at the time, just you and Ron, well, the first meeting I think was even with just Ron. I remember coming back and he was like, oh, we're into fat now. And I was like, that just seems crazy. Because at the point, I was truly, truly rabbit starvation and had had massive success with it. And I did that because I was legitimately fat phobic. I was one of those dumbasses that was like, what's fat? Do you know what? Obviously it makes you fat. But that was me like, I already had a nutrition company at that point. That's the crazy part. So when I came back and I remember where I was and he was like, oh, yeah, we met with this guy, Peter Retilla, Dom Dagestino, and they really made me believe in fat. And I just thought, whoa, like, what a strange new world I've walked into. And then it ended up changing my life. It's interesting because I've heard Ron say that many times. I've never heard you say what you just said. But I've seen video clips of Ron talking about this. And I can't believe that the meeting that Dom and I had with you guys could have had such an impact on a company that was already on quite a trajectory. Yeah. When you seek out disconfirming evidence, like when you actually want to know how you're wrong and you meet somebody that is really a smart and be just so well educated on a particular topic, it's like a fireworks moment. You long for those things. Because it's like, look, my sub optimal life has gotten me this far. Like I've already achieved all of this, living like a fool in some way that I'm as of yet unaware of. If I can become aware of that thing and then make different choices, then can my life be different. The reason that it had such a big effect is because that's how we look at the world. It's like, I want to know how I'm wrong. I want to know in what ways I'm suboptimal. And so you guys coming in and making such a compelling case for fat, I ended up trying it really soon after you guys came because the thing for me and I'm actually super curious to get your beat on where this is still. But at the time, you guys are saying, look, there might be some anti cancer properties. And so I am obsessed with, I don't know if we've ever talked about this, I'm obsessed legitimately with living forever. And what's the Woody on quote, I want to live forever by not dying. Not by having my works to go on. So I really, truly want to live forever. That's something that's captured my imagination since I was a little kid. So when you guys were talking about anti cancer properties, I said, all right, I got to give this a shot. And I did it and I hated it in ways you can't imagine I was doing a four to one. I was in therapeutic range. So my what ketone bodies were north of three and my glucose levels were like, low 60s if I remember right. And I felt so sick, like it was crazy. And I was warned, hey, there's the same called the keto flu. So when it was happening, I was like, well, hey, I found it. And I just thought, I just need to get through, you know, I forget how long I was staying therapeutic. But like, let's call it five days. I'm going to stay in the therapeutic range for five days. It's total misery, but like I can gut it out. And I made it through and I was like, I'm never doing that again. It was so miserable. But in that time, I went from chronic risk pain. I'd been icing my wrists up to two times a day every day for 15 years. And I had like these little burn patches on my wrist from where the ice touch because I was just icing so frequently. It was crazy. And I was like to just get through the day. But I had lost all this weight dude. So I was 230 pounds. I go on a rabbit starvation diet, which all defined as ultra high protein, probably north of 80% of my calories were protein. And then just as little fat and as little carbohydrate as I could possibly intake. So I was doing basically a lot of steamed chicken breast with nothing but salt on it. And that was it. And I would eat basically, I don't know. I was probably, I would oscillate between 1200 and 1500 calories a day. And I did this for roughly two years. And I went from 230 to about 170 and lost 60 pounds. And it was pure insanity. And I looked so good dude. I was shredded best optical shape of my life. And I just wanted to stare at my abs a day. It was amazing. So I'm walking into this whole fat thing with that, right? Like 50 cents said I came into the game humble. Can't nobody tell me shit now. It's like when I got lean, I was like, I've got this figured out. Like there's nothing left. And I just, I thought I had a dialed in. I knew what to do and never once did it occur to me that that was making my wrist 10 times worse. And so when you guys came in and said hey, and to cancer properties, I do it. I hate it. But in the middle of all that, I realize my wrists don't feel better. They feel perfect. And I remember coming into work going, this is the worst experience of my life. It is so unpleasurable to be in therapeutic range katosis, not knowing how to supplement. But guys, it is like a drug like effect on my wrist. I'm never, this is crazy. And it's just eating. So I said I'm never taking fat out of my diet again. I was like there clearly was something to sell membranes, anti-inflammatory. Like there were all kinds of things about the importance of fat that I just wasn't appreciating. And now I'm experiencing it. So from that moment, whatever that was back in 2013, I've been now some variation of high fat low carb or true ketogenic. And when you were at 230, that was a relatively fit 230. I was working out hard. I was strong as an ox. I would have had no stamina. I wasn't doing any cardio. It was purely about strength. So it wouldn't be something that would impress me today. And when I see pictures of myself back then, I'm like a little grossed out because it's like, I got so my opically focused on getting bigger that I didn't realize how much of it was fat. And really went through a bit of bigger rexia during that phase. Where it was literally, if I saw food, I ate it. I just never wanted to miss out on like anything conceivably anabolic. I was all about it. And then I put a similar amount of obsession to losing the fat. And so then I lost a ton of muscle. And so wasn't nearly as strong anymore. But I looked awesome. So I went from thinking only about strength, to thinking only about aesthetics. And now I think about performance. And it's just changed everything. So you said something a second ago, which is pretty interesting and I opposed to you a thought experiment. So you said you want to live forever. Now what if I said to you, Tom, it is your lucky day because once in my life, I get to bestow on one individual immortality. And I offered it to you here right now. Would you take it? Yes, without question. All right. Now, you have kids? No. But you're married. I am the lovely wife. Yep. You have wonderful friends. Definitely. And they're all going to die. That's right. Would you still want to live forever knowing that everyone you know is going to die? And that to me is such a psychological trap that you of all people. You have kids. So if I granted you your children, not your spouse, just your kids. Would you want to do it? It's a very interesting question because so the short answer is I don't know the answer. I'm not convinced it's achievable. So I don't put a lot of time in thinking about something that I don't think is achievable. Though, maybe you'll talk me into thinking it is achievable. I take a little bit of a job, see an approach on this, which is there is something reasonable about death in that it's just closing the loop on the carbon cycle and it forces a little bit of urgency. There's a sense of you have to get something done. Now that said, I hate the thought of saying goodbye to life. I mean, I hate the thought of, so I'm 45. Let's assume I've got 50 more years left on this planet. I know how fast the last 31 by, like I remember being 15, like it was yesterday. And I know that the next 30 and the next 40 will feel quicker because they will occupy a smaller percentage of my relative timeline. So I realize that very soon I will die. So when I think of it that way, I think God, I just won one more year, one more year, one more year, but do I really want it to be a mortality? Would I ever want to bury my children when they were old? Now you won't want to bury your children, right? So that, and this is the legacy, fallacy trap for me. So people talk a lot about legacy. So I've decided not to have kids, right? So people are like, oh my God, but what about when you're older and on your deathbed, you're going to work so much when you think I wish I'd spent my time differently. And the answer is, of course, of course, every time you change your phase in life, your point of reference is now that phase. And so on your deathbed, you will instinctively see your life completely differently. But my thing is, why do you live your life the way that you did? Because in that phase of your life, that was the only way to live that made sense. So even if you're acting at a fear, you're in the middle of the fear, so the fear makes sense. So everything that you're doing has a logical movement to it. And so to live your life out of sync with where you're at in that moment, to try to hit a target, which is to feel good on your deathbed, to me is crazy. Because what that presupposes is that all along your experience of life was awesome because you were living for that moment on your deathbed. My thing is, optimize for the moment you're in now. I'll optimize for my deathbed when I'm on my deathbed. And I will try to do all the things that make being on a deathbed as acceptable as possible. Or maybe even as beautiful as possible to suddenly recognize the imminent death that is upon me and the transience becomes the beautiful thing that I railed against for so long. But I know that I will have the frame of mind to find the beauty in it. I won't spend a lot of time lashing myself for all the alcohol I wish I had done that differently or now with this frame of mind. I can see things so clearly. I should have had kids, but right now in this moment, I fucking love my life. And so this morning after two hours of sleep, I couldn't fall back asleep because I'm so fucking excited to get up and keep working on a project. Now I forced myself to go to bed because I knew that after two hours midday I'm just going to crash. But that's the level of excitement I have for the things that I'm doing that I call work. So if you can build that into your life, then you're going to be okay. Here's how I think of kids. I want kids, dude. I really want kids. Would you take one of mine? If they're amazing, absolutely. I don't know. Somebody tells me you've raised them well, so you've gone past a lot of the hard stuff. I would. The only thing I want more than I want kids is to not have kids. So it isn't one is undesirable and the other desirable. It is that they are two very desirable things and by a slim margin one wins up. So what I think people need to focus on is construct your life around things, give you energy and feel you would joy. Look at deep sense of fulfillment. That's why I think a lot of people actually made the right decision to have kids. Kids to me from the outside seem like pretty instant biological fulfillment. You have a kid and there's a feeling that you get about having that child. You just can't manufacture any other way. And that's beautiful. And for people that either just want that kind of fulfillment or don't find fulfillment in anything else, kids seem like a really good plan. For me, I just found that I could build fulfillment into doing other things and it was incredibly gratifying. And I had big brother for a long time and that informed a lot of my decisions about the realities of the day-to-day of having a kid. It's amazing, but it's such a time consuming endeavor. Yeah, sometimes I realize I don't remember what it was like not to have kids. I think it's great when people like you can articulate that, hey, like not everybody has to do this thing. It's interesting that it's almost something people have to opt out of instead of opt into. It's sort of like become a default thing. If you don't have kids, like people are looking at you like why don't you have kids? But I think I understand what you're saying for sure. Now going back to the other question about immortality. So you obviously have a great sense of urgency and purpose about what you do. And again, I don't want to spend too much time on theoretical fun questions, but do you worry that if you knew you could live forever? Some of that urgency would go away, not even a little bit. So there's a book I read. Dude read this book. It's called Einstein's Dreams. And in that book, it's a bunch of short stories that explore the nature of time. And one of the explorations is a planet where everyone lives forever. And the world just breaks into two camps naturally. You've got people that do nothing because there's always time to do it tomorrow. There is no sense of urgency whatsoever. And then you have this other camp of people that do everything. Because they know I can actually stack all of these passions on each other. And that's sequentially one by one. I can get extraordinary. It everything I've ever wanted to be extraordinary about. And when I read this as like a 12 year old, I was like, oh my God, that is so me. Like I knew to the like visceral core of my being that that's how I would be given that opportunity. And then I was given that opportunity at least in the financial sphere of, you know, hey, what would I do if I never had to work again and what would my life look like? But I would be one of those people that just, you know, buy a Sniyle and retire a sip my ties or what I really go hard. And to me, the answer was so evident. Like when I finally had the money, the resources to do whatever I wanted, knowing I would never have to work again ever even if I lived for 200 years. I started moving faster because now I could do more of the things that I wanted to. I could delegate more. I could solve some problems just by throwing money at it. And so did I earn that state of being, which I like to think I earn all of the things about myself that I value, but maybe I didn't earn it. And maybe that's why it 12. It resonated so hard with me was just, I'm not one of those guys that's like, oh man, I don't know what I want from life and there's nothing I'm passionate about. Like there's so many things I'm passionate about, let alone just really interested in, let alone fascinated by. So for me, the battle is eternally, I don't have enough time. Encountering things that you really love doing, that really, really truly, you're just excited and it doesn't matter. Like I'll give you an example. So impact through in my new company, we're a narrative company. We tell stories. And one of the stories that we're about to put out to comic book, I'm so into writing this book into telling this story. And the world cup is on. And the team that I support because America didn't qualify is England. They were playing today. The game's going, everybody here is having a great time. And I stepped out to go work on the comic. And so I'm choosing between these two things, both, which film me with joy and passion and was so much fun. And I thought this is a good sign. When the thing that's technically work that is moving me towards a business objective is so much fun that I actually, I'll find myself like pulling away from this truly just a celebration and a game to go work on that thing. So structuring my life around things like that, make it very easy for me to say, definitively, if I could live forever, I would live forever. Now, it wasn't always rosy, right? I mean, I think I've heard a little bit about how Quest got started and what you guys were doing before and how you guys all knew each other. But what were you doing before Quest and what brought you, you, Ron and Mike together? Yeah, it depends on how far back you go. So I went to USC Film School. I was studying film. That was going to be my stick. And I cheated all the way through high school. I believe that was smart, but I didn't really have anything to back that up. My own mother, when I left for college, she finally admitted this years later, when I left for college, she just quietly assumed I was going to fail because I didn't show any signs of like being the guy. I promised myself, and I went to college, I would never cheat again. Because I thought this, I'm studying now, but I actually care about. I'm taking on tens of thousands of dollars of debt. It just doesn't make sense to cheat. So literally, as an incoming freshman, I said, A, RF, sinker swim. I'm going to do all my own work and it's just going to be what it's going to be because I need to actually learn this. And so go there. My SITs are a 990. I took a twice, so like you can imagine, I'm like barely getting into school. The film school wanted a 1300. I didn't have it. I go to the admissions committee. I'm like, what do I need to do to get in? They say, look, SIT just tells us how you're supposed to do in school. So if you apply as an incoming junior, we're just going to look at your transcripts. And we don't care about your SIT. So at that, okay, cool. For the next two years, I have to get good grades. So I didn't date. I didn't drink. I didn't party nothing, man. Dude, all I did was work. And I got extraordinary grades. And I think probably about the time that I applied for film school again, I had a four point now. I mean, it's just absolutely murdering it. Remember, no cheating, nothing, just all me fucking hard ass work. And I get into film school and I start crushing it. And I'm doing great. And I'm like, oh my God, I'm the man. Like, I am so talented. This is crazy. And my dad's telling me I'm talented. Like, and I get to film school and I'm just proving it. Everyone's like, you're never going to get into film school. I got in. And only four people in your entire class get to direct a senior thesis film. And I was chosen. And I was like, dude, this is my life. I'm going to graduate with a three picture deal. I'm going to be the next deal, where this is insane. Like, it's all working exactly as I planned. And then my senior thesis film, I fucked up so badly that I stole the master because it was that embarrassing. And people were cutting clips of my film together into like these joke reels to make fun of it, to make fun of me. And it was emotionally devastating because I realized the truth. I'm not saying this to be humble. The truth was I didn't have talent. And that film made it abundantly clear. I didn't know what I was doing as in way over my head and finally this film was just elaborate enough to expose that I actually didn't know how to tell a story. And that was crushing because I had a fixed mindset. So I believe that you're either naturally talented or you're not. To me, you feel making was like, seeing, either you can see me or you can't. And all the training in the world is only going to refine whatever talent you already have. So I was like, wow, well, I guess this is it. I'm not talented. I crash and burn. I am now flirting with depression. And I've graduated. My parents aren't helping me financially. I'm taking remedial jobs. And it's just like, and I, it was the period of my life, I call the King of remedial jobs period where I would only interview for jobs that I thought I would be smarter than the person interviewing me because I needed to feel smart. And I just believe my talent intelligence were fixed traits and life is about making the most of them. So I never wanted to be in a situation that made me feel badly about myself. And so that puts you in stupid places. So I make college graduate selling video games retail. That was my life. And then I got a phone call on somebody who's like, hey, should come teach filmmaking. We need some people that help. And I went and taught and through teaching. And I'm truncating the story. But there's a lot of stuff ring in this part that I'm skipping over. But I end up teaching filmmaking and realize, whoa, I'm actually able to help make their films better. And if I can help them make their films better, why can't I learn and make my own films better. And so that became the seeds that would ultimately grow into a growth mindset. But at the time, and it had those words, I had some Tony Robbins. I was clinging into that for dear life. And the thing that really changed my life was, I don't know if you remember this. This would have been back in like 99 people really debating brain plasticity. And one side was like, it's total bullshit. Your brain done, capped out 12 or 13 somewhere around there, it starts a pruning process after that. You're not going to learn anything major. Now, I was like, oh, God, that would be dire. And then the other side was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, science is coming out. Guys, I'm telling you, the brain is plastic. You learn anything at any age. And I said, all right, I'm going to make a decision. I choose to believe that the camp that's saying that you can change is right. And so I started reading and reading and reading about the brain very racially to try to understand how it could change what I needed to do, what the process of getting better at something, what the neurological process of that was, like what are synaptic connections, how does the myelination process work. So and all of that stuff filled me with so much excitement that I could change. So, okay, I suck today. I don't have to suck tomorrow. I can just pour myself into this and get better and push and work. And so that's what I started doing right about that time. I encountered these two bodybuilder, meathead guys. And of course, immediately write them off as like, bodybuilders are done. And then they open their mouths. And I was like, Jesus, these guys are smart, man. And they were like, look, we're starting a new technology company and we need a copywriter. And I was like, well, you know, hey, that sounds amazing. Because their pitch to me was dude, look, you're coming to the film industry with your hand out. You need to get rich, control the resources, and then you can make films the way you want to make. And I'm, you know, whatever, 23, 24. And so I'm like, that sounds amazing. Let's do that. And so they thought it would take about 18 months. I was going to go help them build this technology company. They were going to sell it. And then I would have the money I needed to make films. And of course, it doesn't play out that way. And I go into first an amazing period where I'm learning to be an entrepreneur in a startup environment. In an ultra-grueling like, hey, don't be a fucking idiot. Get it done, kind of move faster or like that kind of doggy dog environment. But I ended up thriving in that and really getting strong, which is I needed to toughen up. I'm just going to be really honest. And it was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time. I believed I could change and grow. And I met guys that helped me to a high-ass standard and push themselves and wanted to grow and get better. And they knew a lot about business. And so they just brought me into this pressure cooker environment and made a very similar offer to dozens of people. And they said, look, this is a startup. You know, any job in the company you want, you just have to become the right person for the job. Now for me, it was all about fighting to become a filmmaker. I just needed that money. So I went hard, hard, and just fought and clawed my way up. And ultimately was the only one's less standing. And what did that company do specifically? Awareness technologies made data loss prevention software. So if you had a company and this is all timing, right? So this is the early 2000s. So it was like, you have a company and you wereger employees are taking hip-a-data out because you're healthcare or you're worried that they're taking customer data out because the credit cards are still sort of the wild-wild west at this point. And people could just pop in a USB and take it out or they could email it out. So we made software that would allow you to say, okay, if it has this type of information credit card data, whatever, flag it and don't let the attachment leave, not via USB port, not via email or whatever. And I assume you're talking about Ron and Mike. This is just a idea. So you guys exit this company when? So that we started wrapping up around 2009. So in 2010, we launched Quest 2009, we bring on a new CEO who bought the company. And it was sort of a staggered exit. So he and I, the new CEO and I didn't see IDI. He didn't think I was very good at marketing and I thought he just didn't understand marketing. So I said, look, I'm going to go start our next company, which we actually offered him a percentage of vision because we didn't want him to sweat us working on it in the background. And he turned it down. Whoops. And so he goes on this firing binge, fires a bunch of people. And I said, you know, I think there's one more person we need to fire. And he's like, who's that? And I said, me. And he was like, okay, why? And I said, I don't, we don't see IDI. You think marketing is spreadsheets? I think it's storytelling. So we've got this new company that we told you about and I want to go be the first full-time employee. And so I was respectful and phased myself out and made sure that they were standing. But he agreed to let me go and let me add my contract. Mike and Ron stayed behind on contract for, again, it was staggered. But for a year, I was operationally on my own building the company up. And that's how I exited that. And then they finally exited. It was like a year later for I think Ron came first and then another six months in Mike was there. What was the input is for starting quest? What age were you guys scratching? So I can only speak for myself on this one. And I'll say that when we were building awareness technologies in the beginning, it was learning so much about being an entrepreneur, it was insanely empowering. And it was just giving to me, giving to me, giving to me. And then I sort of was hating what I was doing so much that whatever knowledge I was gaining, I was still being eroded. And I used to tell my wife, it's shipping away at me. Like I'm just not having fun. Like this is so miserable. And so it was taking more energy than it was giving. So it was getting drained every day. I never wanted to talk to my wife about what I did. So I'd come home and she'd be like, what we up to today. And I'm like, I don't want to talk about it. Like I just didn't want to think about it anymore. It was just soul sucking because I didn't care about the product. There was no us in the product. Like we were just trying to make something we used to joke. It was a company that was born to be sold in the slavery. Like we just wanted to get rid of it. Like from the jump. It was never something that we believed in. We actually did VC pitches where we said, don't worry, you guys can get rid of us. We don't care. We don't have an ego about this. This and I quote, this company was meant to be sold in the slavery. We actually said those words multiple times, not realizing to a VC. That makes you sound like an asshole who just wants to get out of the company. I'm not going to trust you with my money wisely. So so just couldn't get it for a long time. Couldn't get any money raised. So anyway, it's robbing for me. And I'm by this point, they've given me 10% ownership in the company. The companies were like 22 million at a tight. So I'm like, I'm a multi millionaire on paper. And I'm just like, I'm so unhappy. I'm living the cliche of money camp. I happiness. So I go to my wife and I said, look, I know I promise that I would make you rich. And I'm going to, but I'm going to need to go backwards for a minute. So we can go forward. And I said, I need to do something that makes me feel alive. Like I just can't keep doing this. It's so miserable. And so she was like, yeah, I haven't seen you this unhappy in a long time. Like do whatever you need to do. So I went in and quit. And now when the story, it sounds kind of cool because of how it ends up working out. But at the time, I was ashamed because I was like, I just can't do this anymore. I'm so unhappy. And I had told them anything within my code of ethics, I will do to build this company period. And I realized it's just not true. Like when it's stealing my life from me, it wasn't worth it anymore. So I went in and I said, guys, here's your equity back. I'm not going to cross the finish line. I don't want to get anything for this. You could sell the company tomorrow for a billion dollars. You will never hear from me of sound mind and body. I am walking away from this. And I'm leaving you in the lurch. And that's exactly how it feels to me. And so they were stunned and taken it back. And I drove home. And I'm literally pulling into the driveway. I'm on the phone with my wife. I did it the hard part. The two guys who I love, they are my brothers. And I just said, I'm leaving. And the phone rings and it's them. And I'm like, hold on a second. Let me take this. And I click over and they're like, come out to dinner with us. I go out to dinner and they're like, look, you caught us by surprise. The reality is we could do this without you. But we don't want to. And that let me connect to something other than the money. Up until that point, it had just been like, we're doing this for the money. For the money, for the money, I'm going to make money. I'm going to get rich. I'm going to go make movies. And then it was the thing I really care about in this. I care about the brotherhood. I care about the camaraderie. I want to build something of value. I want to build something I'm passionate about. And so I'd already done the hard part. I'd already quit. So I was like, if you guys want to work with me, then it would have to be fundamentally different. It would have to be a different company. We'd have to be building something we care about. Something we're passionate about. Something that the mother Teresa Quotter, at least it's attributed to her. No one will act for the money. But people will act for the one. So I was like, I can show up every day thinking about my mom and my sister who are morbidly obese. I far too soon, if we can't solve this problem. Because Ron was like a nutritional freak at this point. And he was just into it and he'd help me transform my physique. This is like in the middle of me losing all the weight. And I think I got it figured out. And I thought, whoa, with what he knows about human metabolism and nutrition and my passion for marketing. And I've got this whole new vision that's going to leverage this thing that's is now called social media. But wasn't called that back then. And I just saw this vision. I can your boy Tim Ferris, who I read his book and he introduced me to Kevin Kelly's notion of a thousand true fans. So I became obsessed with this notion of a thousand true fans. I'm going to find a thousand true fans and I stop reading email. Thank you again, Tim, the T Ferris for that one. I haven't read email in any meaningful way since that book. And so I was like, I'm going to go off. I'm going to market this way. I pulled Mike and Ron into a conference where my game this whole pitch. It's easier just to explain the way I'd say it now. These weren't the words I was using back then because we didn't have these words. But guys, look, social media is going to change everything. It's going to allow people to build community. All it is is a megaphone. If you give people a reason to say something good, they'll say something good. And if you give them a reason to say something bad, they will say something bad. But if we can build a company around value creation about building community, not trying to hawk product, actually bring these people together, help them because most of them want to lose weight, help them lose weight, make the mission of our company to end metabolic disease. Like all of the sudden, we can really do something. People will know who we are as people. I was obsessed with that. I was like, I want to be me today. I would say I want to be authentic. Back then, I was just like, I want our personalities to shine through. I want people to know who we are. Company shouldn't be nameless, faceless organizations. This should be real people and you should really feel them in the copy on the website. In the content that they put out. And I know how to tell stories. Let us tell stories to these guys. So we started building just totally different infrastructure than any company out there. We made our own content studio. We were creating all of our own content. We were essentially telling stories. What does the brand mean? What should it mean to you? And that ended up because we were so early in the game of social media, we just exploded. Yeah, it's kind of amazing. And I remember the first time we met, which I guess would have been 2013. So you guys were certainly you would see a quest bar here and there in a store. But nothing like you do today, of course. But I really remember you explaining this at the time. And me sort of not getting it, which was, and I don't even remember back then, like, what were your main social media channels? Was it mostly Facebook? Was Instagram around? I don't even remember. Didn't even exist. I remember that came out. Wow. So this was all through Facebook. All through Facebook a little bit of Twitter. And then probably your two Instagram started to be a thing. And then we started putting more and more resources and then Instagram exploded. And Instagram really carried a lot away in the fitness community because it's so visual. So that was a huge win for us. When did you realize that this thing could work? This thing being quest? Well I knew it could work from the jump for what I wanted, which was I wanted to love what I was doing every day. I wanted to feel like I was sort of going to battle a righteous battle with my two brothers who I cared deeply about and thought they had just amazing skills that would just be incredibly valuable in what we were doing. And I felt ready as a marketer. I felt like I understood something that nobody else understood. I felt that we could move fast. And I felt that we could serve our customer well. And that was it. And I believed because we always talked, we were a food company. We didn't look at it as a supplement company or a bar company. We were a food company. And we were going to end metabolic disease. We wanted to make meaningful contributions to the world of how food is made, source, process, understood, eaten like all of it. And even just looking at the kinds of imagery we were putting out there. We went so against veins and chains. So the body building industry up until that point was literally guys with massive muscles, huge veins wearing chains. And that was everywhere, everywhere had that image. And we thought, oh man, we're going to focus on food. I became obsessed with this certain color blue, which I thought was appealed to men, appealed to women. It was like this beautiful optimistic, creative color. I did all this research on what blue means to people on how it hits the retina. And literally it became like a natural stress point because it was hard to get the right color. But then it becomes this iconic color, the whole industry starts copying it. It was bananas. But like going contrary, like I heard, I don't remember where I heard this, but they said, if you really want to be successful, you have to be a contrarian and you have to be right. And we were a contrarian and we were right. And so because of that, it just everything went nuts. And so looking at everything differently and building a company that we were excited about in a new way, taking care of customers, it was just yeah, it was crazy. And you've been now doing impact theory for two years? Just under, yeah. So talking about that transition and tell me a little bit about what impact theory is. I mean, I think I have some idea, but my guess is I'm probably missing a few of the details and also the understanding of when you decided, hey, it's time to go do this other thing full time because this was obviously a passion for you always. Yeah. So to understand impact theory, you have to understand Rashan Jackson. And when I was in college and desperately trying to get good grades, I had a teacher offer extra credit to go tutor in her city kids. And so I said yes. And they, of course, give you the most problematic kids you can imagine. So they gave me this young, probably drug and alcohol impacted hyperactive kid who was hyperactive on the level I'd never seen. The kid was bouncing up the walls all over the place was crazy. And my job was to get him to do his homework. And so for the first hour, he would cry and scream and freak out and run around and get him fights and just go nuts. And then when I would say, all right, hours up, I got to go. Then he would become so sweet and sloppy and he would cry and just beg me to stay and help him. And so like a sucker, I would stay. So he'd give me for two hours. And so around like week four, week five, I realized this kid's trolling me. Like he knows, he gets an extra hour. If he ignores me for the first hour and then a sweet and sweetness and light, the second hour. So as starts getting really annoying for me because I've got so much work to do. And on week six, you're supposed to tell him, hey, I'm only coming for two more weeks because it's a night week program. So weeks six, I tell this kid, only coming for two more weeks just so you know, and he flipped out. He went to see nuclear is eight at this point. And just just goes bananas. And he was really small because he was on Riddlein or something and so stunned and discross. So he's just tiny, tiny for his age. And he went up and just slug this kid who was like, no joke three times the size. I just never seen like pent up rage like that. And I was like, wow, I finally get him under control. I get him back and I'm like, is this because I said I was only coming for two more weeks? And he says through sobbing hysterical tears. Yes. So I said, look, because now I'm fed up with the whole just like drama routine. And I said, if and only if you do your homework, the moment I get here as long as I live in Los Angeles, I will keep coming and helping you with your homework. And so we agreed and that turned into an eight and a half year relationship. And I ended up becoming far more than just a tutor and he becomes an integral part of my life. And I his and I didn't know it at the time. But he was being abused at home and he ends up getting taken away by the police. And he makes me the guardian of the court. And I have to help him through the court system and into foster care. I mean, like that's how intertwined our lives became. And then I'm young and poor at this point and they move him farther and farther away. And I never really felt like I was able to help him because I was so young and stupid. And the only thing I really knew how to do was to show him that there's a life he never sees. So I would take him to see movies and Beverly Hills because I was like movies cost the same. But I can at least take him to a beautiful neighborhood. That left a really lasting mark on me and my personality and it planted a seed. And then flash forward 10, 15 years later, I'm at Quest. I now 1,400 employees and about 1,000 of them grew up hard just like this kid Rishan. And I realize I have an opportunity to help make their lives better. But how? And so we start thinking of the same called Quest University. And it was meant to be making protein bars as your tuition. But really learn the things you need to learn to go and have a better life. And so I write the 25 bullet points, which are the 25 things I had to do to my mind to go from laying on my un furnished apartment floor. Flirting with depression, not knowing how I was going to do anything with my life. You only totally had a control hopeless and lost to building a billion dollar brand. I knew exactly what I had to do. The changes and beliefs, the thought patterns, everything that I had to do. And so I started giving that to people and trying to help them. And people would come to me and like these are thugs dude. Like tattoos up the neck, tear drop tattoos, grown men coming to me in tears. You care more about my success and my own mother. I have hope in my future for the first time ever. Like people moving up, one guy comes off the line and ends up working in our tech department. Because I showed him how to like learn tech on the side. I mean, just crazy. So many stories like that, absolutely extraordinary. And I was like, when I'm at my most honest, I love helping with the body. But when I'm at my most honest, helping with the mind is what I'm meant to do. And so I thought we're doing all of this for the employees. Let's create a show. We'll call it inside Quest. And I'll interview because what I feared and I remember when I did it, I said, my big fear in writing these 25 things down. They hung in the wall. It was like a whole thing. My fear in writing them down is that you'll memorize them, but you won't live by them. And so I wanted to bring other successful people in that I knew just because they're universal laws of success. I knew would say roughly the same thing over and over and over. And these guys, it's okay. It's not just that. It's all these people that are saying the same thing. And so that became really important. And so I'm pouring myself into making that great in an effort to really do something amazing for the employees. And then at this time, we end up having just the incredible financial windfall at a personal level that we'd all fantasized about since the day we got to business. And I realized all of the sudden, you know, we're in a very fortunate position where the three of us have the financial wherewithal, we don't always have to agree on everything. We don't always have to move in the same direction. The company would be very stable now without me. They didn't necessarily, they being run a mic, didn't necessarily have my level of excitement for doing the mind. And our consumer base was asking, why the hell's the protein bar guy talking about mindset? So it was a total brand disconnect. And I looked at him thought, given enough years, I can get people to change the way that they think about this brand. But are my partners going to want to share in that horrific cost as I shift the brand to fit what I want to do. And it didn't seem like a fair thing to drag them through. So, you know, I said, look, this is something that is important enough to me that I have to do it in my life. So we agreed to part ways at that point and build things the way that we see fit. And so I took the studio that we had built inside of Quest and spun it out into a standalone company that's now in Pack Theory. We create both what I call non-fiction content, stuff like this, interview shows, and then fiction content. So we've got our first comic book coming out that we helped to turn into film or TV. So how much of what you learned in film school figures into what you do today? A lot a lot. So film school is psychology with and put the camera here for best results. Once you understand that, that your job is really to take the audience on an emotional and ideological ride that at the end they're entertained, but at least from my perspective, also enriched and look, most films don't worry about the second part. That's an obsession of mine. But when I think about the things that really shape my life, it's the stories I tell myself about myself and it's the stories that I identify with and make the dominant metaphors in my life. Joseph Campbell said, if you want to change the world, change the metaphor. So I've lofty visions of what can be impacted through art. I heard a quote the other day though, that is very sobering and definitely keeps me thinking about ways to really impact people. And he said, if you want 300 years of Shakespeare has not stopped genocide, then what hope does art really have. And I think that's a fair point. But I think that we're living through a time today where you can marry the non-fiction, the direct, the explanatory, with the metaphorical. Because I think the big problem is that the belief in the metaphors dropped out in Joseph Campbell, again, talks about this and says, part of the reason that you get these stunted adolescence is because there's no ritual driven by belief that the ritual has deep meaning. So people aren't different from childhood to adulthood without those transitional rituals. And same with divorce. And he said, I think a big part of the divorce rate is that people don't have these transitional rituals. And so I took that really seriously. And when I got married, I went through a ritualistic scarification because I wanted to be a different man the day before my wedding than the day after. And I can't tell you how many times that's really like reminded me going through something painful that was difficult made me think of myself as different and begin telling myself a different story that I'm married now. So say more about that. What did you do exactly? When I put it into normal terms, it won't sound as cool, but I got a tattoo. Now for me, tattoos were not something I wanted. I don't like tattoos. I have a thing for tattoos. I have exactly one and that was the one that I got as a ritualist, ex-carification. I was definitely afraid of needles at the time. Definitely afraid. So for me, it was facing my biggest fear, doing something that was painful with this thing that held some sort of mythical element of terror in my life. I think of you an idea. I was one of those guys that when I had injections in my wrist at one point, I almost fainted. And I wasn't even looking because the thought of a needle penetrating my skin freaked me out that much. So that's where I was when I got the tattoo. It was the scariest thing I could think of within the realm of reality. I didn't go swimming with great white sharks. Okay, that obviously would be far more terrifying. But within the plausible realm of this isn't potentially dangerous, it was the worst thing I could think of. And so doing that, having to face that fear, having to do that, ended up being really important for me transitioning out of being single to being married. I've heard you talk before about money. And it's something that I've certainly asked a number of my patients, one of the privileges of medicine, I think there are several. But one of them I think is that you form relationships with people where you can ask very intimate questions. And sometimes they're not just about their health, it's about their happiness. And even though my patient population is quite small, given the affluence of some of my patients, I've had interesting discussions with people about how wealth does and doesn't impact their lives. So I guess even though you're not my patient, I'll ask you basically the same sort of question, which is, did you feel different the day after your liquidity event? No. And that's the weirdest part. Here's exactly what it was from me. And I think this is near universal. When I looked when I was poor and all through my childhood, I looked at people that had money and I had adoration for them. It just seemed so cool. And I thought that in some way, they were better than me or certainly in a better place than me and that made them in some ways better, certainly more desirable to be like that. And so looking at them, you meet them with a bit of reverence. And so in the back of your mind somewhere is this notion that when I get money, I will have that adoration for myself. And I will have that sense of reverence for myself. And you think that somehow, like all the insecurities that you have will be washed out by that reverence and adoration. And it's not. And you realize that you feel exactly the same the next day. And the easiest way I can explain it is to say that it's like losing your virginity. Before I lost mine, I legitimately thought like colors would be brighter. I would just be somehow a fundamentally different person. And then I had sex and was like, oh, that was rad. I loved it, but I'm not a different person. And that was exactly how I felt with the money. It was rad, dude. Money is better than people think. It's more powerful than people think to be certain. But it's not at all what people have been told. It's not going to impact how you feel about yourself. It is merely going to extend your capabilities. You will suddenly be able to facilitate things you wouldn't be able to facilitate money is essentially inert. Right? There's a bit of heat energy to a dollar bill that you could release by burning it. But short of that, the money in and of itself is inert. But it can facilitate things. Now, if you have a clear vision of what you want to facilitate and it's a problem that can be addressed with money, suddenly money becomes insanely powerful. And if you really want to think about how powerful money is, think about how much of your own life is determined by what you get paid to do. Now imagine controlling that money and you realize that you're able to aim incredibly intelligent, capable people at problems you want solved. It's not even necessarily the problem they want solved. So that gets really, really interesting. And then if you can help them fall in love with what they're doing, if you can give them a supportive environment, if you can make sure they know that we're all equals here. We have different roles, but we're all equally important that their voice is desired, that they're there because you want to hear from them. Then it's like, holy hell, I know I only get their attention because I'm willing to pay them. But now that I have their attention, I can create this ecosystem, this environment for them to thrive in, we can do some pretty extraordinary things. It seems like one's motivation around money can change because certainly I'm guessing when you were young or when you were, let's say right out of college, right? You're sort of at a low point. It sounds like we didn't go too much into it, although that's the kind of stuff I enjoy talking about. It's the pain and the humiliation of that experience. And at that moment, my guess is you would have thought, give me a bunch of money and my problems go away. And maybe I'm wrong, but I don't get the sense that at that moment you would have realized that that wasn't true and at best that money would have given you the opportunity to go back and do what you loved. That it was your own hands. Those are different things, right? Very. Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, back then I was chasing money all out because I thought it would solve all of my problems. And I thought it would make me cool as hell. I just thought it would be so cool, dude. I thought I'm going to be the man. I want to fast car. I want to Lamborghini. Like I want the every blingy thing that you can imagine. I wanted it all. And I fantasized about it. Whenever I thought about money, the only thing I thought about was what it could buy me. That was it. And how cool people were going to think I was. How cool I would think myself. Yeah, that was the nature of money to me. Who do you consider a role model in people who have taken great wealth and put it to Max Momen fact Elon Musk? No question. He's probably, I really want to think about this. He's probably one of the few people that legitimately makes me feel badly about myself. And like makes me sweat when I think about like, oh, could I really do that? Like I like to think I can do anything Peter. But woof, spinning that many plates at one time. Eikes. I don't know that I process raw data fast enough. That's the gods on his truth. And so let's consider one of those things which is SpaceX. Yeah. You used to be an engineer. So I'm pretty impressed by the kilo to dollar ratio of payload. Sometimes I still can't believe it's happened. I mean, what they've done. Have you ever been to C.O. launch? No. Have you? I have not. I have a couple of friends who have. I'd love to. Yeah. I've really cool videos out there. Yeah. Seeing the videos, the videos are amazing. Have you taken off the landing? And you've seen the videos where like you have to wear the correct headphones to be able to actually know. Oh, yeah. There's a guy on YouTube. Maybe we can find it for the show notes. But there's a really cool video where you can actually hear, you just get an amazing auditory experience basically. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, yeah. I've actually not that recent. I feel like it was in the last three or four months. Yeah. Pretty impressive. Yeah. I think I talked about how space X could be a trillion dollar company, which is pretty interesting. I don't know that, you know, it's funny when I went to college, I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. So I'm obviously pretty interested in that stuff. But, and this is going to sound like a complete sort of poo poo on the whole thing. But, I'm so much more interested in like what's happening on earth and what's happening in space. And I don't know when that transition took place. But as interesting as I think that stuff is intellectually, I just think emotionally, I feel much more curious about what's happening right in front of me. And I'm also equally amazed at things that we don't know that are so close. Like, you know, because I used to spend so much time swimming, I'm kind of amazed by the ocean, which is like, you know, if you think about it, and it's deepest point, it might be what? 12, 14 kilometers deep. That's a trivial distance. You could walk that in and after and in. But when going straight down, that's a depths of unknowns. Like we can't even fathom. Two types of organisms that don't even require sunlight. That kind of stuff. So by selecting Elon as your example, it's sort of like saying, look, there are lots of incredibly wealthy people, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, many of these folks who have, you know, and people who are less well known like John Arnold, who through philanthropy have done remarkable things. But Elon has done it through building companies that are kind of paradigm shifting. I mean, that's an overused term, but I think it's safe to say that for his stuff. So what is the paradigm you want to change? I want to make sure that no human being on the planet fails to encounter an empowering mindset. That's what I'm all about. And so meeting kids in the inner cities and I'll tell you a story. So I used to interview everybody. If you got a job at Quest, I interviewed you. Whether you were the EVP of global sales or you were the janitor, you interviewed with me. And so that meant that I went through a phase where all I was interviewing was people working for the production line, which naturally draws people from lower income brackets. And I started asking just because I wanted to really understand like what motivates you. Because my thing was I never wanted to hire somebody into a parasitic relationship where I was going to get their time. And essentially gives them very little money when you really think about it and exchange for that time. And so I thought, wow, they're going to spend 50% of their waking hours with me. And I'm going to give them not enough money. And I didn't feel good about that relationship. Now you can't build the business just by throwing money at everybody. So what else could I do to add value to people's lives? So it was like one thing, I can hire people who there is a secondary thing that they can learn from us. And then they can go on and do that thing. So they can build their skills set up the example I gave earlier of the Katie wanted to learn technology, awesome, came in, busted ass, made a lot of protein bars. Also, we helped him get a job in tech within our own company. And then goes on to start his own tech company. It was crazy. So I was looking for people like that. I wanted to know what's that next thing? I know that you don't want to spend the rest of your life working a protein bar line. So what's the next thing that you want? And if I really believe that I can help you get there, then our selfish desires are aligned. We can work together to make something amazing happen. And I would rather have you for three or four years. And you believe that I'm making your life better every day than to have you for 20 years. And you hate every bit of it. The way that those two people will work is so dramatically different. Just to be clear, part of your motivation is also selfish. It's like I'm going to get way more out of you in four years on a per unit basis, a productivity basis than 20 years where you're going to stay here forever, but you're not happy. And then part of it is sort of altruistic. Yeah, I'll even say it's all selfish. So I don't think selfish is necessarily a bad thing. I just think that we all live life from our perspective or motivated by certain things. I like to see other people win. I'm wired for it. So I remember when I was like six or seven in an Easter egg hunt, I pretended not to see some Easter eggs because I knew winning meant a lot more to my sister than it did to me. So I pretended not to see them. She found them and she won and she was very happy. So that's just me. I just like to see people that I care about happy and having a good time. So that's part of it. I'm wired for that. So I know that I'm going to be stoked if I see that they're having a good time. And then I want to build a big company. Make a whole lot of money. And the only way I can do that is by convincing extraordinary people to come work for me. And then make it a great environment where they don't want to leave. So yeah, I don't mind people saying that it's entirely selfish. Fine. If it's good for people, I'm okay with that. This became your lab. I mean, I didn't realize this. You interviewed every person you hired. So I've interviewed north of 1500 people, which doesn't sound like a lot when you think of all the things you do 1500 times. Until you go to interview 1500 people and you realize Jesus, this is a lot of people. So yeah, years of my life were spent interviewing. We were growing back then. What did you learn from that process that surprised you the most? Yeah, this is a punch line to the question that you actually asked in wanting to find out what is your real desire? I started doing this magic genie question. So you can ask for anything that you want, anything at all, got to be something self or so can't be the cure cancer or bring somebody back from the dead and you can't ask for more wishes. So what do you wish for? And I wanted to just get like that truest thing that they really want. And Peter, two a person, remember, I interviewed hundreds of people, two a person, they all said the exact same thing. What are the odds that like, let's just say that that particular question I asked 300 people? What are the odds that every single one of them without exception will give you the same answer? Well, if you're not leading them or asking the question to each of them at a point in the discussion that was equivalent. So you're priming them. I would say the answer is the probability is incredibly low. Okay. So I'm leading them just enough that we narrow the world down for sure. Otherwise this really would be like a magic trick because almost to a person this was less universal but almost to a person the first answer was I want a job which I know is bullshit. They're saying that because they are there for an interview. So I would say, okay, I get that a lot of people give that to me is their first answer. So this is now me leading them and I say, why do you want the job and they would say for money? Okay, rad. So is it fair to say you would ask the manager, Jeannie, for money? Yes. So none of this is weird to me. The weird part is when I say give me a number and every single one of them every single one I never once got a variation gave me the same number and the number was a billion dollars. A billion dollars. Peter, what the fuck are you going to do with a million dollars? You can't buy a house in LA for a million dollars. Let alone be set up for a life. It's a magic Jeannie. Now I've thought about the magic Jeannie question a lot and if you're asking for money you've already wasted your ask but fair enough like I spend a lot of time thinking about the magic Jeannie but the fact that they all asked for a million dollars was crazy to me. And the first time I heard it I thought, well, that's weird. The fifth time I thought, man, how is it possible? Five people have said the same thing. Around number 10 I actually thought my team was fucking with me and that they had started telling them ahead of time to do it just to like mess with me. By the time we got to 25 I realized something about humanity that you only dream is big as you think and you only think is big is what you see. So if what you see around you is that everyone's wishing and thinking about a million dollars because that seems like an impossibly large amount of money you never go my dream and life is the Terraform Mars. You never think that big. You're stuck at a million dollars. It would never occur to you that you can Terraform Mars because your thinking is so limited by what you've seen. And I thought, whoa, if I could just give them my mindset overnight because I'm interviewing people that are smarter than me and I'll define smart as the ability to process raw data quickly. Okay. Does that seem like a reasonable definition? It seems like one component but I don't know the definition of smart. I would certainly include that in it but let's grant that that's the definition we use for the moment. So I would come across people that blew me away. They could just think faster than me. They could see all the different permutations of a given problem and come up with a solution that was well thought out more intricate than I could. And so I thought, okay, well, my success isn't predicated on intelligence. It's definitely partly hard work but I work hard because I have a certain belief in a mindset that I can that my efforts will be rewarded. So I started thinking, okay, humans lead with belief. It's because I believe that I can get better at something that I'll pour myself into it but they don't believe that they're going to get that results so they don't. They don't believe that they could ever get $100 million dollars. A billion dollars, $100 billion a trillion. That's not real to them. So even though we're talking to a magic genie, they don't think that big. So it was crazy. Push them and really ride them. They'll work their way up to 10 million. But nobody ever goes a billion a trillion. There's done. So I was like, wow, I became obsessed with how do I codified my mindset, what I've done over the last at that point, like 12 years of just training myself to think a certain way, how do I impart that to people? And that is still my obsession. So that's what I'm hoping can be done through story. And when you read Home of Deus and Sapiens, it just really understanding how narrative is so massively influential and that the dominant narratives that we use are all religious. And then you look at how I think the bottom is falling out in terms of belief in a lot of their religions for a lot of people. And you just go, okay, well, what's the ultimate punchline when people no longer have a metaphor that they put any weight in, they have no belief in, then it really becomes a documentary. And my life is what my life is. I know it because I see it. That scared me because now if you can only envision what you're living, you can't even turn to the Bible to see extraordinary acts. You can't the Quran, the whatever, to a movie, something to have some vision of something that's bigger than what you've done. And I thought could we use storytelling to give people a way to think in the way that the matrix gave me a way to think. And so that became the obsession. It's funny. I was thinking about it. But what would I ask for in the genie question? And it's so interesting that I wouldn't think to ask for money, which is not to say that I wouldn't love to have more money because of the reasons we described. It would be amazing to be able to amplify the things I want to do, the first thing that jumps to my mind is like the type of laboratory I'd want to have. And how I hate the fact that all of the best scientists that I interview for my book and for the podcast and just folks from my friends, I mean, they spend 50% of their time fundraising. And I imagine a world where like you could create like a true institute where you're going after high risk translational problems with infinite resources. So let me tell you, if the genie would give me the dollars, I'd be happy to take them. But I actually think the first thing that comes to my mind would be some form of fulfillment. Because at least money, you sort of know it can be got. But fulfillment strikes me as one of the hardest things to find. Again, maybe I'm biased by what I see clinically, which is people who have more money than they could ever spend. I've actually had one patient say to me, it's almost impossible to spend more than $600 million in your lifetime. That was the number. I remember that was like, you know, anything over 600 million is just a waste. Like you can't possibly spend it. That is a failure of imagination. I assure you. I mean, look at the Elon Musk. Come on. Like even just to pour 600 extra million into each one of his three companies, he could be well, I think this person was saying through like expenditure on, you know, like, willingly stuff. But interestingly fulfillment seems to be something that's missing. I certainly don't think I know fully what it means. I think I've had moments where I've experienced it. But it's interesting if it's a real magic genie, can you imagine what that would feel like? Yes. Can I give you my secret formula? It's a fulfillment. I would love to hear it. So one fulfillment is a neurochemical state. So there's no possibility of a flatline. So there's no way you're just going to have it forever. I think that it ebsom flows with the movements of a day. But having said that, I think that fulfillment comes from becoming someone that you're proud of building a skill set that was incredibly hard to build. That serves not only yourself, but other people. So you're doing the hard things. You're not doing things that would be deeply pleasurable and in building your identity around not doing things that are pleasurable in order to become extraordinary in order to serve other people. I think that's the name of fulfillment. When I think about the times where I feel just fucking awesome, it is because I did something really hard while other people were playing. It made me more powerful in the way that I define it, which I can't believe powers become a dirty word. Power to me is close your eyes, imagine a world, a better world. The world you want to create, open your eyes and have the ability to manifest that. That's power. So Mother Teresa had power. She was able to do things. That is what leads to fulfillment. That's what the Greeks called technique. It's not enough to go to a little superdicision, right? That should. That's pleasurable. It feels good. But it isn't fulfillment. Because you didn't earn any special ability to do that. Now fulfillment is the guy that worked at Toyota that came into the soup kitchen and said, I'm going to improve their efficiency. So more people get fed. He increased their output by like 40 or 400% on how to foreign it. But it was like massive. And I thought that's fulfillment. He worked his ass off. I'm sure there were a ton of days at Toyota, where he was like, what am I doing? Why am I doing this? But he gained the set of skills. It was insanely powerful. He put them to use in soup kitchen. Now that feels good. That's fulfillment. So getting people to a place where they can learn that the cool stories are the stories that while you're in it suck. When I heard your story, a swimming around Catalina Island, that sounded like actual madness to me. When I heard that you swam from Catalina back to the mainland, that sounded crazy. And the same thing with doing the one in Hawaii. I was like, these are my greatest fears. Open waters, my greatest fear. And I thought, but that's why he gets to feel good about himself because he did those things. It's in the hard stuff. It's not the easy stuff. That is interesting. I certainly agree that it's very hard to be fulfilled if you are not in the service of someone else at some point. In other words, I think obviously you have to be in service of many things and others being only one of them in service. For many people, I think that might be part of the relational joy that they experience in having kids is for a great period of time. You are in service of those kids. In fact, sometimes it seems like you're in service of them too much. And you don't get a break from that. But you don't have to have kids to obviously be in service of another person. Yeah, I don't know. I really find this question of fulfillment and true relational joy to be interesting. And we're in sort of a weird time, right? Because I was talking to a friend of mine who's a psychiatrist, I actually hope to have him on the podcast at some point because this is a discussion that it's probably going to be a controversial discussion, but I think it's an important one, which is, is that there any evolutionary basis for suicide? So that's question one. And the question two is, do we believe that we are seeing on an age-adjusted mortality adjusted basis? Are we seeing suicide at a greater extent today than we were before? Or is it just that we are paying more attention to it now or is less? But I do wonder, is there any part of civilization that contributes to society? And my intuition says yes, that's about the extent to which my knowledge would go on this topic. I want to talk about this with somebody who really thinks broadly about this because something that is so against our DNA, like our DNA is pretty geared towards survival. If you think about it, maybe at the risk of oversimplifying what pain could be so great that it could override, arguably the single most primitive drive that our species would have. And so I think the prevalence of suicide is such that virtually no person I know's life hasn't been touched by it, which tells you how ubiquitous it is. And it's sort of, you know, you alluded to depression. I mean, I just think when people really are honest with themselves, like if they haven't thought of killing themselves, they've certainly thought life isn't that much fun. And that's kind of a sobering thought. I've become obsessed with this topic. I'm unfortunately not the person you're looking for that has like the real deep knowledge, but I will say this, I'm not the right person to take any advice from on this topic, but follow my logic. I think that there's something terrifying happening with the microbiome. And I think that the potential effects of the microbiome being one of the massive contributory factors in what feels like, and again, I don't know, is it just we're paying attention to it more maybe. But man, it feels epidemic right now. It's crazy. You had Anthony Burdain, Ann Kate Spade, killed themselves in the same week. I mean, it's like we can just accept money doesn't solve the problem. Fame doesn't solve the problem. And so I just started thinking, okay, well, what are we going through right now? Now, I am particularly obsessed with the microbiome because what happened to my wife? How much I can't remember how much you and I've talked about this? No, no, I don't think I know anyone else. So three years ago, we are on our way to Vegas. Pact, the bags baby, I'm on my way. And my wife goes, I'm not feeling well. I feel funny. And I was like, what does that mean? She's like, I don't know. I just don't feel right. And then an hour later, she's like, gosh, I'm feeling kind of nauseous. I think I need to go home. And I was like, whoa, so she leaves and then she calls me from the parking lot crying. And she's like, I just projectile vomited everywhere. And I was like, oh, baby, like, wow, this crazy. Like, I can't remember the last time that she threw up. So I was like, all right, we'll go home. I'll come down. I'll deal with that. Don't worry, just go. She goes home. And I think, okay, stomach bug, bad timing, bummer, but it didn't go away. And it became, she wasn't vomiting anymore, but she couldn't hold on to food. And I was like, oh, this skin is a little scary. And it's one of those where, like, how many people does diarrhea kill? You know, so I was like, really getting paranoid. And just nonstop, nonstop, nonstop. Everything she ate, nothing like would stay. And I was like, whoa, this skin really scary. And so we have her microbiome tested. And they're like, you basically don't have a microbiome. They're like, it's been so decimated by overuse of antibiotics. It's my wife used to get chronic chest infections. And so she took antibiotics just in the time that I knew her probably, I don't know, 12 times. So and who knows how many before that? So I mean, she just absolutely murdered it. And then, of course, the scents are into, she wasn't clinically depressed. She was getting real close and just really, really struggling emotionally, struggling physically, unable to like maintain a physique, like just, it was crazy. And so in building it back up and seeing how complicated it is, seeing how much it affects in neurochemistry, knowing that what 95% of serotonin is stored in the gut, I mean, it's crazy. So it just started being this whole thing of like, whoa, I think this is wildly underappreciated. We started doing a lot of microbiome testing at Quest and it was just like, man, people's microbiomes, the diversity is just absolutely atrocious. It's pretty crazy. So whenever I hear something that has to do with neurochemistry, I immediately go to. This is a microbiome problem. So what's changing it then? So in her case, antibiotics might have played a role massively restricted eating. So we both had really restrictive diets. So remember the whole rabbit starvation, she was doing the same thing. So just overrestriction, over sanitizing hands, over washing hands, like, never getting anything that's dirty. Yeah, I mean, just making literally every mistake that you can make with your microbiome. That would suggest, because again, the microbiome in that situation would be a facilitator of an environmental issue, right? The environmental change is being nutrition, overuse of antibiotics, sanitation, things like that. I also wonder if there are sort of psychological, emotional cues in the environment that exacerbate this problem. Wouldn't you be in nice stress? I mean, I hate that word because it's such a sort of loaded term, but I wonder if people feel more alone today than they felt a couple hundred years ago. One of the things you talked about earlier that you were very passionate about was, even though you didn't use the word, was kind of your tribe. It's funny. People ask me if I'm ever talking about my training in medicine, they're like, residency sounded really horrible because you know, you worked about 110 to 115 hours a week. You probably slept about, I remember I slept about 28 hours a week, so it was pretty miserable. And it's really funny. I look back at it as one of the fondest five year periods of my life. And it's despite all of those things, of course, not because of all those things, but part of it was just a camaraderie. I mean, just brotherhood and some sisterhood, right? I mean, there was just amazing male and female residents that you were in the trenches with. And it was a shared sense of purpose, a shared sense of mastery, a shared sense of suffering, but I wonder if outside of places like the military and residency and startup companies, which are places where you see a lot of that camaraderie, are we losing that more broadly? And was that something we were wired to experience? That's really interesting. And another thing that really interests me is the way that culture stacks. So if you had ex amount of expectation on your shoulder to succeed, then you give that to your kids, plus some, and then they give that to their kids, plus some. And when I think like how much my parents drug me around, and that seemed crazy, but then I see how much parents dragged their kids around. Now, that's one of the reasons I don't have kids. I was like, if that's the expectation, I'm not prepared to be a chauffeur. So it just gets crazy the amount, like the level of sort of, and look, I'm a freak for efficiency. But the level of like clinical efficiency that people work into their lives, where there is no more play. Like one thing I will tell you that my wife and I are really good about with each other is reminding ourselves not to lose playfulness. Because look, when I came into business, I needed to toughen up. I needed to get harder. That's just true, my personality. And so as I did that and became more powerful, more self-assured. Like it was amazing. But I started to harden. Everything about me was just harder. My wife would be telling a story and I'd be like, get to the punch line, which is a terrible thing to do in your marriage, by the way. And she was like, you just got in harder. You need to be playful. Like loose and up, you used to be goofy. So yeah, it's interesting. Like how much of that stuff is as we shape each other and we shape the society. And we talk about things like terraforming Mars, but then all of a sudden like fuck, you've got to give your life over to terraforming Mars. Like if you want to be the next Elon Musk, he set the bar so high that it's like where is that breaking point where there's, there's no more natural off switch. You've got your phone all the time. There's no natural break where it's like, well, there's no electricity. So when I'm in the cave, like there's nothing left to do or it's the weekend. There are no phones. There is no email. So everybody's gone home. So there's no work to be done. So there were all these natural sort of kill points that, I don't know, exist anymore. And look, I'm the biggest violator of all. I love to work. My problem is people apply this stuff when they don't even love it that much. And so now they're just working around the clock at something that drains them, that get scary fast. What routines are rituals? Do you have around protecting yourself to maintain a creative environment? Do you have forced downtime or forced time away from work? I'm guessing exercise is still very important. Do you mean what sort of routines do you enact to make sure you can function at your best longitudinally? Well, the make sure that I function at my best, I optimize cognitively. So my diet is like thing number one. I don't fuck around with my diet. My diet is on point. And I work out five days a week and that is hugely important. I hate it. Absolutely hate the gym, but it's critically important to strength, longevity, and cognitive optimization. Why do you hate the gym? It hurts. Is the honest answer? That's part one. Part two is dude. Remember the whole thing I want to live forever because there's so many things I want to do that I love that every minute I'm in the gym is a minute I'm not doing something that I would really intrinsically love. Like in and of itself, the moment is fun. In the gym, I love the result. I love being able to say I do hard things. But in the moment, it's just pain. It's lactic acid building up. It's heavy weights. It's the disappointment of not being able to lift away. You've been trying to get. It's like everything about it is meeting my limitations. Even if it's just the limitation of I can only do so many reps in a given set for a given weight. It's like I literally failed to do this thing. So the act of being in the gym for me is a nathema to the things that I love. It's ugly. It's not even beautiful. So it's like iron and weight. Oh God. I'm always surprised that I have to explain that to people. Do you enjoy the gym? Me? Yeah. I do. I wife loves the gym. You're both crazy to me. Whatever in Dwarf and Russia getting, I'm not getting. It is everything about it in the moment is unpleasurable. It's interesting. I wonder why I enjoy it. I guess we all get the things that are easy for us. And for me, fortunately exercise comes easily in terms of it really requires no discipline. Now sometimes it's a bit of a challenge as far as time management. And sometimes I don't feel like exercising. But it's always for the reason you just described, which is I've really got this other thing to do and it's really pressing. But let's be fair. If you said to me Peter, I'd like you to go swim the Cat Lane in the channel next year. That I have no desire to do again. I have no desire to spend what probably amounted to 20, 24 hours a week in the ocean swimming. As part of the training. I mean that I don't have a desire to do. But I really do enjoy dead lifting. Which is not to say it's not unpleasant. And it's not to say that it also makes me upset when I can't do it. So I certainly understand all of those things. So I have this thing where part of my stick-in-longed cavity is rule number one is don't get hurt. So it's like exercise matters, but don't be an idiot. And so one of the things I've been fortunate to develop over the years with the help of a lot of great physical therapists, trainers and such is a really good sense of the cues that tell you something's not right that day. So I'm getting pretty good at knowing when my glutes are not firing. And when I'm dumping the weight into my sacchariliac joint or into my lumbar spine. And so even to this day, about one out of every five times I go to deadlift, I abort. Really? Yep. That's smart. So I'll go, you know, I warm up bar 135, 135, 125, 275, 315 is always the warm up. And if on the way up that ladder, I don't feel perfect. Like perfect. All glute basically doing the work. Nothing loading into my lower back. If I don't feel that, we're done. And honestly, I think at least out of, yeah, probably one every five sessions, we just abort. And that pisses me off. I mean, truthfully, I get really pissed for like another couple hours. I'm like, I can't believe I didn't get the deadlift. I got away to hold week to try this again, blah, blah, blah. And I have the same rule with squatting. You got to can it if you can't do it. But now go back to nutrition. Tell me about what is dialed in for you. So I'm on just whole foods whenever humanly possible. So I try to vary my sources. So I'll have a wide variety of vegetables, constituting a very diverse color array. I eat a lot of eggs. I have a lot of fat in my diet primarily from olives and olive oil. Those are the big fat. And then I do eat a fair amount of red meat. That would be, I guess, philosophically, some people believe it to be a higher person than a generic meat. I'll say this. I'm not the right person to take advice on it, but I have no fears about that. I get a lot of my fat from that as well. And then, yeah, that's it. Whole food, cycle between beef, chicken, some lamb, a little bit of pork. And just try to keep it, quote unquote, clean, high fat low carb. And I never cheat. Not never, but wow, it's rare. Twice a year, maybe. And then it's not like some debatrous day. It's like, omel. What do you do as far as meal timing fasting things like that? Yes, so I also do a lot of fasting. So I do a lot of intermittent fasting, but then also at least once a year, I'll do a five day fast. And that's water only. It's not like a Ramadan style. Water only fast fast fast for five days. That's been big. What do you feel when you do the five day water only fast? Anger, a lot of hatred. Now, the big thing, to be fair, what I love about fasting is that it's hard as hell. And I know that I'm going to stick with it. So there's like so much just like juice that comes from that. But the reality is the first two days are easy. By day three, the problem is mostly boredom. And what I've realized is I get a lot of dopamine hits from no, oh, I'm going to eat. Like, here comes this meal. I love this meal. It's going to be awesome. And there's none of that. So your day doesn't have those like excitement markers in it. So for me, the big problem is, and then also by day four, I do start slowing down. Even though I'm fully keto adapted, I'm posting awesome numbers. I'll get into the threes when I'm doing a five day fast. So it's like my machinearies there, I usually do a cycle of keto leading up to a fast. I'm already primed to burn fat. So it's not that. It's just I do feel less energetic. So and I don't know if I just am not a great fat burner or if I'm able to, I don't use the key tones as a fish. I don't know. But by day four, I'm like, yeah, I'm 20% off my normal, like I go go. Now, it's not like anybody around me notices. I just know that it take, I have to push my energy out more. It's not just naturally there for me. How does your body composition change in that five days? I'll lose fat for sure. How much weight do you lose in the sky? I've never weighed myself. I know better because I can get super myopically focused on the scale. I'm going to guess call it like three to four pounds probably. That's it. That's interesting. I lose more than that just doing a five day FMD. Really? Like the 750 calories a day, it's a thousand the first day and then 750 for four days. Yeah, I can lose. Now that said, it depends on the nutritional state I enter. So if I come in relatively carb fed, yeah, I'll lose 10 pounds in five days. But of course, much of that is water. So each gram of glycogen is carrying around four grams of water. So as you, if you take your glycogen store is down to 50% of baseline, you think about how much glycogen that is, plus how much water it is, plus the plasma. And then it's a reduction. It's interesting. I mean, I think it probably speaks to the fact that you're entering at a pretty lean state. If you're only losing three or four pounds in a five day fast. Yeah, and I don't do. I never carb live ever. Unless it's like Christmas and I have a snack or dessert or something there. But you know, it's so interesting. People assume because of all of the time I've spent in ketosis and all of this stuff. I've written about it that I don't like carbs, but it's like it'd be hard to find a person who likes carbs more than me. I've never really met a carb, I just freaking love them. I can eat plain white rice. I could eat a bathtub full of plain white rice. Wow. I just, I was gonna challenge you because I love me some carbs, but yeah, I'm not gonna eat plain white rice. You're gonna be, I hand the crown, and then when you do IF, how often are you doing that? If I'm in a ketogenic cycle, I do IF the entire time. So let's say I do one week protein, one week keto. That's pretty typical for me, so I just bounce back and forth because I find if I do too many consecutive weeks where I'm actually posting ketones in my blood, then I do start to notice the softening of my muscles, and so I just don't feel as hard. So I tend not to stay ketogenic for long, but I'll bounce back and forth. So you're saying you'll go a week of ketosis, which is obviously restrictive in carbohydrate and protein. Correct. And then on your protein week, do you mean you're adding both carb and protein back in? They're mostly just protein. And so on your on protein week, how many grams a day of protein are you getting? Ooh, I spent a while since I counted now, I just tier by my blood and how I feel I probably throw in, I'll add from what I'm normally doing, I'll add 40 grams of protein. It's about right. That's really interesting because that's not that much. So let's say in ketosis, you're walking around that 100 grams, you'd go up to 140. Correct. Which would be enough to knock you out, and do you reduce your fat intake during the off-week sort of unintentionally, yeah, when I'm high protein. It'll come down just because the calories are being replaced with protein. Okay, so yeah, what I'd asked you was, where does your IF fit into that? Are you IFing during the ketone week, but not the non-ketone. Correct. Correct. Because I find it so easy to intermittent fast when I'm ketogenic and I find it a little more distracting, I always do, like I never eat in less than a 12 hour window. So, but I don't consider that intermittent fasting. I only consider intermittent fasting if I go all the way to 16 hours without food. My average day, even when I don't consider it, IF, I eat my last meal at 6, and then I eat my first meal at 8. That's typical for me, so what's that? 14 hours? So my typical day is a 14 hour gap. And then, how deliberate are you about to sleep? Very, I'm a psycho about sleep. So I'm in bed, by 9 PM, every night, like it's a religion. Mind it through Friday on Saturday, I'm a little looser. But yeah, I get to bed, I don't use an alarm, I sleep as much as I need, I wake up when I wake up, it is what it is. And I have been doing that now for like 16 years. So that's critical. Do being tired is a unique form of misery. You are worse at everything you do. And so for somebody who's trying to optimize cognitively, like I'm trying to get as much done as humanly possible, if I don't get sleep, then I'm just slower. So I'm like, I was better off spending the time sleeping and then just being more efficient with the time that I was awake. That's a hard thing to explain to some people because certainly theoretically what you describe makes sense. But I think a lot of people say, look at the end of the day, if you're going to give me four more hours to work and I'll sleep four hours instead of eight, how can that be worse? There was a study that was done at the University of Chicago a couple of years ago. It's a pretty good study. Very small study, but it was very well controlled study. They took a group of healthy volunteers and did Uglysy McKinslan clamps on them, which is, of course, the gold standard for measuring glucose disposal. So they did the study. They did the Uglysy McK camp and then they restricted their sleep to four hours and night for 14 consecutive days. So basically they did for two weeks what we did in residency for five years. And then they controlled what they were eating during that experiment. So the resultum about the described was not simply the result of that they ate more during that time. But when they repeated the Uglysy McK clamps, their glucose disposal had fallen by 50% so they became about twice as insulin resistant with getting four hours of sleep a night for just two weeks. Whoa. This is but one study. There are other studies that have looked at other elements of this. And I sort of assumed that the extra fatness I got in residency was just due to my dietary deterioration. But I now believe that it was also in large part due to the lack of sleep. The other thing is it's very difficult to consolidate memory with sleep deprivation. The hippocampus is very sensitive to this. And of course that's where we consolidate memory. So I'm kind of amazed at the gaps I have in my memory from that period of my life. Yeah, when you said that that you look back on it as one of the best periods of your life, how do you remember it? Like when I get that fat fatigue and the funny thing is I'm the same with film school. It's the same thing. It just no sleep due to this ridiculous. And at the end of that, like the bonding is intense because you're all going through this hard thing. You're having to help each other. You're all exhausted, but you find the way through it's amazing. And then in the end I was like, Jesus, there are just patches where I'm like, I don't remember man, because you're so tired. It's crazy. So do you meditate? Do you have a practice or a spirituality? It's interesting. You think of meditation as spiritual. So I meditate like a fiend. It totally changed my life. And I don't know where I would have been in my more stressful years without it. I'm so grateful. And for a long time, because I'm a fool, I didn't meditate and didn't want to. Didn't want to hear about it. It sounded so feminine. Like, I was a guy really needed to toughen up, which is weird. This came up like three times in this. And so, yeah, I just resisted it. And then I met NaviSeal and they marked a vine. I don't know if you've heard of him. Amazing dude. And he was like stopping in Jackass meditate. And so I went and watched his videos. I thought, all right, if it's, you know, NaviSeal, tough guy, let me give this a shot. And I was like, whoa, once I understood, it's taking me out of the sympathetic nervous system into the parasympathetic and that diaphragm breathing actually causes that trigger to happen, that it's mechanistic. I was like, okay, all of a sudden I get this. This isn't woo woo woo. This is like some hard biology and allowed me to really begin to train down. Because I am incredibly anxious by nature. And when I was in business and constantly out of my element and learning and I was always behind, I developed just massive anxiety. And so I defined a way to like figure that shit out. And so meditation has been just inhumanly helpful. So now if I'm like about to go on stage or something, guaranteed if they're like doing the announcement, I am meditating. Dive her and breathing, getting into a nice calm state. Like, it is crazy to me how well it works. And now like, I'm an evangelical for this. I want to bite the microphones so people will listen. If they have not tried meditation, like it is such a game changer, such a game changer. Because it gets rid of what I call the background radiation. Like all that just sort of residual stress. Now, you're sure what you're stressed about. You just feel uneasy, something, something's looming. And so meditating even on my worst day, I can get to absolute zero where I am totally stress and anxiety free. Just from breathing. It's crazy. Mindfulness component to that. In other words, are you doing a breath meditation where while you are breathing, you are focusing on a component of the breath? Or is it more a concentration thing where you have like, you know, sort of a mantra in the background? All breath. 100% I don't remember who said this. It might have been Sam Harris, but it might have been somebody else. And I reflected on it and realized it's, it's very interesting and it's quite true that if you ever consider a negatively valence demotion. So the reason I throw in the word valence is because some people get all bent out of shape when you say an emotion is positive versus negative. So just so no one gets bent out of shape. I'll just say negative versus positively valenced. None of them are really rooted in the present. So depression, sadness, anxiety, fear. When you think of all of the negatively valence demotions, they are virtually all rooted in the past or in anticipation of the future. And I think it was the realization of that and the desire to sort of drown out some of those things that got me very interested in mindfulness meditation, which was this notion of being as present as possible. And I even took it to really interesting depths of, I don't think Sam made this point, but somebody made this point, which was even pain, physical pain that we endure is actually more about the anticipation of worsening pain or progression of that pain or non-saccession of that pain than it is the actual moment. And I was like, that can't be right. So Josh is my body worker. So one day Josh is working on me and there's this one move he does on me that is quite literally upsetting. That's when he gets into my serratus and my sub-scapularis. And it's unbearable on many levels. Definitely there's some nerve impingement going on when he's getting in there. He's probably like yanking on some of the hairs on my arm pit or something. And the whole thing is unbearable. And one day when he was doing it, I was like, all right, try the exercise. Focus on your breath and focus on the pain at exactly that moment, but don't think about how much it's going to hurt in two more minutes. Just think about it in that moment. And I was totally amazed by that experience. And it was like a very interesting tool that I have since continued to experiment with any time I find myself in extreme pain, especially pain that sort of lasts for a long period of time. And it definitely makes me understand that there are probably people out there who can have total mind control over pain. Speak of mind control. I remember the first time you came over for dinner. You guys came all the way down from LA down at San Diego, we all had dinner. And I remember you talking about mind control. You were like, I want you to come and work for Quest. You're like, just have mind control over you. And some shit like that. You were like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how do you think about that? Have you refined your thinking around mind control? Yeah, I think that really comes down to energy output. I think that you really can. It's almost distressing how much you can move people in a direction. You want them moved if you're willing to put in the time and the energy. But you really have to play a super long game. And oftentimes, not worry about what's their best interest. And that just doesn't not suit my personality. So I found that far better to think about who are the people that are resonant with what I'm doing. Right? Here's what I'm doing. Put it out there. Tell people get them excited. Show them my excitement. Let them understand my vision where I'm trying to go. And then go, OK, of these 20 people that I would love to do something with who's the one that steps forward and says, I want to do that with you. That to me is far more interesting. So I used to say, and this is what you're thinking about on a long enough timeline, I can get anyone to do anything. And I just don't even think about it like that anymore. Even if that's true, and maybe it is, if you give me 100 years, maybe nobody can resist, my wily charms. But it just stops being interesting. It's like, I want to do stuff with people that want to do it. I want to do it with people that are excited about it. And so yeah, I take a really different approach now. And my thing now is about sharing the vision. Here's what I'm trying to do. Embodied the excitement, because I know how infectious it is neurologically. I know that we really do share energies. And if you're around somebody and you're amped up, like they're going to pick up on that, they're going to get more energetic. And I just know that people like to be around people that make them feel more alive. They make them feel better about themselves that feel energized. So finding people like that, and then I am just really not a fan of having to be a raw raw leader. Like, I want to play my part in the creation of whatever we're creating as well. So I would much rather do that. Like, create the environment, create the enthusiasm, show people we're trying to do this, and it matters. And you're going to be able to get that fulfillment that we talked about. It's going to be hard as hell, but we're going to be able to do it. Like, I want to create that environment and then go and fight too. So that's far more interesting than having to type Jedi mind tricks and shit and like, trying to really understand what you want and make sure I'm setting things up so that you're getting that. I'm always just thinking about you, man, far better to say, this is the environment. This is what we're doing who wants in. But I'm sad that you never came to work for Quest. I did really want that bad. I did. Yeah. I know people are listening to this podcast right now because they believe in you. But I'm just saying that belief is well placed. You are one of the most intriguing human beings. I have ever met the way your mind works. I almost stopped you earlier because you were saying something so fucking interesting that I was like, just the way you think through a problem captures my imagination. So there are just some people do. I have a total of man crush on your brain. It's amazing. Well, I appreciate that very much Tom. And I can't thank you enough for making the time today. And I really want to apologize for the fact that you're doing this before I'm doing your show. I promise you, I will, if you still want me to be on, I did be honored to be on. And I can't wait to, I don't know how I'm going to top this. I don't know what you'll ask me about that's interesting. But that will be fun. Trust me. We will crush that. I would have you on in a second. So whenever we can make that happen, we'll make it happen. And anybody listening to this that likes themselves and Peter at you will want to hear that interview because I promise I will take this guy to some very interesting places. So where can people learn more about you if they're listening to this and they're new to you? At Tomville you. So my last name is Bill Beism Bravo. I L Y E U. It's across all socials. My primary two are going to be Instagram and YouTube. So yeah, you have a pretty prominent YouTube channel. Don't you? Dude, I'm proud of that damn thing. So YouTube is hard to win at. It is hard to build a meaningful audience. And we've done a really great job. And it's just growing crazy. And by the time people hear this, I'm sure we've crossed 400,000. Wow. I didn't realize it was that big. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really, really been special. And we just pour our heart and soul into making an awesome show and getting people like you on the show, no BS. I'm just really, really proud of what we've done there. And one of my favorite stories. So I'm walking in Vegas, Casino and a 51 year old black man jumps out in front of me, crying. And he was like, dude, you changed my life. And I thought this is the world we live in now. Like you can make content. Like here's the thing. And I think it goes without saying, I'm not paid to be on the show. I'm on this show because I believe in you. And I believe in what you're going to bring to people. And I think this is going to be special. And I'm so glad that you did it. Because meeting you once randomly changed my life. The fact that you're going to make yourself available through the show to the millions of people that I hope find this is incredible. Like what an insane time that we live where extraordinary people can be rewarded for sharing that kind of stuff? Jesus dude, I know how much you charged to be a concierge client. So like it is crazy. Like it's so amazing. So yeah, I love it. I love what we've done with YouTube. I love them. proud of the show, which is called Impact Theory. Just the people that have come on and share their wisdom is bananas. So, thank you, Tom. Thanks for having me. You can find all of this information and more at PeterOTaMD.com forward slash podcast.

Tips with the part, make sure your heels are in line with your hips. Keep your left heel on the ground with your right leg up. You can lift the hips and pull them straight enough right leg. And then quick check down us to make sure that your hips are level that you're not hiking one up more than the other. Then you're going to slowly lower the right leg down to top the ground just the leg. Keep the hip up. And then this leg, you should feel us in your left glute. You should have any popping or clicking in your back or in your pelvis if you do. You've got to need your arms more. It's two four more ups there. Good lower everything down from everything back up. Make sure that you're at least you line with your hip. The left knee is not going to block the side at all. She's going to all this near glute and hamstring nothing in the back. Very little in the water steps. Four more. Good now hold yourself up. Just lower the hips down only. Just the hips and then lift it back up. So as you lift the hips up, you want to focus like you're pushing the top front of your hips up to the ceiling. Not arching in your lower back. Good floor one. Last two. Now hold at the top lower two inches. Then lift two inches of the hips. Two inches of the hips. Good. I need several. Use that left glute. Six. Four. Three. Two. Good.

So, heal and sparring out as possible. So, hips fully extended. They're putting the toe down and put that tension on it. We need an TFL on the side of the wave. So, let's work about not dumping into the long bar spine, easy to accentuate that curvature. But it's gonna easily really hurt. That's that.

Good, let's say hips up make sure that the right elbow is right in the right shoulder and gauge the right mid back and the right knees in line with your hip. Abs engage lower the left leg down and up. You're gonna feel this in your left, glute knee, make sure the left leg stays in line with the hip. Three more. Good, then everything comes down. Strong with the trunk as you lift up, don't extend your lower back. And hold at the top two inches down with the left leg two inches up. Three more. Good.

That was what I was supposed to get my position right so it takes a pretty narrow stance of something like a power slider and if you think about it. If you have aduction, avoiding a knee dogus and trying to get hips back. I sort of aligned the mirror a little bit. Make sure the knees are covered by the toes. I'm not trying to do the deepest squat, I'm just trying to get my can of hips right. Mostly paying attention to the glute fire. My feeling is more than glutes and the quads. And then quickly transition into a lunge. Feel free to point out for all of what I'm doing. Yeah, so his heel is high on the ball amount of his toes. He's getting that maximum, great toe extension. Make sure that his lumbar spine stays neutral so he descends down into his lunge. He's really eccentrically loading the right quarter step and not just collapse into his lower back. So by staying really strong in his transverse abdominis and seeking straight down, he's maximum of the left quarter up here and extending his thoracic spine instead of just collapse you right into the lower back. Right glute, left quad. Let's get back together.

Okay, sorry to lunch position. If you're just going to bend the right leg down, working on his right glute. Here we have a sub-ruget, starting to make sure that the back is neutral. You don't have any extension in the lower spine. You should be feeling left glute and right quad loading here. So, there's going to come down, reach out for the block, lift the right leg up. So, in this position, make sure the left knee does not go into balladges, or in turn, our rotation should be pointing straight forward. And then the right hip is going to come down a little bit more. Then you're going to cross it and come over into a curtsy. It's going to lean forward, come back up into the standing split position. So, make sure the right hip stays down. Left glute should really be firing. Then right knee's going to pull through. Let's go to the back. Left right back into that perfect lunge position. Back, neutral in the mirror is the side will help you here. Good one more. Lift up left glutes firing. Back's neutral, she sinks down. Perfect. neutral. Sweet back. And then that perfect lunge. Awesome.

So this is going to be the more advanced version of the shark bite. So using the right leg back and grab the weight. So first, he's going to find his lunge, sink down into a lunge position, find his left glute, and his right hip flexor and quad. And Peter's going to lean forward, come into his standing split position, make sure the pelvis is aligned. Give me three taps here. And he's going to go over into his<|it|>zi. Back as upright, sink straight down. He's going to go right back into his standing split. Again, three taps right here. Making sure that he's really pushing the left hip back. So I think he has left glute and hamstring. Nothing in the tens behind the knee, pull straight forward. And then right back into that perfect lunge position. So as you move into this second repetition, when you lean forward, come into stance, let you believe that I'm going to make sure the right hip is down with the left, the left hip is slightly pushing back. So the pelvis is long. And then upright position is just to see the down into your cursy. I'm going to engage the transverse abdominis here, so I can any lower back extension. Pull straight through. Lunge position, back heel higher with the ball line of the toe, sinking straight down. Good. Awesome. One, two, three. Move toward 밝ies her hips.

If I don't have much time in the gym, I'm only doing compound exercises. For today's AMA, all things related to muscle mass and muscle strength. I mean, the truth of the matter is you always need to be kind of trying to push this. Why should everyone who's listening to this? Care about this topic. A very active individual, lower level of decline, still declining. A population average, quicker level of decline, and a sedentary individual, much quicker level of decline. How would someone implement progressive over mode? Maybe the most obvious way that people would naturally think of which is you can increase the load or the weight. But you can also do it by increasing the reps. Any other aspects of nutrition? Really one of the few supplements that I almost universally recommend. What are some ways that I can start this? In hopes of knocking an injured and doing this for a long time? Act is though you've never done this before. Focus on injury prevention. What does some programming look like for them? And how could they take that information to a gym? Thank you for viewing this sneak peek of an ask me anything episode of the drive.

People say I want to lose weight, but I've never actually heard somebody say what I really want to do is lose a lot of muscle and stay as fat as possible. All of these things can theoretically imply that fasting can further benefit to health, beyond the equivalent amount of caloric restriction. And if someone is going to do fasting, are there ways that they can potentially save some of that lean mass? If I could go back in time and do anything different, Nick, I would go back to that three-year period of time when I was doing all of that insane fasting and I would have done this. Is there any evidence that extended fasting reduces cancer risk in particular? If fasting results in a long-term and sustained reduction in excess body fat or at a capacity, then that would indeed lower the risk of cancer. How does fasting potentially help either prevent or improve symptoms of autoimmune diseases? Intermittent fasting and long-term fasting of up to a week can really reduce systemic inflammation and that could obviously help with any autoimmune disease. Do we have any evidence or knowledge that can fasting can extend lifespan on a whole? Thank you for viewing this sneak peek of an Ask Me Anything episode of the Drive.

People with mild hearing loss have about a 90% relative risk of dementia, whereas those with severe hearing loss, it's a 400% increase in the risk of dementia. For today's AMA, set a focus on one topic. We gathered some of the most common questions we're asked on brain health, exercise, body composition. Are there certain exercises that are better for cognition than others? If people are worried about their risk for dementia. I think an individual is always going to be better off doing more modalities than fewer. Next section exercise. If people are doing zone two training, how much do they need to avoid going into a higher zone? I never paid attention to whether I dipped in and out of it. I talk a lot to professional cyclists, and it's the same. So why do I fixate on it today the way I do? If women, particularly a perimenopausal menopausal women, should be doing zone two training? Yeah, again, this is one of those weird things where social media has just taken on this idea that women, especially postmenopausal women, should not do zone two. How do you think about advising people on the number of calories they should use if they think they have either a fast or a quote unquote slow metabolism?

If I'm sitting here drinking six mountain dudes a day, would I be better off doing everything the same but moving to six diet mountain dudes a day? Today's topic, everything around sugar and sugar substitutes. Are you better off with an artificial sweetener or a real sugar in a protein product? Is there any truth to the idea refined sugars are important to what more dangerous than natural sugars? Any sugar you're consuming unless you're chewing on the cane or eating the apple, it's refined. Whether I should be using sugar substitutes, swapping them out. Aluluses, a no-brainer for immediate use. I honestly think it's hands down the best alternative. How much does timing matter? There is no better time to consume sugar than after a workout and or during a workout. What do we know about the long term safety and long term use of artificial sweeteneres?

This would be the one where I've had the greatest change in my personal behavior. Highlight, things you found really interesting, anything you changed your mind on, how you work with patients. Lazy and Peter don't typically go in the same sense, except when talking about skincare. Actually, we came away with something pretty easy, right? Which is an AM and a PM protocol, males are often the driver of fertility issues. So think that three quarters of men are not even evaluated before fertility issues before proceeding to that is crazy. Rapa is being investigated as a potential drug to extend the fertility years in a woman. So if it's slowing the aging process of the human, is there a chance it's slowing the aging process of the egg? The estrogen drop during menopause is a major accelerator, a facial bone and fat loss. And that women should really be talking about HRT early. The point can't be overstated that the role it plays in skin health and bone health. Nobody should ever die of ASCBD, like full stop note note chance. If you were walking around with an APOB of 30 and normal blood pressure and you weren't smoking, I mean, it's almost impossible to die of a heart attack truthfully. Honestly, I think a good life is what makes a good death. Anybody who's listening to this still has something that they can do about it.

Hi everyone, welcome to the neck upper back and shoulder curriculum created by myself and Peter Atia. We decided to start with the shoulders neck and upper back because so many people that we take care of experience injuries here and I think part of it stems from an artifact of evolution. So most people are pretty aware that their hip is a very stable, ball and socket joint. We're pretty fortunate in that we through our evolution learn to stand up and in the process basically traded stability for flexibility. So in exchange for being able to throw a spear we had to give up a lot of stability here. So the first thing to keep in mind when you think about your shoulder is this joint doesn't behave like a typical ball and socket joint. And Jesse will explain a little bit about what the gleanoid faucet does and how the humorous is stabilized there. But the point to remember is you have a series of muscles that are doing a lot of the work that would be done by a typical socket elsewhere in the body. The second thing to keep in mind is if it weren't enough that we figured out a way to stand up and the chuck spears we've now in the last few years done something even more unnatural for which evolution hasn't given us enough time to catch up, which is we have now learned to do this. So we hunch over, we type, we look at screens, we look down and that is something we just haven't had any time to cope with. And so we see a typical set of injuries where the posterior chain, the muscles in the back, tend to be locked long. Also tend to be very weak and as that happens you transmit that weakness to other muscles. Now we're going to focus on four different specific aspects of the upper back and neck and shoulder. The first is just the range of motion of the neck. The neck is extremely mobile if you don't use it, you lose it. So we're going to work on not only increasing range but making sure that that neck and head can stay centered over the body so you're not getting all that upper trap and neck pain. The next one we're going to focus on is the actual glenoid fossa. This is an extremely mobile and shallow joint unlike the hip which is a deep and strong structural joint. So with the glenoid fossa we're not going to do a lot of overhead pressing but we will strengthen it in the overhead range. And the reason we're going to strengthen the overhead range is we also want to focus on the AC joint. This is where the shoulder most becomes impenetched around the acromion roof and the AC joint is responsible for allowing pivot and rotation in flexion and extension but most importantly it's the last stabilizer and overhead reach. So this is actually one of the first things that starts to degenerate. So working that AC process and strengthening it in that end range is going to help your pain in the front part of the shoulder. And the last thing in the most important area we're going to work on is something called the scapula. The scapula is your shoulder blade that's free floats, it doesn't have any attachments and it basically glides along the rib cage. Now the scapula is innovated by many muscles, the trapezius, rhomboids, pech minor, shoulder rotator cuff. And basically if any of those other muscles around it are impenetched or asymmetrical, the scapula is not going to move well. And that's important because the scapula is actually what saves the shoulder blade as the conduit of force. So the scapula is responsible for transferring force into the trunk and the trunk transfers force into the scapula. So if you have a nice rhythm where the scapula is moving in rhythm with your shoulder blade, all the force of daily living and exercise is going to be transferred into that scapula, into that core versus into that shoulder. When you look at athletes who really have to use their shoulders, swimmers would come to mind, incredible scapula flexibility. People often talk about the amount of reach that a great swimmer like Michael Phelps can generate in the scapula. This is the reason why it's to be able to catch water high and pull without loading the shoulder you have to be able to use the scapula. So whether or not you're a swimmer, just in our pretty convinced you're going to get a lot of value out of these movements in the sequence.

So this first exercise is going to relax the nervous system and allow our body to be more receptive to all the work we're going to do today. With Peter I'm going to do some deep breathing here. The crux of deep breathing is your breathing out longer than your breathing in to relax the nervous system. And we always remember we want to breathe through the diaphragm, filling the belly with air. It's not about how much air you can get, it's how much air you can fill into the stomach here. You're also using a diaper here but you can use a foam roller and what this is doing is relaxing the erectors and it's giving Peter something to relax into to be a little more mindful of his body through the breathing. So we're going to do a count of five count inhale, five count hold and ten count exhale. It's three breaths a minute, not very easy to do. It's a real challenge but if you get this right and this becomes comfortable it's going to really set you up for success for everything else we do. So I'm going to have Peter put his hands on a stomach and I'll take him through the count. You'll do this about nine times for about three minutes but we'll just show you one for the purpose of time. All right. So we'll start with inhale for one, two, three, four, five hold, two, three, four, five, exhale, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I cube Peter to breathe in through the nose and then breathe out through almost a whisper or a forced kind of a whistle because it's going to slow down the exhale so it doesn't lose all his breath at one time. So that's how you'll start our nervous system soft tissue sequence. We've already gone over this in the movement preparation sequence from the previous series but now we just want to show you again because it's something you can't skip when you're dealing with the upper back and shoulders. So this move is going to be that thoracic spine roll. Peter's going to put his hands wherever he prefers arms back, arms straight. Key points here again are just to make sure to roll the mid back to upper back and also not over extends his lower back but get his extension from right under those scapular wings, his shoulder blades and the thoracic spine. Once he's done that for about 30 to 45 seconds, he'll roll over to his side and get the serratus anterior and lat and the key principle here is to make sure he opens the hand here to pin and stretch and just go all the way down to his lat pretty deep and then back up always with breathing. So if you don't like to do here perhaps because I'm not that tough is I like to let my legs and my arms take some of the weight. I find if I try to put as much weight as possible on my serratus I'm getting bruised. Now we're going to work the pectoralis major and we're going to use this supernova ball here. This is a pretty low density one. You can also use a lacrosse ball if you want to be a hero but I think you'll find that slightly larger, lighter, less dense objects will feel a little bit better on this one. I love this one because you can pin and stretch the shoulder and the motions you want to use it so it's extremely functional for the functionality of that shoulder girdle. So I'm going to have Peter placed the ball right basically in the just outside the armpit of the peck and relax his chin and head on his hand here and I'm going to have him just reach forward. Now when he reaches he's going to separate his shoulder blade from his body, retract his shoulder blade in and then bring the arm down to a 90 degree angle. Reach up again, retracting. So again your pin and stretching here at the same time as you're giving some soft tissue love to those overworked pecks. The other thing I want you to do is make sure you do a few reps where you're reaching out to the side and that's going to focus even more on the peck. Again letting the scapula come out, letting the shoulder blade come in. Now we're going to work on neck range of motion. Basically you're carrying an eight pound bowling ball on your neck all day long so you want it to be a centered over your body as possible. So I'm going to take you through a few different stretches here and what I want you to pay attention to is to make sure to not hold these stretches for too long because your ligaments will take over. These are at most eight second holds and then you move on. Maybe about four reps on each side is plenty just loosening up the body and the shoulders around the neck. So first move I'm going to have Peter do are just some simple shoulder rolls forward. And then backward. And the key here is he's just keeping a nice relaxed neck cervical spine here keeping whatever extension he has neutral right there. The next move is going to be a chin to chest drop where I'm just going to have him keep his teeth together and drop his chin as far as he can. This is the most important one for not holding longer than eight seconds because this is a decent amount of flexion on the discs. But again if you don't use this range of motion you'll lose it. So you'll feel a nice stretch through the traps. The next two are going to be for the levator scapula and the actual upper traps which often get very tight on people. So those of you wondering what the levator scapula is which is not only a good crossword puzzle word. You want to point that out on him? Sure. Yeah. So it basically elevates the shoulder right here and it goes just diagonal along there and it's the main muscle that's keeping your scapula raised up and elevated. So to hit that one I want to look over this way and then take kind of a diagonal 45 down chin over collarbone clavicle and you'll watch the strain here you'll see right. So one. And to increase this stretch also I'm going to have Peter clasp his hands behind his back that's going to pull the traps in tension and he's going to feel even a deeper stretch. And then back to a neutral position. Focus on the traps and that's just a simple lateral flexion here and this one you're going to really feel almost a burning go through the traps here. But again the more you can pin your shoulders back and down the more you'll feel that stretch. For the last and most important exercise to counteract technology and keep the head centered over the body we're going to have Peter do some chin tucks with extension. Now the first move you'll do is actually glide your chin forward and then you'll bring the chin back, staying in that same plane and you'll create a fat chin here which is okay because it's going to relax all the muscles in the traps and it's going to really turn on those stabilizers right behind the neck. Once Peter makes that fat chin he's going to look up but only look as high as he can without actually losing that fat chin because all this is the incorrect way. If I have him go all the way up he's going to start to really torque the spine there. So he's going to keep those muscles turned on, glide back, look up, keeping that fat chin breathing, glide forward, glide back, great strength thinner and an amazing counteraction to all the technology that we're with too. Also I find this one of this stretches where it's really difficult for me to breathe through my mouth so you gotta remember to breathe while you're doing this but note that for most of you it's going to be more comfortable to just breathe in and out through your nose.

Now we'll move on to part two dynamic stabilization in our series. So this exercise is going to strengthen the cervical extension and all of the supporting muscles around the neck to really make sure you can stay with your head centered over your body. So I'm going to have Peter, stand nice and tall, put his hands behind his head, glide his chin forward, and then glide his chin back into that chin pack. He's putting some isometric tension here into his hands, breathing, holding for eight seconds, feeling these muscles strengthen here, the ligaments relax, and all of this is going to actually turn into putty in his upper traps. It's going to glide forward again, create some isometric tension, chin back. Another variation is you can use a towel here and hold it behind your head if you want, but this is just the simplest way to do it. Always with breath. In this next exercise, I want you to pay particular attention to the cues I give to Peter and how I position his body. I see people doing this incorrectly all the time and the difference between doing this the right way and the wrong way is going to make all the difference to the health of your shoulder in the long term. This is called the 1990. Now you can see that we've placed a towel under Peter's head here and that's to protect his head from flexing down and creating any tightness within that. In that next cervical spine. I'm going to have him rotate his right arm as far as he can behind him and touch the ground and Peter's doing a great job here. He's reaching high and lying with his forehead. I see all the time people reaching down here, internally rotating the shoulder and not actually getting the opening of the shoulder that we're looking for. So reaching for the forehead is key here. The other thing he's done is you'll notice he's moved his eyes with his hand. So you want to look where you're going because cervical rotation and thoracic spine rotation go hand in hand. So always move that neck move those eyes. Another important key here is that he's not over rotating his lower back. His rotation is coming from his upper back. In fact, if I put my hand here, Peter's hip, you'll notice he's not putting any pressure into me at all. So he's able to fully rotate and separate rotation from his upper body to rotation from his lumbar spine, which we don't want. You don't want to torque and wrench that lower back. Fight the urge to separate the knees because that will give you artificial rotation through the lower back. Really squeeze and keep those knees tight through the whole movement. Now here's a great cheat. If you can't quite reach the floor because the last thing you want is to be reaching and struggling and reaching because that's not going to relax anything in your body or open up any flexibility. So we're going to put this block under Peter's knees. And now you're a little bit elevated through the hip. So you're going to be able to rotate all the way because you're already a little bit rotated in that hip. It's going to feel a lot easier. If that still doesn't do the trick, I would just get whatever you have in the house, stacks and books rotate again and press into that stack. The key here is you can't be just hanging out in space or it's not going to work. Always breathing again. The last thing I want to show you is that if you have a partner or a buddy, you can actually open up the ribs and the serratus and the spiral line. So I'm going to have Peter reach. And I'm going to lock his hip here and I'm going to help him rotate through the ribs and you feel a great stretch there. The best stretch ever because I'm actually open up the entire spiral complex that's impinging this movement and then I'll help him rotate back. Now we're going to mobilize the internal rotation of the shoulder while protecting the lower back from moving. I'm going to have Peter get on all force. He's going to rock back here where his hips are almost touching his ankles there. What this does is it posteriorly tilts the pelvis so it locks in a position. I'll have him walk his hands a little bit higher actually. You can see it's really important that his chest and shoulders are higher than his hip. Internally rotate the right arm behind his back. Now you're going to want to crank this on your own and see how high you can get and be a hero. But the higher you get, the more you'll start to impinge that shoulder. So only go to where you can keep that extension of the shoulder blade and not let it tilt forward. And then I'm going to have Peter lead again with his eyes just like in the last exercise pull his shoulder back squeeze that shoulder blade. Take a breath and then go back down. He's going to reach. Make sure he kept his hips low and his chest high lead with his eyes squeeze the shoulder blade. He's doing a great job of keeping that shoulder open and now you'll be able to put on your backpack without tearing your shoulder. Now we're moving on to the all important thoracic extension without cervical extension or flexion. So a nice neutral neck. I love this exercise and the reason I love it is because you're getting some nice thoracic spine extension and mobility. But the arms are bent so you're not impinging the AC joint by having a arm straight. So if you actually have any kind of shoulder problems with the AC joint right here. You can do this safely and still get some nice extension of your upper back. So I'm going to have Peter put his elbows on this slot here. If you're in a gym you can use a bench. You can use a couch at home. Whatever you have to put your elbows on so your head is floating off. So if you've done a cat cow pose in yoga you'll be familiar with this. We're going to have Peter actually going to extension. This is the cat park. But the key here is that he's not overextending his lower back or low bar spine. His hinge point is in his mid thoracic right here. He's going to take a breath. Then come up, pro-track the shoulder blades a little bit and then go back down into that extension. Focus in on getting the hinge from here and you might not go that far. Don't create any false movement from here. It's fine to be a small movement and in time you'll increase that range of motion. Now if we want to take this to the next level and you have pretty open shoulders and a scap and scapula you can actually put your hands behind you and cross them. And this will further stretch those lats and you can even press into where your hinge point is. So now you have a little bit of feedback of where you're hinging from. Peter's also doing a nice job of keeping his neck neutral. He's not over flexing his chin. He's just keeping it nice and relaxed. Key point here is to not let the chin flex forward. You want to keep it centered over the body as you extend and flex that thoracic spine. This next exercise is a fantastic compliment to the external rotation strengthener we did before. We're going to take that shoulder through the entire range of motion overhead. Normally I like to do this with a really wide dowel to start and over the course of my workout because I usually do this in between sets of other exercises like squats or deadlifts. With progressive sets my grip will come narrower and narrower. But for the purpose of this we're just going to use a broomstick. It's actually a little narrower than I would like to start but I think it gives you a chance to see the rotation. A couple of cues I think about what I'm doing this and just point them out in detail as I'm doing it. One is try to have a very relaxed grip. The second is I want to be slightly cupped inside and just see I think we'll be able to point that out probably a little bit better when we go to a side angle. But I'll show you what this looks like from the front. So again, given that I'm limited by this broomstick I'm going to grab it as wide as I possibly can. I'm kind of a neutral stance. You can see I'm not standing bull upright. I have this cupped position which again will be more evident from the side. And with a very relaxed grip I'm taking this thing up and around. And nowhere in there am I feeling any impingement in the AC joint. Nothing in this position hurts. In fact this just feels like a wonderful movement. So if you're doing this and it hurts you need to be going wider. Let's take a look at what this looks like from the side and then Jesse will call out what he's cueing me to do. First of all that cup Peter talked about is in a great position here. It's almost the same activity you get in a really deep dead bug exercise where that transverse abdominis is fired up. Making sure that extension doesn't come from the Lumbar spine. But with this cup also you'll notice Peter stays neutral here and doesn't flex forward like he just did because if you cup too much you're going to have to work really hard to overcome that flexion of the up or back there. So we're going to cup at the lower Lumbar spine nice and neutral here. I'll have him reach up. Watch this moment here very important. His shoulder stays open the whole time. How do you know that you're basically doing this in a two-challenge way and that your arms are too close that you'll find this basically imping forward. We'll show Peter to a really close once you can see this would be too close right here. He'll do a lot of things and move around and you can see that shoulder come forward just a bit there and he can't even make it here without probably bending forward or changing just the wrong position. You'll know when it's wrong. So start wide, go slow, open up the extension all around that gleno-humorled joint. To finish up the sequence and prepare us for loading, this is a great exercise to strengthen all the extensors we worked already. We're using a stability ball for it because you can actually articulate the spine versus if you were on the floor you'd be stuck in a fixed plane. So this is going to actually let Peter move through his the facet joints of the spine. So we're going to have Peter lay down here. He's nice and relaxed with his neck. He's slightly over the ball with his chest and the reason I'm doing that is because when he's slightly over the ball he has the lift slightly with his chest versus if the ball was all the way into his chest he could just be very relaxed here. So again you're slightly hanging over the edge here. The first move he's going to make is forget his arms this way into a W position. Now we're starting with the W because this is the least provocative on the shoulder complex and everyone will be able to do this move. The biggest cue here is just making sure we're maintaining a 90 degree angle and again pinching that pencil between his shoulder blades here. The next move he's going to make is bringing his arms out into a T and then retracting again. You could see that he's fighting gravity here. So really he's working very very hard and this is close to loading. So that's why we put this at the end because it's probably the most work you'll do and this whole sequence for actually strengthen and stabilizing this movement. The next is he's going to reach into a Y here with his arms forward. The third hardest of the exercises. And now he's really working on that extension overhead again fighting gravity making sure he's moving from his mid back not his traps are next so the shoulders are staying down. And the last move is straight into an eye. This is the hardest and most provocative because the AC joint is working really hard to stabilize here. But it's also the best of them all in terms of getting the most range of motion out of the entire shoulder girdle. Now a lot of the exercises we talk about including this one can be done and should be done on a nearly daily basis or certainly any time you're about to exercise. But this exercise in particular I find really important to incorporate at higher volume into workouts when I'm going through phases where I just feel like I don't have this stability or strength in my shoulder. So during periods of my life when I've been coming back from shoulder injuries, this is exactly the time of workout I would do without a load by the way. I'm just using the weight of my arms and hands to do this as actually you know say 10 sets of this throughout a workout. So in the way we're doing it here where you might just progress through it once or twice, great way to prepare for load is about to do in the next sequence. But also don't forget that these are the kinds of exercises that you can do it a little bit more volume to actually increase the strength of the shoulder.

So now we're in the third and final sequence of our upper back and neck health and prep. What I love about this phase is we're actually getting to load the joint. So what I see a lot of times is people will stretch and leave it at that. First is when you actually load and put pressure on the joint it's much more likely to stay in that position. So you've got to challenge it now with load with weight or you'll just go back to your old patterns. The first exercise in the loading sequence is a wide row. I'm going to have Peter take the handles and create a little tension with his hands. Now you'll notice the downward angle here of the cable. That's so that the traps don't engage because when it's that downward angle it's more likely to keep his shoulders depressed and actually work the scapula and wrongboids in this area. Now all the time I see people wide row incorrectly. There's a lot of rows and all of them are good. You could do a close row. But when you do the close row you don't actually open up the joint and the rhomboids don't fire. It's mostly by-seps. So we're going to keep the row wide and elbows up so we can really focus on getting that rhomboid squeeze here and actually strengthen all those extensors that we work so hard to open up. All the time I see people try to get that last bit of row by turning their biceps in. So now you're really just doing a bicep curl and you're sathing all the strength and energy out of what you're trying to work which is that upper mid back. So always row keeping that 90 degree angle forward again. Pro traction, scapula, retraction, shoulder blades, rowing, really focusing on that pinch into the rhomboids. Also Peter's doing a fantastic job of keeping his head neutral. Often we want a row and as we get to the end the head will come forward. Make sure you really police yourself and stay back and neutral. Try to row in the posture you want to create. Now we're going to go into a hanging sequence where we're going to go through a few different variations of moves. But the idea here is to get the shoulder is open as possible and stabilize it all through the scapula and rotator cuff. Bringing everything we've done together and a great stability move for the shoulders. So I'm going to have Peter reach up and he's actually in a pretty close. The wider, the more provocative on the shoulder. So I want your basically thumb to be just outside of your shoulder blade pretty close and tight in here. Now the first move is going to be a dead hang. I say a dead hang but it doesn't mean that you're just totally flopping and letting your joints totally relax. So I'm going to ask Peter to just pull his shoulders down a little bit. So basically he's engaging that scapula right here. So now he's nice and tight here. Normally I would like it if we had a slightly longer height here so he could truly hang but this will do for our purposes. So that's it. Just hanging with his head straight pulling his shoulder blades down. I would start with as little as 15 seconds if you haven't done this before but you really want to work up to I'd say at least 45 seconds to a minute to really be moving on to the next phase. It takes a long time to establish this facial structure and you don't want to go too fast here. So start easy. Take your time progressing with this move. Now we're going to have him activate his trunk and this is a fantastic activator to basically make sure that he's getting that extension and hanging but he's not popping out as ribs and arching his back. So he's going to engage everything here and his deep transverse abdominis. Scoop his feet forward and now he really has to work very hard in that scapula to core stabilization. Remember we said that the scapula's job is to transmit weight into the core. So now I'm firing the core with this scoop and I'm firing up the scapula. Can you be strengthening for this complex? One point out here as I mentioned in the intro I have a torn labor mini shoulder and a lot of times I feel very vulnerable in a fully extended position. I've gone through phases of my life where it's very difficult to do a dead hang pull-up. But by doing this exercise which I always do before I go into my pull-ups I feel completely protected and in fact I feel a little out of sync if I try to do a pull-up without going through this exact sequence and the importance of being able to activate this transverse phascia when I'm in this position while protecting my shoulder while basically using a scapula to take the load off that joint and I just can't be overstated. So here as a guy with two torn laborum dead hanging. And let me also say that Peter's doing a great job activating his core but this exercise does decompress the back so the only time I wouldn't do this exercise is between heavy lifting because you don't want to tell the spine to decompress and then to compress with heavy weights. So do this anytime during your workout it's always a good time to hang hanging is the new planking but don't do it when you're doing a heavy hinge compression of the spine. This is the third and hardest of the hanging sequence so I really want to make sure that you can hang for at least a minute passively or in that hollow position before you even attempt this exercise. Start slow just 5 to 10 reps then build up to even 30 if you can handle it. The beauty of this exercise is that it puts each scapula in shoulder blade on an island so if you have any asymmetries and grips strength in time it'll start to balance out that asymmetry because one arm takes the load. So now we'll have Peter rocked back and forth making sure that when he transfers the energy from one arm to the other he's pulling the shoulder blade down on the hand that's gripping and then he'll transfer the other way pull that shoulder blade down it to the socket and transfer energy. He's just trying to get a little bit of lift here. A variation would be just starting this where you just kind of be light on your hand versus actually lifting it. So I'll have him actually stay with his hands on it and just practice gently transfer an energy pulling each shoulder down into the socket. Once you develop the coordination to transfer energy back and forth and feel comfortable bringing that shoulder blade down now you can actually lift the feet up and do this in real time. Paying close attention to really gripping, pulling that shoulder down, trying to get a little height with that opposite hand. Now we're going to show you a farmers carry sequence which is really important for the health and stability of that shoulder in its socket. What it does is it not only strengthens the joint socket in the scapula around it but it also strengthens your grip and we know that grip and shoulder health are interrelated. There's a reason why our grip gives up and pull ups because it's actually protecting our shoulder socket from something it can't stabilize. With any carry especially when your hands are down you want to use a weight that you can't buy a set curl because if you can do that you'll start to bend the bicep a little bit to take the torque off your shoulder. You've got to make sure to keep those arms really straight, pack your chin into extension with a straight strong cervical spine. This is another one where you want to move in the posture you're trying to create for yourself. So the first of the four carries is a farmers carry. I'm going to demonstrate this as Jesse explains how to do it correctly. I like to do these with one arm at a time because you have to fight all the lateral force of the old leaks versus doing a double carry. We're not really activating the sidewall of the trunk. I like to use double carry because I can cheat and lift more weight. So we're going to use the single carry and Peter's going to pick it up. Now, if you can't stand correctly in this position you can't walk. Peter's doing a great job of keeping a nice straight right side and where he's not flexing the oblique in. So I'll show kind of an incorrect way. We're going to flex the other cheek I see are people jut there hip out to decide to bring the center of gravity over the kettlebell. Nope, we're going to stay nice and tall shoulders back chin back. You're going to always see a little bit of space here. I also like to pretend I'm almost holding two kettlebells because that's going to turn on the other side and just walk at a medium pace. We're walking a little bit slow just because we're confined with space but feel free to walk at your natural cadence. You want to go pretty much until your grip comes out. I'd even queue Peter to be a little higher with his neck. It's really easy to let that neck flex forward here. Let's walk back. Tall neck. You can also pick a line on the floor that you're going to want to follow. Too often I'll see people kind of walk sideways. Laterally it's not easy to stand your center of gravity but that's the challenge to walk that straight line. The next carry is a front load carry which is incredible for not letting that shoulder internally rotate and teaching it to stay stable in external rotation. So I'm going to have Peter again pick up a pretty heavy kettlebell but one he can handle. He's a beast and he's going to keep a really nice, strong, straight wrist. You notice there's contact right on the side of the arm. I'm even going to have him rotate his arm a little bit in to form a little bit of a cradle and you can see his shoulder blade is in retraction here and it's not tilting forward. Same idea here. Take a walk. Stay long on that right side and this is a tough move. It's going to throw you off balance. You're breathing, you're keeping your chin tall and you're not letting that right side collapse. Not letting that right hip jut out to the side. Staying as tall as possible. The next carry we're going to do is probably my favorite for grip strength and transferring that grip strength energy into the scapula and shoulder joint. It's a bottoms-up kettlebell walk. So you'll notice that we're using a slightly lighter kettlebell because what Peter's actually going to do is tip the kettlebell up so it's upside down and hold it just from the handle working against all of that lateral rotation of the kettlebell. He chocked up because this isn't the best kettlebell for this. It has a vinyl coating which is a little bit slippery so I recommend doing a real metal one with some traction or you can use some chalk if you have it handy like Peter always does. Never leave home without chalk or dirt. So getting a good grip before he starts, keeping that shoulder blade retracted and back, keeping that head back, great challenge for your grip to rotate or cuff strength. Nice job here. When you do this with your watch hand, take your watch off because one foul up can cost you a watch. The last of our farmers' carry sequence is going to be done with an overhead press. But before we do that I just want to mention that any of these exercises can actually be done stationary. You still get a great benefit just from holding the posture but you definitely get a little bit of a short, better shoulder challenge when you're walking and moving with that unstable hip and trying to balance through those different planes of motion. Now you'll notice in this exercise Peter's going to use a slightly lighter kettlebell again when we had it side loaded or when we had it here close to our body I don't mind to wait being a little heavier but when it's above the head in a kind of provocative position especially for that AC joint I prefer it to be a little bit lighter. So another key here is as Peter's going to bring it over his head he's going to make sure to support and press with his opposite hand because I don't want a lot of work to be done with such a heavy weight pressing overhead but once it's locked in he can release that hand. You'll notice that as the force is compressing him downward he's actually fighting that by pushing his shoulder blade a little bit up. In the pull-up I had him pull his shoulder blade down because that the force was taking him up. So now he's slightly pressing up into that scapula, shin back, right into that shoulder socket, walking a nice straight line. Really easy for people to bring that shoulder forward and in fact if you can't touch the wall in that diagnostic exercise we did if you can't bring your hands up and touch a wall and that wall angel we did for the test you have no business doing this exercise. You have to make sure you can really open your shoulder all the way because if it's forward at all it's going to really stress that a cromule roof and make if you signs of impingement. So only the best shoulder movers should attempt this one. You know these days I don't really even do overhead pressing much anymore because the repetitive strain of the press seems to put much more pressure unnecessarily on my shoulder. So the just the end I were doing a shoulder workout we would spend much more time emphasizing actually strengthening the deltoids which can be done without overhead pressing and then using this in a static overhead way to generate this stability. Now we're going to bring everything together with a loaded twisting sequence. The beauty of this exercise is it's practical core to scapula, strength, and action. The other thing it is is that it's a shifting exercise. So too often we're working the shoulders in this front loaded lifting plane but now we're going to get an opportunity to shift with a weight and stabilize that shift. So I'm going to have Peter take the weight, put it just below his knee, keep it a nice tall back with his hips out. He's going to rotate his foot toward me and punch the kettlebell up at a 45 degree angle with arm straight and hold it for a beat. Then bring it back down. You'll notice Peter hinges with a tall spine. This is just like doing your classic hip hinge deadlift squats where you don't want to let this lower back flex. Turn and power from the hip and foot and punch the weight again. You'll notice Peter is an overroating here. You want to stay pretty much just outside your knees here any further and you might start to rotate from the lower back. All the rotation happens with the hip. I also like to say shine the beacon of light with your belly button. So your belly button should always be moving here. Imagine shining it all over the place. That's going to ensure you're not rotating from your back and it's coming from the hips.

This is an important diagnostic test that I learned probably about 10 years ago when I was rehabbing from an early shoulder injury. When I actually, one of the ones I alluded to in the intro. The purpose of this exercise is really to get a sense of how flexible your scapula are. So you start by sitting your butt as close as you can get it to the wall and you put your hands out about 90 degrees. Now the goal here is to do what Jesse's going to walk me through in a second but keeping the entire voiler surface of the arm meaning the back surface of the hand forearm and upper arm always on the wall. And what I'm going to try to do is get my arms as high as possible but without separating from the wall. So Jesse's going to walk me through this and you'll get a sense of what we're trying to do. So the less provocative or less challenging position will actually be a wider wall angel or a wider wall reach because it's mostly the peck that's stretching and you're not involving the the lat and serratus as much, right, or at least muscles under the armpit. So I'm going to have Peter just push out into a nice wide y. Now Peter has incredible great shoulder mobility. You may find that to keep that surface down you might have to be here and that's fine. The key is to not struggle to go through the range you can go through and breathe through this. It's not a forced exercise. The wall is being accepted by your arms versus you pushing them into it with all your might. The more you struggle the harder it is. So as you go, you'll be able to reach all the way up because you'll have enough length and that serratus and lat to fully touch the wall with arm straight. But again, this is a very advanced position. I would recommend reaching down a little bit of a y reaching down again and seeing if you can start your work your arms closer and closer. Great diagnostic to see if the whole shoulder girdle is working properly.

So let's move on to an exercise that Jesse and I like a lot to strengthen the rotator cuff. Now, as we alluded to at the outset, evolutionarily we made an enormous leap by trading stability for flexibility in the shoulder. And the price we've paid for that is that we don't have the stability here that we have say in our hip. And so the shoulder is really stabilized by not a true ball and socket, but rather by these four muscles that make up the rotator cuff. The muscles are Terry's minor, infraspinatus, superspinatus, and sub-scapularis. Now, anyone who's been through rehab for a shoulder injury is probably really familiar with the types of exercises that you can do. Typically done as a series of four. An exercise where you move against tension this way, move against tension this way, and move against tension this way. In my experience having done all of these for many periods of time, I actually prefer one simple exercise that I'm going to show you now. And the reason is any time I find we're using bands, the resistance is very non-linear. And so I can never really find a perfect sweet spot where I'm using a reasonable amount of weight through the entire range of motion. So this simple exercise which I'll show you in Jesse will walk us through. First of all, it's done with a very lightweight. I will typically start at maybe 10 to 12 pounds and really never go higher than about 17 and a half or 20 pounds. And I'm trying to get a maximum range of motion, and I'm obviously trying to recruit anything but this very strong set of muscles that you want to rely on. The beauty of this exercise for me is that Peter is pinning his elbow against his knee. You'll notice that a lot of the band work that people do around the rotator cuff. The elbow is flailing all about. This really creates a fixed axis point and allows us to focus on the infraspinatus, which is a rotator cuff that's locked long on most people because our shoulder is pulled forward. And infraspinatus is an external rotator of the shoulder. So giving this a little love and a little shortening goes a long way to shoulder health. So you'll see, he'll come up, keeping that elbow pressed against the knee, coming down to his full range of motion, focus in on really accessing that rotator cuff. You can see he's shaking. This is a great example of stability of the shoulder and the rotator cuff. Great exercise for maintaining shoulder health. Well, this is a reasonable position to do this exercise, and it's actually not my preferred position. Given the choice, I'd like to be sitting on a bench and have the knee that I'm using to support my elbow up on a dumbbell rack, that seems to at least for me, put me in the perfect position to get the maximal range of motion without anything that's taking my attention off what I'm doing.

This next move is a fantastic compliment to the broomstick exercise we just showed you. In this move you're going through similar ranges of motion in an overhead sequence, but you're getting traction from a resistance band and you're also getting to move your scapula in a rhythm along with your shoulder joint and we talked about the scapula being such an important structure that should slide along the ribs to support the shoulder and you're getting most of the rotations and movements in the scapula within this exercise. Now I like to do this as one continuous movement to save time, but just for the purpose of this video we'll break it up into some different motions so you can see the benefit of each different scapula or elevation or depression. So what we'll start with is Peter's going to take this band, put it over his head and he's going to create a little traction by pulling his hands into a y. Just a light bit of traction you don't want to be straining too much here. I'm going to have him elevate his shoulders so his shoulders go to his ears and then pull his shoulders down into scapula depression and then we have him open his palms and bring the band behind his neck. Really almost trying to rotate the palms downward to get that external rotation and then he'll come up again with that traction. Elevate, depress, turn the palms up, he's doing a great job keeping his neck neutral lining up over his body. And now on the next move I'll have Peter actually pin the cable into his upper back with his arm straight. Now just this is a fantastic stretch. The band is set just below his shoulder blades as you can see here. If it's too high it's going to actually hit his neck and I don't want a lot of people writing about they got snapped in the neck from this one. So he's going to make sure it stays right on those wings right here. He's going to bring his arms forward. Pro-tracked his shoulders forward with his palms down. Retract squeezing that scapula, almost trying to pinch a pencil here between his shoulder blades. Bring the arms back with the palms up behind him. Again opening the hands, staying in this plane. When you do this you're going to want to go down to this plane to get further but again you're just bringing the shoulder down and forward. You want to stay right in line with that upper back here and then he'll come forward. Pro-tracked again. Retract. We're teaching the scapula how to protect the shoulder here. Retract. Bring the palms back. Big peck stretch for all those people who love to do pushups and whale on the chest. Also stretching the AC joint here. So notice as we're going from the scapula retraction and forward position into the peck stretch we're rotating from palms down to palms up. And then here you go back to palm down. So many of the shoulder injuries we see because the scapula isn't doing its job protecting the capsule of the shoulder. This is the one exercise we're really focused on that scapula movement to protect the shoulder in the long term.

So two of my favorite exercises for grip strength. This is the first one where you take a hex down and you just do what's called farmers carry with it. So you grab these things, pull the chalk definitely helps to keep your grip on the runner. And then basically, if you walk around with these things, and what you're doing is increasing time, but you hold it in weight. So usually once I can get to 45 to 60 seconds of walking around, it's time to go up and wake. So you might even almost start with 15 pounds. This is about 22 and a half and I can hold this for over a minute. So you do about one or five pounds for 30 or 40 seconds and then just keep going. And I superset this basically in between most exercises. So I might get 10 sets of these carriers throughout the workout. Okay. Okay. One more bonus grip exercise I love is called a ghee pull up. So you put a towel here up over the pull up rack. And you can do this like either single or crossing the nose of the other area. And then you're going to pull up, but you're holding an towel. So popular due to exercise has the term ghee pull up. But you can see this is basically going to be a grip for taking exercise. Now, one thing that I'll just do, one of this to the other way, always really tug on the towel before you get up there. I kind of towel split on the floor and that doesn't pleasant. So there you have it, ghee pull up. Okay. The next one of that love and I also went to superset is to take a kettle valve in for carry. And then so I'm going to walk in with this thing in inverted carry. So again, really amazing grip exercise. You're also obviously getting a little bit of shoulder work here. Obviously a little bit of stability in a transfer sauce because you can't be able to stabilize an asymmetric movement. But for me, this is primarily another great grip exercise. And so, typically, do about a 30 to 40 second block. Come down, switch it up and go this way. I never do this side by side because when these things do, slip, you want to have a free hand to catch it. I've also sometimes do a heavier carry and not walk. So it's easier to just stand and static. So when I go to a heavier weight, I'll just do a static hold for 30 seconds. Alright, so that's the second one.

The father of modern medicine, Dr. Claude Bernard, he had said, in science more than in any other discipline, you have to recognize that we bring biases to any question. And you have to actively suspend those biases as you take in new information, so you have impeccable objectivity. And it's a lesson for everyone today. Unfortunately, I think we're going the other direction in science right now. We've got policing of misinformation. We've got this sort of culture of obedience in medical school that goes right down to your first day of medical school. So I'm optimistic on the future of healthcare because enough people now are sort of anti-central authority, anti-corporate, and there are questioning things they didn't before, but this culture of just get in line and do what you're told, is still a powerful force. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Hey, Marty. Thanks for coming in. Good to be with you, Peter. Great to see you again as always. So you've got a new book out, Blind Spots. And this is a book, I guess. I certainly remember talking about with you as it was kind of in the works. We've had many dinners together when some of these topics have come up. Do I take, can I take like 5% credit for the inclusion of HRT in this book? Now you get 99% credit for that. That was incredible. And I saw a late edition, right? To the book. That was that tipped me off to do my own sort of investigative journalism. So I tracked down the people that made that initial announcement, saying it caused breast cancer. And I pinned them down and I went over the stats with them hard. And finally got them to confess that it did not. So thanks for tipping me off there and helping me shape the book. So the book is a great read and it goes through a number of situations that all kind of have this theme in common, which is an idea comes up. The idea is a bit shaky in terms of lack of evidence, which in and of itself is not really a problem. That really is the way medicine and science have to work. They have to start with ideas that we may or may not have great evidence for. But what sort of goes wrong? Why is there a book about this instead of a bunch of case studies of how everything has gone really well? So there's a science to group think. And that's really what's going on a lot of times. It's the bandwagon effect. It's not just in medicine. It's in business. It's in politics. It's in relationships. People are dead set on an idea, not because they're convinced of it, but because they simply heard it first. And there was a psychologist named Leon Festinger, who since passed away, but had written a tremendous amount of material on this idea of cognitive dissidents. He really carved this entire discipline out inside of psychology. And the idea is that the brain doesn't like to be uncomfortable with conflicting ideas. It likes to settle and be lazy with one thought. And so it's often the first thing you hear. And so if something comes along that challenges, your deeply held views or just what you've happened to her before, there's this internal conflict. So what the body does is it will reframe the new information to make it fit what you already believe, or it'll dismiss it completely, kind of the modern-day cancel culture. And so this happens in day-to-day life. It happens in human interactions. And it happens in medicine too. We get this sort of herd mentality. But the important thing is science is that the purpose of science is to challenge deeply held assumptions. And so that's something that I follow as a threat in so many areas of modern-day health recommendations in this book. And it will come back to this because I think one of the take-home from this is not just the stories, but what a person can do going forward. But I would also have to say that, and maybe this is, frankly, just a hard thing to hear, both is the author of the book, but as a person listening, which is, how does it individual, like a normal person navigate this? Right? Like, I'll use myself as an example. Not because I think I'm normal. I think I have at my disposal access to more information. I have a research team that can help me answer questions. And yet, if I was to challenge every idea out there that I held sacred, I'm not sure I'd get anything done. So what's the balance in your mind between your doctor tells you something? Kind of makes sense, like on first, it seems logical, at least plausible. But technically, you haven't done the thinking on it. How do you not allow yourself to become a crazy, conspiracy theorist who doesn't trust anything and throws out what's 80% good in the pursuit of throwing out the 20% that's trash? How does one navigate that? Right. How do you shift through that? It's, there are extremes on both sides. And you see the pendulum swing, like with childbirth. You know, there's this over medicalization of ordinary life. And then this swing back to avoid all doctors and hospitals and deliver it home with nobody. And that's a dangerous proposition. And so you see that frequently in the history of modern medicine. And for the everyday consumer out there, I think the flag should go up when something is put out there as a health recommendation with such absolutism as science, evidence-based. When really there's nothing to point to. That should be a flag for everyday folks. We don't want to create hysteria. We need people to trust doctors. I need my patients to trust me a lot of times, but asking questions should be part of the process. And I think there are times when we are very slow as a medical community to implement scientific evidence. And it's okay to educate the public on it. There's a non-operative protocol for appendicitis. Yeah, it's one of the things I wanted to talk about with you. Okay, you wanted to mention briefly now, so. Sure. Yeah. You can talk about how you and I learned to treat appendicitis. And what is appendicitis for us for us for maybe to fix a sense of this? Yeah, so inflammation of the appendix and infection sets in that sort of tight junctions break down and bacteria from the colon will creep in there. And in fact, the appendix it becomes inflamed gets into the blood system and late stages. And to give sense that people are sensitive, I mean, what's the lifetime prevalence of this and prior to any treatment? So 200 years ago, what was the mortality from acute appendicitis? It was over 60% Walter Reed, a famous physician himself died of appendicitis, the hospital and D.C.s named after him. So it was a common cause of death. And the lifetime prevalence was not that small. It was like seven percent. I mean, not it was five, but you're probably in that range. And so. Think about that, right? There's a one in 18 to one in 20 chance. You'd get an infection of your appendix and a 60% chance that if you got it, it would kill you. Yeah, I mean, it was, it still is one of the most common operations performed in American hospitals. And we have learned as a reflex as surgeons. You were at Johns Hopkins. You did this many times. We may have been in the operating room. We did many together. And so as a reflex, you learned to take out the appendix. You do it swiftly. You do it with lapar scope as of the last 30 years or so. And. That pre-med students are, you know, know this. This is like we will take the interns through the case. This is a reflex. We don't even think about it in the hospital. So it's been one of these easy things like diagnosed treat, diagnosed treat. Diagnosis used to be tricky because it can present a lot of ways. Now the cascans just points out the bull's eye and you go to work. You call the team, mobilize high five each other after the case, talk to the family. It's a quick, great case for a surgeon and a surgical trainee. Well, then a study came out showing that you don't need to operate. And a short course of antibiotics is 67% effective in patients that don't that come in with a appendicitis. If the appendix is not ruptured or there's no little stone, we'll be called a fecalith in the appendix. Which is the vast majority of people don't have rupture or a fecalith. So here is a discovery that really shook up the whole field of modern surgery. So just make sure folks are following us. The study said, look, if you're in the majority of cases of appendicitis, it's not yet ruptured and it doesn't have an obvious mechanical cause. You can instead of taking a person to the operating room, which is low risk, but not zero risk. You're still subjecting a person to general anesthesia. That's right. Plus there's the cost associated with surgery. You're saying that you can get 60 to 70% the same outcome if you give them any antibiotic. And if they don't respond to any antibiotic, then you'll take a third of those people otherwise back to surgery. Yes, exactly. And of those that do not, of those who respond well to the antibiotics, it's something like high 80% will respond to the initial course of antibiotics. A small fraction, maybe 12% will come back with recurrence symptoms in the first month and say, hey, I got that pain back and then you go to surgery with them. So the total cure though is about two thirds. Two thirds. Okay. And you don't get behind the eight ball. It's not like, oh, they know, well, we washed it within a, we gave a short course of antibiotics, washed it. And now it's so far along, we can't do anything in the patient as far worse. They've done the long term follow up. So and it's not just, you know, you made a good point about the cost and the other thing. But the patient doesn't have to go undergo an incision, anesthesia, risk of infection, risk of hernia, all the minor risk that they're present. The carbon footprint of the hospital, the amount of waste produced, the nursing staffing resources. I mean, the weight list at a hospital every night in every hospital in America has cases that are waiting to go. And typically there's an appendix or two on that list. And sometimes these are operations that are going to be done in the middle of the night anyway. Yeah, we've got a nursing staffing crisis, you know. So there's so many implications to appropriately implementing this research. So I was talking to one of my colleagues because I I'd offer this to a kid who came in to see me. He had, it was, I was really in a dilemma, because I had redness study. It was convinced of it. And I thought this is at least something to offer patients. Nobody else was really offering it at the time. The study had been a couple months out. So I had it this guy come in about 19 years old. Perfect candidate. No rupture, no fecalith. Early appendicitis, young healthy guy. They're already getting antibiotics when they come in and get diagnosed in the emergency department anyway. So usually it's just running at a little bit longer. And I offer him the surgery versus no surgery. He tells me he has a wedding the next morning in Boston, which he has to fly to of his sister. And I'm thinking, oh my god, what gets him to the wedding faster? Just taking him to the operating room right now, which case he might get there in a wheelchair. I don't, you know, he should be able to leave the hospital in the morning and get a flight. He might lip around. He'll be in some discomfort. Or do I do the antibiotic protocol? So I just offered him both. And I told him what I don't know, which is I think the most important part of being a doctor is understanding the unknowns and dealing with uncertainty. And guess what he chose between surgery and no surgery. No surgery. No surgery. Yeah, of course. Yeah, do you want to go on to the knife or not? You know, it doesn't matter. Of course he chooses no surgery. So he goes to the wedding the next day, dances up a storm and I become so convinced that this may be revolutionary. And I tell one of my colleagues about it and he says, I don't buy it. I still live you've read that randomized controlled trial. It's published in like our top journal and he says, I need to see two randomized controlled trials. So I'm like, okay, you know, they've been doing this in Europe a lot longer than we've heard about it in the US. So a second randomized controlled trial comes out like a year later. I show it to him and he says, I need to see three randomized controlled trials. And then believe it or not, a third one came out. I think it was like six months later, long term follow up. The initial study was repeated in children's other studies came out that were non randomized. And I showed it to him and he says, I just think you're better with it out. And I'm thinking it would be unethical to do any more research. Like this is one of the big this is the cognitive dissidence that Leon Festinger was describing. Leon Festinger embedded himself into a cult to prove his theory correct. A cult that met in Chicago believed that aliens were going to pick them up because there was going to be a great flood. On a certain day, a certain time and he read about this in the paper that they were assembling to be picked up by this spaceship. And he realized this is the real world example of my theory of cognitive dissidence. Why we cling to what we hope believed first and we're not open-minded to be objective. So the thing he wants to test is when the aliens don't come to rescue the people that were the firm believers, how many will say, oh my god, how stupid was anything this, versus what will be the set of stories that get spun to explain why they're belief was still right? Sounds like you, you somehow knew that the aliens did not come and pick them up. I was able to make the leap of faith that the aliens indeed did not come. So they didn't come that night and he was there in the room with all the cult members. And somebody says at 1205 because the pickup was supposed to happen at noon and they had removed their belts and metals for the flight and everything. Somebody says, oh the other clock is wrong, it's really 1155 and everyone gets excited and there's this denial and denial through the night and then in the morning basically it, you know, it did was obvious it did not come true and they did not abandon their views, they dug in deeper. Those who had a little belief, they thought this is not and they just left but there was a physician that Festinger spent time with and he writes about it and is book called When Prophecy Fails where the doctor said, it just openly won. So almost in a Freudian way said, you know, I just have so much vested in this now at this point. My job, my family, my friends, everybody knows I'm so into this, I have to hold on and Festinger watched and plain view what we all experience in a subconscious way and that is this resistance to new ideas and you see it in politics and business and everything else and it was really amazing. It's a theory that's now well accepted as kind of dissonance and it's tied closely to effort reporting effort, justification, that's the concept and psychology and that is, hey, I'm Vest, I've spent all this energy on it, it must be good or just fired or and we do that with our surgical residency, fraternity, hazing, it fosters this cycle of abuse and in the examples by I think their name was Aaron and Mills where the two psychologists right after Festinger around that time and they took college students and they said, hey, we're going to have you do this task, we're going to pay you for the task, you take little pegs and you put him in. The most tedious point thing you can design and they paid them half of them 20 bucks and the other half $1 to do it for an hour which groups said they enjoyed doing the task more. The group, beginning to pay the dollar. The group beginning to pay the dollar because they had to justify and they did another experiment where they said, hey, we're going to have a sex talk and you have to take an entrance exam and there were three groups that took the entrance exam. One, they had an entrance exam that was incredibly difficult, they didn't give them the results, they just said, okay, you know, you passed. The other had a moderate exam and the other one had no exam. Then they had the talk and it was the most boring, disappointing, let down you could possibly. They basically said, yeah, bees get together and multiply and they're just kind of like, what, you know, this is what we tried hard to get in for this class and then they asked them, did you enjoy the class? It was designed to drive you nuts board and the guess which groups said they enjoyed it the most. The one with the hardest test. The one with the hardest test. And this plays out in our lives every day. Now that I've read these studies and have written about them, I think about this in our research meetings when new ideas get suggested when people ask me if we should do it a certain way. You know, we've got these traditions and dogmas and medicine that can take on a life of their own. So let's talk a little bit about peanut allergies. Probably everybody listening is no stranger to a peanut allergy. In fact, there's, I don't know what the prevalence is, perhaps you do, but it's quite prevalence. So there's again, the probability that someone listening to this doesn't either have a peanut allergy or know somebody with one is probably close to zero. So let's talk a little bit about this. Has it always been this way? And if not, when did this, when did this become an epidemic? Well, it really is an epidemic and it's tragic and people can go into severe antiflexus just being neuropenate without even ingesting the peanut. In 1999, Mount Sinai did a study and estimated the prevalence to be about half of one percent and the vast majority were very mild. And it's there many theories as to why that might have crept up from zero generations prior. But the American Academy of Pediatrics decided to address this problem by issuing the recommendation. Now, they didn't know what to recommend. They honestly literally had no idea what to recommend. I went back and interviewed some of the individuals who made that recommendation. It was a strong recommendation. Even if it wasn't made with such absolutism, it was interpreted as the law of the land. And the recommendation was for all children, zero through three to avoid all peanut products, including the little peanut butter moms would put into food and infancy. And pregnant mothers and lactate mothers should also avoid 100 percent peanut abstinence. And what happened immediately after that recommendation in the year 2000 is peanut allergy rates in the United States began to sore. And we saw a new type of allergy which is the severe antifelactic reaction, the ultra allergy where if someone used the same ice cream scooper as in the pistachio, even though they had rinsed it, that kid could end up in the emergency room. When we saw emergency room visits, skyrocket. So the medical establishment deletes, I'll say, not the rank and file doctors that think independently. And the rank and file doctors knew they just made this up. And some were had immunology backgrounds and knew this doesn't fit with immunology. And immunology, you need to be exposed to things early in life to be immune tolerance, something called oral and immune tolerance. Parents had known it as the dirt theory, sometimes you around cats and dogs. Yeah, develop a robust immune system that helps your life. Bubble kids end up getting really, really sick later on. There's a pediatrician named Gideon Lack who's an allergist who was one of these enlightened guys early on. And he said he noticed kids that had, I think it was like iron or metal in their teeth for dental work were less likely to get a reaction to ear piercing later in life. And so he had done research in immune tolerance and knew this concept if you're exposed to something you're less likely. Well a bunch of pediatricians to test this recommendation tried to speak up. They were basically silenced or sideline. And this recommendation took on a life of his own. Parents were told for their kids, remember one, two, three at age one, you can introduce milk at age two, eggs and age three. Finally, you can introduce some peanut products. So it became known as the one, two, three. It took on a life of its own. It became dogma. As the peanut algae rates soared, the medical establishment said, what's going on here? We're telling people what to do. They're not listening. We need to double down. We need to get people to comply. We have non-compliant parents out there. If we can only get everyone to comply with this, we can defeat this epidemic. If you can dear little echoes here of modern-day correlations. So this doubling down took place. And the more they double down, the worse it got to the point where now there's an estimate of the one-eight, one-and-eight teen kids has a peanut algae. But the severe peanut algae is at the real issue now. It's banned in a lot of schools, about 20% of schools in America. I've banned all peanut products altogether. And the more you ban the less exposure, the more immune sensitization, because now you have to think about the one-and-eight teen kid with an allergy. So it became a self-licking ice cream cone. It was like, you know, more abstinence, more abstinence what are you doing. And the parents who were like, no, I'm going to introduce peanut butter as my grandmother did. And for generations, when there were no peanut allergies, they were seen as anti-science. They were ridiculed. Schools would address these parents sometimes. I have two medical students, or well graduate students doing research in my research center at Johns Hopkins from Africa, once from Cameroon and once from Zimbabwe. And they came to fly over to the research meeting in their first days. And they were like, what is it with the peanut allergies here? Like, they're announcing it on the plane to be WI. They're these all these products are like contains no trainites. And they're like, what have they've never seen this before in my life? And like, some student invited one of them to dinner at his house, because he was a new student from Africa. And he goes, oh, would you like to come over for dinner sometime? And he goes, yeah, sure, do you have any peanut or other allergies? And he's like, Marty, what the hell is with this peanut obsession here? We have no peanut allergies in Africa. And I was like, wow, faith. Have you ever heard of a peanut? These are public health graduate students. No, we have no peanut allergies in Zimbabwe. Then I would call relatives that I have back in Egypt, same thing. I've never heard of a peanut allergies except for there was an X-pat living here in Cairo, hit a peanut allergy. And you realize this is a unique American epidemic that was created. But there must have been some index cases that caused the hysteria. Yeah. So that incidence from outside, I suggest half one percent. It might have been microbiome related, we think. But the peanut abstinence just through lighter fluid into this fire. And it really resulted in where we are today. So where is the American Academy of Pediatrics today on their recommendations? So here's the thing, the study got done eventually 15 years into the recommendation. That doctor Gideon Lack, I mentioned in London, published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine with 640 kids doing a randomized control trial to early peanut butter exposure in infancy for five, six months. Not as they're sold diet. He's go pro-bent breastfeeding, right? And whole peanuts have a choking risk. So I mean the smart way. Yeah. And then some peanut abstinence in peanut introduction in infancy. Fast forward a couple of years, radically eightfold different rates in peanut allergies and spher allergies. Published in the New England Journal of 15 years. Why didn't the American Academy of Pediatrics? And so what year was that study published? 2015. Okay. Then of course, full difference. So we're talking about that's almost like a significant as smoking, giving lung cancer versus not. Like smoking versus not smoking and lung cancer was about a tenfold difference. Yeah. One of the biggest odds ratios you see in research. Yeah. And then of course, the, you know, the beer crats at Nye Add and NIH from the National Institute of Allergy and infecses. They fought two years later. They get around and putting a position paper and all this stuff. So, 17 years. But do we also understand how much, how much is that position paper reverse the behavior in parents? Because when it comes to kids that are born today, do we know that the amount of peanut abstinence going on is virtually gone now? I think it's unknown. But it's a great point you raise. Why not reverse the recommendation now that the science is clear with the same vigor at which you put it out initially? Why not show some humility? Why not what if the leaders got out there and called CBS mornings and other morning shows and said, hey, we got something terribly wrong. We really need to correct the record on this. You didn't see that. Yeah, that's to me on my soapbox. That's really the beef I have with DHRT. Stuff is the absolute, I mean, mega foam of, you know, fear that was promulgated through estrogen hysteria in 2001. And even though if you read the fine print today, many of those people have walked back those recommendations of estrogen avoidance. But again, it's not only is it too little too late, you've got a generation of women, literally a generation of women over 20 million women who have been deprived of HRT. But even women that are available eligible to take HRT today, they're still confused because the same megaphone that was used to say estrogen will give you breast cancer is not being used to correct course. So there's an enormous asymmetry in these information campaigns. And one little piece I know you've done a great job covering HRT. But one of the guys in that committee. So in the investigative journalism, I did around the HRT dogma. Before the announcement, there was a committee meeting where they were hoodwaint. And the 40 investigators were basically told, hey, throw out the agenda. We've got some breaking news on this study causes breast cancer. We have already submitted the journal. It's coming out. And a bunch of guys there are like, what the, this is not how we do research, right? One of them Bob Langer, who I interviewed, had said in a shouting match with the lead investigator. He said, look, if you put something out there as sensitive as breast cancers caused by HRT, if you, you will never be able to put that genie back in the bottle. And that's exactly what happened. And sure enough that guy had confessed to me that it did not cause the renewing increase in breast cancer deaths, you know, maybe with a gun to his head when we were in it, you know, I was doing the interview with him. Yeah, not a single increase in breast cancer deaths. I believe in that was at the time of publication. That was again demonstrated nine years later. And again, demonstrated 20 years later on the follow-up of the same cohort. I can't tell you, Marty, how many times I get asked this question. It is, it is probably the single most prevalent topic of discussion I have in a public setting, like get a dinner or, you know, something like that. So it's amazing how much incorrect information still exists out there. It's amazing. There's probably no modern day medical intervention that has improved the health of a population as much as HRT for postment of positive. But it's not just HRT. The medical establishment got opioids wrong for 35 years. They got heart stance wrong for 15 years. They got the low fat diet wrong for how many 60 plus years. They got peanut allergies wrong for 17 years. Where's the apology? Where's the humility? Where's the, you know, that's why there's distrust right now. Yeah. And again, this is, this is where I really, really struggle. Because I have friends who are otherwise smart people who have such ridiculous views in terms of like where the pendulum is one the other way. And like they're convinced like you shouldn't microwave your food because microwaves are harmful. And I don't say this to be kind of arrogant. But there's also such a degree of scientific illiteracy that even when I try to explain to one of these friends, what a microwave is. And why a microwave can't be harmful. Like why it, you know, you have to understand what ionizing radiation is. You have to understand what a light, like if if microwaves are harmful, then light is more harmful based on the wavelength. But that's a hard thing to explain to people who don't understand science. You can't see wavelengths, right? So it's, it's, it's, it's difficult. So I think that's what bothers me is we've created kind of a bi-modal distribution, right? Of complete rejection of science and everything that medicine says is wrong. And you should never go to a doctor and anything your doctor says is wrong to complete an utter blind faith. And again, it comes back to my question, which I don't have a great answer to, which is how does a reasonable person maintain skepticism, but you know, not be paralyzed by it and not be pushed so far to either extreme. And I still, I still come away thinking I don't know the answer to this. Yeah, I don't have a satisfying answer either. And I feel for the everyday person out there, friend of mine who will come up to me and says, well, I asked about hormone therapy, but my doctor, whom I love, said, no, it does this. You know, you don't want to create so much skepticism where people are denying a chest tube when they have an suction pneumothorax. Right. So it's like, what is that, Bel, I don't have a satisfying answer, but it is exactly what Leon Festinger was describing. And the father of modern medicine, Dr. Claude Bernard, he had said, in science more than in any other discipline, you have to recognize that we bring biases to any question. And you have to actively suspend those biases as you take in new information, so you have impeccable objectivity. And it's a lesson for everyone today. Unfortunately, I think we're going the other direction in science right now. We've got policing of, you know, misinformation. We've got this sort of culture of obedience and medical school that goes right down to, you know, right down to your first day of medical school. So, you know, I'm optimistic on the future of healthcare because enough people now are sort of anti-central authority, anti-corporate, and they're questioning things they didn't before, but this culture of just get in line and do it your told is still a powerful force. Yeah, I mean, I'd love to spend some time when we get through a few more of these interesting examples talking about how to, how to at least change medical education. And to me, one of the most important changes I would make if I were medical education saw would be a very dedicated track of statistics and probability theory. And I think this is important for all of science, right? I mean, you, I know you would agree with me, I think, but you know, there are no proofs in science. You know, I've said this many times before, so nothing is 100% certain. So, so science is not a thing, right? It's a process. And what is highly probable today is probably a better way of describing something that we think is true. So, you know, and new information should always be obtaining probability. So, if you think about that framework, right? If people are trained in in in the mathematics of uncertainty, which is what's the statistics and probability theory are, and I feel very fortunate because I was a math major before I went to medicine. So, that kind of came a little more naturally to me to think that way. You could look at, you know, you could look at some index cases of peanut allergies in the 90s, and you could say, well, my hypothesis is this is due to being exposed to peanuts as a child. Now, that turns out to be wrong, but that would be your hypothesis, but you wouldn't cling to that hypothesis with absolute certainty because you would understand that it's a probability distribution, and you might assign it a probability of 50%. And you would say, well, if this is true, how would I test it? I would test it, and then based on information as it's coming in, I'm updating that probabilities. Now, more than 50% or less than 50%. And I know that sounds very mechanical, but I can't really think of another way. I mean, and I know we're going to try not to talk about COVID today because the world's COVID fatigue is rampant, but COVID offered so many lessons in this, right? Which is, hey, did this virus come from a lab or did it come from a wet market? I don't know. I'd say 90% it came from a wet market because we have a precedent of viruses coming out of wet markets. Okay. Well, it's three months later, we have some more information. We found out about this research being done there. Should we update the probability? Okay, maybe it's 80-20 now. Great. That's an update in probability. Six months later, hey, we still haven't found the vector. Okay, maybe it's 50-50 now. But if we thought about it that way, I think it's easier to change your position. Yes. Because you're not wed to a binary outcome, yes or no. You're thinking about it as a probability distribution function, that's right. Which is constantly getting upgraded and updated and improved and it's theoretically converging on what is true as we go. And that's true of everything, right? I mean, like I've lost track of all the other things. Fortunately, I've purged most of them for my brain, but like I've remectin, you know, all of these things. I mean, all of these are reasonable things to have assumed that what became unreasonable was to not go through this process. Both sides, the sides that clung to them and the sides that morally oppose them. So anyway, we should we should probably revisit that. Let's shift gears a little bit and talk about antibiotic use. So this is something that probably doesn't get that much attention. I know Marty, when I was in the hospital, we did talk a lot about this. In particular, we talked a lot about it in the ICU, which was the idea of antibiotic resistance being a real problem. But as a person who lives outside a hospital now, I don't hear much about it. So that makes me think one of a couple scenarios. scenario one is it was greatly exaggerated in the early 2000s when I was a resident because it hasn't materialized resistance resistance. Resistance. It was real and it's still real, but more and more drugs are being developed to keep the bacteria a day. So you know, you might walk through several other machinations, but give us a sense of what this means, what the implications are and what can be done about it. So about a hundred thousand people in the US die a year roughly from resistant bacteria that resistant to the antibiotics we've had. The time period it took for bacteria to develop resistance through their natural evolution was about 23 years when antibiotics were first mass produced in the 1950s and 60s. Then it shrunk down to 14 years and now it's about one year within a year and bacteria will mutate around an antibiotic and it'll be a blank, say, methysl and resistant staff lacoccus. We're now seeing C-Diff, one of those common bacteria, take the life of somebody, you know, every other month or so in the hospital and most hospitals, it's you tend to pick it up in the hospital. Sadly, you look back and you say, oh yeah, they took an anseph for this tiny little thing they didn't need to take the anseph antibiotic for. The about 60% of our patient antibiotics are unnecessary according to several studies and in patient antibiotics, I'm not sure it's much better. I personally have given thousands of unnecessary antibiotics because I've been forced to, well, I say I give them. It's the operations that I do. There's this protocol that you give every single operative patient antibiotic before the incision. Yep, Marty, I don't think I ever cut a person's skin in my life without an antibiotic being unbored except for a certain trauma case where you're literally putting a knife on them the second they walk in the door because they're going to die. But yes, we would, I don't know, we used to give anseph. I don't know if that's the case, right? That's yeah, I don't know why yeah. Okay, so and then again, the reason was, um, there are bacteria on the skin and even though we scrub the skin, you can't get every bacteria out. So we're going to give you an antibiotic that has to be in your system. It's going to be given to you intravenously. And then usually the anesthesiologist will does it in pre-oper before you cut skin so that by the time that incision goes through whatever bacteria are on the edge of that skin aren't going to potentially again. And so again, makes a lot of sense. I never questioned it. Where there, and there must have been studies that demonstrated lower incidents of wound infections, right? I can't imagine something that prevalent was was implemented without an RCT. Was it? The worst studies and the RCTs in major abdominal operations that were done open, your most surgeries done minimally invasive now and people have inappropriately extrapolated those findings to minimally invasive surgery. I mean, have you ever heard of an infection after a laparoscopic in Gurohernia? Maybe like a case report. I've never seen it but isn't that because we're giving them antibiotics potentially? I don't think so, but if because you would see at least some, I don't think it would be 100% effective. You don't see that with abdominal surgery. I mean, it reduces the incidence of infections a little bit. I just don't think there's any mechanism in some of these procedures. I don't think it works only at guest this. Well, for whatever reason, with no data, the research from open abdominal GIC has got extrapolated broadly. And I remember asking, I was actually in practice a little bit before the broad recommendation. I remember asking this guy patched DeLinger who was involved in these recommendations is called like the antibiotics society of America. You know, one of these, there's no these niche meetings. We have the pancreas club, you know, it's like all these meetings. It's more fun than the spleen society, by the way, they're they're boring. And so I remember asking why is it that antibiotic recommendation at the time of incision? For every operation, I've never seen or heard of an infection for these minor procedures. And he said, well, you know, we thought a lot about that on our committee and we decided making it easy to remember to do it for every operation would ensure that the big operations get it. And I thought, well, we may have a blind spot in American medicine. Now it's very obvious to me, based on some research I've been seeing out there that not only could we be breeding resistance, but what are these antibiotics doing to the gut microbiome? And it turns out that a new theory, which has emerged out of the University of Chicago, is suggesting that surgical infections don't come from the skin bacteria crawling in. It comes from the gut. Some sort of weakness in the gut and there may be a transposition of some bacteria. And they've actually done studies now in mice where they alter their gut microbiome prior to surgery. And they have found that there's some reduction in infection. So there may be sort of probiotics preoperatively that may reduce the risk. This is a big area of ongoing research. There's nothing definitive. We've learned the people should chug a gatorade three to four hours before surgery is mostly for the glucose, but what's it doing to the gut? Are the patient coming in into starvation state and is that doing something to the microbiome? We've had all this dog by in the operating room. You got to wear your hats, like you have a cover your shoes, some places, don't cover your shoes. And then you go overseas as you may have as well. You go to Africa and you realize they're not wearing anything. Not even wearing masks when they're doing surgery. And their infection rate is no different. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And this is surprising to me. Yeah. And you think, well, what is the mask doing? Is it preventing sweat from dripping in? Is it preventing the airborne particles? Because the airborne particles just come out of the side of your mask. Right? So there's still, so there's this University of Chicago research is challenging a lot of deeply held assumptions in an operating room protocol. But one of the things I feel bad about, and I don't do it anymore now is going in for a minor laparoscopic procedure. And a physiologist says, you want me to give Antsaf and I say, no, you can hold off. The average 10 year old in America has taken 11 courses of antibiotics. And the average three year old has taken two and a half courses of antibiotics. We think that zero to three age group is the most, the microbiome is the most sensitive to antibiotics. But antibiotics are like carpet bombing your microbiome, you know, these millions of bacteria that live in a harmony. And this study, I don't know if it's, if I can mention this, but this Mayo Clinic study is our study before I was dying to tell you about this study. Incredible study out of the Mayo Clinic that came out. I think maybe the most significant study of the modern era in that it's shattering our deeply held assumptions about chronic diseases. In the Mayo Clinic researchers took the 14,000 children that live in Olmsted County in the area of Rochester, Minnesota. And they looked at kids who took an antibiotic course in the first two years of life and tracked whether or not they developed asthma, learning disabilities, overweight, obesity, later in childhood. And what they found were these incredible correlations were about 10,000 kids who had taken an antibiotic course and 4,000 who had not and they matched them to the best of their ability statistically. A 20% increase no obesity among kids who had taken an antibiotic in the first two years of life. 21% increase in learning disabilities. These were all this statistically significant findings. 32% increase in attention deficit disorder. In 90% increase in asthma and a 289% increase in celiac. Other studies have shown a correlation between antibiotics early in childhood and ulcerative cladis and Crohn's disease makes sense for changing the microbiome. We may be carpet bombing the microbiome with the dogma that there are no downsides to antibiotic. She got some sniffles. Probably want to help you. But it won't hurt you. Not true. How do we know in this study Marty that the 4,000 kids who were in the control arm that didn't get antibiotics weren't healthier kids, which is why they never needed the antibiotic. And that it wasn't some other factor about the 10,000 who did get the antibiotics either. They were just naturally less healthy kids. There was something about them that was less robust. There were other factors that couldn't be corrected for that actually explains those differences. I love it. That's how a scientific mind should think because there could be confounding variables. For example, maybe it's the infection that they were treating that is the blood to the surgery. So those are all good questions. Now my first while we cannot make conclusions from this study. But this study is an incredible signal that I think we should pay attention to for two reasons. Number one, it's been repeated in a Danish study of about a million children. Number two, there was a dose-dependent relationship. The more courses of antibiotics the child took, the more significant the more significant the higher the odds ratio. So again, worth maybe pausing and explaining to folks how you can increase the probability of a finding being real in an epidemiologic study. So again, it always comes back to this, what's the probability what you just said is causal. Cuzzality is the single most important force in science. Yes. I'm convinced of that. If you don't have causality, you have nothing. It's what makes the universe what it is in my view. So you stayed in a correlation. It's only interesting to us if there's causality. And now the question is how probable is the causality. And various factors defined by a statistician named Austin Bradford Hill speak to the strength of the association and the probability or likelihood that that association is causal. And you've outlined a couple, right? So one of them is what's the strength of the association period. So if I knew nothing else, the asthma, the 289% celiac celiac. So the fact that that had such a strong hazard ratio that's a hazard ratio of 2.9 versus the others that are like 1.2. You would say, well, just on the basis of strength of association, that one's more likely to be causal. You then stated another factor, which was reproducibility. There's another study that's done the same analysis and it's coming up with the same answers. So that makes it a little more likely to be causal. And then talked about the dose effect. Even within the association, like for example, all of this was sort of figured out during the kind of smoking, cholera epidemics when people were trying to understand causality. And then you would say, well, if smoking is causally related to lung cancer, then theoretically, my correlations should get stronger and stronger. The more cigarettes you smoke. If that's not the case, it becomes very hard to make the case that smoking is causing lung cancer. So you're saying that there was a dose effect. The more antibiotics you took, the more strongly you were having these associations. Yeah, and this is the first formal study I've seen like this on an epidemiologic basis that fits AI hypothesis that to me makes sense. The Sephlosporans had a higher correlation. They're generally considered to be a little more damaging to the microbiome than the Antseths and Petacellins. Is that because they target gram negatives more or anaerobic more or what's the, I'm so far out of my life on anybody. I don't even remember why that would be the case. I don't know, but this is these are, there are other observational data. For example, farmers have used antibiotics to fatten animals for food production for decades. And the world expert on the microbiome, Marty Blazer, who was the chief of medicine at NYU, his daughter developed chronic abdominal diseases. And obesity, they feel terrible because they gave her a bunch of antibiotics in childhood. And they thought there was an association. He started, he's a laboratory scientist. He started doing all these mice experiments. If antibiotics are making animals, more obese, what are they doing to humans? By the way, is another one of the Bradford Hill criteria. Do you have experimental evidence that also supports this, which of course, in the case of human epidemiology, you would look at that at animals? So, of course, someone listening to this might say, well, okay, Marty, but there's got to be some bad luck involved here. I mean, you had, let's go back to the Rochester Minnesota study. You got 4,000 kids who never took an antibiotic. 10,000 kids who did at least a course or two. Well, I mean, those 10,000 kids weren't just given antibiotics for no reason. They must have had ear infections. They must have had tons of light as they must have had appendicitis. They must have had something. Well, what were we supposed to do? Yeah. How do we make that? How do we draw the line between what was medically necessary? Because as unfortunate as those consequences are, they pale in comparison to a life-threatening infection that could have killed a kid. So, how do we decide what the minimum effective dose is? What's absolutely medically necessary versus what is superfluous and potentially just exposing a kid to this complicate. These complications later in life antibiotic save lives. You've seen it and I've seen it right in front of our eyes. They're amazing medications. They ushered in the white coat era of modern medicine. And as I wrote in my book, Marty, it's what took us from medicine. 1.0 to medicine. 2.0. Yes. We died like dogs. Yes. But 250,000 years of human existence. We died like dogs. Yes. And you got an infection. What life expectancy was 38. Mothers and child. Again, it's not the only thing that made the difference. But it was arguably the single most important difference with sanitation and antimicrobial therapy in the transition from medicine 1.0 to 2.0. That's right. So, we don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water of the baby. This is the nuance, which if people want to sort of a simple dumb message and all or nothing, which is where our echo chambers of media and politics take us in life. And social media, right? You want this all or nothing, absolutism. Antibiotic save lives, but they are also massively abused and overdosed at least 60% in all the studies. And we've seen it. We've seen it. Meaning 40% of antibiotic use is justified. Yeah. And I even questioned that number because they would say that I should be giving antibiotics before my minor procedures. But there's also epidemiologic data over time that look at all these chronic diseases. Now, I know they're multifactorial, especially obesity. But look at all the increases we've seen in these exact diseases that they've seen increase in the antibiotic group. After the broad administration of antibiotics in the 1940s and 50s, in the 60s, you know, it just went up even further, the discoverer of antibiotics. Ali Xander Fleming in 1922, he had warned after he got the Nobel Prize about the massive overuse of antibiotics. He had written in his diary that I found in my research that these mass factories producing penicillin at Bloom away. This was a mold that Bloom into his lab when he left the window open. We don't know if his hammer is lab tech. He says he's unknown. But somebody left the window open in his lab where he was growing staff in an auger gel. And some of that mold landed and formed a circle around the mold where all the bacteria were killed. And he had discovered what's considered to be the greatest discovery of moderate medicine. And so you're right, it took us from being surgeon barbers where we had a Lancet and an axe to do amputations and maybe Dejoxin, which didn't help many people. And that was it. And doctors weren't disrespected, but they were respected like a priest or a barber. And then with the mass production of antibiotics, now we had the power and controlled a substance where only we could give you a magic pill. Doctors began to wear white coats. They had an unquestioned authority. We kept people in the hospital. A little of the support and you're not wearing a white coat today, Marty. I'm not a white coat kind of guy. But, you know, we held babies in the hospital for 10 days routinely. Normal healthy babies. And immediately I was in the hospital for 14 days when I was born. Normal. Yeah. At term. Yeah. I was 14 days. It's crazy. I remember by you could be out of the hospital with an aortic root replacement in half that time. I remember my little sister was born around 1980s. And mom came home from the hospital after delivering her. My brother and I were like, okay, we have a sister. And every day we'd ask, Dad, when is my little sister coming home from the hospital? Well, a doctor has had the release to her yet. She's totally normal, right? She's sitting in there for days and days. You go in there with some big glass window. You know, and they'd be like, there she is. Third row from the back. Six one over. You know, he's his little head of hair. We're apt and some. And you're like, you're looking back on it. This is the medical paternalism. This is that white coat era. This never happened before in history. People stayed in the hospital for two weeks after a cataract. They'd measure their toe diameter. They'd, you know, probe and poke and put babies of the NICU and feed them formula and, you know, the mother would be like, can I see a hold the baby? No, we have to take the baby. Even when I was in as a student, you know, I was in the OB rotations. My first rotation. I'm nervous. I mean, I was shaking thinking about it. They give me the scissors. You know, like, oh, right, section. You know, he's morning. You go in there and all sorts of K. K. I was going, okay, as soon as you see the embellish accord, you got it. And I'm holding this scissors. I want to learn about the process of childbirth, but I've blocked out everything. I've because I have one job, right? And I'm holding these scissors and then this K. Awesome. And then all of a sudden this baby and I can barely see this slippery cord and they're putting clamps on it. Cut it. You know, and I'm like swooping in to cut it and then they take the baby off to the back table. What are we doing? Oh, we have to re-warm the baby. Okay, so they put the baby under this table with the French fraud light and I'm thinking, baby, French. Oh. And baby, the irony baby was getting a warm blood transfusion from the mother with a pulsating embellic accord which was actively pulsating when you clamped it and told me to cut it. But I don't understand anything, I want to be, and I want to get, I want to get a good grade. And I'm like, Okay, well, um, you know, the mom wants to hold the baby with that B warm enough, you know, no, we have to warm the baby. Turns out the data now on skin to skin time hours of skin to skin. That's the best incubator. There's all kinds of incredible data now on how the baby has more normal blood pressure and heart rate and more normal glucose levels when the baby is held by the mother. And the heart rate and blood pressures, I thought I heard that in the studies and I was like, that makes sense, but I don't get the glucose. Why are the glucose, there's stress one cortisol, right? Of course, yeah, you figured it out quicker than I did. And um, um, I'm kind of like, what are we doing? You know, they're sticking a metal temperature probe in the baby's rectum. And I'm like, what, this is, can't, this is a nice way to welcome a human into the world. You know, like, what are we doing? Like the baby's temperature is what the mom's temperature was because the baby just came from mom two seconds ago. Like, what are we doing? And um, they were just like, oh, we have to put it on the sheet and all this probing and poking. And um, then they have to want they wash the baby. It's like you don't now they know they're not to wash the baby for the first 24 hours. So there's kind of a protonized protonaceous coat. And again, sea sections are they've safe lives. But sea sections like antibiotics are also massively overused and it turns out as the head of the microbiome unit at the NIH explained to me when I did the research for this book. She said in a vaginal delivery, the baby's got in utero is sterile. And so it's seeded. The microbiome is seeded from the bacteria and the vaginal canal. And then augmented by bacteria from the clasper from the early breast milk and the skin and the kisses of the grandparents. But when you're born by a sea section, the baby is extracted from a sterile operative field. And what may me see the baby's microbiome are the bacteria that normally live in the hospital. And when she explained it to me that way, I thought my God, you know, it makes sense. So what is the prevalence of sea section today? And how close are we to peak sea section versus what was it 50 years ago? So we're at a, we're about 30% in the United States, private hospitals in Brazil are at 90%. Over season, sometimes even worse. The individual doctor's sea section rate ranges from 12% to we've seen 100%. So we have a big project at Johns Hopkins and through our consortium on the appropriateness of care where we look at practice patterns of physicians. And we basically can profile a physician on their pattern of doing something where there's, there's no need to be a lot of inappropriate overuse. But again, just help me anchor this to some context. 50 years ago, presumably they were not doing elective sea sections. The sea section was done because it was medically necessary. Is that a safe assumption? Yeah, there's definitely more unnecessary sea sections. So what was the prevalence of sea sections? Pick your favorite decade when elective sea section was not done. Was it, is it like a five? Should it be five percent? Should be 10 percent if we're only doing it for medically necessary sea sections? The obese that I've grown to really respect, really trust ethically on, they talk passionately about the overuse of sea sections and they have impeccable judgment. They have sea section rates in the 12 to 15% range. Okay. So we think that that probably is at least in the zip code of what is necessary. And by the way, that let's go back to what we were talking about in the world of medicine, one point, oh, when we live to, you know, we barely got to our 40th birthday's. And infant and maternal mortality were sky high. Every one of those kids that would be getting a necessary sea section, they'd be dying and probably the moms are dying. So this is a huge advance. The fact that we could do this operation. And again, I know that you're not, I know you don't think this way, but I just want to make sure people listening to us don't take away from this sea sections are bad. Sea sections say flies. Yes. I mean, like I would argue sea sections, and he'd bite my hands. I saved more lives than anything that we're doing in medicine today. Correct. Yes. Right. That has doubled human lifespan. That's right. Be able because because when something goes wrong in pregnancy, air in delivery, it doesn't go wrong in hours. It goes wrong in seconds. Right. A fetus doesn't have an enormous physiologic reserve. So when their heart rate starts crashing, like you've got to get that baby out immediately. So what you're basically saying or what I think we want to discuss is, why did we go from a world in which once we had modern medicine at the early part of the 20th century, and we were able to get these 12 to 15% of children born safely via a sea section, how did that go to 50, 60, 70% depending on your series? What was that transition? Why did that happen? I'm told it's a combination of a consumerist culture. If you think about it, if we're being really honest here, I've talked to a lot of doctors in my life. I think you have too. Being an OB doctor, specializing in labor in delivery is one of the breedar. It is so hard. It brutal lifestyle. Yeah. And so you have somebody who's been pushing in labor. It's now 10 o'clock at night. They're telling you just cut this thing out of me. It may not be netically necessary, but in the sort of fog of the moment, I will tell you that there are OB practices that the ethical OB doctors I've interviewed and talked to tell me about this and it drives him crazy. There are OB practices where you check out from your first prenatal visit and the receptionist when they schedule the next one. It's also scheduled when you're sees actual. Would you like to schedule a pick a date for your C section? No, no informed consent. And people that runs in certain circles, I'd be nice to have it on Graham Mother's birthday and one of us scheduled it. Christmas Eve birthday and we try to schedule the birthday. There are so many factors in Brazil. There's a dogma that it changes. Faginal delivery changes one sexual pleasure. It's unsubstantiated, but it looms large as a dogma and popular society in Brazil. So there are many reasons. And I'm not in this field, but from talking to folks in it, there's a massive, I mean, my cousin I went with heroin. She delivered. She was by herself. And I've of course, I'm highly attuned to this issue. And the OB docs come in and they're looking at something on the rhythm strip and they basically tell her, well, I think that C section might be safer for the baby. Well, even though she didn't want to see section, she of course is reasonable and open-minded. You tell that to any woman in the world, there are a hundred percent going to see what it's doing. And so I think there's a little bit of what we call the Nudge. You know, hey, what about this nonoperative protocol for Penn to cite us? Well, it's a little experimental could be a little dangerous. Oh, well, heck, don't do it. You have bone on bone in your joint. Nothing is going to help except a knee replacement. I'll shed bone on bone. Just go ahead. Right. So we have these nudges in medicine and the kind of well known in every field. Look, I'm probably guilty of them myself. I would bet that if if I were if I were listening to me, if I were outside of me and listening to me, talk to patients, I'm sure there are many times when subconsciously I'm doing the same thing. I'm nudging them towards what I think is the right answer. Even if in cases when maybe my confidence should only be 70 percent instead of 99 percent. Do we have any evidence, Marty, that that trend is reversing, that it's coming back to more of a natural childbirth process in terms of everything from both a vaginal delivery standpoint, but also in terms of how the baby is handled post-operatively. I mean, I know that for all my three kids, they had the instantaneous cord cut. Yes. We were trying to set a world record with how quickly that cord could be cut. We really really smoke that thing. What is the trend on that now? So on that real quick, they've done studies looking at 45 seconds versus 90 seconds of delayed cord clamping and there was a clinical statistically significant benefit to 90 seconds. You're getting stem cells, you're getting benefit in what regard, what was the outcome? I don't remember. This is a Redb's randomized control trial of two timings and I'm told by the obese our respect. You want to cut it after it's done pulsating. Could go two minutes? Now, you were talking about the pendulum swinging to the extreme and people taking hard-line inappropriate positions. One patient told her once, don't you dare cut that before five minutes. And she's like, oh, it's not going to pulsate after two minutes. So we don't want to create extremists here, but the C-section rate has stabilized and I think it's because of awareness out there. I don't think people understand the impact of the microbiome. I don't think people, you know, study just came out in JAMA surgery that children born by C-section had higher rates of colon cancer before age 50. How much higher? I don't remember the odds ratio. JAMA surgery came out in the spring 2024. I think I've got it cited somewhere in the book, but it was a large database study from Sweden. Now again, we cannot make conclusions from that. These are little signals on the data that we're supposed to pay attention to. I do think it's stabilizing. Dr. Will Brune tracks C-section rates for health care organizations and he will say here's the 28 doctors at this hospital. Here's their individual C-section rates as we are pulling from big data. We're not going to grade. Dr. Shen big under scrutiny for 15% versus a 19% but we use these data as a screening tool. If you're over 30% see section rate in your low risk deliveries, which we can do in big data. We can use this of air pre-clampsia and the twins and all. Then that is a screening tool to identify inappropriate concerning patterns that weren't a closer clinical. How prevalent is that type of analysis today? We're the only group doing it that I know of. It's called global appropriateness measures. It's a consortium of physicians that I help start with Dr. Will Brune, GAmeasures.com is a website. Lots of groups that we pay. GAmeasures for global appropriatenessmeasures.com. And so health systems are saying hey, you've got all the commercial data or nearly all the commercial data. You've got 100% of the Medicare data, 100% of the Medicaid data. You can actually pull the C-section rate and low risk deliveries for our doctors. I want to see what they are. And then what they do is they send a report showing doctors where they stand on the bell curve. And when you're out here on the as an outlier, guess what happens when you get a report. We watch in the big data they regress towards the mean. By the way, what's the reimbursement or the economic difference between the C-section and the vaginal birth? 9,000 versus 7,000. I really don't know it's not an economic difference. I don't think there's any financial. I mean given again how brutal how difficult that job is of being an OB, I think it's other factors. And by the way, we're doing this for spine and hardware and fusion rate during Lumbar spine surgery. What's your rate? Shouldn't be over 50% in non- deformity cases? We're doing it for how often it is a hernia fixed on both sides. When somebody comes in with a hernia, it shouldn't be fixed on both sides more than 20% of the time. So we learn the ways in which there's inappropriate practice patterns. And then we profile individual docs for improvement for quality improvement. By the way, what percentage of inginal hernias are repaired with mesh versus the tissue repair? I think they're all fixed with mesh except in the famous shawl dyes clinic. Where I might go someday, I got a minor hernia if it ever becomes a problem. I might go there because we've sent many patients to the shawl dyes clinic. Really? Because, and I could be, you know, just out to lunch on this. But one of the things I took away from residency that really stood out to me was how difficult the tissue repair was. Like I just remember technically, I still don't understand the anatomy. But secondly, how much better it was if the tissue was sound. And yet, we didn't do very many tissue repairs. Pretty much everybody had mesh. Anything to say on that? Not really. The mesh is now a so lightweight. They're like a little thin net. That's what I've used. If I could do it as well as the shawl dyes clinic, I'd probably would. I just like the idea of no mesh in there. But, and I'll offer it to patients. Say this is how I do it. If you want to know mesh repair, there's a place. I think it's in Canada. It's in Toronto. Where you're from? Aren't you? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's interesting. So basically, if you want to get a tissue repair of an enel hernia, you got to go to the shawl dyes clinic. But you're saying maybe mesh is getting so much less intrusive now that it's there's less downside to doing mesh than they're used to be. Yeah. When we used to operate together, they put these big thick polypropylene meshes in there that I don't understand how you wouldn't feel it. And the idea was to promote scar tissue because it's actually the scarring that is the but now they're lightweight thin like a fish net almost. It's a little bit about ovarian cancer. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe just give folks a little bit of an anatomy of the female reproductive system so that what's an ovarian, what are the little tubes that connect it to the uterus? Give folks a sense of what that anatomy is. Yeah. So this is an incredible area where we're doing some work. Our research team at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to studying the big issues in healthcare that we are not talking about that we should be talking about. Where research is taking off new sciences pointing to things that like hay pay attention and there's not a lot of attention or NIH dollars. And one of those areas is the true origin of ovarian cancer. The ovarian sits draped under the phlobian tube and the end of the phlobian tube has finger-like projections called the fibrier. So we're talking like a millimeter. I mean they're almost really in contact. And so you only explain how this is. Yeah. So it turns out we- What is an ovarian first of all like what does it make, why do women have them, you know, where do the eggs go, all that kind of stuff? So it used to be thought that the only purpose of the ovarian is to produce sex hormones but it's not true. It produces, you know, as we you've talked about with Astrogen's involved in heart health and so many things. But it produces the eggs that then are go down a little circulation through the phlobian tube into the uterus. And doctors have really struggled with ovarian cancer. Really no major progress in modern medicine. You get most of the cases are lethal or present in late stages. There's almost nothing you can do. Very little surgical intervention. There are some cases where it's early enough. But overall the fatality rate is over 50%. And there's a strong association between certain types of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Yeah, there is with the hereditary predisposition. So some people get tested but a big study was just done in the UK looking at screening tests for ovarian cancer. Should we have mass population screening like with using what ultrasound and they've done cat scans and none. We're show shown to improve the outcomes in people and detect to go very cancer. None. Total failure. They abandoned the entire idea of ovarian cancer screening based on this big UK study. So here we are with a cancer with almost no advances. A ton of money is not for lack of funding at the NCI. And what is going wrong here? Well, I love this sort of blind spot of medicine because it shows how when you're certain of something in medicine, you can still benefit from challenging deeply held assumptions. It turns out that there was a recent discovery that ovarian cancer does not come from the ovarian, the most common and lethal type, comes from the philopean tube and that cells float onto the ovarian. So we have taken out millions of healthy ovaries to prevent ovarian cancer during a abdominal surgery, during a hysterectomy. The ovaries will be removed to so-called prevent ovarian cancer. Turns out we were targeting the wrong organ. And so with this new discovery that biologically based on the genetics based on a lot of good research that's emerged from pen, Dr. Drapekin, Guy at Johns Hopkins, one of my colleagues, there's a gynecologic oncologist now. This is her entire career focus is that we have to increase public awareness that this is really not a very cancer of the vast majority of time. It's philopean tube cancer and we can prevent it because the philopean tube serves no function after one of woman childbearing years. It's not like even after menopause. There's very low levels of estrogen that can trick aloud to the ovarian but after woman's done having kids. If they come in and say I want my tubes tied, the new answer at Johns Hopkins is. Take them out. We don't do that anymore. We remove the philopean tubes to massively reduce your 1 in 78 chance of developing ovarian cancer. Yeah, it's that high. 1 in 78. Yeah, I love it that you have that reaction because I had the same reaction. I realized we don't think like that in clinical medicine. Like the pancreas cancer conference once I asked what it this patient was asking what is her lifetime chance of developing pancreatic cancer and I said we have no risk factors and she goes, well what is it? I'm like you mean just for an everyday person and I asked the experts. No one knew. I looked at opposite. I was going to guess one in 20 actually but maybe it's less than that's it that's for all pancreatic cancers. You mean pancreatic adenolethyl cancer? Yes. 167 is. Oh it's not. Okay, I would have guessed even more frequent truthfully. Okay. Yeah, I think it's like a fourth most common lethal GI cancer is something like fifth most common lethal cancer full stop, not GI. Right? So cause of death. Cause of death. Okay. Yeah, cause of death. Right? It goes number one is lung. Mm-hmm. Number two breast and breast and prostate and then colon and then pancreas. And breast is only over pancreas because it's almost almost exclusively women or as pancreas is men and women but it's about 40,000 for both breast and pancreas cancer. Anyways, you know we think about, well if you have and this is what the doc told me in the conference. Well if she has chronic pancreatitis her her relative risk is increased 28%. Okay, well that's that what she's asking. She's asking what what are the chances? But I can Marty, I'm still surprised that Ovarian is as high as 178 and pancreas as 167. So most common GI and cause of death. Yeah, I believe that for sure. Okay, so how widely accepted is it today that Ovarian cancer is a misnomer? Like is that what you're basically saying? Yeah. It's not Ovarian cancer. It's philopiantube cancer. Yeah, now for the vast majority of these cancers. You can have other types of gonadled tumors that are much more benign that arise out of the ovaries. There's many types of cancers in that little region. But the most common, the rank and file, what we call Ovarian cancer, just not come from the ovary. It comes from the phlopiantube. And this is what we previously thought of as Sirius Ovarian cancer. Sirius Adnosis at Carson, oh my yeah. Is a philopiantube cancer? It's a philopiantube cancer. How is that not understood? How is the histology of? I mean I just don't do the cells look the same because I mean pathologists for decades have examined this because when a woman gets Ovarian cancer, she doesn't die from the ovary. She dies from where it spreads to. Right? She's dying from the spread of that cancer to another part of her body. So when they take those cells and they're looking at them under a microscope and they're staining them, why did it takes a long to figure this out? Because of medical group think. And when I interviewed the scientists that were involved in this discovery, the resistance that they encountered was the same old story of the people who challenged the low-fat diet and opioids are not addictive and HRT and all the cellar stuff. It's the same story. They at UCSD, San Diego, a pathologist there wrote a very bold essay in one of the medical journals where he said, I'm telling you that cells were looking at do not look like Ovarian cancers. These are very encancer cells and don't look like Ovarian cells. And he got of course, you know, piled on like the H.P. Laura is caused by you know, causes ulcer die. He just got destroyed. And his courage to step actually led some researchers to say, and then he was another one's, to say, actually we're going to explore this a little bit. And they did a little bit more of an analysis, it was like 15 years ago. And they kind of affirmed him a little bit. They were like, yeah, we are seeing the same thing. They did a series of people who had brak mutations. And then this guy Ronnie Drapekin and Chris, a Kimmer's last name at Brigham and Women's Hospital, they decided, and it was incredible. The Chris had a mentor at Brigham and Women's and he goes, whenever one's laughing an idea at an idea, in science, that's a signal you should look into it. That you should your curiosity should kick in. But let's be clear. And I want to keep coming in fact, if it's maybe 19 out of the 20 things that we laugh at, we should be laughing at. Yes. I mean, this is the thing I just want to make sure we're not giving people a license to a soon that every dumb idea is right because most dumb ideas end up being dumb and wrong. Yeah, we don't want to promote snake oil here on the drive. But we do want to, but it is an interesting. Yes. But but this is the challenge, right? Is this six-year-old noise ratio is still incredibly low? And the examples that are most remarkable, always looked a little foolish at the outset. But I think what we want to do is just make sure that people understand that just having a crazy idea is not sufficient. You have to have a means of it, you know, stating what a hypothesis is determining how to test that hypothesis and above all else having the ability to update your hypothesis based on new emerging information. And because again, most crazy ideas end up being wrong. That's right. Just full stop wrong. Yeah, most ideas end up being wrong. Yes. So, so yeah, it's it's very challenging. Where are we right now in terms of like rolling this insight out into broader oncologic care? So you said at Hopkins, if a woman wants to get a tubal ligation at tying of the phlopian tubes, she is told, will happily take your phlopian tubes out. But if we're going to go in there, we might as well make sure you never get cancer. Massively reduce the risk count. Yeah. Where where else do we see this? How you ubiquitous is the acceptance of this? And is there any uncertainty that remains here? Or is this basically now a fate of complete as far as our understanding of that physiology? There is uncertainty because I think as early as we are in something like this, there always will be, but it is now standard of care in Germany and most of Canada, that when a woman comes in for any abdominal surgery, elective abdominal surgery. So even a lap colisestic if you're being your gallbladder out. Yes, even a lap coli. Most commonly a lap coli, actually, woman comes in because that's more common in women. And they're finished having children. They will be offered to remove the phlopian tubes sparing the ovaries as during the procedure as a concomitant surgery. And the general surgeon does this. So the general surgery, and I'm doing this now in my practice, woman comes in, done having kids, I Rebecca Stone, who is our GYN oncologist who's one of the national insurance. She comes in and does the salping. Yeah, I'm going to be taken out the round leg and then something. Yeah, and tell me what is the probability of taking out the phlopian tube and damaging an ovary such that a woman ultimately needs an uphorectomy as well, which would be a disaster, an absolute disaster for women to lose her ovaries if she's premenopausal and still relying on those for hormones. Yeah, and I think you've touched on a big unknown there, which is the single reason why this is not a broad recommendation for any woman and every day person to come in for gest their phlopian tube removal. It is only offered as a concomitant procedure. They, they'll be so very good at this. They say it's a simple procedure, but here's the issue if you make a broad recommendation for every woman who's done having kids to come in and have this done. What if one in 20 surgeons is going to have a complication rate of 5%. You've canceled out all the public health benefit of reducing a very cancer. So that's why it's for now the recommendation and this is a recommendation that not even all of our surgeons at Hopkins are aware of is that when we're in there doing another elective abdominal procedure in a woman who's finished having children and generally on the younger side not over 67, I think is the average age for a very cancer. So after that, you're benefit diminishes. So in that window, I've done having kids before they're in their mid-60s or so and this is we're just using our best judgment here. That's the group where we're offering now that, hey, I can have you talk with our OBGYN doctors. They can come in and reduce your 1 in 78 chance of her. And Canada, they've done giant studies now and they're showing actually lower rates of a very cancer long term. And so we're waiting for some of that data to come out. But it's pretty wild and the pathologist Dr. Valicus at Johns Hopkins has actually said, Marty, we haven't made progress with chemotherapy on a very cancer. And maybe this is why we may have been targeting the wrong type of organ tissue. So it's pretty interesting. It's an opportunity. It's also an opportunity for people to be aware of this best practice out there. But you know, like the guy who needs to see three randomized controlled trials to do the nonoperative protocol for a pentacidus, it's going to take time. I mean, only at some doctors in the United States outside of GYN are doing this, the American Academy of OBGYN has actually put out a statement recommending women who come in after they've done heavy kids. So there's actually a national guideline on it. But it takes a long time for people to understand, become aware, learn the best practice. I hope it can address the overranging cancer incident. It's in my mind, it's in the bucket of challenging certainty. If you're 100% certain that this cancer must come from the overranging, be open-minded to the fact that, hey, there's some things here that we haven't understood in the past. For example, two obligation has resulted in a lower risk of a very incancer. Interesting. Maybe it's blocking off some of the cells that could have caused cancer in my grade of down. Maybe it's killed off some of the lining. There was, there's an understanding that a very incancer is more likely to spread, more likely to be discovered after it's spread. Well, there's a little gap between the floppy and two in the overranging. So maybe it's disseminates in early stages because of that gap. So there's some interesting things that are now fitting together. Again, I think this speaks to something that we can talk about it at an arms length from any situation and it all makes sense. But now you want to think about how difficult this is to put into practice. Your, your doctor, and this is what you do. You have 99% certainty, which means you're a good doctor because you don't have a 100 percent certainty. Yes. You have 99.9% certainty that this cancer is coming from these overrides. And your, everything that you do in your practice is predicated around that. But now you have to somehow work with a 0.1% probability that everything you believe about this is wrong. Now, again, that's a really low number. That's, that's a 1 and 1,000 delta. How do you not squash that and allow that to remain open and flexible? While you continue to do your best work here and periodically come back to revisit this, assuming you're not even the one who's doing the primary work, but you're just trying to keep update on your practice and your practices and say, well, maybe that's now a 1% chance. Maybe that at some point, you know, if that's a 10% chance, I really need to pay attention. If there's a 10% chance I'm wrong, I really need to pay attention to this. I need to pause. We're not trained to do that. So how, how do we go about thinking about this? If you were, you know, I already said what I would do if I were ZAR of medical education. I don't know enough about medical education today. It's been 25 years for me, but you're closer to it because you're still part of a university system. Is medical education significantly different today when it comes to this? Like, how does a medical education today at Hopkins differ from what it was 25 years ago? Well, one of the most important qualities of a physician is humility, knowing your limits, and having the awareness, the self-awareness that you could be wrong, as you said. And when you are wrong, when it's clear, you might be wrong feeling bad about it and offering the patients, hey, you know, we get this wrong. I thought this is the best way to approach it. One thing I love about Rebecca Stone and so many of the doctors that work with at Hopkins is they don't say you need to have your phloatbeen tubes out. They say we have some data that is suggesting that if we take the phloatbeen tube out, we can reduce your risk of a very cancer significantly. I think the danger in medicine, one of the poisons today is the absolutism that's out there. And when we go through medical school, you're just memorizing and regurgitating, and it's this terrible robotic dogmatic degree still that way. It's still that way. You might even think, say it's worse. So I was talking this morning to Dr. Will Brune who just graduated, you met him, but he in mind I'm working with on the appropriate as work. And he just graduated from Oklahoma University School of Medicine. We were talking about all the useless dumb, remote memorization stuff. He said it was like 50% of his medical education. This bacteria is catalyzed positive, catalyzed negative. It says a branch chain, bacteria. This is a straight chain. It's just it's my numbing, memorizing the names of enzymes. He says was like 20% of his medical education. What are we doing to these kids? They come to us in medical school, bright, creative, altruistic. They want to do good. Social justice is a generational value. And we beat them with the road memorization of these enzymes and stuff. You can look up. We have phones nowadays. You don't have to know the Krebs cycle on demand and the trauma bay. And we do this to this incredible generation. They spit them out seven, eight years later. They're different people. They're robotic. They're sometimes emotionally disconnected. They've learned to reflex as a survival mechanism in order to do what we tell them to do, which is get through the exams. And the thing that kills me and a lot of students they see the tension and they feel it. They hate it. They're fighting it. We do have incredible students that are able to stay normal through the process. But it's a struggle because the culture of medicine says obey. And it's one private company that controls the medical education in every medical school in America. The WMC, a small group of people, get to decide what every doctor learns in their medical education. And these people are dinosaurs. They're forcing kids to memorize the names of all these. And what's the relationship between the AMC and the company that administers the U.S.M. L.E. and the accreditation? Are they linked in some way? Presumably? Yes. Yeah. That is the private organization, WMC. Small group is the entity that also regulates the U.S. M. L.E. to licensee and then they collect a lot of money from these students. It's a private organization. And they are, so I know I was talking to one of the cool things that we get to do is talk to a lot of people out there in America and get a bit of a bird's eye view on things. And I was talking to conference of medical school deans. And later on I had met the dean of medical school in San Antonio University of the Incarnate Word, U.I.W. It's called Great Medical School of San Antonio. And she's like gosh, Marty, you're so right. Why do we have to teach all this wrote memorization and just beat them to regurgitate? I would love, she's told me, to teach self-awareness and understanding uncertainty and focus on applied statistics and the critical praise of research. And the fact that there are nerves that extend to every aspect of the hand without having to name 50 nerves in the hand, you know, and regurgitate on the exact, I would love to have a modern day education. But I can't because the WMC dictates what we teach and we have to teach to a test in our test score pass rate. So is this terrible system and it's connected to the American Board of Medical Specialties, which issues board certification? And recently they've basically said, in order to keep your board certification, you got to pay us $2,300 every two years or so and take a quiz that we give you. And they're out there like making a ton of money off this new thing. Now they're telling hospitals you have to require current board certification unless they pay us, or private company. They're not currently board certified. Imagine your college, do you see a staffer? No, Berkeley. Where'd you go to college? I went to Colton, Canada. Okay, imagine your college college, you're in said, hey, you're degree. You don't have it anymore. You got to pay us every year to keep your degree. That's exactly what the American Board of Medical Specialties is doing. They're private organizations, monopoly. My buddy Will was telling me at Oklahoma University School of Medicine. I probably shouldn't say this, but what the heck? Eight hours on transgender sensitivity training, two hours on nutrition. The two hours on nutrition, he said, we're so pathetic. It might have been better to have zero hours. No, HDL is good. You know, it was like the most basic. And I see this awareness among a generation of doctors and students that they know something is missing. That's in right to just be memorizing. There's smart people. That's why you've got a huge number of people. Doctors who are learning from you as you learn, talking about evolving your position. You're out there learning, reading, talking to people. People are learning with you and they're hungry for this kind of honesty with where medicine's going. Maybe we should be talking about more chronic diseases differently. Maybe we should be talking more about treating diabetes with cooking classes than just throwing insulin at people. Maybe we should talk about school lunch programs, not just putting kids on our zempit. Maybe we should talk about sleep medicine when we treat eye blood pressure. Not just throwing anti-hypertensive that people. First line, second line, third line. Maybe we should talk about ice in physical therapy instead of just surgery and opioids when somebody comes in with pain. Food is medicine. The microbiome, general body inflammation. These are the topics that a generation of doctors are starving to talk about. We need more research in them. They want to think differently. Who would fund this research? When I talk about the pillars of medicine, we have nutrition and exercise and sleep and emotional health and then molecules. Let's roughly five things. You could really add a sixth pillar which would be a waste bucket of everything else that may or may not have benefit. Like sauna, cold plunge, red light therapy, falling kind of stuff. One of those buckets is really taught well in medical school. We really do learn in biomedical school. Medical school in residency. You learn about procedures and medications very well. That's what we learn and I think we do learn that quite well. But to your point, we learn nothing about exercise, sleep, nutrition and emotional health and well-being. But part of that, if you're not trying to be as un-synical as possible, at least when it comes to molecules and procedures, the way to study it is straightforward. The interventions are easy. You take this pillar. You don't take this pillar. You take the placebo. And then on top of that, there's a financial engine that supports the use of that which justifies the cost of the studies. But when it comes to doing research on many of these other things, outside of philanthropic and government causes such as the NIH, it's very difficult to get any of that research funded. How would we create a new medicine around something for which it would be so difficult to really gather the right evidence? Or would you argue, look, we already know enough today that we could teach off the current practice? The NIH could not be more broken. They've got these siloed funding centers as you suggested. And on, let's your research falls under kidney, you know, cardiovascular disease. And it's what the old belt belt and suspended as professors there want to fund. It's a legacy system where if the senior guys who've done the research and made a name for themselves on an idea, like it, they throw money your way. I think the disruption is happening right now. Private industry, you're seeing private industry fund research on different probiotics and bacteria you can introduce. We're seeing private industry fund research. They funded our research on price gouging and predatory billing and other big blind spot in medicine. I do think, you know, a lot of our work is not funded by the NIH and people come up and say, my gosh, it makes sense which are saying why don't we have a big study on natural immunity? And we could draw the blood of these people. I mean, how many studies have you put out there? We you said, this study needs to be done. It's not what falls in line with the NIH silos, but it needs to be done. The classic example. A practice right now that is surging in the United States is taking a newborn and cutting the frangulum under their tongue, either routinely, or if it's a foreshort and tongue. Some people believe in routine and other people believe in only in foreshorting and other people believe never should be done. I don't know what the truth is. I've goody and teeth, friends. What is the rationale for doing this? The rationale, the claim, is that it'll improve breastfeeding and lactation rates, that it may help. There's claims out there that it may help with sleep, apnea, with speech impediments. I think they're outrageous claims when it goes that far. These are people who are also cutting the frangulum under the upper inside lit and sometimes the side of the tongue and the frangulum under the tongue as all. Yeah, so there's been babies that don't breastfeed because they're in pain from this. And this practice is taking off like crazy. It's driven a lot in dentistry. It's in that lactation world of lactation consultants could refer you to some, and it's this dogma that has never had any scientific evidence to support the claim. Now, I'm not saying it's being tested. No. I'm not saying it's bad or wrong, but I'm saying this desperately needs a randomized control trial. Desperately, just like the peanut allergy study, just like the antibiotics study, do it in a cohort of a couple hundred randomization, follow-um, take a look, five years, or whatever that study design is needed. Who's going to fund that study? Big pharma? No, fat chance. The NIH, not one of their clinical centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics with their, you know, $1,000 a year membership of all these $130 million in revenue they take in the year. No, no, they haven't. Possibly. No interest. This is the Brbidot triangle of healthcare in the United States and worldwide. We desperately need to fund things where there are ideas, people are doing things, and they're doing them in a black hole with no scientific evidence. We need to do the appropriate study. We could answer the controversy in less than a year. I hate to mention COVID. We saw this during COVID. All those COVID controversies could have been answered in three weeks or a month or two. They could have done the clinical study immediately, done the randomization answer the question. Instead, they have one went on TV and oh pine about it. It's easier. The NIH controls $80 billion. What are they funding? They were funding this cruel dog experiment at the University of Iowa, trapping these dogs and having these sandflies bite their heads in these cages and concluding in the article that is published. Lushbinius has conspired from dog to dog via sandfly bites. Who gives a shit? This is where our tax dollars are going and we're not funding basic clinical research out there. Why do you think that is? I think it's just, I don't think it's diabolical. I think people get set in their ways. I think it's Leon Festinger's cognitive dissidence. I think people think, oh, this would be interesting. Find out whether or not what's the average diameter of stones on the hamstring? Oh, be interesting. No, it's not interesting. I'm seeing it a lot now with health equity. I think describing disparities in health equity in my personal opinion is not interesting at all. We know there are massive disparities in health equity. Saying, oh, there's also a health disparity in chronic myloginist leukemia according to health. That's not interesting. What's, we've, that's known. What's interesting is what you're doing to reduce disparities in health equity. And yet half of the papers now and I go to these conferences are on differences and so and so by race and socioeconomic set. Yeah, it's been known since the beginning of time, the number one driver of health status overall and the population is the socioeconomic status of that community. So I think it's just, I don't know, intellectual laziness, the old guard. There are fresh ideas in medicine. But when you show up in medicine and you've done this, you show up in the academic world as a resident or you get a peek of it as a student. You have big ideas. Hey, this thing about the microbiome and the rates of this and all fits and maybe chronic diseases have gone up with antibiotics. Whatever the big ideas, you're told, no, no, you need to pick one narrow area and work on an incremental little scientific paper that'll go to the abstract of the Southern surgical society or whatever it is. And that's how the NIH funds their research, little small ideas. We need big ideas. They don't fund that. We need new ideas on cancer. What's the ROI on our cancer funding? Paper at ASCO showed that a vast and increased glial blastomas survival rates by two months. Well, patients want to know what's the cure? Did you cure anyone else that you haven't cured before? If that's the top paper at ASCO, our investment on research has a terrible ROI and I think it's because we're not funding big ideas. We need Ben Franklin thinkers. Ben Franklin intellectually curious starts thinking about ophthalmology, and events by-focals is interested in electricity, events the lightning rod, events a stove called the Pennsylvania stove, which is an amazing invention. I mean, he's a size it true scientists. We don't have Ben Franklin thinkers today in medicine. I think the Niper sod is one thing we don't have them or you think we don't have a vehicle to fund them. We don't have a vehicle to encourage them. I think, and I'm just saying this because I've said this to other people, you're one of those Ben Franklin type thinkers. You think broadly about healthcare. That's what we do on our research team is you're told in med school day one, hey, here's the netter textbook of anatomy, pick an organ. You're going to have to focus on just one, which one do you like? Do you like kidney? Do you like brain, heart? You have to pick one. You're like, well, what if I'm interested in the whole body or the system or the way we deliver care or the way we fund research or approve drugs or what if I'm interested in all of it? What if I'm interested in gun control and violence prevention and I'm interested in trauma and all everything. You're basically told, no, no, stop thinking like that. You got to pick an organ. I went to the gym as a medical student and there was some docs. There were also used the gym and they would ask me every day. What are you going into again? I want to be like, I'm a second year medical student. I don't know. Is that okay? I don't know. I think you can get a specialization and then come around and get off the hamster wheel. There's a lot of these docs now saying, I don't care about my R-view bonus. I want to do something more meaningful and there's starting businesses. 50% of our medical students at Johns Hopkins are getting a second degree with their medical degree. They don't want to live the life that they see with these guys who are like, I got four NIH grants and presented 60 papers. I mean, I hit that point where I was like, okay, I've published 300 scientific peer review articles. Nobody's reading them. I don't think I've beyond maybe a couple meaningful contributions. Like, what are we doing? We've got to focus on impact. So everything we do now in our research group focuses on impact. And that's how we got into the science of medical errors, frailty as a condition, predatory billing and price gouging in medicine. You know, 62% of Americans say in our Harvard survey, they don't trust the medical profession to build them fairly and they avoid care or delay it for fear of the bill. So you can now have the cure for pancreas cancer. But that cure is only instead of being a 100% effective. It's only 38% effective because you've lost that connection, right? So rebuilding trust is the hottest topic right now in medical journals essays. So speaking of that in 2020, the New England Journal of Medicine broke with a 200 and 8-year tradition. And it endorsed one of the candidates for presidency, which again, this is the most esteemed journal in all of medicine that for 208 years was decidedly a political and it chose to break that now, regardless of a person's political stripes, why do you think that's a bad idea? I think there is a political narrative and politics. Everyone sticks to the same talking points. But in science, science is based on a civil discourse of different ideas among experts. And so they're directly in conflict. So you know, we, the journal decided to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time. Okay. Other journals have said, here are some issues we're not going to be both sizing. Like, okay, what if you said that about peanut allergies back in the days? What if you said that about people who are suggesting opioids are very addictive? They've seen it. And the New England Journal is the one is the place that published that study that out of, I don't know, 30,000 cases of people taking narcotics. There was only one patient who developed dependence and that became the dogma. And dogma takes on a life of their own, the life of its own. I think the journals are in a bubble. I think just like we need term limits for politicians, just like president should turn over after eight years. Journal editors should not serve terms like monarchs in Europe or African presidents. They're there for life. And it's they're loading these journal editorial boards with their buddies. It's cronyism. Everyone in the field knows it. It's hard to criticize because we all need the journals to publish our research. The New England Journal of Medicine just a couple years ago at a 51 editors had one African American. Now you can only find one African American to serve in the editor. What's going on is it's their buddies from the Brigham and Women's Hospital. And you know, Beth Israel, Deaconess and Mass Jollis, my buddy from, I remember meeting the editor of the New England Journal when he came to visit Hopkins. Jerry Casserra, I think was his name. I don't know why I'm mentioning these names. These guys will probably all send me some hate now. But with that. And I said, oh, I got a chance to meet your predecessor at a conference. We actually had a nice time together. Talk medical. Yes. Oh, yeah. He was my roommate when we were cardiac fellows together. And so you have all these internal medicine doctors who look alike, think alike, their buddies from one institution, from one part of the country, deciding what should go through the gates for the rest of the doctors the world to see. It's changing. Vinay Prasad and John Mandraula and Adam C. Foo and and I and some other started a new newsfeed called sensible medicine. We're publishing our thoughts in real time when we see articles that look flawed when there's a bandwagon effect when we call things out. Yeah, like 100,000 subscribers to this thing now. We're starting a new journal now, which is designed to be objective and it's called the journal of the Academy of Public Health. Jay, about a chariote and Martin Coldorf and I and a bunch of others. So there is this effort now and with social media. But how do you know you won't fall into the same trap of the New England Journal of Medicine, Science and Nature? Again, I want to bring it back to this thing, which is the biggest journals in the world became political in 2020. They made a very concerted conscious decision to weigh in on politics, to endorse presidential candidates. And again, I don't think it matters who they're endorsing. I don't think it matters what party you're in. I'm amazed more people don't look at that and say, oh no, that is awful. That is awful. Yeah. We cannot have science and policy. A politics, I should say, we can't have those things co-mingle. Again, it doesn't matter if they're endorsing your party, you should be just as concerned as if they're endorsing the other party. That's right. There's there's there's an object activity that can't be co-mingled there. And I think as much as I respect Martin and Jay and you, I just, I don't think I have a sense of what the answer is here and why just coming up with the new rogue journal is the answer because I still don't understand systemically what's going on. And you know, anyway, so I don't mean to sound pessimistic. But but I, but I worry that the, I just, you know, all the terms for for kind of the non-conventional thinking world is the goal of that to be a little bit more provocative in the other direction, even if it's deliberately provocative, but I just want to be careful that we don't, you know, we don't, we don't create disagreement for the sake of disagreement. That's right. We are prone to the same bandwagon group think as the jammingling journal editors or a bunch of like-minded friends. We are at risk of that. We have to be constantly aware of it. And we've invited people who disagree in sensible medicine. We love publishing pro-con articles on the same issue, same topic. And you'll see that, you know, if an eye-pursat is wrong, Adam C. Fu is wrong on this topic. And they're sparring in the spirit that we should have in academics. Remember, when Obama first ran for president, he was asked, what is your favorite book? He said team of rivals, how Lincoln brought together all these different opinions. No, don't go to war, do and he wanted them on his cabinet. He wanted to moderate a civil discourse. Well, I think it wasn't just different opinions. Lincoln's cabinet was composed of the people who had attacked him and run against him during the election. Yes. It was, these are the people who have just spent the past six months telling the American public, while Lincoln is an idiot and should never be president. And that's the, that's the team that he assembled his cabinet from. We need to stay humble, avoid celebrity worship in medicine. We do that a lot. It's the culture of how we create these the greatest highest attainable achievement you can have as a physician is to be the chief of a department. And the way that we drew though, Marty, like, there was never a day when I wanted to be the chief of anything. I think you're unique. I mean, in the culture of academics, it dominates, right? Get your NIH grant. Oh, you have a grant, but it's not NIH. Mm, try harder. Maybe you'll get a K award. But what percentage of people who, what percentage of physicians today are academic physicians versus community physicians? Well, it's blurring. I mean, what's an academic center nowadays with the acquisitions and mergers? Yes. I mean, I do have a, if we just define academic is people who have some funding for research and or are involved in the education of students and residents beyond, you know, the, like, I'm not talking about cyanide where like your community surgeon who once in a while has a resident scrub with you. I'm not talking about that. But if we define academic a little bit rigorously, it can't beat more than 10% of physicians would fall into that bucket, right? Probably. Probably. So they in a control a lot of the girls. That's the question, right? Is what do they control and how much do the community physicians look to them? And I think that just kind of comes back to everything we've been talking about. But ultimately, what matters is what are the community physicians doing? What are the, what are, what are the what are the, what are, what are the, what are the, what are the why courses doing? What are the people who are taking care of the majority of the patients? And let's be clear even if that number is right I'm making it up 90, 10, but directly I'm sure that's in the ballpark, it's not, it's 90 10 and head count. It's not 90, 10 and patient, touch. It's more than that because the academic physician has many other responsibilities that don't involve patient care. So it might be 90, five, five, and other In other words, the majority of people listening to us are going to get the bulk of their medical care from people who are not academic physicians. And therefore the most important thing in delivering exceptional care to the majority of people is making sure that community-based physicians are able to think independently or able to think clearly. And in that regard, I think that, you know, I mean, I think, I just don't know. So again, I don't know that the answer is lies in the hierarchy of the academic institution. I don't know that that is really where the problem is. I don't know where the problem is. But I don't think it's where five to 10 percent of the attention lies. I don't disagree with you. I think, you know, I've got my perspective being in the sort of towers of the ivory tower, the top of Hopkins. It's all about, you know, Fabian Johnson just went to be chair at Wake Forest. He just got this job. Great. Now we're having a big reception form. It's a big deal. It's kind of, you know, what we do, we create chairs to go out there. So I'm an I have a due-have-escute perspective, but every doctor gets trained in an academic medical school in this culture. Every student tends to come through this culture where we tell them it's a privilege to hold a retractor for six hours instead of come and watch me talk to a patient's family afterwards and learn self-awareness and how to be perceptive and empathetic. So I don't have a solution, but you see things where you say, this isn't. We are actually moving more in the direction of everybody getting line than we are in sort of the freedom of the rank and file doctor in America to speak how they would speak creatively. For example, I'll talk to a doctor and say, what do you think about, let's say, hormone replacement therapy, post-mediposa. So I'm saying, wait, you know, I've heard this, but I tend to question that. I know some people are saying this. I'm not sure. That's a good doctor. A doctor who says, no, according to this, you know, US Preventive Service Task Force, you must do this. Okay, you're like reciting a catacysm. That's not the doctor that we want to create, right? And how do you teach humility? John Cameron and I did this thing where we when he operated next door to me, I would pause and I'd say this is a really interesting scenario. Can the scrub nurse run over and or the tech run over and get out of Cameron to take a look at this? Need come in and you'd say, oh, it's really interesting. Marty, in the past, I've done it this way or that way. I know exactly what he's going to say, but I want to model humility to the students and residents in the room. When he gets as maybe one of the most famous surgeons in the world, he gets a situation like that. He calls me and, hey, can the tech run over a grab doctor may carry to come in, take a look, get his thoughts on this? Yeah, and need my thoughts. And if he knows my thoughts anyway, we've worked together for 25 years. I go in there and I say, oh, it's interesting. Gary, so you're going to do it this way. Yeah, that's what we're thinking. Thanks, Marty. He's trying to model humility. And I think that's one way we can teach it, but it's an uphill battle. I mean, the policing right now in modern medicine is at an all-time high. I was gave grand rounds for our OBGYN department at Hopkins. And I went great and it was awesome and they helped me shape some of these ideas and the research that I've worked on and that we discussed. And when I filled out the CME form, you know, there's this. I've coined this ICD-9 diagnosis code called Sendis Your Slides in Advanced Herasements in Drill. Starts off in the hallway with, hey Peter, do you want to, could you, would you be interested in giving us a talk sometime? Yeah, sure. And then the harassment and the email, and we need your fill out these forms and these write four questions for our CME and send us your slides. Now you don't have to have my slides, okay? I'm going to work in Cernyvance from that morning and my talk. All right. Sometimes I've realized the, the kryptonite for send us your slides and herasements in Drill. Is, is, what if you don't use slides? I'm not going to use, that's so bad. Oh, I'm not going to use slides. Oh, well, well, then I guess we don't need Judas send them, but okay. Then we'll show up with a thumb drive. Hey, I got some graphs, so I was going to throw up, is that okay? Oh, yeah, sure. The interview guys at the back. But anyway, I, one of those forms I'd be fill out for this CME continuing medical education required for any time to give granted rounds. Go ahead. You, I hereby agree that everything I say will comply with generally accepted norms and standards recognized by consensus within the medical profession. And I'm looking at this and I'm like, no, what I put out there is I like to cite research that challenges deeply health assumptions. And I'm going to be talking about that. And I'm not going to, you know, sign to some cataclysm here that yes, I will obey and only, you know, say things that are in line with consensus. If you look at our track record in modern, modern medicine, when we use good scientific studies, before we make massive health recommendations, peanut allergies, whatever you, when we have good science, we shine as a profession. When we wing it, when in an elite small group of medical establishment folks decide what the world is going to do based on their own gut feeling or dogma, they have a lousy track record. So what's, let's, let's, let's talk about the thing, what are you most proud of that, that the medical institution in this country? Let's just keep it simple. What do you, what do you think medicine has done the best job of in the last decade? Well, I think you look at cardiac surgical care. I think you look at mine infections and hospitals. I mean, there have been some really big wins here that don't get maybe as much attention as they deserve. What else? Where else are we hitting it out of the park? I'm statical care. I think we've not only now have is the if it mortality rate as good as modern medicine can deliver it, but we've now accepted these, these new best practices of skin to skin time delayed court clamping, encouraging breastfeeding early on reducing c-sections when not necessary. These are, those are in the last 10 years, those best practices. But we're at a pretty good point where the system is humming on a lot of acute care. And there's a video I saw on social media the other day where a guy said, if I get shot, I want to go to a US hospital. We have the best care in the world. If I break a bone, that's where I'm, I'm going to go straight to the hospital. I'm going to go straight to a doctor. But when it comes to telling me, you know, what I should be eating or how to live my life, I don't think I trust modern medicine. If you come in with chronic abdominal pain, sometimes our sophisticated system doesn't know what to do, right? So I think the acute care has been mastered. And I think, you know, I think about the operations I was a part of these laparoscopic wipples and it's a tour de force of science and technology and advancements. And we do something called a transplant with eyelet cells now for people with chronic pain. So I think good stuff is happening. We have good people. People go in medicine, nursing, every aspect of healthcare, united by one common thing. And that is everybody wants to help other people who are in need. And that's an incredible bond that we have. It's a profession. We should all be proud of it's a heritage. You know, I'm proud of that my dad was a part of and I get to do the things he encouraged me to do little tips, ways to connect with patients. I still think of the time he said, don't ask somebody. Are you taking your medication instead say, you know, some people find it hard to take their medications as prescribed. How are you doing with it? It's far less, you know, head to head. And so it's an incredible profession and teaching these little pearls and gems, citing research, calling out the importance of good scientific methodology. It's still, I think, the best job in the world. Medical centers are still some of the most respected institutions in America, which is why we've called on them to have ethical billing and pricing practices. But we can correct course. And I think all in all, it's an incredible privilege to be a part of the medical profession. I encourage anyone to get into it. You would still encourage someone who's sitting here listening to us, who's in college, who's on the fence about going into tech, going into business, going into law, going into medicine. You'd still give them the nudge to do medicine if it's something they're partially considering. Yes, where else can you put a knife to someone skin within seconds of meeting them just because you're the doctor? People will tell you secrets they've never told their spouse within minutes of meeting you because you're the doctor. And so there's an incredible heritage in the profession. And so I think it's the best job in the world. Now you've got to be okay with memorizing enzyme names over and over again. I mean, hundreds of names of useless molecules that you could look up on Google. That's just part of the old system and people. But you know, I think the bigger issue isn't so much that you have to memorize those names. It's that you're sort of lacking the context and why. I mean, Marty, I still memorize names of complex enzymes and pathways. But the difference is I'm doing it because it's feeding my interest. Yes. Right. It's like I'm reading papers and I'm learning new things and I have to draw diagrams to help my, I mean, I'm doing the same thing I was doing 25 years ago. So I don't, I also don't want to let people suggest that it's not important to have knowledge. Like it is important that I know these things, even if they seem a little bit esoteric. But it's just easier to know it when you understand why when you have a scaffolding around why I, while I can't tell you every step of the Krebs cycle, I still remember in great detail how metabolism works because it really matters to what I do. So I think if anything, I just hope that medical education can major in the major and minor in the minor because while I think it matters that you understand these things, I think it, and I get maybe this is already the case because I'm so far from it. But but if you understand why the Krebs cycle matters and why when the Krebs cycle isn't working, every disease in the body gets worse, like why is it that a person with cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes Alzheimer's disease, why do they have defective Krebs cycle? That's what I want medical students to be understanding and learning. Yes. So anyway. Yes. I don't know where I stand on it truthfully if I do get asked from time to time by young people, hey, you know, would you do it all over again? Of course for me the answer is undoubtedly yes, but but I also realize there are a lot of other exciting fields in the world today that maybe weren't available to me and I don't know. How about surgical residency? You wish to do that part again? You know, yeah, it's interesting knowing what I know today and knowing where I ended up today would I have been better off doing an internal medicine residency? The answer is probably yes. I think it would be more logical. But look, I wouldn't know you. I wouldn't know Ted Sheafer. I wouldn't know a lot of the amazing people that I've gotten to know through my surgical training. And I think in many ways surgical training, especially the way we did it so long ago, you know, when you didn't have regulations on work hours and stuff, it was so hard that it really gave me an appreciation for how much easier my life is today and how lucky I have it to, you know, not be woken up every 14 minutes when I sleep and, you know, things like that. I don't know. I'd probably be reluctant to change anything. I think it all worked out okay and I'm really grateful for the folks I met along the way. And I do hope that someone listening to this who's contemplating medical school, as you said, I agree with you completely. Anybody who chooses to be anywhere within the vicinity of this field, you want to be a nurse, you want to be a radiology tech, you want to be a phlebodomist, you want to be a doctor, the one thing that unites all of those people is they're doing it for the right reasons. You know, the sort of kid in high school went asked what do you want to go into and they say, I don't know, I'm thinking about being a nurse. They're different from their peers. It's a calling really to be a medicine and so we attract these great folks. I think our challenge and the academic towers is how can we keep the focus both on the test technically sophisticated pieces of metabolism so they understand it. At the same time, not lose sight of the overall person. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, you pretty up to preserve the humanity of the field, while harnessing kind of critical thought and and doing it around as I said, kind of this scaffolding of purpose. One quick thing, I discovered classic example of this, the Pima Indians in New Mexico along the Gila River, they had been cut off with their water supply, farmers and ranchers and settlers and so this nation of Indians, all of a sudden, wasn't they weren't able to grow crops and the healthy foods they'd been eating for centuries. So the U.S. government recognizing how they were being depleted of food and the starvation that was happening, they started shipping food. But of course, it wasn't this wasn't Whole Foods stuff, this was spam and potato chips or whatever else. And they started developing massively high rates of obesity, diabetes, quickly ensued, and so you had this population that was massively obese and diabetes. And the NIH decides to swoop in and address this problem by looking for pre-disposing gene for obesity and diabetes and they tested the blood of all these poor Indians and it's like we can't see the forest on the trees. There we've been feeding them shit for decades. That is what's been driving the obesity and diabetes. It's not that they have a gene. They've had spontaneous mutations of the FTO gene that have now produced rampant obesity. Well, Marty, thanks for making time to come by and talk always a pleasure and congrats again on your new book. I'm sure many people are going to get a kick out of it. We barely touched on, I think, a third of the stories that are in it. It's always great to be with you Peter. Good to see you.

I've never seen a cyclist who in defeat is so gracious. And it's almost like you don't, it's clear that you're upset, but you demonstrate, I mean, I remember after that stage, like you just thanked your team. You just said, you know, thank God I had a great team around me today or I would have come off the podium. That's remarkable sportsmanship, but how are you able to do that? But it's not the individual sport, it's the team sport. And the guy sacrificed everything to be there in the tour, to help one guy to win the tour. And in this day, we could really see how the guys reacted to me when I dropped and they helped me, they support me emotionally, physically whatever, you know. And yeah, I just, I really felt like I let them down and I was feeling just, yeah, I was devastated. I was upset, angry, but I couldn't change it. Not so, I just went with it. I was feeling down, but yeah, you cannot change nothing. And then, yeah, when we had dinner with the guys, was already better and, you know, they really helped me through that days. Hey, everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Todd, thank you so much for making time. Obviously, you just raised yesterday, you've got a race tomorrow and we're two weeks out from the World Championships. So, to give us any time is amazing. Thank you. No, thanks for having me. You know, a lot of people listening will know everything about you as I do or, you know, they're super fans, but there's also probably a number of people listening who might not appreciate kind of the magnitude of what you've accomplished in a very short period of time. I learned about you in 2019 as the most promising young cyclist that was coming up, but I don't think many people probably myself included expected what happened in 2020 at the Tour de France. What were your expectations going into the tour that year? Yeah, I was not expecting at all to in 2020, it was a COVID year. We had pretty good trainings, not too many races, so not too much to prove now. I mean, 2019 was great through year for me, but then 2020 came and it was like a long period doing nothing and just training and we went to the Tour with Fabiaro and me as two leaders. And yeah, it turns out in the end I was fighting for podium plays for second place in the last week and I was really happy with that. And then the final time trial came and it turned out to be a table around and yeah, I wanted to remember it. I think still a lot of people don't believe it happened. Well, obviously people at the time of that final time trial said, we haven't seen a race like this since Le Monde and Lauren Finiale in I think it was 89. When he had that come behind, but what stage in 2020 did you realize I'm going to be on the podium? On stage, Colour was I think I was sure I'm going to be second because this was the the Queen stage and I come behind Royal League just 15 seconds and yeah, the Lopez win that stage on high mountains. So yeah, that was the day I knew that this is it now. But I also think Royal League thought that day that he's going to win. So yeah, you never know. Yes, so going into that last time trial, what was your team telling you in the radio at the time checks or even before the time checks in terms of your Delta per road glitch on a kilometer basis? Yeah, I was in I mean, Royal League was studying behind me. Yeah, and yeah, the time checks were like I think two time checks on on the flat before the final time and I got the times I don't know who was leading the time on on the flat section. I got that time and how much I think I was even behind. And then when the climate came, there were so many people I did not hear a word on in the radio. I just went like we thought I would go and yeah, I just went to the top. Do you feel anything different that day? I mean, did it feel like better than some of the other stages or was it simply a matter of he had deteriorated more than you across 20 days? I think because it was the last hard stage the next day is just songs that they just roll through. I mean, it's still hard days, but if everything goes normal, you're just yesterday's the same. So I think yeah, it was okay, final time trial had just need to be relaxed. I second place, why Jersey, they were preparing white bike for me for next day, for you know, for seven years. I was, it was cool. It was dream field of pressure. I didn't feel nothing, though. So I just, yeah, we were really chilled out and you were the percussive really well because I did recon before with Talon Piper and Mikhabir, we did a lot of work on that. And then when they came, yeah, I was just mad. Everybody was happy around and there was no tension, no stress, nothing. We just roll with it and then it was one of the best days I ever had. Yeah, it's a little hard to believe. Do you remember what your average power was over that time trial? Yeah, I mean, on the flat, I had a power meter and a unit and then on the climb, I had nothing because I wanted to have a 6.8 kilograms bike. So it's like this possible by regulations, but on the flat time, I think I was like doing 380 to 390. So I'm not in crazy on the flat, but yeah, I was just, I guess I was just going fast enough, you know, to be in that range. What was your weight by that point of the tour, were you 60 kilos? I think that year and 2020 I was like, 60, 60, 60, even I think really. Yeah, yeah, I was. What did you weigh this year? This year in the tour, I come to the tour with 64 and a half and then 65 and 65 and a half, you know, like then jumping from around 65. Yeah. Throw the tour. 21 is another amazing year. And in 22 and 23, you have great race, but a couple of stages where it goes wrong. In 22, I guess the first stage where it was a struggle was it 16? Yeah, I call the ground on the ground. Yeah, and telegraph got a little bit down, we had some, almost a lot of stuff. Visited on attacking, constant constant constant. Yeah, where I made my mistake when I, I mean, yeah, shouldn't follow a wrongly, immediately there on the telegraph, he took already on telegraph, I think, with, yeah, who was, was Tishby Nu and then La Portway, him on the downhill and they just flew down and when we started, Galibier, they just go one by one, you know, I had to respond, I think, eight or nine attacks. And you looked very strong. Yeah, how was that was really good, but I think that was, yeah, yeah, if you do eight, eight sprins, no, that's just, it takes too much and then I try to respond by being stupid now and I try to drop everybody from the wheel on Galibier, but then, yeah, I knew that what one art is also in front and it's checkmate anyway, you know? So yeah, that was just stupid for me. And how much of that, I mean, just from a nutritional standpoint, did you feel depleted? Did you feel like you didn't have enough, did you have a bot, were you, were you short of bottle on that stage or something? I think, I, I, you know, but you did, I think, I mean, the legs. You, you cannot eat enough when you do so much, you know, you do so much power, you do so much attacking, you, yeah, you cannot take more food than you can, no, so I think, yeah, we, we had quite good plant nutrition, everything, but if you do too much with your body, you cannot replace that. When you're training, do you try to simulate that extent of attacking and recovering? And, I mean, obviously, you can't replicate that fully in a training session, but... Well, I've always liked, since I was junior, even before I like to, yeah, I, I knew what's gonna be per course like, then find around my home, similar type and then just, do repetitions of one climb like how many times it's gonna be in the race. And now sometimes I still do the same, I just see, for example, here Montreal tomorrow, it's like around four minutes, climb to five minutes and two short ones, so you just try to do as many as possible repetitions in the training, as well, and trying to simulate the race. What kind of climb do you like the most, what kind of climb do you like the least, in terms of grade and duration? Well, depends on the shape also, but I don't know, I really like around 20 minutes, quite steep, around that. Like 10 to 12 percent or not that steep. Yeah, I would say now that, because we go really fast, and a 7 percent to 8 percent, it's already a lot of drafting, but then what's more than 9 percent, I think, is pretty cool, because there's not much draft, you know, so you can do what you want basically. Do you have many climbs near you that replicate where you can do 20 minutes at 8, 9, 10 percent? No, not really, but like 5 to 10 minutes, yes, like 9 percent, 10 percent. In Slovenia, also just around 10 minutes, it's still points, but 20 minutes, that's not quite rare. And then how much does the heat factor into it and how much are you able to replicate that in training? Well, I think the heat training became a thing now in cycling a little bit, especially this year, maybe last 2, 3 years, I mean, we try to pass, like, over heat the body in training session or in home trainer. And because it is a big factor, especially for me, I felt always that I struggle when it's like super hot, but yeah, if you try to train this and you can be better. Yeah, I mean, I guess I could imagine if you're on a trainer at home, it's easy to replicate it, otherwise you just have to find the environment at the elevation altitude. This year, 2024, remarkable year for you, winning the zero, so comfortably, winning the tour quite comfortably. But it seemed to be your strongest year. I mean, people said, well, you know, Jonas crashed early in the season, but the truth of it is, Jonas's time is we're pretty remarkable this year. I mean, he seemed to put out very good numbers, so it seemed to be just as much a function of you riding even better this year than Jonas coming in injured as much as he was. What do you feel that's the case? Jonas had a big injury this year. Yeah, I don't know how exactly his recovery event, because they kept it quite quiet, but he was when he once got on the bike, I think he could start immediately training quite normal now for sure. It's first a little bit, a little bit, but I think it affects on three week stage race, it affects that preparation and yeah, you don't have the capacity to go three weeks, you have the power, like 10 minutes, best power output or five minutes, 20 minutes, you can do one day, but then maybe your body is not used to go another day. So I think that was the case with Jonas this year. He had a great power, he got great numbers, but then maybe he liked this three week, extend, you know, to perform. I feel like every cycling fan just feels that we have this incredible treat where we have both of you as these remarkable cyclists, you're both so young. We're going to have many more years if you guys racing each other. Do you feel you're going to continue to race the tour for many, many more years? I mean, obviously people are saying, look, you know, you could break every record here, you could you could break the five tours, the seven tours, I mean you could do it all, is it your intention to keep riding grand tours and specifically the tour to France? The tour to France is the biggest race of cycling, so yeah, to be to keep being on the top, you need to do tour to France and yeah, I think battling between me and Jonas is pushing each other and always the tour is the test, who is better, no of that year. I think I will keep on riding the tour until I enjoy it. Once I don't enjoy this stress anymore, maybe I hang up the bicycle in Gorash or somewhere. Something seemed different in you this year, you seemed stronger, what changed in your training between 23 and 24? Well, I didn't change only training on the bike, I also implement like court training more and more outside of the bike stuff. I got more into the details of nutrition as well, I'm getting older, so yeah, I'm not so obsessed anymore with just going cake on cake or just seating sheet, no, so yeah a little bit, my little. Is that mean that five years ago you weren't paying much attention to your nutrition and you were kind of shooting as much as you wanted? Yeah, for sure, when you're a kid you can eat what you want and you don't gain that, no, you don't gain too much because you're evolving, you're growing up and yeah, it's just, yeah, when you're a kid you can eat what you want and when you get older, you already see. You're at the age right now because you're going to be 26 and a week. Yeah, do you need to watch your weight in the off season now? I mean, my all year looks more or less the same. I never restrict too much or I never say, okay, I cannot eat cake or I cannot eat chocolate, but all in measurements and when the time is right because if you don't. If you restrict too much and you don't touch chocolate for a month or for six months, then one time you will break and you will go crazy now and I think that's not good relationship with food. So you need to have balance also with the bad food also now and then when comes off season, I don't have the cravings. I'm like, okay, now I go vacation, I have nice food, good food quality food and not crazy amounts, so I don't gain so much weight. What's the heaviest you'll be in the off season? 70? No, like 69. Like maybe 70 after when you wake up after party or something when you're big, big dinner with, I don't know, after a girl they party or something. You just a lot, but that's also a lot of times just waterwaters or something, but around 69 would be maximum maximum. Now, do you have a sense of how many grams of carbohydrate you can drink in an hour when you're training? I mean drink or it's total amount of carbohydrate. So in drink we have either 30 grams or 60 grams in per bottle, so normally you're not a very strong dilution then. No, I honestly, I like the 30 grams of grams because then I can eat more, but when it's a hard stage it's better having 60 grams in the bottle and then you can eat less. I mean still no because for hard stages you need to get around 120 grams per hour and for easier stages from 60 to 90 is enough. So yeah, basically we aim for that per hour. Was that easy for you to get to or did you have to train your gut to be able to eat that much? At first it seemed like five years ago, 120 grams per hour, that's impossible, but we do good food with good nutrition. What do you like to eat and drink? Sponsor energy, and with our nutritionists, he designed really good the gels and the drink that it's easy on the gut and since they created this product, I don't have any stomach problems. Five years ago I will always go shit my pants after the stage races or long races and now even eating 120 grams most stomach problems. And do you think that's more because you've gotten used to it? Do you think it's more because your nutritionist has figured out recipe that works for you guys? Yeah, I think it needs to be good ratio between glucose, glucose and all other stuff in the gels. And it needs to be good quality of what's inside. So I know, yeah, you get used to it for sure. When you're training right now, I don't mean right now. I mean like when you're preparing say for the tour. How do you define your energy systems? You define them more by heart rate, by power, by how you feel, what are you using? I've been training with hard-drain monitors since I'm, I don't know, 12 years old or even like 10 years old. So I would say I know how my body responds, I mean how my heart rate responds when I'm tired or when I'm good. So yeah, I could go by heart rate only, but it's always good to compare heart rate to two-power, but power meters are not so reliable these days. I would say really. Which one do you guys use SRM? We have Shimana parameters, but yeah, you always need to be careful with the temperature, so the outside, the calibration, everything and sometimes can be off. And you need to be careful about this. I, in my experiences and yeah, the best is to train on your home roads, but you can also look the speed, the van, how fast you're moving. What kind of van are you able to reach when you're training? Well, on training, 7.5% if you go all out, I think it's like 1700 to 1800 to 1. For like 15 minutes, so. Yeah. That's just incredible. Yeah. I mean, people, I know that people listening might not appreciate that. I'm not going to take time to explain what VAM is. If they know what it is, they understand how crazy that is if we don't take and look it up, I'm happy when I hit a thousand by the way. Yeah. But yeah, depends on the gradient, but what I was trying to say is like, you can, you can see using these other metrics. Yeah. You see all these three things, the speed, heart rate and power, and then you see how you feel and in Weads on, are you really in? And how much of your time are you spending at like a low intensity, where do we call it zone two, whether we just call it a row big, how much of your total training time would be in that zone and not burning matches? Well, I love riding zone two. And yeah, around where I live in Monaco, it's really hard to get big time zone two because it's a lot of climbing and then you have all the down hills you cannot go to camp. So yeah, try to hit really high zone two on the climbs. They are like 20 to 40 minutes long and then you recover and downhill. But when I go home to Slovenia or somewhere else or in Spain when we're training in Calpe or somewhere, where it's more flat, then I really like to stay five hours in zone two. She's on two. Yeah, and some trainings, I would love to do just zone two and going on stop. What is your heart rate at zone two approximately? When I'm Satiq, it's like 140, 145, when I'm bit more fresh like 158 to 155. And how many watts are you putting out at that heart rate? Like 320 to 340. Again, I know it's just hard for people who are listening to us to understand what that means. 320 to 340 watts for five hours keeping lactate below to keeping heart rate at 140 is really remarkable. That's also another thing not in Monaco on the climbs where I can recover after. I can do, you cannot look zone two and say this is your zone two because you did to 10 minutes. Yeah, because it's too much up down. And if you're doing five hour right, you're zone two after five hours, maybe not be your zone two anymore. So you need to also, you always need to know at what time this zone two will not be your zone two anymore because on the flat, you will not recover and five hours of writing of 320 to 340 for me is also next day. I'm not not writing the bike. So on the when I go on flat for longer, I drop power to 292 to 300. Do you track your heart rate or heart rate variability in the morning? Do you, do those numbers give you any indication of how you're going to train that day or race? Yeah, I started this in 2020, at first. I was especially in COVID time, lockdown, this mean my girlfriend, we were doing that, but yeah, I did not find it really interesting or helpful. But this year I started using again more to track HRE heart rate in the night and yeah, I must say that I quite like it now to track it, but yeah, it's not something that you, it can be misleading, it doesn't necessarily take it, it can get in your head a little bit, you don't want it to tell you how you're going to train that day can be misleading. It's almost better for somebody else to look at it and tell you after. Well, my girlfriend, she had a really good method for a while, especially in races. She don't open in the morning, she opened it after the race, she checked after the race, what was her heart rate variability in the morning, not in the morning. So she would not, if it would be real low, it doesn't. She would be less than then with the mess with race. So how much variation when you do look at your heart rate variability, how much variation do you have between a high day and a low day of HRV? Well, if you really, yeah, on a really good day, I would say my HRV would be, I don't know, 120, 120, maximum some days can pick up to 150. Wow. And then on the lower end, would be also, I don't know, 35 could be that much of a difference. Could be, but is that from drinking alcohol the night before me? Yeah. Okay. But yeah, like on the races in the tour, for example, and zero was quite steady around from 80 to 110 was like average. Wow. Everyday. Yeah, that's that's pretty amazing. And then resting heart rate, do you care at all about that or do you see how much, how much heart rate range do you have? So what's the lowest you're going to be at? And then what is your maximum heart rate now versus five years ago? And the lowest I hit since I'm tracking, I think was 37, but my average I would say in the night, I think 43 42. But someday I could walk up with 48 49 if you're sick or really fatigue maybe even over 50. And the max heart rate, yeah, when I was junior, I could hit 213. Yeah. But was shorter races. Thanks. So now, for example, when you were yesterday, 233. So was still pretty high. So I'm pretty happy about it. How often do you guys test VO2 max? Oh, since it's been a while since I tested the last time we were to max here. Yeah, interesting. And do you do it? Yeah, I'm going to bet it's pretty high. So, and do you do an FTP test out of season just as a way to track it like a true 20 minute test? True 20 minute test also, it's been a while since I've done one. We do, I did this year like fatigue test when you repeat eight minutes of one power. Yeah. And I mean of going higher and higher power and then also all out. And normally we do home trainer test in the camp in December. It's long from one hour to one hour 30 depends how you really want how long you want to test to which zone you want to test, but yeah, normally around one hour 20 for me. 10 minutes steps on the home trainer and every five minutes you take like that from from the year to check for the zones. And I like to do it also at home with my girlfriend one time I do for her. You see you test each other with test each other and yeah, for people listening your girlfriend is obviously a very competitive professional psych. Yeah, yeah. If you guys have kids one day, they go, oh man, I don't want to put them in second though. Well, that would be a good idea actually because they would probably have a very hard time filling your parents shoes. Yeah, but they should pick up another sport. They couldn't be better even. Okay, changing topics for a second. If we just think about three of the most epic climbs in the two are to France. Well, for me, if I would say, Vauntu, Alptu as Gullibier, but what what what what would be the most epic climbs and what I really want to know is how do they compare and difficulty assuming your equally fresh on all days like same situation. If you have to race up each pick those three if I said Vauntu Gullibier and Alptu as well of those three, Galibis they just. Then I would say when to second and not Alptu is second and then. Vauntu will be the first. I think is the hardest there also because of the nature because they ended the top and stuff like that. When hit can be no and yeah, Alptu is it's hard, but I think it's shorter. Angaly B is the pen. It depends where it is in the state from also this but from Briand's own side is like dragging up in the valley and then when you turn right I mean it's quite high altitude, but yeah it's still quite regular climb from the other side you have telegraph and then small downhill and climbing again, but it's like. These are calls from apps they're all more or less the same. And Galibis called up on it these are almost identical climb so you're used to those and yeah, Alptu is just mythical you have you have we a hundred climbs then. Alptu is for sure. What is the hardest climb you think in the in the modern tour? Well for me personally, Colela was the hardest. I think everybody would agree on that this was my well you had a first guess of day there in 23. Yeah that was what stage 18. Stage 7. Was it the Queen stage? Yeah it was stage 17. Yeah yeah. But yeah I did twice and yeah first time. Okay I did good but then I felt really tired after it was really exhausting climbing. Yeah last year was with it Lose and then small downhill and 12 to put in what's called this town. Cushvel and this was brutal but yeah. But this is something about you today that is very. It's very interesting. I've never seen a cyclist who in defeat is so so gracious and. It's it's almost like you don't it's clear that you're upset but you're you demonstrate. I mean I remember after that stage like you just thanked your team you just said you know thank God I had a great team around me today or I would have come off the podium. That's that's remarkable sportsmanship but how. How are you able to do that? I if I put myself in your shoes. I would just be so pissed off I wouldn't even want to talk to the media like I would just want to be locked in the trailer you know. Yeah but. It's not it's not the individual sport is the sport and they the guy sacrificed everything to be there in the tour to help one guy to win the tour. And and then in this day we could really see how the guys reacted to me when I when I dropped and they help me. They support me emotionally physically whatever no and. Yeah I just I really felt like I let them down and and I was feeling just yeah I was devastated I was upset. I was upset but I couldn't change it not so bad just went with it. I was feeling down but yeah you cannot change nothing and then yeah when we had dinner with the guys was already better and you know they really helped me through that days. What did you think about after the 23 tour you now come in second twice and. My guess is there were people out there saying hey maybe this guy isn't the next Eddie marks you know and again I'm sure you don't care about that but like whether you're the next Eddie marks are not but. How did you think about that and how did it motivate you over the winter coming into 2024 where you set off on this again very aggressive schedule. To win huge races going into the tour. Yeah it's frustrating was frustrating. Yeah. It was. Yeah I was anxious I was stressed and I was not feeling great last year after the tour but. I evaluate what when wrong what was. What was the mistakes what I can do better and I told went back to the crash from leash and preparation to the tour and everything else. It was a it was a it will love everything and yeah. Psychologically I mean did you have to get some confidence back I mean did you for sure I mean I got some confidence back already on stage 20 when I win. Yep. Three days after that but then I worked on it was like just a small patch on the wound I would say third place but great racing but. I didn't feel enough you know and then. Yeah winning longer day was. Yeah it was really amazing big for me last year and then again for sure people listening who might not understand that there are these five huge classic races. That normally the people who win the tour de France do not win those races and vice versa. This is a totally different sport it's sort of like I don't know the person who wins the marathon winning the 10k I mean even that's not even remotely the right comparison but there's their did like yes they're both on a bike but it's different. Yeah and you've now one three of the five classics. Yeah I mean longer this the closest one that grant to winner can win. The other four is they're really unlikely maybe they're just on the edge but also it's really hard for grant to. Contender to win those races but yeah. Do you want to win you have a very rare day still. Yeah very rare day and a scenario yeah. Sanremo is the one that's gonna send me to Grave I have feeling it's just. You're gonna die trying to win that probably it's I'm getting so close but it's so far and it's it's unbelievable it's. But this is that to be clear this is a goal you want to win all five. I mean I want to win first World Championships yeah Sun Rema and then we can see if there's a space for a bit or not. And not to discount it but the Vuelta. Yeah of course Vuelta my first grant to renew in 2019 it podium was breakthrough for me with three stages. Why jersey and I want to come back and seal the deal with the regers if I sure. Yeah well I think you will. Right. What about the Olympics where does that rank on your goals? Well it's in Los Angeles in four years I really hope for a nice per course. I really want to dip like again climbing per course like was in Tokyo or even harder. So yeah we'll see when they announce it how eager I will be but Olympics in cycling is hard timing. It's right on the floor. You know for other sports in some other sports they train four years just for Olympics and then this is the peak of the career. And in cycling the peak of your career needs to be to the France every year so it's a bit like no. It's not as high a priority as one of the goals obviously. I mean yeah it's not. Do you watch have you seen any of the Netflix series the two that you know the Netflix has done the two specials and the two have you ever watched them? Yeah I watched the first season I didn't watch the second season I watched the because I was in training camp and I didn't have anything better to watch but yeah for people like us when we are there no. Yeah it's not so fun to watch. But you know it's fun for me to be able to watch it with my wife or with friends if they're not cycling fans right so they're not going to watch the tour with me and stuff like that. One of the things that people who don't watch cycling and frankly people like me who do still cannot believe is how you guys are able to ride while fans are encroaching the roads. What's the closest call you've had with a fan? Well first the fans are amazing when I was a kid I always wanted that feeling to ride through the group of fans like this and now I enjoyed the most and yeah the closest I've been having. I don't know yeah in cause I lost I was when in 2020 was some close calls which lovinian fan. And yeah but normally you need to watch the flags the flags are really really tricky one because they are waiting in the middle of the road and they move it. The last time and sometimes you know they they move differently the flag and. That's when I'm watching this with my wife she gets so mad at the TV. She's the get out of the way get out of the way. I mean she's screaming at the TV for the fans to move she's so upset. I think they have I think. I think. So I was going to say the opposite because I put try to put myself in a cyclist shoes and I feel like I would subconsciously be holding back a little bit for fear of hitting them. And not that you worried about hitting them but worried about falling because you're going to. Yeah you do sometimes like let off the throttle a little bit especially like if you attack or something and you're in the zone. If you like you're pushing all all the words that you can but then when you see the fans. You don't I don't know you may be let off a little bit but it's still high power I would say but also because. The other sharing is just adrenaline is so high and the noise is. Yeah incredible the noise is so loud and you're just you're just riding and you don't actually lose any momentum and. You just it's crazy it's hard to describe I can't imagine actually it looks like one of the craziest things. I've ever seen and I yeah so. This year in the tour I was very surprised that certain commentators were. Almost expressing disappointment when you were winning stages after you had already secured the yellow jersey. Did any of that make it to you and if so did did you does that does that mean anything to you that people are saying he shouldn't be winning so much. I actually don't see so many people saying he shouldn't mean so much okay the ones that they hate me they will say that but obviously they. Hold something against me no yeah it's normal but like even the people that are neutral and this don't say it in that I should hold back I shouldn't mean so much. It's just the media and the commentators and journalists they like to they like to say these things just. So that's a kind of a. Yeah but I really don't see so much. Yeah I can't trust in this because also for me. In some stages a lot of stages I can't I can't the other day how many stages I win. 12 stages in grand tours this year and I think we control. To win and that I won was seven stages so. It's just a little bit more than half. So it's not so bad. Do you even think about. Equalling or bettering the the mark now of of marks and Cavendish and in tour stage wins. I don't want to think so much ahead. Just. Yeah just because you never know when you're lost in know that's why you also. That's why you take every win. Because if it's there you take it now if you enjoy and you feel good you go for the stage. You win unless it's there some other reason. But yeah I mean 36 or how much? 34 or 36. 35 stages from Cavendish is just crazy and. It's incredible achievement but yeah I don't want to think so much ahead. I want to go from tour to tour and see how I feel and what can I do. If you met Eddie Merck, I assume you have. Yeah I did. I made him a few times one time more closely but that was. Now already three years ago yeah we met for dinner. That was nice. There's a great book about him called Half Man Half Bike. It's one of my favorite books about cycling and it's kind of the story of his life in career. And it's just amazing. I'm sure you would enjoy it because it gives you an appreciation for how could a guy win all of these races. Like again like what you're doing right you're winning you're winning you know grand tours he's winning the one day classics. And then of course in 1972 to just obliterate the one hour world record record that would stand for 12 years. And even 12 years later when it was broken by Francesca Moser. I mean it was using completely new arrow equipment and stuff whereas Merck did it on a. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. And so you know I've read certainly that Merck has considered you truly the second coming of him. That must mean a lot to you. I don't know I don't know how to how to respond to that but yeah for sure he was. One of the greatest especially at his time this was. He was incredible and how he won the races and yeah I mean I never saw any of his racing but yeah just when you read his Palmaras is just unbelievable and yeah it's something that you can not imagine in this era to achieve so I don't think it's. It's possible to do the same what he did not but it's different cycling. You think that that the one hour record is something you would even entertain in terms of like making the effort for training for it setting aside time. I was until yeah gonna did it. And then being I think he did also before people. And before that time I would consider it now not so much there there. I mean Ghana was fast really he did incredible. What is the difference between your power when you are climbing so your legs are you know your femurs are not kinked down versus when you're in a time trial position. How much of a how many watts do you lose being in a time trial position for the same period of time? Well I don't know I still trying to figure this one out actually but yeah I have I see that I have on time trial. I have some good days and some bad days I never have more I don't consist I'm not so consistent as on a road bike but when it matters I can push more or less the same numbers on the real. And then I think that the same thing is the same thing. Wow it's coming all along now with via mechanics and wind testings and so many training so many intervals doing that. Yeah you trying to figure out the best position to be possible to do this power. You mentioned that you did some more strength work in the offseason coming to twenty four as part of the reason why you've seen. Stronger than before which is hard to imagine. Were you doing any strength training for your legs were you doing any weights? Yeah a little bit weights. I mean I'm still doing the strength training throughout the season but with less weights. But yeah still legs core glutes. I mean hips and this is for me personally is important. Yeah. Do you not anymore but did you ever use to when you're growing up run or swim or do any other endurance sports? Yeah when we were younger in our team in Lula and in the winter we were running up the mountain and like three four times per week after school. We we had meeting training meeting and we go this mountain that was closed by and we can we go like two three times up down and that was it. We swim also a few years one time per week for one hour or something. So yeah we tried different sports in the winter and cross country skiing this my favorite. Yeah running on the flat not so much but now I try the last two years I tried to to put running also into off season really. I tried to start in off season and I tried to keep it as long as possible to season but it didn't work out this year. So in your off season what is the most days you'll go without being on a bike at all no stationary bike no outdoors. Especially in off season I don't do it but yeah I don't know we have a team camp in UAE it's like six days but. Yeah last year for example we went with the boys run together in Abu Dhabi two times and playing paddle something so. And then going off to vacation and then on vacation you get bored you go for run or playing paddle or whatever again or swimming and I don't really have. I cannot say that I do two weeks without a bike or without any training at all but because I really enjoy doing other stuff and other sports so. Yeah maybe three days doing nothing then one day do something and then maybe three days again nothing and you know but then meet November always starting on a bike road bike again. How old were you when you realize you're going to be or where you knew you wanted to be a professional cyclist. My thing when I was a junior so. Yeah six sixteenth sixteenth seventeenth years old when I. When I thought that I have a chance to to be professional to be in the war tour team but then. Yes second year juniors. Why realized that I can definitely be in war tour and then when I come to under 23 then I already signed with UAE team pre contract for 2019 so two years after. Well today I have a million more questions I could ask you but I know you've got a team meeting shortly I want to make sure you get to that on time want to make sure you got a good dinner and have a great race tomorrow and above all else I mean really we're just. You know I think everybody's kind of excited to to see what the world's in a couple of weeks and. Not again not to put pressure on you but just so people understand the significance of that to be able to win. Two grand tours in a year is really unprecedented. If there's a chance to add a world title to that it's kind of unbelievable and and and at the other end of that you know should it not happen this year given that you're you're you're not yet 26 I think most people would take the bet that you're going to have another shot at that. Yeah but the sooner we get it over. The better is there's no more pressure. Yeah I love it. Thank you so much.

Human genome project was completed in early 2000s, and with the human genome having been sequenced, and then also with DNA sequencing technology becoming cheaper and faster. Scientists were able to start a sequence in many, many more genomes. And so they can start to make comparisons between healthy individuals and also people who are affected by specific diseases to see what's different between their genomes. And by doing that comparison, they can identify the differences that may be causal for disease. And so, you know, two-date based on genetic analysis, researchers have probably identified more than 5,000 genealty mutations that have a direct causative role in disease. And so these are called genetic diseases. They are usually affecting a small population of individuals that are not as common as things like cancer or diabetes, or these, what people call complexor or complicated diseases. But nevertheless, these are the ones where we know the exact genetic cause. And so, the tantalizing idea is then, if you know the mutation in the genome, why not just go and fix it? And so that's where gene editing comes in. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Hey, Fong. Thank you so much for detouring your trip and coming through Austin. I've been really looking forward to sitting down with you for, frankly, about a year. So this is a topic that I don't think there's anybody who's heard this podcast, who hasn't heard the term CRISPR. But I think very few people can actually explain it and explain what a powerful tool it is. But I do think that before we get there, it would be really helpful to kind of understand a little bit more about your journey on one hand. And then the journey of gene editing kind of as a parallel. But let's start with with yours. You and I overlap to a little bit because, I mean, not temporarily, but you were at Stanford and you were a postdoc in Carl Desaroth's lab. Well, first of all, thank you for having me beyond his podcast. I've listened to your podcast on and off, especially when I'm running around or exercising and it's always I learned a lot from this year to the podcast. Awesome. Thank you for having me here. So back to Stanford. I was there as a graduate student. I was in the lab for researcher named Carl Desaroth and I was there for five years. That's right, you did your PhD there with Carl. OK, now as you know, Carl, and I were classmates, Carl's been on this podcast. And so maybe folks who either didn't listen to that podcast or who did but have forgotten, give us a kind of a quick summary of the type of work that you and Carl did. Well, I was working with Carl Desaroth with developed a technology called Optogenetics. And it's a way of studying brain cells in the brain how they are connected together and how they mediate memory, mediate different types of physiological function. The way it works is that we took a gene from a green algae. And this is a gene that senses light and converts it into electrical current in a cell. So we can put this gene from the green algae right into the brain cells in the mouse. And we can shine blue light or yellow light and control the brain activity in these mice. So for example, if you wanted to study sleep, you can put this gene into different groups of cells in the brain and stimulate them. And you can find out which ones of these are controlling wifleness or which one are causing the mouse to become more sleepy. So if you do this systematically, one by one from one type of cell to another type of cell, you can gradually start to put together picture of how the brain is wired together and then also what are the different components that govern all sorts of behaviors from sleep and wifleness to thirst and hunger, to memory and even to motivation and happiness. So it was really fun to be as Stanford and working with Carl. Yeah, and to me the thing that always stood out about the technique was just the resolution. It was, I don't know what a great analogy would be, but it was sort of resolution at the level of the word rather than the page. If you were thinking about a book, for example. Right, what is incredible about these algal proteins is that they are very, very fast. So you can control the way the brain cells are able to signal to each other at the action potential level. So action potentials are these individual signals that they're basically like the phonemes of the speech that when neuron speaks with another neuron. And you can control it at every single phone in the level. And that is pretty cool. And since we're going to be talking a lot about gene editing, what was the technique that you guys used to insert those algal genes into the brains? The way that you will put a gene into the brain is usually by using a virus. So this is a virus that exists in nature, but we have engineered it by removing everything that is pathogenic by the virus and replacing those pathogenic genes with the gene that we're trying to put into the brain. So in this case is the gene from the green algae. And by injecting the virus into a brain area that you want to study, the virus will infect all the cells in that region and then make those cells begin to produce this algal protein. So once the neuron starts to carry this algal protein, it becomes light sensitive. So you can turn blue light on it and then be able to stimulate it. Yeah, amazing. What year did you finish here PhD? In 2009. Okay, and then you went to MIT, or did you have the brood? Then I was a Harvard. I was there for about a year. And then I went to MIT and brood after that. Okay, and then your attention there sort of turned. You obviously worked on some on optogenetics, but what else did you sort of pivot into? So as I was working on optogenetics and especially toward end of graduate school, they began to realize that one of the biggest bottlenecks facing optogenetics is our ability to insert the algal gene into a specific place in the genome. And the reason for that is because in order for us to study different types of brain cells, we need to have very precise targeting of different types of brain cells. Brain cells are not just one type. The neuron is not a single type. They are probably hundreds of different types of brain cells. The way that they're defined is based on their molecular property. So each brain cell, even though they all share the same genome, they have different sets of genes that are turned on. So that's why brain cells, the control, pain sensation, versus brain cells that are involved in Parkinson's disease are different. So the way that you would target one or another type of brain cell is by figuring out what are the molecular signatures of that cell. So if you know that gene A is turned on in that brain cell and not in another type of brain cell, then you can insert this algal gene into the region that's controlling gene A. That way it will only get turned on in neuron, that the first type of neuron. And the way to insert this gene into that precise place in the genome required gene editing, and it was really hard to do at the time. And so I thought maybe if I wanted to get after genetics to become even more powerful and useful, we need to make gene editing more easy to use. So by the time I went to Harvard, I began to focus more on trying to figure out how do you more easily be able to modify the genome? Yeah, so this is to me where the story gets so interesting because you stumble across a problem that you're trying to solve because of your passion. You've already alluded to why this is so difficult. And I guess maybe just go back and explain something so that the listener understands, why was it easy to do what you did in Carl's lab, relatively speaking, right? Where you're putting an entire gene into presumably an adnovirus and letting the adnovirus infect the neurons and stick a whole gene in. Why is that a different problem than the one you just described that you started to solve at Harvard? Make sure everybody understands that distinction. The work that I was doing when I was at graduate student with Carl Dysroth is that we were simply trying to insert a gene into brain cells. And when we did that, we weren't as... Meaning you don't get to care where it goes specifically. We can get it into the rough area in the brain but there are many different types of cells there. And so we weren't as precise in our ability to target those cells. And we also developed some tricks to be able to get it into a specific type of cell but that was only limited to mice because we can genetically modify mice and it will take a long time. We'll take a year or two years to be able to make those mice available to engineer them but it wasn't generally applicable. And so especially if you think about how to turn up to genetics into a therapeutic to using a human, we certainly couldn't go and use those transgenic technologies to make a working in a human brain. So so this was a major problem. OK. So let's keep that story on the side for a moment. And let's tell in parallel another story, a story that started long before you were even in college, when you were young kid. And it stems from an observation that grew out of a discovery in sequences that existed in bacterial DNA. A certain type of repeating structure. They had all these interesting characteristics. So let's go back to the 80s and tell a little bit of that story. And it's all obviously I wouldn't be going through this if it wasn't going to quickly converge with your life change the direction of your life. But let's go back to the 80s. Sure. I was born in the 80s. But what was really interesting that you are pointing out is that back in the 80s, there was a group of Japanese researchers who were just looking at DNA sequences of bacteria. And they were looking at E. coli. And what they found is that within some of the genomes, the DNA sequences of these bacteria, there are these regions that are very repetitive. So just repeat over and over and over again. Normally, genome sequences are not repetitive because they encode genes and different genes. But here, they found that these repeat sequences that are all grouped together. So they're clustered. And they are not tandem repeat. So it's not repeated one next to each other. But they're interspaced by a short fixed length gap. And so it's basically A, B, A, C, A, D, A, E, A, G. And so it just continues to repeat itself. But in this regularity, spaced pattern. And when they first found it, they had no idea what this sequence was all about. And there's something else about those repeating segments that was quite interesting as well, which is in each direction, whichever way you read them, they were the same. So they're called palenjums. DNA is double stranded. So there's a pop strand and there's a double strand. There's a bottom strand. And so this is why they look like a double helix so they twist and insert. And what is interesting is that when you read these repeats sequences from the top and you read in the reverse way at a bottom, they're almost the same. So so they're a palenjum. So you had these palenjum clustered repeats that were interspaced. And if you say that in the right way, you get a few letters. C, R, I, S, P, R. Right. CRISPR. So the name CRISPR that term was actually coined then nearly 40 years ago, right? So CRISPR is really a brilliant acronym. And so CR, I, S, P, R stands for exactly how these repeats look. Clustered, regularity, interspaced, short, palenjumic repeat. So CRISPR is really brilliant and is very catchy. But this name wasn't the name that was given to these repeats back in the 80s. In fact, it had many different names. Would that name not come along until the 90s? It didn't come until the early 2000s. Oh, really? OK. OK. So before Francisco, Mohito, he was named Mohito, Kima, was named. Kima, was that name. But there was no way to tell these 20,000. OK. Now, if my reading of the history is accurate, understandably, scientists in the 80s and 90s focused on the repeating segments. Obviously, any good scientist, I think, would look at that and realize this is a very interesting observation. How do we figure out what it is? But the focus was on the repeating segments. What you describe is the A in the A, B, A, C, A, D. When did, and I believe it was Francisco, who was the first to observe? The factually, what's interesting is not the repeating segments. It's the seemingly uninteresting segments in between them that are different. Exactly. So this Christopher repeats. They had this conserved A sequence. And this A, of course, repeats many, many times. So it's the most obvious thing. And usually, when we are looking at things, we look for things that have the strongest signal. So you have 20, 30 repeats of the same sequence. That's the strongest signal there is. But it turns out that is not an interesting part. The interesting part is actually the non-repeating sequences that's interspaced between pairs of these repeats. So Francisco, Francisco Mojica, he's a Spanish researcher. He's been looking at bacteria and looking at their weird sequences for a long time. And what he did back in the early 2000s is that he took these non-repeats sequences and he just searched against viruses in the bacterial world. And a few of them, he found matched virus sequences. And so that was really a breakthrough. Because it started to highlight that maybe these non-repeating sequences are foreign to the bacteria. They came from somewhere else. And somehow bacteria acquired them into these repeat patterns. And that really started to launch the CRISPR revolution. Because that observation and that inference allowed people to start to realize that maybe this has something to do with how bacteria and the viruses are interacting with each other. Yeah, what's interesting when you, again, look at that story is that when he tried to publish that finding, it was rejected by virtually every significant journal out there. They viewed this as either incorrect, uninteresting, whatever. It was ultimately published, although I don't recall the name of the journal that first published that finding. But it was many runs below nature, science, et cetera. The irony of science sometimes. So maybe folks, we can remind them just how the human immune system works. Because just like bacteria, we are also encountering viruses all the time. Viruses do nothing good for us just as they do nothing good for bacteria. Right? You know, we have a pretty negative relationship with viruses. All they want to do is use us as host to replicate their, their genomic material in the process. They tend to make us sick. So obviously when a virus infects a bacteria, it's just using its genetic machine to re-eplicate and it's going to kill the bacteria. So as you said, the bacteria needs a tool to fight back. Now, we do it through the creation of antibodies. But how did this story continue to unfold? What were the bacteria doing? Or what more to the point? What did Francisco realize was happening with this artifact, left behind of viral DNA? In the early days of CRISPR research, there were actually several different converging lines of work. So there's Francisco Mojica who's looking at these repeat sequences within the bacterial genome. But then there are also other researchers who began to zero in on a group of genes. So these are things that are telling the bacteria to make certain types of protein. There are these certain genes that are right next to their repeats. And it took a while for people to begin to associate the genes and the repeat to be together as one single system. But the people who are studying the genes realized that these genes were carrying nucleases. So nucleases are proteins that usually go and cut up either DNA or RNA. And so they initially thought that maybe these genes were involved in DNA repair. So for example, Eugene Kunen, who is a really brilliant bi-informatician, he's been studying these genes. And he really started to zero in on what biologically these genes may be doing. But the linkage with these repeats took a little while longer to get associated. But it was really when the discovery that there are these viral sequences in the repeats. And that there are these genes that are associated with the repeat that are involved in DNA cleavage that started to really put together a framework for thinking that maybe this is a system where these viral sequences are working together with the DNA cleavage proteins to go and recognize viral sequences and try to cleave a virus sequences. And we can put some names on these things so that people can start to see where the thing is going. So you talked about these genes that were near, but at a distance from both the palendromic repeats and the inner-spaced segments that we now realize were copies of viral DNA. And as you said, they coded for proteins or enzymes called nucleases which cut DNA. And similarly, we have helicases, right? So you have certain enzymes that can unwind the DNA so that they can go and cut. And these were referred to as CRISPR-associated proteins, correct? Which is abbreviated as CAS. So was CAS one and CAS two the first that were identified in that regard? That's exactly right. So these genes that are right next to the CRISPR-Ve-P's that are called CAS proteins. Although they probably underwent many, many different green naming over the course of two decades. But eventually, the community researchers were studying CRISPR-P proteins and CRISPR RNA, they came together and started to really curate these different genes. And so CAS one, CAS two, CAS three, CAS four, et cetera. These are things that are kind of number based on part, the order that they would discover. So the most popular protein is, or the most widely used protein now, it's called CAS nine. And this is one of the CAS proteins that are found among array of many, many different CRISPR-P proteins. And so yeah, so these CAS proteins work with the CRISPR RNA. And CRISPR RNA refers to these repeats, which are encoded in DNA, but they are made by bacteria into RNA. And those RNA are called CRISPR RNA. And they don't encode protein. They simply are a short guide sequence that directs the CAS protein to find the target virus sequence. And so CAS protein, CRISPR RNA, they together form a complex that go and provide defense function for the bacteria. And whereas our defense against a virus is going to be making an antibody and or activating another type of immune cell with an antigen receptor on it called the T cell, the defense of the bacteria is simply to cut the genetic material of the virus to kill the virus. Obviously, a much more directed approach. Let's walk through two scenarios. First infection reinfection. And explain the difference between how the bacteria defends itself with special attention to the use of the CRISPR system and the CAS9 enzyme. Sure. So first of all, first infection now. Out of the gate, you're an E. coli. I'm a bacteria phase. You've never seen me before. I've just injected my viral DNA into you. So CRISPR is an adaptive immune system. So this system can evolve with a bacteria to be able to accommodate many, many virus infections. So when the virus, which is called a bacterial phase, first infects the bacteria, it will inject its genetic information into the bacteria. The virus is usually very powerful and very potent. It will probably wipe out most of the bacterial population. But for very small number of cells, maybe one out of a million, the CRISPR system will successfully recognize a piece of the DNA of the virus and begin to insert it into this repeat area in the CRISPR system. And how long a piece is that typically? How many nucleotides in that piece? It's usually 30 letters long. And that is enough for the bacteria to uniquely recognize the virus. So anyway, so during the first infection, in the most bacteria die, very, very small number of them begin to acquire a snippet of the genetic information of this virus. And the insert it into CRISPR system. So those bacteria that survived have now acquired immunity against these viruses. And in the process of surviving, what do they have to rapidly do to fend off that first viral infection? Well, so the bacteria has many different defense systems in addition to CRISPR. So in fact, CRISPR is not the first line of defense. There are other things that are also very powerful technologies now that are restriction in the nucleotides. These are proteins or enzymes that bacteria use. They don't adapt, so they don't evolve. But they recognize fixed letter sequences. And sometimes these will always be activated first and try to fend off the virus. But if it doesn't, there are a host of other defense systems and one of these will eventually work. But unfortunately for the bacterial population, these things don't come in quick enough. And that's why most of the cells die. But the few where these things weren't able to keep out with the virus, that's what allows a CRISPR system to begin to acquire the genetic information. So now let's talk about that subsequent infection. So we've obviously, through a very Darwinian mechanism, selected a subset of the E. coli in this case that indeed are able to not just survive with their first and second line defense against the bacteria phased, but now they've also developed the memory. So to speak, the way we would use the term. So now it's a month later. The same page comes along, infects you. Inserts its genetic material, but now you actually have interspersed between your CRISPR repeats. You actually have the 30 nucleotides that match a sequence within that virus. So now, how do you spring into action to resist this infection? Exactly. So after the first infection, in the way the bacteria has been vaccinated against this virus. So the second time when this virus comes around, it will injects its genetic information into the bacteria. But now the bacteria in the CRISPR repeat area has a signature of this virus. So the repeat area will get turned on and it will start to make CRISPR RNA that carry a 30-based parallel or 20-based parallel guide that's able to recognize the incoming virus. So the CAS protein will bind to these CRISPR RNA. They will go and try to search along all the DNA sequences in the bacteria. When it finds a match in the viruses DNA, it will activate the nucleos and it will cut the DNA. And approximately how many base pairs are in viral DNA? Depends on the virus, they can be small, maybe 10,000 letters, or they can be long, 100,000 or even longer. Which again, just for context, so people understand, we have about 3 billion, right? So we're still talking about tiny, tiny, tiny amounts of DNA. And by the way, does it differ if it's an RNA virus versus a DNA virus as the process identical? It's very similar. So the reinfection tends to make pretty quick work. Because now once the bacteria is able to make the CAS protein, which it can make really quickly, it makes the, in between the CRISPR segment, it makes the RNA segment to guide it and match it. And really that's kind of a CRISPR RNA plus a truncated sort of other version of an RNA that holds the RNA in the CAS protein. Correct? And like we guess we call that whole thing the guide RNA. How quickly can that CAS9 enzyme holding the guide RNA? How quickly in actual time does it go through the entire sequence of viral DNA until it finds its place to land and cleave? That process probably pretty fast. I don't know exactly how quick it is. But also it's important to recognize that in a single bacteria, there are many, many copies of the CAS9, along with the guide RNA. And so that means once the virus comes in, there are many, many copies of CAS9 that are simultaneously in parallel, searching against the virus DNA to see whether or not there's a match. And this is why the system is so powerful, because it's able to, you know, very quickly in a parallel fashion, find the match and then inactivate the virus. With a minute, with a minute. Yeah, and there's something else that is pretty unique about where those cuts take place. When we bring in the viral memory, it always begins with three particular nucleotides. What's the significance of that? Right. So what you're talking about is what CRISPR scientists call Pam sequence, PAM, or proto-spacer, Jason Motiv, just a jargon. What is significant about that is that it is a sequence that is only found in the bacterial viruses genome, but not in the bacteria genome. So when the bacteria acquires a piece of the virus sequence and sticks it into its own genome, one question is, couldn't the CRISPR system go and recognize the virus's own genome now? The bacteria. Yeah, the bacteria. The bacteria genome. And be able to cut the bacteria. And be able to cut the bacteria. It's going to like, couldn't you turn the weapon on yourself and cut your own DNA and kill yourself? Exactly. Yeah, so how does it avoid this self-targeting or auto-immunity against itself? And this is where the PAM sequence comes in. The PAM sequence is in the viral genome. It's right next to the sequence that is acquired into the CRISPR system, but it itself is not acquired into the bacteria genome. And so what you see in the bacterial genome's CRISPR repeat is just the recognition sequence, but no pen. And so Cas9 requires the PAM to activate recognition, cleavage. And so without the PAM, it doesn't cleave itself, but it's still able to target the virus. So, thank you. Does this bring us more or less up to speed with the state of the art when you turn your attention to how can I create a finer resolution for gene editing for my optogenetics problem? Is this about where the state of the art was? Yeah, so I started to work at MIT and it brought the Institute in 2011. And so when I first started, I went to a scientific presentation, and they were talking about CRISPR. And they mentioned that CRISPR are nucleases, because I was thinking about nucleases and gene editing at a time. When I heard that word, it just kind of got me interested. And so I went down to Wikipedia, and looked at what CRISPR is. And Francis Mojica and Sivay Mojniu and Rodal Berrengu, they had just published the very early studies on the Cas9 system. Back then, it was still called Cas5. It was only later on, it renamed to be Cas9. But there was all these papers that, if you read them, there aren't too many of them. You can piece together an information, and you can get a sense that this is the RNA guided DNA targeting and cleaving enzyme. And at a time, there were other gene editing systems that were being worked on by researchers in the field, something called Zinc Finger, New Cleas, or Talon. And these are systems that use protein to recognize DNA, but not using RNA to recognize DNA. So maybe let's talk a little bit about both of those, because they were the state of the art up until 15 years ago. And I want to understand both how they work, and why they may not have been sufficient for your application. In other words, why are you looking for something beyond two techniques that already existed? Sure. So when I first became interesting gene editing in the sort of late 2000s, there were people already developed in gene editing technologies. In fact, there were multiple iterations of technologies that came around. There's something called Megan New Cleas, which was very, very early. And then what got me excited was a New York Times article. I think it was 2008 or 2009. It talked about a system called Zinc Finger New Cleas. There's a company in California that's called Sanamo Biosciences. And they were already developing Zinc Finger New Cleas for gene therapy to be able to go and edit DNA and treat disease. But Zinc Finger was a really challenging system for scientists to adapt and use, because it required very sophisticated protein engineering. The way it works is that Zinc fingers are protein domains. They're just one glob of protein. Each finger, each Zinc finger, can recognize three letters of DNA. And they occur in nature. So you can find them in naturally occurring DNA binding proteins called transrofen factors. And they allow transrofen factors to go and recognize different genes in the genome to modulate their activity. Either turn them on or turn them off, or change how much they are expressing the cell. But how do you get specificity when you are only recognizing three nucleotides? The probability of those three nucleotides showing up seems pretty likely across the genome, right? Right, exactly. So nature has solved this problem by forming Zinc Finger arrays. So they tether multiple fingers together. And all of them have to hit their target of three nucleotides. Right, that's right. So if you have an array of three fingers, they recognize nine letters. If you have a array of six fingers, and that's 18 letters. So you're going to complicate a genome like our genome with three billion letters, 18 would give us uniqueness. So 18 can allow you to find, or define just a single position. And that's because four to the power of 18 is a big enough number. It's bigger than three billion. Yeah, okay. So let's now talk about the talons. Why, first of all, what is that technique? And why was that not necessarily going to serve your purpose? Right. So the challenge with Zinc Finger is that you have a engineered finger to recognize different combinations three letters. And you have to make sure that when you tether them together to make a Zinc Finger array, they can recognize what you intend to recognize in that multiple three fashion. That turned out to be really cumbersome, and usually it doesn't work very well. So then this other system that you mentioned called transcription activator like Effector T-A-L-E, nucleosodevalent. So these systems can also from bacteria. They came from a specific pathogenic bacteria called Zincimonus or Rizzi. So it lives on rice plants, and it's a major rice pathogen. The way these proteins work is that they're injected by the bacteria that's trying to colonize the plant into the plant cell. And once you get inside, it homes in to the genome of the plant cell, finds the gene, and then starts to turn it on. When it turns it on, it allows the bacteria to, it allows the plant to become more susceptible to the bacterial colonization. And so it allows the bacteria to be able to more successfully survive on this whole plant. So it's a major pathogenic system. But what is really cool about talents or tales is that they recognize DNA in a very programmable fashion. These proteins, they have repeat domains, justizing fingers that form a ray. But individual domains recognize single DNA letters. And so you can find these tail proteins in the bacteria that have 12 or 16 or even 20 different repeats. And so they can recognize long stretches of 12 or 16 or 18 or 20 DNA letters in the plant genome. Plengino is also large. There are sometimes two, three times the size of our genome. So recognizing long sequences is important for achieving precision. And so that was the tail system. So what is really cool is that all the bones who is a researcher in Germany, and also Adam Bogdanova, who is a researcher in Iowa, and I was at the time. They discovered that there is a specific code for how these tail proteins recognize DNA. It turns out that within each one of these repeats, there are two amino acid letters that correspond with a specific DNA letter that it binds to. And so if you take any tail protein and you just dial in different combinations of these two amino acids in each one of the domain, you can specify what DNA sequence this tail protein is able to recognize. So it turns out to be much more easy to use of then-sing fingers. So were you satisfied with that? Or, I mean, obviously you weren't. You were sitting there looking up Wikipedia for what CRISPR is when you heard about it. So something must have said to you, this is good as the talons aren't as much as they're an improvement over zinc fingers. They're still not good enough. Why was that? Why were they not good enough? So zinc fingers were really hard to use. And one way I tried to engineer it, it was very hard, very difficult, almost impossible for just a single researcher to get something that would recognize the DNA sequence that you're trying to get it recognized. So it was very hard to use. Talons, on the other hand, were easier. But the repetitive nature of these proteins made it quite cumbersome to engineer new proteins to recognize the sequence you're trying to edit. So for example, if you wanted to be able to modify a specific gene, it could take you maybe several weeks, or even a couple of months to be able to successfully make one of these tail proteins. And when you do that, usually a work's been not always. And sometimes it's not very effective. Is that because it's so difficult to predict the folding structure of the protein, even if you know it's sequence? Like why would it take that long? It's long because from a technical perspective, these sequences are just very hard to work with. They are very prone to, because they're very similar to each other, they're prone to recombination. So in order to get a tail to work, you have to, in a very precise way, put every dummy in the correct order, because if you're trying to recognize AGTC, you have to put it together, AGTC, you can have AC, GT, it just wouldn't work. So to put repetitive sequences together, and light them up in exactly the order you want, that is really challenging to do. OK. It's possible, but it's very challenging. So it's very interesting. I think it's worth just sort of taking a step back. I mean, if most people can sort of remember that they were thinking 10 years ago, 12, 15 years ago. And the human genome was sequenced nearly 25 years ago. And the promise of gene therapy was sort of hailed as right around the corner. And yet here we are, a decade, more than a decade, after the sequencing of the human genome, and it doesn't appear that gene therapy through gene editing was any closer than it really was from a practical standpoint, a decade earlier. I think that's a bit of a disconnect for people. I think most people, necessarily aren't in a lab, would be surprised to understand that simply knowing what the sequence of genes are. I mean, hey, we've talked about this a lot in the podcast. We still have no idea what most of these genes do anyway. We have no idea why there are coding segments and the majority of the DNA is non-coding segments. And yet some of these non-coding segments are where mutations exist that result in disease. I mean, all the stuff still a bit of a mystery. But here you're sort of getting at this central, or maybe the most important or jugular question, which is, if a person has a disease, like cystic fibrosis, or sickle selenemia, where we really know in unambiguous terms, where on the DNA, where in the gene this lies, where in the DNA, we know what the substitution is. We know which C was turned into a G or a T. And all we need to be able to do is go in there and fix it. That was something we couldn't do 10 years ago. I think for many people that's quite surprising. And I know that that's not the problem you were trying to solve, but it's obviously the world you've created. So let's talk about the steps down that road. So you figure out what CRISPR is. You bring yourself up to the state of our discussion today. What's the next thing? The next thing is a CRISPR? The next thing that you're starting to know pursue, I mean, how are you now going about solving your problem for your good? Because I'm guessing at this point, you're still sort of, like at what point do you realize you're working on a problem that has a far bigger application than just solving your problem? I think pretty quickly, since I started working on gene editing, because the human genome was, the human genome project was completely early 2000s. And with the human genome having been sequenced, and then also with DNA sequencing technology becoming cheaper and faster, scientists were able to start sequence many, many more genomes. And so they can start to make comparisons between healthy individuals and also people who are affected by specific diseases to see what's different between their genomes. And by doing that comparison, they can identify the differences that may be causal for disease. And so, you know, two-date based on genetic analysis, researchers have probably identified more than 5000 genetic mutations that have a direct causative of a real disease. And so these are called genetic diseases. They are usually affecting a small population of individuals that are not as common as things like cancer or diabetes or these, what people call complex or complicated diseases. But nevertheless, these are the ones where we know they exact genetic cause. And so the tantalizing idea is then, if you know the mutation in the genome, why not just going fix it? And so that's where genetic DNA comes in. And people have since the very beginning been trying to realize this idea. They were trying to work on it using make-and-nucleases. They were trying to solve this using seeing finger nucleases. They were certainly trying to use a talent to also treat diseases this way. But the challenge is that they weren't very efficient. And it was also difficult to apply them to be able to treat the disease with sufficient amount of efficacy. When CRISPR came along, especially with Cas9, it was much easier to be able to design strategies to edit DNA. And that made it much more feasible for many, many groups to really start to work on this idea. So, were you finished with your postdoc and now starting your own lab? Yeah, I had just started my lab at MIT. Okay, so you've got how many PhDs in your lab? I probably had maybe 10 PhD students. Okay, and a couple of postdocs to boot. Yeah. And these people have all come to you presumably because they're interested in optogenetics. Yeah, they were interesting of different things. Okay. Yeah. So at what point do you come back into the lab and say I'm gonna hit pause on the optogenetics problem? I'm gonna kind of go down this CRISPR path for a while. I think when I first started my lab, I was already sort of focused on the gene editing process. I see. And so when students came to me, even though they came to me wanting to work out to genetics, I had to convince them that there's this other problem that is also interesting and maybe we can try to work together and make a difference there. And so I started to try to tell them about CRISPR, tell them about gene editing, all the potential applications. All right, so keep going down the story now. So it's the early 2010s, what are the next steps that you take to develop this technology? So when I started the work, so when I first started my lab, I was working on talents. And then very quickly, I had learned about CRISPR and I started to also sort of get CRISPR projects going in the lab. And we worked on both systems for a while at the same time. We pretty quickly realized that talents were difficult to use because of the cumbersome nature of how to make them. And then because of that, the promise of CRISPR was much more apparent. So maybe I'll give another analogy. So we now have a mobile phone and on a phone there are many different apps that help you book trips, that helps you send messages to your friends and family apps that allow you to take photos. You have a phone and a phone can do everything. You just load the app onto it. With talents or zinc fingers, the analogy would be, you have to build a different device for each one of these functions. So for each change, you have to need a different phone for each app. You just have hardware. Yeah, so for every gene or a target, you have to build a brand new protein to be able to target that gene. And that is very cumbersome and not very effective process. With CRISPR, the promise is that CRISPR is like the smartphone. You can load software onto it to recognize different genes. And the software is the CRISPR RNA. These RNAs are very easy to chemically synthesize. And you can define the gene by reading off the sequence of the gene, which is already completed through the human genome project. So all of that was just a step function improved over the zinc finger and talent technology. So anyway, so we realize that if we can make CRISPR work, not only in a bacteria, but put it into a human cell and get it to recognize things, genes in the human cell, then we can have a much more powerful, and much more democratized gene editing system. So what was the breakthrough that I set a breakthroughs that led to the utility of this? And did it start with, let's just silence a gene first? I mean, let's figure out how to go in and with precision bombing, silence one gene was at the first problem before the, let's actually take a strand of novel DNA and put it in. Right, so CRISPR is a natural nucleus. So in bacteria, it uses the guide RNA to recognize the virus DNA. And then once you recognize it, it will cleave the virus DNA. So make a double stranded DNA break. And so that's what we're trying to make happen in the human cell. We try to program Cas9 with a guide RNA to go and recognize the specific gene in a human genome and then we have to cut it. Which is valuable? I mean, there are certain cases where over expression of a gene is pathologic and if we silence a gene, we fix the disease. Exactly. And so there were a lot of studies done on how breaks in a DNA would get repaired. So Maria Jason, Gene Paber, they had studied maybe a couple of decades before that, how DNA repairs would get processed. And so what they found is that when you make a cut in the DNA, so when you make a break, it will activate repair processes in our cell. So in fact, our DNA is getting DNA breaks all the time. And we have a robust process to be able to fix them to improve the mutations. So anyway, so what Maria Jason and Gene Paber found is that if you make a cut in the DNA, that cut will activate one of two different repair processes. The first repair process will glue the DNA together usually correctly, but in a very, very small number of instances, it will introduce a mistake. And that mistake will inactivate the gene. So it will no longer make the protein product that is supposed to make. And this is very useful. If you wanted to inactivate something in the cell, sometimes there are mutations that are deleterious. And if you can inactivate that deleterious mutation, then you can make the cell healthy again. And so that was a very powerful method. The second repair process is called homology-directed repair, HDR. And this relies on a template DNA that carries the sequence they are trying to repair with. And so if you make a cut, and you also provide a template DNA, then the repair process will copy whatever that's on a template into the DNA break site. And this is a more powerful way to be able to change the DNA sequence in the design fashion. Is there a risk when you cut the DNA and it repairs that it repairs in a manner that remains pathologic, even if it's distinct from the path that was already there? It is possible, but the probability is much, much lower. OK. What about kind of the Holy Grail, which is to literally edit a new gene to put something in that didn't exist? What was required to take that leap? Yeah. So there are different ways that you may want to change the DNA sequence. You may want to inactivate something, you may want to delete something, and you may want to insert something. So to do each one of these, you need to have a machinery that will allow you to do that. So the Holy Grail would be to be able to insert a gene into anywhere you want precisely and also very efficiently. And today, that ability is still not quite there yet. We're still working on, and many other groups are working on developing technologies to make that happen with high enough efficiency. We can do it now with very low level, maybe less than a percent, or maybe just single digit percent. But for a big gene that we're trying to put in, we don't have a good way to do that yet. OK. So currently, is it possible to snip DNA anywhere you want with the current technology? Yeah. With CRISPR, we can pretty much target throughout the genome and the M.A. cuts. So what diseases are currently amenable to that type of gene therapy? And we'll put aside the regulatory stuff, which we can talk about. But if we were dealing, if we pretended that humans were laboratory animals, where we could do an experiment and actually do this, what are some of the diseases that we could directly affect in that manner? So there are a lot of genetic diseases where there is a mutation that is pathogenic. Over expression. Well, in this case, over expression, if you want to deactivate it, but some would be under expressive course. Yeah. So these are genes that are usually important for the body, but there's a mutation in it. And that makes the resulting protein, the mutant protein, the deleterious for the patient. And so if you can inactivate these genes, then you can treat these. So for example, there are diseases in the liver, where there are certain proteins that cause embryo doses, and that can lead to serious problems. And so by using CRISPR, you can go in and cleave these genes, inactivate them so that it no longer produce these toxic gene product. Huntington is another example, where there are mutations that are occurring in the gene that makes the gene deleterious. And so if you can go and try to inactivate these deleterious mutations, it may be possible to treat the disease. Is it generally the case that autosomal dominant diseases are an over expression problem, or an expression of something harmful problem, whereas recessive diseases are the opposite, where you tend to not be producing enough or something of that. Is that a, is that a, yeah, it's a really simplistic, but, yeah, if that's a good explanation. So many people are probably familiar with Huntington's, because it is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases imaginable, perhaps second, only two Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS. But unlike ALS, where we don't really know the ideology, we clearly know the ideology of Huntington's disease, which is a gene, right? It's a genetic disease. It's an autosomal dominant gene. And, sadly, it doesn't present until later in life, so many times individuals will pass this gene on prior to the symptoms being manifest, and therefore they go on to suffer the fate of this disease having already passed it on. So what can tell us a little bit about Huntington's disease and why it may or may not be amenable to this type of treatment? So Huntington's disease is caused by mutations in the gene called Huntington, and this is a gene that's expressing the brain. And in mutated form, this gene accrues an expansion of repeat sequences within the gene. And the longer the repeat is, the more deleterious it is for the patient. And so the idea would be to try to shorten these repeats, or maybe if you can reduce the amount of repeat the sequence of the RNA that's expressed, you could also get a cell to be healthier. The challenges are the repeats happen within the coding region of the gene. So the region that is important for making the protein sequence. So in order to make the resulting edit successful, you have to do it very precisely. You cannot delete, you have to delete exactly three letters at a time from the repeat sequence. Otherwise, you will shift the frame. And the gene remind me has how many base pairs? The gene has thousands of base pairs. Okay, so the huge gene. And these repeats can also be several hundred or maybe a thousand repeats long. And so you want to be able to delete them very precisely. So that is one challenge. The other challenge is to be able to deliver the gene editing machine raising to the brain and get to themselves. And there are some virus-based technologies that are coming along, but still we don't have probably the most suitable method yet. So let's talk about delivery a little bit. How do you do this? So we now have this idea, hopefully people can wrap their head around this somewhat challenging idea of what CRISPR is. And maybe we can again just sort of summarize it, right? You have a CRISPR vehicle, right? It would be a Cas9 protein. And you also have a guide RNA that is made up of both the piece that you actually want to put in, wrapped around another sort of tracer piece that holds it firmly in the Cas9 protein. That Cas9 protein, by the way, does it require its own helicase to open it? No, it can do it itself. Beautiful. So it's a one-man shop that runs up the host DNA opening it and waiting to find its match. And it waits and waits and then it finds its match, holds the strands of DNA at the Cas9 and then clip. And obviously, if you then put in something, you can sort of, so how do you actually deliver the Cas9 protein to an individual? Right, so that is really the big challenge. So right now, there are clinical applications of CRISPR for treating different diseases. Diseasing the blood like sickosell disease or disease in the liver, disease in the eye and many other places. And so depending on where you're trying to deliver CRISPR into, there are different technologies that people use. So let's take the, maybe the simplest might be in the blood. OK, so tell people what sickle cell anemia is and why it's amenable to this type of therapy. Right, so sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation that causes the blood cell to sickle. So they form a sickle form. And so they are not able to sort of, you know, property function and sometimes they can aggregate and then this can cause occlusion in the blood vessel and can cause serious problems. And so these replicials are made by progenitor or stem cells in the body that produce these replicials. And so one idea for treatment. And it's a simple mutation. It's a simple, it's a single point mutation. That changes one amino acid. That's right. One amino acid based on one base pair of chains. Can't remember what it is. It's an alanine to a glycine or something. It's quite trivial. Yeah. Is what leads to all of this bad, this downstream badness you talk about. But now, so current treatment for these patients is blood transfusions. I mean, it's an awful disease. And these patients experience an unbearable pain. As an aside, some might ask, why does this disease exist? Why didn't Darwin get rid of this? Well, it turns out there's an advantage to having the trait. For malaria. Right. So it turns out that if you have one copy of the sickle gene and the other one is normal, you have normal looking red blood cells. You don't get the disease, but you actually get protection, as you said, from malaria. So that would keep this propagating, particularly in a malaria rich area like Africa. This is why it's much more prevalent in a black population than a white population, because it offered some benefit. But if you have two copies of the gene, you get the sickling. Those are not the people that are passing on their genes historically. They would have perished before reproduction. And also just perished in a great deal of pain. But nevertheless, here we are today. So OK, you have to be able to go into the bone marrow to make this change, because there's no point in doing this if you have to do this every week. You want to do it one and done, right? On the right. Yeah. So one of the promises of gene editing is that it can provide a single treatment that is a cure for the disease. And so in the case of sickle cell, what happens is that the doctor will mobilize the stem cells, the bone marrow cells from the patient, get them to come out and be able to harvest these bone marrow cells. And they don't necessarily do this with a bone marrow as per it, they do it by giving them medications that cause them to secrete more progenitor cells into the plasma. That's right. This is the current zirpractice in the medical field. OK. And so they will get the patient harvest their bone marrow cells. And these cells are going to be sort of modified in the laboratory where researchers will take the RNA, the messenger RNA, for Cas9. So this will allow the cell to produce the Cas9 protein. And they will also take the Gaid RNA. Maybe just tell folks really quickly sorry to interrupt you, fun. But maybe just explain really quickly for people the relationship of doing DNA, RNA, messenger RNA, protein. It's the central dogma. But that way, when you say what you're about to say, they'll know why it works. Yeah. So there are different ways to get a protein to the cell. And the way that proteins are made in the cell is that they're encoded in DNA. And the DNA has to be transcribed into messenger RNA. And that RNA is then translated by the ribosome into the protein. And so if you can put into a cell, either the DNA the gene for Cas9 or the messenger RNA for Cas9 or the protein for Cas9, the cell will eventually have Cas9. Because if you put in the DNA, the cell will start to make mRNA based on it. And then mRNA will get translated into the protein. Or if you put in mRNA, But how do you put it in the DNA? Isn't that the whole problem that we're trying to solve? Right. So there are different ways to put these things in. So for DNA, you can just use a virus. If you're working with cells in the petri dish, you can directly elect to operate the DNA into the cell. And this is done by zapping the cell with the electrical current. It will rupture the membrane. When the membrane ruptures, things can be can. So you can't DNA the cell cell. When the cell membrane ruptures, the DNA that's outside the cell will flow into the inside the cell and get into the cell. And this is actually how people treat psychosalt disease. Except they're not putting DNA into the cell. They're putting mRNA. So they incubate these bone marrow stem cells that have the psychosalt mutation in the bath of mRNA for Cas9 and the guide RNA. And the guide RNA. And the separate. These are separate. OK. Separate. And it's amazing that once those cells acquire both the mRNA for Cas9 and the mRNA that is called the RNA. Yeah. It will translate into a Cas9 protein. Yes. It doesn't translate guide RNA into a protein. It just stays there and they find each other. That's right. And again, it is so remarkable to me that biology, it's so remarkable to me that anything works in this universe. But that's up there is one of those things that kind of just amazing. Well, this is really the result of the biotechnology revolution, the molecular biology discoveries that have really under to repay the biotechnology revolution. And now what is the efficiency of that process? So once you go ahead and put those two bits of very different RNA into the proximity of these bone marrow cells, this can be quite efficient. So in the laboratory or in these petri-dish settings, this can be approaching 100%. OK. So now within a very short period of time, you have cut out and also reinserted the, it's just a single base pair. So what are they doing? What's the exact thing you're asking Cas9 to do here? Actually, for a single cell, the treatment that has recently been approved in the last year is actually different. OK. And the way the treatment works is that for sickle cell patients, it's been found that for some individuals who have the sickle cell mutation, if they also carry another mutation, or if they somehow is able to express the fetal version of hemoglobin, then their sickle cell symptoms are much, much less. And so for treating sickle cell patients with geneticity, the therapy actually goes and modifies a different gene, sort of modulates this expression to then allow the fetal hemoglobin gene to turn on. And why is that in easier solution than simply changing the 1 amino acid that's broken in the first place? Because the way it works is that it simply makes a cut. And it doesn't be fire. It doesn't have a change here. That's right. I see. So we're still at the point where in vitro, we're still better off with a cleavage, just a straight cut of the DNA, then even a single base pair switch to fix one amino acid. That latter is a harder problem. The latter is a harder problem, but there's also very good progress on that front. So for example, David Liu developed a methodology. Yeah, also. Yeah. Is a colleague of mine, and he developed a technology called base editing. And base editing allows you to use Cas9. You get rid of the DNA cleaving activity of Cas9. And so it simply goes and binds to the DNA. So you use it as kind of a guidance system to direct a different enzyme, cut of the aminoates, and to be able to go and chemically modify a single base. It's amazing to me, Fung, that that is easier than what we just wish we could do, which is change that C to a G. Take out the C, make it a G. And that will give me the amino acid. I want the fact that we're chemically having to modify it with a Daminase. What do you think is necessary to take this next? Because we've already had, as you described, that a big step function from where we were 10 years ago. What's going to be required for the next step function, for the science fiction to start? Yeah. So I think this really goes back to the vision of genetic medicine. Genetic medicine is very powerful. CRISPR is a part of it. But it is really a two component system. There is the medicine itself, and there's also the delivery technology. So you have the right vehicle for delivery and the right payload to be able to treat the disease in the right cell. And we're limited more on the delivery than they are. So the payload technology has come a long way. No, we now have mRNA. We have Cas9. We have base editing. We have prime editing. We have a lot of different types of editing technology. And even epigenetic editing. But the bottleneck is how do we put these really powerful payloads into the right cells, in the right tissue, in the body? Say those again, what were our tools Cas9 base per editing? Yeah, we have Cas9. We have base editing. We have prime editing. We have different recommended phases. We have epigenetic modifiers that also are based on Cas9. We have mRNA. We have SIRNA. We have a lot of different things that can modulate in modified cells. Yeah, I want to actually come back and talk about the epigenetic modification using Cas9. So it's not a payload problem. It's a delivery problem. And it's also a biological problem. Right, because many diseases will not be amenable to this. So I'm sure everybody thinks, well, Peter, we've heard you say that cancer is a genetic disease. Does that mean that once we solve the delivery problem, we solve cancer? Why is that not necessarily true? And that is because cancer is caused by many different risk mutations in the cell. And so it's difficult to treat cancer by correcting the mutation. Because you really have to be able to correct at a very, very high efficiency. If you have a few cells, a few cancer cells that have not been corrected, those cells will continue to divide and replicate in form tumors and even massacize. And so that is really challenging. But the people are using gene editing in their cancer therapeutic context. What they're doing is that they are using gene editing to engineer immune cells so that the immune cells are more potent and recognizing a killing cancer cells. And this is part of what's called immunotherapy. Everybody's talking about AI. Does AI enable this any better on either side, on the payload side, or on the delivery side? AI is very powerful for protein engineering. In the past few years, there's been amazing breakthrough in the use of AI for predicting protein structures. Each protein is made of a unique sequence of immunosensis. And the unique sequence allows the protein to fold into a specific shape. And one of the holy grail problems for a long time has been how do you take just the letters of a protein and predict what the shape of the protein looks like? And this is something that many may scientists have worked out for a long time, but hasn't been able to come up with a good solution. But it was really in 2021, the use of AI by this group called DeepMind that was able to come up with a solution called AlphaFo2. And AlphaFo2 is an AI-based system that has learned from all of the structures that the protein is that scientists have experimentally determined. And when they solved those structures, there's a huge database at them. And they were able to use AI to look at all of them and learn from that large database to then come up with a prediction system called AlphaFo2. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing to me. Maybe just explain to people again. So let's pick a pick your favorite protein. How many amino acids are in the primary sequence? We can pick the green-fly simplicity from jellyfish. Maybe 300 amino acids. 300. It's a relatively small protein. Yeah. OK. So it has a primary structure, which is like what are the actual amino acids? Right. It has a secondary structure, which is like, well, when does it actually form a helix? When does it form a sheet? It has a tertiary structure, which is kind of like how it starts to bend. And then it has this quaternary structure, which is how the whole thing fits together. It's complicated three-dimensional folds. Exactly. What you said a moment ago is if a scientist wants to make a protein, and they know what it needs to look like, they kind of know what the quaternary structure is. Like, I got to get this protein. I got to design a molecule that fits in that receptor. It's almost a trial and error problem to go from the primary sequence to that. You're saying that AI is really good at doing this thing where it knows the relationship between primary sequence and final quaternary structure. Is that just literally linear regression at a level we've never understood it because humans can't do it? But is it basically just solving the world's most complicated linear regression problem? I think at a very fundamental level that is what is happening. But the human brain we can't process so much data, very effective, but you can have these masses, that's where that can really process this. Let's go back to animal models for a moment. You touched briefly on the idea of a transgenic mouse. And again, people who have listened to this podcast for years are no stranger to the transgenic mouse. So many amazing breakthroughs in science have come through these. And frankly, just through genetic understanding of mice, making changes to a mouse gene, we recently had Dina Dubal on the podcast. We talked about Clotho to me one of the interesting proteins out there. And of course, we learned the story of how Clotho came about. And it, you know, silencing a gene, found this thing, overexpress the gene, found this thing. Okay, how this CRISPR enabled that today has it changed the ability of people working on totally other problems to get their quicker using laboratory animals. Right, so the transgenic mouse technology really revolutionized biology. And when the transgenic mouse technology was developed, the way it worked is that you would start with stem cells for mice. You would modify these stem cells. And you put the stem cells back into a embryo. And then you transplant the embryo into a mouse so that embryo can develop into a full in developing the feeders and then the newborn as a new mouse. That is a very long process. And the one stem mouse is born, usually that mouse does not have 100% of that genetic modification. So the mouse is called a mosaic. And then you have to take that mouse and breed the mouse again with another mouse and hoping that... That the mosaic part is the one that gets expressed. And you basically try to concentrate the mosaic portion of it. Exactly. So we use this methodology. It can take probably a year or maybe even longer to be able to generate a specific transgenic mouse. So you used to take a long time to do this. But now with CRISPR technology, what people can do is they can directly inject the gene editing, cast nine, and guide our name into a embryo, into a single cell embryo, and the modified there. So again, this is so brilliant because we can't do this in humans, of course. I mean, we could, but that's a whole ethical discussion we should talk about. But we can directly do this. So we can make a transgenic mouse in one go. Exactly. So the mouse gestation period is 21 days. So after 21 days you have a transgenic mouse. What has this done to the field of biomedical research? It has accelerated biomedical research dramatically. So imagine yourself as a graduate student, and usually a PhD will take five years. If it takes you a lot of time, is the road work of transfecting mice and waiting for, yeah. Yeah. So if you have the way two years to get a mouse, so that you can begin your experiment. That is a long time. So now with CRISPR, or gene editing, you can get a mouse in two, three months. So let's play devil's advocate for a moment. When you did your PhD, you had to slog through the old fashion way. Were there hidden benefits of that? In other words, that it give you more time to read, more time to be curious, more time to fail. Again, it's a tangential discussion, but do you worry that with this remarkable precision tool that budding scientists are missing out on an experience that you and your entire generation and everyone before you had? Or do you think that that's a relatively small price to pay for the pace of development? I'm not too concerned about it. I think if we can accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, the acquisition of data, I think that will really help science move a lot faster. I think in the future, especially with higher throughput technologies, CRISPR, DNA sequencing, and many other things, together, we're going to be accumulating new data for biology at an exponential pace. And we're not only going to be relying on our own ability to analyze data, but we're going to have AI to help us. These large systems that can draw much, much larger regression analysis. And with that, I think biology, discovery, and disease treatment development will really accelerate. I think that's a really exciting future. Now, we've talked a lot about Cas9, but you've also specifically done quite a lot with another CRISPR associated protein called Cas13. What's the difference? And how does this potentially impact future work? Sure. CRISPR is a bacterial immune system, and there are many, many different types of CRISPR. And so in nature, bacteria are invaded by DNA viruses, by RNA viruses, all sorts of different viruses. Cas9 protects bacteria against DNA viruses. But then there also needs to be a CRISPR system that protects against RNA viruses. So Cas13 is the RNA analog of Cas9. It uses a guide RNA to recognize the RNA virus and then cleave the RNA genome. And what is really interesting about Cas13 is that unlike Cas9, it not only cleaves the recognize RNA, but once it recognizes a piece of RNA, it also turns on almost a suicidal function. It goes and cleaves any other RNA that's in the bacterial cell. And so in the infection cycle, you can think of this as a altruistic sort of system, when the Cas13 recognizes myself, has been affected by RNA virus, I would have shot myself down, killed itself, and saved the population. So hang on, why is that the case? If we, so why does this cell not choose to do that with the DNA virus? Are RNA viruses necessarily more lethal to bacteria? RNA is usually more abundant. And so usually there are many many, once the RNA gets produced, there are many copies. And so it's difficult to shut out every single copy of RNA. What is what DNA there is usually just one copy of DNA, saving a shut it down. So when a DNA virus infects a bacteria, so again, let's just talk about a very specific bacteria phase latches on the outside of an e-coli, it's going to shoot in the DNA. We've already talked at length about how that works and the role Cas9 plays in that. When a different bacterial phase comes along, you're saying it inserts a lot of RNA. No, so we're just the RNA replicates much quicker. RNA replicates quicker. Okay, so it inserts a small amount of RNA, but remind me why a small amount of RNA will be amplified much quicker than a small amount of DNA is it because it's one step less. It's already made to go in front of the translating ribosome. Exactly. Because DNA has to go to RNA to make protein. Makes sense. That go back to make DNA. So you're saying Cas 13 also has a suicide feature. And this suicide feature is actually quite useful for developing diagnostic technologies. And so especially during COVID, we use Cas 13 to develop a way to detect coronavirus RNA. And to provide it a way to have a simple and rapid detection method. So, same more about that. Was that really the first application? That was the first application. One of the first applications. How would that have been done before? And what was the speed and accuracy of it being done in that way? Right. So, so the most widespread method for diagnostic is using PCR. Yes. So it checks for the nucleic acid sequence. But PCR is a laboratory based test. It requires a machine called a PCR machine. Which is complicated to run. And you have to be in a laboratory environment to go through the test. What Cas 13 provided is something that's more similar to an antigen test where you can run it at a point of care or even potentially at home. And it was simply required to take a swab to have the sample. It makes the sample into a buffer. And then Cas 13 would react in that buffer to be able to detect a virus sequence. Then you load it onto a paper strip. It will run. And then you see whether or not a band shows up. Okay. When we think now about gene editing going forward. And again, we've already established that the payload is not the problem. It's the targeting and the delivery. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of Cas 9 versus Cas 13? And are there other Cas or CRISPR-associated proteins out there that might even be better than both of them? Sure. So, so Cas 9 and Cas 13 both have therapeutic applications. But one of the challenge is that they are large proteins. Cas 9 is 1,300 amino acids long. And Cas 13's are usually around 1,000 amino acids long. So they're fairly large proteins. And how long was Cas 9? 1,300 amino acids. And so in order to get Cas 9 into a cell, you have to be able to fit Cas 9 and the guide RNA into your delivery system. And if you're using viral vectors to deliver, they are usually very compact. And you can barely fit Cas 9. So then the nice thing is what if you have something that's smaller. And so we have also many other groups have worked on trying to discover new proteins that are more compact and more easily packageable. And there are some out there, but sometimes and usually they're not as specific or not as active as Cas 9. And so they're trade-offs to using some of those systems. And we're working on engineering them. And there's a lot of good progress turning those systems into a specific and the comparably active systems as Cas 9. So what would be, if you could wave a magic one, how big a Cas protein would you tolerate such that your Cas protein plus your guide RNA would easily fit into your delivery vehicle? Would you want to be half that size? And be 500 amino acids, do you need to be smaller than that? If you could shrink it down to 1000 base pairs, so 300 amino acids. That would be ideal. But I think that's challenging to do. Yeah, and let's maybe make sure I understand why, right? You're saying, look at the end of the day, I need a protein that has the structural integrity to hold the guide RNA in a place. Make its way down into the nucleus, open up the DNA. So it's basically two enzymes. It's a helicase and nucleicase. That nucleus. And it has to be able to march along the DNA, recognize while holding, you know, it's just, again, it's a mechanical problem if you really stop to think about it just on the smallest level. And then hold, cut, boom, insert eventually. And you're saying at some point, we just about the limits of physics. Like I need a certain amount of amino acids to make that structure. But it sounds to me like you're saying, you don't believe that that exists in protein. In exists in nature, you're not out there looking for a 300 amino acid Cas protein anymore. You're now going to say, let's use AI to help us build one. Well, there are natural forms of proteins that are small and are like Cas9. Oh, okay. In fact, in one of our projects trying to look for a small Cas9, we thought, let's look at the evolutionary origin of where Cas9 came from. And by tracing the evolutionary history of Cas9, we found that there is a very large family of protein called ISCB. That is the ancestral form of Cas9. ISCB is a very small protein. It's only about 450 amino acids. So it's about a third of the size of Cas9. And it does exactly what Cas9 does. It's got a helicase activity. It's got nucleos domains. And it also works with the RNA guide to recognize and cleave the DNA. But what is different between ISCB and Cas9 is that the guide RNA for ISCB is much much larger. So you're using it here and you got a PayPal. Exactly. And an RNA is not as stable, not as robust. It's more prone to degradation. Yeah, you don't want to go any bigger on guide RNA. Right. Yeah. So you need to best of both worlds. You need a Cas associated protein that is small. And you want to be able to keep the guide RNA small. Small. Right. That's a whole detail. Okay. And is it your prediction that that will have to be developed synthetically? I think through engineering. So it's not clear that such a compact system has been developed by a nature. But we can start from the shares Cas9 or ISCB as a scaffold and then begin to engineer. So what kind of race is on for that? Because I can't even fathom the commercial value of that. If there was a new protein called the Cas Alpha or Cas Omega, whatever, the synthetic version that was small enough to now easily deliver payload. This is a trillion dollar product. A lot of people are working on it. I think it's certainly going to be very, very useful. Is the lion's share of this work being done in universities? Or is it being done inside a biotech companies? Is that as in both places now? Yeah. Is this one of the biggest races going on in CRISPR biology today? I'm not sure this is the biggest race. I mean, there are a lot of other capabilities that we want to realize. Okay. For example, how do insert large genes into the genome precisely and efficiently? I think that is just as important for problem. Cas9, even though it's large, we can deliver it to some cells already. And so there's already. In vivo or only in VTVVVV? In vivo? What cells can be delivered in vivo using Cas9 currently? So liver? Okay. Yeah, liver is a place where we can use lippin' and oparticles to deliver Cas9 in guide into. You know, the co-wave vaccine is made using MRNA and lippin' and oparticle. And so it's a very similar approach where you formulate these lippis with the Cas9 and MRNA and guide RNA. And what is it about the liver that makes it amenable to a lippin' and oparticle? Lippin' there's a lot of lippin' recycling happening in the liver. And so we have a lippin' and oparticle. They get bound by these recycling proteins and they get taken up. Interesting. And this is, does it matter the manner in which it's given, intravenous, intramuscular, does it do all lipid nanoparticles and up there provided they're not ingested orally and presumably digested? A lot of it goes to liver. Yeah. Yeah. Because liver also, it's one of areas in our body that fills your out of the toxins. Yeah. And so everything gets trapped there. So in other words, if you were thinking about one of the rare inborn diseases of metabolism, these are the really rare diseases where children are born without a particular enzyme that allows them to be their metabolizes of a certain protein or glucose even for that matter. Do we think that we're on the cusp of being able to use, I don't want to suggest that Cas9 is primitive, but in the context of our discussion, we've realized it has some limitations. But do we think that the CRISPR Cas9 system is already good enough and sufficient to cure some of those diseases? For some of them, potentially, it will depend on a mutation whether or not we can use Cas9 or base-editing or primatiting to be able to fix the mutation. You have to figure out the payload problem. Right. And yeah. Yep. Okay. But if you're in the liver and it can be addressed by targeting a pathocytes in the liver, then the delivery problem is already sort of addressable. Okay. What about genetic diseases of the eye? That's also a place that's easy to reach. And you don't require systemic administration. What are the genetic conditions of the eye that might be amenable to this treatment as it stands today? Yeah. There are different eye diseases that are affected by single gene mutations. For example, LCA-10 is one of the eye diseases that there's already been a clinical CRISPR strategy being developed for. The way that these diseases in the eye are treated is by designing Cas9 and a guide RNA to be able to sort of knock out the gene that is causing degenerative conditions in the eye. And using a viral vector to deliver the Cas9 gene and also the guide RNA into a peculiarity into the patient. And so once the virus gets into the cells in the eye, they will make Cas9 and make the guide RNA. And then that will carry out the modification. So in that sense, it's a bit of the old meets the new, right? You're taking the oldest trick in the book that was the original original gene therapy, vehicle, the virus, and you're combining it with a far smarter payload, which is Cas9 and Guard guide RNA. Right. How are those where are those where do these stand in clinical trials right now? So the liver and the eye, which would obviously be the, you know, leading edge of this. Yeah. So the eye is the first place where in the US, a gene therapy was developed and approved. And so this is a draw called Lax Turner. And Lax Turner puts a gene into the eye to be able to treat the disease called LCA2. And so basically the virus provides a gene that is missing in the cells in the eye. And that is able to allow the patients to regain some licens of the ability. And so that was the first gene therapy. And these are patients that are completely blind without it. That's right. And then how much light sensitivity do they get once this gene is inserted? They get some so that they can kind of move around in the room with large obstacles. Wow. Yeah. And this is all done just through a single injection in the eye. A single injection. Wow. What are other ocular targets? So LCA10 is another one. That is being developed by Edith Hoss Medicine. And the way this disease is sort of developed is that there is a mutation that causes degeneration in the eye. And the idea is to use Cas9. Use the same viral vithur system to deliver into the eye. And have Cas9 inactivate this mutant gene so that it can slow down or stop degeneration. So LCA2 you have to put an active gene in that was missing. LCA was at 9, 12, 10. You have to deactivate a gene. That's right. Okay. And how where is that in clinical trials? What phases is that in? So it was through phase one too. I think there was there was the efficacy in phase two. There was some efficacy. What's the phenotype of this patient without gene therapy? Is it total blindness? Is it also blindness or deteriorating vision? So blind by what age? How do you 30s? Okay. Wow. Yeah. And then what did the phase two find how much I say where they were able to restore? They found that there's something to prove me of vision. But I think it was in Izobas as they had a four. Okay. Why do you think that is? Why do you think that these therapies are not fully restoring vision? In the case of the LCA, too, is it because by the time you treat these people, the neuroplasticity part of it has lost its window of development. In other words, is the problem that if you treat these people late in life, the part of the brain that receives the visual signal isn't developed or is it literally that we're just not fixing this in the right. Okay. You know, the red light doesn't regenerate. And so you have to be able to deal with, it's a vis-a-raided degenerating. You have to deal with what is what is left in the red. And so what you can restore is really kept by whatever that's already left there. And plus there's also any efficiencies in the delivery systems. You're not restoring 100% of the cells. And if you're layering on gene editing on top of it, which also has some sort of less than 100% efficiency, when you multiply that all together, that's why you're not getting sort of full restoration. So what would have to be true to fully restore vision in those patients? What set of things would have to be true therapeutically? I think it's only very hard to fully restore vision. So if you really want to fully restore vision, you probably have to regenerate the red light. So you have to replenish cells that are missing. Could that be done epigenetically? What do we know about the epigenome of the retina in the adult versus the infant? And do we know that if we could simultaneously, or even in two treatments, correct the genetic defect, but then return the epigenome to the milieu of embryogenesis, or early life, could that fix the problem? Could potentially work, although this is not my expertise, so I don't know all the processes involved there. But if you can recapitulate development in the eye, and allow cells to sort of redevelop the retina as it was developing in trained development, then potentially you can regenerate the eye. On the side of the liver, what has been the success rate of the Cas9 delivery system there? Or the lipid nanoparticle delivering the Cas9 payload to be more exact? The liver is quite robust. You can part of you get 80% in the liver. And that's sufficient to correct certainly any under expression, right? Right, right. In the liver, there's also an interesting development where scientists are trying to target a gene called PCSK9 to be the treat cardiovascular disease. And the idea there is, so they're going to use a lipid nanoparticle to put into, you're going to put in a new PCSK9 gene that's inactive, or you're just going to deliver a vehicle that paralyzes PCSK9. Yeah, the strategy is to paralyze PCSK9, so that you can inactive a PCSK9 and then reduce cholesterol. Any idea how much a treatment like that would cost? I don't know. I think initially it may be tens of thousand dollars. Well, to be honest, that would be really cheap because the drug that inhibits PCSK9 inhibitor and there were three of them out there. You know, these are when they came out, they were $15,000 a year drug. Now they're $6,000 a year drugs. And yeah, so call it $10,000 a year as the current drug costs. So you're saying that $50,000 or maybe that much more. Again, still relatively inexpensive compared to the whole thing to a lifetime of therapy. But are they trying, I mean, is there any particular reason it costs that much? If you actually just look at the drug and don't try to bake in the cost of the last 10 years of developing it? And if a company to launch, if a company today came along and said, I'm interested in developing a drug that one and done treats PCSK9 and lowers LDL cholesterol. And definitely how much would it actually cost to make that drug under GMP conditions at scale? Yeah, I don't know the exact cost of good, but it's probably much lower than that. But in order to get to that, we need to get the processes developed. And so I think over time, we're definitely going to be able to get down the cost. You know, MR, large scale MR and a production, large scale formulation of nanoparticles. I think those are the processes that people are making really good progress on. So what is driving the cost right now? What is making it expensive today? I think there are a lot of factors, including development cost and also the fact that these drugs is the first time developing these modalities of drugs. And so the manufacturing processes are new to get developed. And and what specifically is it? Is it that we're now? I mean, presumably we're just making synthetic cast nine and cast 13 all day long, right? In the laboratory at laboratory scale, I bet, but I'm not sure you're not. Right. Okay. Well, I mean, so you make your own cast nine and cast 13 in your lab. We do. Okay. Yeah, we do. You can also buy it from commercial companies, but the scale is usually for laboratory use. If you think about Amales is 10 grams, a human can be in a 40 kilograms. So so that that's, you know, a thousand times larger in body weight. So you need a thousand times more material. And I think it's developing the process to scale that to that level, to be the treat human beings. And that is where the expensive process is. Is there any foundational roadblock to doing this? Or is it simply just more like, you know, if we think about again, like, is there a Moore's law aspect to this where it's just going to get significantly cheaper over time in the same way that transistors just get significantly cheaper over time? I'm not an expert on this, but but I think there would definitely be efficiency from scale. Is it my way processes from making these RNAs is getting much better? Sure, it is improving. So all those things, I think, they will compound and that will result in significant cost reduction. How much do you follow slash pay attention to sort of the regulation of gene editing? I know that gosh, sometime in the last six, seven years, there was a very controversial case in China with a scientist who had, it seems somewhat nefariously from my reading of the story, edited the embryos of kids to render them on the surface. This sounds like a great idea, but rendered immune to HIV and I believe one of their parents was HIV positive. This was an IVF case, but it turned out that there was an enormous amount of backlash from the scientific and medical community because I guess one, he did it without the full consent of the medical community and also the belief that you actually didn't, the risk of transmission of HIV was quite low to the child in the first place. Can you say more about that case in particular and then also what the current state of the genetic manipulation is from a sort of ethical legal standpoint? Right, so this was back in 2018. So there was a couple who wanted to have children. The father was HIV positive and so they wanted to make sure that their children are not in fact the way HIV. And so scientists made a mutation in the embryos that is called CCR5. And the CCR5 mutation is an actually a cream mutation in the human population. Single digit percent of individuals carried this mutation and these individuals are naturally immune to HIV infection because they don't have this genetic gene mutation. Right, they don't have this specific protein on a surface to allow HIV to bind and insert a cell. And so the scientists edited the embryo human embryo to remove this CCR5 gene. But it turned out that that edit wasn't complete. Like earlier with the homozyacism, so the result of his edit was actually two girls who were muzyaks for the CCR5 mutation. And so anyway, so the editing happened and embryos were implanted in the mother and carried to turn. And so two baby girls were born. And when the genetics of these baby girls were analyzed, it turned out that they were hiding muzyaks, suggesting that editing wasn't very efficient. And the edit was done at how many cells in theory was it one? I don't know exactly how many cells, but very early on, plus post-ferralization. But to have guaranteed no muzyacism, would this edit, would you need to do this edit at a single cell? And then proliferate only that cell, discard the rest of the blastocytes. Right, that you think that's the way to do it. And do we know what this person did? I don't know exactly how much of the technical details were released. Okay, so these girls are born muzyac, but what's their phenotype? Where they're spec to CCR5? So they are, so some of their immune cells have CCR5 and some don't. So that means that they can be affected by HIV for those cells that RCC are positive. But it probably means that they'll never die of AIDS because they will always maintain a population of T cells that are not susceptible. Mean, they'll not be able to get. They could be HIV infected, but they'll never have a T cell level that falls so low that they're maybe, yeah, their CD4 count gets below whatever the threshold is for AIDS. Right. Okay, but the world really responded harshly to this, correct? Correct, that's right. Okay, so what was the, what was the fallout for this scientist? So the, the reason that there was a huge backlash is because there really wasn't any, there's no medical need to do this. Right, yeah. That's right, it's not justified. Yeah. And so, so, so the scientific and also medical community were were really sort of, they, everyone voiced their concern about this ethical issue that that just occurred. And I think the scientist was put under house arrest for a while. And, and this incident also really motivated much more sort of ethical discussions around genetic there was, I think it was such a before, but it really sort of focused the issue. And there were multiple working groups that were established, multinational working groups between the different national economies US China, UK, as well as the WHO had several working groups. And I think in the US there is legal regulation that prevents a germline modification, but it's certainly not the case internationally. And so, what do you think is being worked on outside of the US in places where there's no regulation with respect to germline mutation? So for example, are people trying to basically say, look, we're going to get rid of APOE for isiform and make it APOE 3 or 2 isiform? I mean, what is the extent or ambition of people? Are we going to delete LPA genes so that there's no LPA little AFEN. It's time to make a case that a lot of these things would you need directionally improve human health? What are people working on? And then let's talk a little bit about the ethics. Yeah, I don't know what is happening internationally because there isn't people are not publicizing their work. But I think what is no is that there is international consensus that we don't want to do these types of embryo germline editing right now. Even for things where it really matters. So the APOE 4 and the LPA don't, you don't have to do that. But what about Huntington's? What about inbornaires of metabolism where children are going to probably die during infancy? System fibrosis. Things from which we have no viable treatments. Is the international consensus still that this type of gene editing will not be pursued? I think there's a lot of discussion going on. So it's certainly not a settled issue. But what I think scientists have all come to terms with is that the technology still needs much more validation and development before is ready for application in this germline editing setting. The efficiency, the specificity, both in YouTube be optimized further in order for for there to be any chance of a germline therapy having the intended effect. Yeah. And how much of that do you think is the main reason for the hesitation here? Versus the slippery slope argument which says yes of course those applications are absolutely worth pursuing. But if we do that how far are we from doing APOE 4 which may be a little bit gray. And then what about identifying genes that are frankly not remotely related to lifespan or medical necessity but instead relate to kind of the stuff that people talk about in science fiction. Hey, this is a gene that might make my kid a little bit taller. This is a gene that relates to intelligence or some other physical characteristic that is completely irrelevant to their health. I mean, which is it more about this is dangerous? We don't know how to do it or even if we figure this out, we don't want to open up a Pandora's box. I think this is very much the debate that's happening right now. There are patient groups who are advocates for using this using gene editing in a germline setting to treat disease. Assuming the technology is safe and efficacious then we should do it because it will alleviate suffering. So there is that argument. There are also people arguing the slippery slope argument which is if we allow for X and Y then eventually we're going to be getting into uncharted territories with designer babies and so forth. So that is very much the debate that's happening. And I think while that debate is happening I think it's important to recognize that science is also progressing other fronts. There are likely advances in science that will achieve the same outcome without having to edit the genes. And so all those things are think are a competition with each other in the ethical debate. And that's why this is such a complicated issue. You're one of three or four people on the planet who not only know more about this technology but have been personally responsible for it. As such I can't imagine you get to sit quietly during these debates even though you're not an ethicist or a philosopher. Sure people want to understand what you think. So how do you think about this? Not from a technical standpoint which will continue to talk about in a minute but from an ethical standpoint where do you think the line should be drawn in what we as a scientific or medical community permit with respect to gene editing in the germline which is obviously the area where I guess we should have made that point a little more clear the outset. We're talking about making an edit that will persist in perpetuity. Yeah I've thought about this issue a lot and I think the things that are are very easy to agree on is that if there is obvious and an important medical benefit. So especially for environmental errors and metabolism or other non genetic mutations if the technology is there I think is something that is definitely doable and I think it's okay to to improve the lives of those patients. Is that a mainstream view or do you think that there is still a lot in the establishment who have not come around to that yet because of this slippery slope argument? There are certainly people who have not come around to that. Okay and I think we're making decisions like that when making a medical decision like that it's also important to consider what other alternative methods there may be. For example pre-implantation genetic testing is another method where you might be the screen out embryos that have those mutation. Which for IVF we certainly can obviously for IVF all of those diseases can be checked. So then it gets to maybe a more complicated question which is is there a role for genetic engineering within well within in utero for example? Yeah or is that just so technically challenging that it's much easier to focus on just the IVF side of things? So certainly on the disease treatment, managing age and age disorder IVF I think that that is probably the most likely application further down the road. There are some obstacles to solve. While we don't really understand biology enough so if you wanted to make your kid 30 IQ points smarter nobody knows how to do that. We don't really know how to do that and so the biology needs to catch up. But I do think that I society can use a develop if the science is there and the technology is also there I think people will opt to do that and of course you consider whether or not they're other. Sorry meaning let's just assume and by the way I think this is personally you know fun. My view is I think these problems are way harder than people think. I think these polygenic nuanced traits like intelligence, athletic performance, resilience, happiness, all of those things I think are infinitely more complicated than we believe and probably just as environmental as they are genetic. So even if you give somebody the right genetic template if they're not in the right environmental surrounding they won't necessarily even develop the way you hope. Absolutely. And you you might give somebody 30 more IQ points. It doesn't translate to a person being demonstrably more intelligent if they aren't in the right environment. So that's my prediction is that that stuff is way way way harder and the biology is it's more complicated than anybody on the than any lay person is thinking about. And also another thing is in the biology has a lot of compensation. You might make some mutations that make the person smarter but that could also increase cancer risk or impair athletic capability. Or you know make a person live shorter. Those complicated trade-offs are things that I think people maybe don't fully appreciate. Yeah for me it's I don't know. I think there's a reason I'm not an ethicist because I tend to think about things quite. Things seem much more obvious to me sometimes which means I'm probably not a nuanced enough thinker on these on these regards but you know when it comes to a disease that's going to kill you with no other treatment it seems like a no brainer genetic editing and genetic engineering should absolutely be considered a part of the equation. At the other end of the spectrum when it things when we're talking about things that are truly superfluous like intelligence, high athletic performance, eye color, any sort of trait those seem clearly like a horrible reason not for the ethical reasons like what does that say about disparity forget all that. It's the reasons you just said we have no idea how complicated the system is. If you're going to take a huge risk there has to be a huge payoff and the asymmetry of that strikes me as too much. And then there's the gray area and I guess I'm a gray area I do feel a bit nuanced right which is should we just get rid of LPA genes well maybe but then to your point we have anti-sensaligone nucleotide inhibitors that are just around the corner that effectively will get rid of LPA little A. They shut the gene off. Right. So why would we risk trying to eradicate this from the population when we can just give you a drug that does the same thing with fewer side effects and less permanence. Right exactly or or you can do it not in the germ line but but just the indisomality cells. Yeah. And that that could also be beneficial. And then there's yet the other area which is look at something like autism. Autism is genetic disease despite what many people will have you believe. But the heritability of autism is so high that we we know it's largely a genetic disease but very polygenic, very subject to other things. And do we really want to get rid of it? I don't know. I mean certainly when you see a child that's devastated biotism who's nonverbal you know who's harming themselves it would be a very logical thing to say but when you start to move further from that end to the spectrum towards the end of the spectrum where people are quite functional with autism you might say well I don't know it actually comes with some benefits as well and and do we want to create a homogeneous society where everybody is the same? This to me is a bit. And this to me is a bit more to the sophistication. Yeah. Yeah. Right whether it be moved. Because that diversity is important. Yeah. For for the human race as a whole that diversity is you know what what will allow the human race to be resilient in the long run. So I want to talk a little bit about kind of yours your story going back. So you you grew up in China. You came to the middle of the country right where did you grow up? Yeah I grew up in Iowa so I moved to the Moin Iowa when I was 11 years old. What brought your parents here? My mother came to the US first. She was an exchange scholar in computer science and she she had a chance to visit one of the schools in Iowa and she saw that the educational system in Iowa was much more hands on as opposed to joe memorization and and because of that she thought I would maybe benefit more from that type of instruction. So she decided to stay in the US and and and integrate here. And when did you start to become aware of your your your your your intellectual abilities for lack of a better term? I mean was it was there was it just with school always so easy for you where you sort of breezing through high school facing every test put in front of you or what was it was I don't think I'm all that smart. I think I've always been interested in science. I've always been very curious. So I think I've just always kind of followed my curiosity to do something that that is enjoyable and fun. I think what is really interesting is I didn't like biology at all when I preferred physics and chemistry and not in math it was more logical. I think things that I can understand and build a mental model for and then build to predict things. Biology was very much enjoyable memorization. So when I first moved to Iowa in 7th grade there was life science in the middle school and I remember it was really about memorizing trees and dissecting frogs and identifying anatomical parts. It wasn't so much sort of based on logic. Yeah. It was string 7th grade that I attended a Saturday in Richmond class. It was a molecular biology. I didn't know what molecular, what biology had to do with molecular things. So I went to it and in that class that's when I started to learn about the advances in modern biology. The teacher was very passionate. He taught us about DNA RNA protein in the central dogma but he also had his due fun experiments like extracting DNA from strawberries and putting an antibiotic resistance gene to a bacteria so that it can survive on an impassaline. And he also at the same time showed us this I call it the documentary but it's actually a Hollywood movie, a Jurassic Park. Because if you put yourself in my shoes at the time where your learning all these molecular biology fundamentals gene splicing all that and then watching Jurassic Park to see all those theories being so tangibly there to make a dinosaur. The movie really felt like a documentary but it was also just so inspiring and exciting. That's about when Jurassic Park came out. It would have been the mid-90s. You were in middle school. It was 94. So anyway, I saw that and I became really interesting in learning more about molecular biology. I also learned about gene therapy and a promise of using molecular biology to build rationality-scient medicine. So that really captivated my imagination. The teacher was amazing. His name is Ed Pelkington and he was the teacher of the enrichment class or did he also have a regular class in the taught in high school or middle school? He was a consultant for the school and he was working with kids who are interested in science and technology. But he remembered that both myself and also a few other students were really captivated by molecular biology. And so by the time I started 10th grade, he came to us and he said, there's this really cool opportunity that you guys may want to take advantage of. The Iowa Methodist Medical Center had just opened the gene therapy lab and they have a volunteer program at the hospital and maybe you can, you guys can apply and specify that you wanted to volunteer in the gene therapy lab and maybe you get to go there. So we applied me and three other kids and we got admitted to the gene therapy lab and they taught us how to do experiments. As you remember, the very first experiment I did where the scientists had me put the gene for a jellyfish protein called green fluorescent protein. This is a protein that makes jellyfish glow and I put this gene into a human cancer cell. Just using an adenovirus. Using just lipid, we dropped it up with a bit of fat and then got absorbed by the cell. And so I did that the afternoon the day before and then the following day I went to the lab and the scientists took me into this dark microscope room where there was a beam of blue light coming out of the microscope. We put the picture there was a cell on it and he told me to look into the eyepiece and I saw a field of green cells that were fluorescently. It looked alien to me. You were in tenth grade. I was in tenth grade and that moment just made me feel so inspired about what we were doing and this idea that we can use our knowledge to then start to engineer rationally new medicine. And from that moment on I thought science is really cool and I want to do more experimental science. Do you ever just reflect on the direction your life took in response to something as seemingly arbitrary as where your parents chose to move your good fortune to be in that enrichment class and then your good fortune to have a very special teacher who not only did this incredible work with you but then stayed as a mentor got you to apply to this program as a sophomore in high school. I mean like you know I'm sure you've heard the arguments for the remarkable set of circumstances that allowed Bill Gates and Paul Allen to be in the right place at the right time from the right high school that had a computer lab that took these people who were naturally quite brilliant but more importantly put them in an environment where they could sort of leapfrog ahead of the time. I mean did you see a parallel there? I think I have a very fortunate and I think there are a couple of things that I I've over time have developed more and more gratefulness and appreciation for. Number one I think is the importance of teachers. I've been very fortunate that throughout my life I've been just you know met with many teachers who care about their students and teacher who really want to find as many opportunities as possible to help their students develop. They really care about nurturing the next generation and I think having that and having experienced that was really a great fortune of mine. The second I think is really about America. I think having been able to immigrate to the US and to go through the American education system where there's really a merit-based system where you can you can work hard and be able to learn and develop and have opportunities, have access opportunities. I think that that is really special about America. So I think education and having a system where in their shares, people who want to develop and work hard I think has been really my right way for sure. Do you think that had you grown up in China? It would have been different not because obviously people in China don't go on to do amazing things. It also produces great scientists but you know just again speaking to the randomness of this beautiful situation with this amazing teacher in this program and all of the things that followed do you think you could have still stumbled onto the direction you would have? Maybe even in a different field I guess what I'm getting at is you're very modest but obviously you're you're very special in what you've done. I wonder if you think you would have done great things regardless or do you think that no sometimes you you have to be in the right place at the right time. I think timing I think fate is important. I think you know there was a lot of opportunity in China too. China from the 1980s out of the way to now has developed exponentially but I don't know where I would have ended up. There were a lot more people in China things were competitive and education systems different. I tend to I like to think her with things and in China it's much more memorization based. So I don't know but but I'm very grateful for having had all of the teachers and opportunities here. What did you study at Harvard for your undergrad? I majored in chemistry physics. And you did that obviously knowing you were interested in genetics but did you feel that you wanted a greater grounding in the physical sciences because of your ultimate ambitions or why did you choose that as opposed to you know biology or molecular biology? Exactly. I wanted to I knew I wanted to study biology and engineer biological systems but I felt that biology was developing so rapidly and new information was accruing on a sort of weekly basis with new papers and new studies that is probably more beneficial if I study something that's not going to change very much from the time that I enrolled in college to the time I graduate. And so chemistry and physics were much more established fields and it provided a scientific foundation that I think has been very tremendous to be helpful as I continue to work in biology. And at the same time I did work outside of classes in a biological lab where I was you know practicing biological experiments and reading the later literature and I thought that was a nice combination. And when you selected Stanford for your PhD, did you do so because of Carl or was there another reason and then you ultimately after a year or so of class work found your way into Carl's lab? Carl hasn't started at Stanford yet. Okay. And so when I was choosing when I was growing up especially after moving into Iowa I read about people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and and all of the you know internet revolution that was happening. And so I had a special feeling about Silicon Valley. I was very intrigued by it and so when I applied to graduate school I thought Stanford being a Silicon Valley would be a really good place to be. And so I made the decision away. How did you then make the decision to go back to the East Coast for your postdoc back to Harvard MIT area as opposed to stay in the Silicon Valley and pursue your passions there in closer approximation to industry although of course everybody realizes Boston would clearly be not too far behind the Silicon Valley for biotech industry. I think at the time it was probably the most interesting opportunity. So I should mention that Carl Dicerat is a phenomenal mentor. I've learned a tremendous amount from him not only about doing science but also how to just be a good contributing member of the scientific community with sharing information and reagents and the transfer knowledge to as many people as possible. And he was also a great mentor where he just gave me opportunity to try things. So during graduate school for many months I was working on a biofuel project in Carl's lab. What year was this? This was in 2007, 2008. So it was energy crisis, oil crisis and the biofuel was an important thing. That's what Alex Seravini said for the world. Yeah, it was the same time. Right. 2008. And so around that time I thought this was an interesting problem. So I explored that in Carl's lab and we thought maybe we could even go and do adventure capital and if we had something working out well. But it turned out that around 2008 the financial crisis also hit. And so a lot of those opportunities at that moment seemed to have just vanished. But at that same time I was contacted by someone from the Harvard Society Fellows. And they said we liked your work as a graduate student. Would you be interested in coming to the Society Fellows and just you know, explore science here. So I thought that was interesting. They said we'll give you a stipend and you're not expected to do anything specific. You can just come in, hang out and think about interesting things. So I applied and and and when they're that's where I started to I swore to gene editing technology. So you're you know barely 40 years old. You're one of the most prominent scientists in your field. Do you are you optimistic about the state of science? Are you and I'll point out two things that are negative that you don't need to comment on. So I don't want to put you in hot water. But just sort of there's been a clear attack on meritocracy in the United States. So a lot of the opportunities that that served you well might not have served you well today. They might not have been available to you today for various reasons, including your race. And similarly, I think despite all of the remarkable scientific advances during COVID, there was also a loss of public faith in science during COVID, where some of the lines between science and advocacy got blurred greatly. In addition to a whole bunch of other things. So one of other words, I guess what I'm saying is there are a lot of things today that don't look as promising as they did maybe 10 years ago, vis-a-vis the field and just sort of the state of the art. Despite those things, do you remain as optimistic as ever or do you have concerns? I am an optimist. I think that's the only way to be because if you're not optimistic, then there's only downside when you are like that. But I am optimistic about science. I'm so excited about all of the rapid advances that are happening. Knowledge about biology, about the human body, physiology is accumulating at very rapid pace. Every week, there are interesting and exciting discoveries that are being reported. And our technology, so we're studying biological systems, are also accelerating with sequencing technology development to protein, mass-veg geometry, to gene editing, to new microscopy. That is allowing us to collect new and more rich data cheaper and faster. And then there's AI with the advanced AI and larger computing platforms. We can analyze and learn and build models around those data that are much more powerful, much more predictive and generative that ever before. And that combined with future advances in robotics, where we can have automation of experimentation and maybe even building a close loop system where AI and with human intervention can design and iterate our experiments rapidly. I think it's going to accelerate science and medicine and human health beyond our imagination. So I think that's really exciting. At the same time, I think we need to continue to motivate people's interests in science. We need to make sure that the best talent are going into science. Do you worry that we've lost the focus on STEM that, I mean, obviously people talk about the heyday of science, right? During the 1960s, when kids growing up saw the space program saw the cold war, the best and the brightest wanted to do science. They wanted to do engineering. Do you feel that slipping away? And if so, what do you think is necessary to bring it back? How do we get the absolute best people into STEM? I think we can do more for sure. I think we need to get kids more excited about science. And I think we need to um, we need the education system to to support kids for our curious and and who have special interests in the science and technical things and to give them opportunities like the ones that I had to to really explore those curiosities of interests. When they're young, they are optimistic and they have energy and if we can nurture that and help them maintain that curiosity and energy, I think that's how we get the best people to continue in science. Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. And this is not an investment that pays off in a year, right? You've got to be doing this today and then you'll get your pay off in a decade and two decades. And sometimes those investments are really hard for society to make because it's hard to say I got to pay money now for something and I don't get paid back for 10 or 20 years. Those are hard things to accept but um, I hope that people listening to this podcast appreciate certainly in your case. What an enormous value it was for that investment um, you know, in many ways it's a great story of lots of things. It's a story about immigration, it's a story about science education, it's a story about curiosity, it's a story about the American dream. So anyway, I'm really glad we finally got a chance to sit down. It was absolutely worth the wait and I'm excited to follow your undoubted the continued success over the coming decades. Thank you so much for having me here today.

Talk a little bit about what insulin resistance is. Basically, every time you eat a meal, you're going to release insulin. There are many processes that insulin control. So one of the challenges with the term insulin resistance is, as you said, it's a vague term and it's non-specific. The two problems and diabetes. One is, you know, I'm making an ovenslint. The other is your insulin resistance. Type two diabetes. Very bad. You're knocking on death's door. Correct. You're going to go blind. Yep. You're going to have your toes amputated. You're not ever going to have an erection again. And you're going to die of cardiovascular disease or kidney disease or Alzheimer's disease quickly. So people say that Alzheimer's disease is, you know, diabetes type 3. I'm not sure. Brain diabetes. Yes. You are obese when you're four years of age. You're going to be obese when you're at out. And your life expectancy will be significantly shorter. And your quality of life will be significantly reduced. What has changed so much in the last 30 years that has created this epidemic? Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Ralph, thank you so much for coming down to, I guess, up to Austin from San Antonio. Very excited to sit down with you and talk about, you know, potentially one of the most important subject matters in all of health. People who listen to me all the time here and are familiar with me talking about these four horsemen, right, cardiovascular disease, and cerebral vascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative and dementing diseases. And then there's this fourth horsemen that I talk about. And it's in many ways the squishiest because it's not the one that shows up on the most death certificates. But in many ways, it's the foundational one that is amplifying the risk of all of those causes of death. And I refer to it as, you know, sort of metabolic disease, spanning the spectrum from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease all the way out to type two diabetes. So given how much I speak about that, it seems very important that we should have a really thorough discussion of that foundational metabolic disease and no one better than you to have that discussion. So let's start a little bit with just kind of telling folks briefly about, you know, what you're doing at UT San Antonio and why you've spent the last almost 40 plus almost 50 years now working on this problem. So for me, I actually have been sort of in this field of metabolic disease for a long time. I think I'm the longest consecutive lead funded 53 years in IDDDK investigator. And I actually started even long before that when I was a medical student at Harvard, I had this fantastic teacher, Professor Kale, who gave us all of the lectures on intermediary metabolism. And I decided, this is what I wanted to do. And I worked at each summer with Professor Kale. And, you know, sometimes in life you meet the right person, the right opportunity to change everything that you do. And basically what I do now, I can tribute the directly to George. And, you know, when I gave the Banting Lecture in 2008, people usually, you know, put a picture of their mother and father and children. And I love my mother and father and children, but I only showed one picture and that was Professor Kale because he's really the person who's ended up sort of directing me to where I am today. You know, people who are listening who are particularly a student might recall, I've referenced a number of Kale's papers, but one of the more interesting studies he did, which it's possible he did while you were even a student there was the 40-day starvation study. You might have not been quite at Harvard yet because this was, if I recall in the mid-60s, maybe 60, 60, 60, seven, where, and it was probably a group of medical students that actually volunteered if not medical students undergrads. And they, they did a water-only fast for 40 days. And the study basically just followed all of the metabolites. What happened to glucose levels, obviously in Slend by the hydroxybutyrodicida acetate. Anyway, it was very fascinating stuff. One of the things that was most interesting to me, and that study was even under a period of such extreme starvation, the brain never gave up its dependency on glucose. So even though ketone bodies began to service the brain by about day seven to ten as the majority of the fuel, even at three and four weeks of starvation, glucose was, if my memory serves me correctly, still providing about a third of the brain's energy. Your memory is very good. The brain did switch over to ketone metabolism and believe it or not. I didn't do the 40 day fast, but I was one of the people who fasted for five to seven days. And if you fasted for three days, you could get paid $50. And I thought I was the richest guy in the world from this study. So I can assure you that the physical specimens in this study were phenomenal. What did the 40 day fasting students get? I don't know, but I'm sure he paid them a lot of money. That's a very good order to do that. The interesting thing about that is you realize that we have so much energy stored in the human body who would have thought that you know, your lean type person, you can fast from 40 days, but the real problem is that at some point you start to break down muscle. And then if you start to break down cardiac muscle, then prolonged fasting at that point becomes a problem. But you have a lot of energy stored in fat and you can start for a long time and it will be people easily go for three, four months with all of the reserves that are in the body. Well, let's maybe talk a little bit about what insulin resistance is. We'll get into what causes it, but let's just maybe define for people this term that gets thrown around constantly. And let's you know, explain what it is from a technical standpoint. Yeah. So basically every time you eat a meal and your blood sugar level goes up, you're going to release insulin. And insulin is sort of a master regulator for all biochemical processes in the body. So one of the things that insulin is going to do is going to talk to your muscles. I'm going to say take up glucose and burn that glucose. So what we need to know is in a normal person, one of the issues in insulin, how much of the glucose is taken up by the muscle. And then we could look at someone who is, say, overweight, or you could look at someone who's diabetic. And I actually developed the goals, they're the technique, which is the insulin clamp technique to look at this. So we could take an obese person or a diabetic or a normal person. We raise the insulin and then I'm using muscle as an example. How much glucose is taken up that's supposed to be by the muscle. And then I can compare if you're overweight, compared to the lean person. Well, obese people are very insulin resistant in terms of muscle glucose update. I could look at the diabetic. They're even more insulin resistant. But there are many processes that insulin control. So insulin regulates how much fat is released from your fat cells. And obese people, unfortunately, insulin keeps the fat in your fat cell. But in obese people, insulin doesn't work so well. So instead of keeping the fat in the fat cell, even though your insulin is high, you're breaking down the fat. So you have to look at each individual process that insulin is controlling. And so for that process, we know this is what a normal person should respond like. This is what a diabetic response like in the diabetic is much, much more insulin resistant than not responding. So it's in a certain way, it's a general term because insulin controls so many things. Protein metabolism. Insulin is very important in helping you to build protein. So I could infuse insulin and we've done this using carbon label loose in. And we can define how insulin promotes protein metabolism in a normal healthy person. And then I could do the same kind of study in obese person. And we know that the obese people don't respond to the insulin as well in terms of aggregating protein metabolism. So it's kind of a general term. And does that translate not just to structural proteins, such as enzymes or cellular structural proteins, but also macro structural proteins such as muscle? Absolutely. So I can look at specific enzymes within the cell. I can look at certain genes within the cell that are turned on or off. Or I can look at muscle in terms of muscle is a bulk. So there are many, as I said, many ways in which you could define insulin resistance. But basically, whatever the particular process you're looking at, you're comparing what would be the normal response in a normal healthy person compared to what might happen in a diabetic person or an obese individual. So one of the challenges with the term insulin resistance is, as you said, it's a vague term and it's non-specific because the actions of insulin are so many. It has an action in the liver. It has an action in the muscles. It has an action with response to glucose. It has an action with response to amino acids. And it has an action with response to fat, both in the liberation of fat, lipolysis and presumably in response to oxidation. Absolutely. And we'll go through all of these. But let's maybe start with how the U.G. Lycemic Clamp test is done. Yeah. And let's assume that I'm a healthy enough individual that we can use me as a proxy. I come into your clinic. What are we going to do? How do you run this test? Yeah. So let me bring you back in time when I was a fellow because at that time that we didn't really have a good measure of insulin sensitivity. So what people would do is you do an oral glucose tolerance test. Yes. And the insulin level would go up. And so then some people would say, I'll look at how much insulin comes out compared to the rise in glucose. And that's a measure of beta cell function. And then someone would just turn it around and say, look, I'm going to see how much the rise in glucose was per insulin. And that's a measure of insulin resistance. And it was very clear to me, well, this is insane. You can't take two variables and then just depending upon how you want to look at them, switch the denominator and numerator. And so I said, we need to develop something that is really more specific. And just to be clear, Ralph, I mean, unfortunately, we as clinicians are not able to do U.G. Lycemic Clamp. Correct. So we are still looking at oral glycemic tolerance tests. We are still giving people you know, oral glucose and sampling glucose and insulin every 30 minutes and trying to impute what we can, which I'd love to come back and talk about interpretation, but carry on with the limitation. We could do that because we actually have been a lot of work and how you interpret that. So what we said is, why don't we develop a serious way? And so we developed the technique where I could take 100 people. And I would infuse insulin initially as a primary dose and then just clamp the insulin level. So I give a prime continuous insulin infusion. I can take 100 people in all 100 people. I can raise your insulin level by 100 micro units per ML. And I can do that for two hours. And now I know that the stimulus, the insulin stimulus, whether you're lean, whether you're obese, or whether you're diabetic, whatever particular process that I want to look at. So maybe I wanted to look at how insulin shut down a paddock glucose production. And actually we were the first people to ever use radio isotopes to trace this and show that in normal people, insulin shut down glucose production by the liver very quickly. But obese people and diabetics were very, very resistant to the insulin. And then we said we wanted to know, look, everybody now has got the same insulin level. How effectively does that insulin stimulate muscle glucose uptake? And again, what we showed, and these actually were the very first unequivocal demonstration that diabetic people tied to were insulin resistant. Before this, there was a lot of controversy, you know, Dr. Reven, who is a sort of the father of insulin resistance. I like to think I'm the son of Dr. Reven. He's a great idol of mine. He really was one of the very first people to insinuate the diabetics were insulin resistant. And with the insulin clamp, we showed this very definitively. And we also know, we use the label glycerol and free fatty acids. And we could show the ability to insulin the shutdown release of lipid from the fat cell was markedly impaired. So three of the major organs, all of this work originally was done by us when I was back at Yale. So let's summarize those again. Yeah. We're talking about this in an insulin sensitive person right out of the gate. Insulin is going to shut down hepatic glucose output. Absolutely. So it's going, which again, all of this kind of makes sense if you think through the pathway, our liver is constantly putting glucose into circulation because the muscles can't put glucose into circulation. So something has to feed the brain. Yes. Absolutely. If insulin is high, it suggests glucose is already sufficiently high. So let's not create more glucose toxicity. Let's shut that. The second thing it's going to do is it's going to take that excess glucose and put it in the place where we have the largest capacity of the stored, which is muscle. Absolutely. So point two is we increase muscle uptake of glucose. And then point three you said was it's going to shut down lipolysis. Yes. It's going to shut down the release of triglycerides and or free fatty acids from the adipose tissue. And that's very critical. And we also, when we did these studies, we would put a catheter in the hepatic vein and in a femoral artery and a femoral vein. So we could look at the individual tissues. And what we showed is that when you infuse insulin, say 80% or 90% of the glucose is going to be taken up in muscle. Only 10% is going to be taken up in the adipocyte and stored. And I'm much in the liver. At basically none. Under uglysemic conditions and we were the first to show this conclusively as well, there's no glucose uptake in the liver by insulin. Just explain to people what a uglysemic condition is. Yes. Uglysemic means you're fasting glucose when you wake up in the morning is 80. Now your uglysemic, that means when we do the studies, we keep your fasting glucose of 80. We don't let the glucose change. All we're going to do is raise the insulin. And that means you're giving glucose. Of course because if we didn't give glucose, then your blood sugar level would drop. And then you'd release cortisol. You release epinephrine. Yeah. So I just want to make sure people understand that I was going to come back to that, but I wanted to finish that point. So let's let's make sure we go back to the test because it's very counterintuitive. So I've got a catheter in each arm. I walk in off the street. I've been fasting. My blood sugar is 80 or 90. Whatever milligrams predestilator it is. You are going to have to infuse both insulin and glucose into each of my arms. When the reason is, when you said a moment ago, you're going to steadily increase my insulin and take it to a steady state of 100 IU per million. That's a staggering high insulin level. Not so high. In your eye after a meal would be maybe 60. Or these people very commonly get sure for a healthy person that would never see an insulin level that high. And if you were not simultaneously running glucose into them, you would kill them within minutes. Hopefully not. Yeah, but just to get to the point of I guess they would become so profoundly hypoglycemic that they would cease to exist. And it should be obvious that if you're very sensitive to insulin, I have to infuse a lot of glucose. But the other beauty of it, as I said, when I was a young guy at Yale, there was a physician in New York, Dr. Altrulla. He was the first one to use treated glucose to trace metabolic pathways. And I said, oh, this is astounding. So I actually went to visit Dr. Altrulla and learned how he did it. And so all of the insulin clamps that is that we did, we were the first people who used treated glucose in humans and to show that the ability of insulin to shut down the release of glucose from the liver was markedly impaired. And this is just again, sorry, interrupt, but just to make sure that people are following us, the reason you wanted to use treated glucose there was not to quantify the total amount of glucose disposal. You could do that on mass balance. Yeah, you wanted to determine the ultimate fate of glucose. How much became hepatic glycogen, if any, sounds like the answer is none. How much became muscle glycogen, sounds like you said about 90%. And how much ultimately got converted through the Nova Lipogenesis into out of Poseidor Free fatty acid, sounds like that's about 10% under the U. glycemic condition. Is that correct? Yeah, in general life's correct except in the muscle, remember, some of the glucose is going to be oxidized. So if you look at the glucose once it gets into the cell, one third would go through the glycolytic pathway and be oxidized. Right away. Yes. And the other two thirds would be stored is glycogen. Now, what if the person is, I mean, presumably you're doing this test and a person is sedentary? Yes. So how is the, and the muscle, is it, is muscle that metabolically active at rest? I guess it is. Yes. Yeah. So that's really interesting. Does that mean you're increasing energy expenditure under these conditions? Well, of course, in a certain way you are, but it's not like when you go out and you exercise and you run a mile or two. So, you know, it's a, I would say you are turning on a number of cycles, which are of course, going to increase energy expenditure, your generating ATP. So there is a certain increase in energy expenditure, but if I really want to increase energy expenditure, I get you to go jog five miles. So, yeah. As exercise is really the thing that really increases energy expenditure. And we're off just for a sense of amount. If you're doing this in, say, somebody my size, who's insulin sensitive, how many actual grams of glucose would you be able to get into the person within the hour while, while keeping insulin clamped? Yeah. So I'm going to do it first in terms of rates, the way we express it, and then I'll translate that. So it's under basal conditions, you wake up in the morning, and your liver is producing and your tissues are taking up about two milligrams of piquellogram body weight per minute. Okay? Sorry. Say that again. Two. Limer is producing, that's a particle of glucose output. That's a particle of glucose output. Two milligrams piquellogram body weight per minute. And we were the first to actually show this many years ago, and this is humans. It might so very, very different, totally different. And that's why extrapolating from mice to humans can be a problem. What was just reflected on that for a second? This, people who listen as podcaster probably sick of me saying this, but I'm sorry. I just can't stop saying the liver never ceases to amaze me. Right? Like, I mean, it's an unbelievable organ, and again, I come back to this idea. It's the only major organ for which we don't have extra caportial support. Right? Interesting. If you're heart, if you went into Cardio Genic shock, and we felt we could, you know, reverse it in time, we could put an introortic balloon pump in you. We could put an IABP in you. We could we could put a left ventricular advice device in you to to to to stem you over until we get you're other. If your kidneys are destroyed, we can transiently dialize you. Even if your brain is experiencing swelling, we can, you know, put enough steroids in you were decompress your skull to give you the time to recover and keep you alive otherwise. You go through all the major organs. If your spleen is dinged, take it out. Right? Even if you lost your small bowel, we could at least transiently keep you alive with, you know, TPN or something like that. None of this is true with the liver. You know, in the old days, they actually used to use pig liver profusion. I know. And that was in the old days. We don't do that anymore. And baboon as well. Yeah. So again, the fact that the liver can titrate this amount is remarkable. So two milligrams per kilogram per minute. So you take an individual who weighs 100 kilograms, you're putting 200 milligrams per minute of glucose into circulation. Then you can multiply that by however many you want to look. So this is a gram every five minutes. Yeah. That's 12 grams of glucose every hour. It's a liver is putting out. But now when I do an insulin clamp, depending on how much I raise the insulin in over the years, we've done a dose response curve and I can come back to this because your fat is exquisitely sensitive to insulin. If I raise the insulin just by 10 microids per ml, the fat stops producing free fatty acids and glycerol. You inhibit lipoluses literally completely. The liver you need to get the insulin up to about 50 micro units per ml to really get it shut down. So in the fact you had to get how high? 10. Rise of 10. And tell me, these people when they come in and healthy, they're at five to 10. Yeah. So I'm going to raise them from five to 10 to maybe 50 or 20. And that's going to in large part shut down lipoluses. Okay. And in fact all of this sort of work was worked that we originally did many many years ago. Now at the level of the liver, you really need to get up to about 50 micro units per ml. So maybe at 10 I'm going to bring you up to 50. And that's in large part going to shut off glucose production by the liver. Now that's critical because you know, you wake up in the morning and your liver is producing glucose. Now if you eat a meal, glucose is coming in from the gastrointestinal tract. You can't have glucose coming in from the liver at the same time. Otherwise you get very hyperglycemic. So when you eat a meal and that insulin comes out, it really needs to shut down a paddock glucose production. Now what's replacing the liver is what's coming from the meal. But then after you absorb all of the meal, the liver needs to turn back on. So understanding how the liver is responding to the insulin is really very important. And then if I want to look at what's going on in the muscle, the reason why we go to 100 micro units per ml, which is it's above physiologic, but it's still within the physiologic range. And you really need to get, if you really want to stimulate muscle glucose uptake completely in a normal healthy person, you'd probably have to get the plasma insulin to about 200 micro units per ml. But in reality, I'm sorry, at 200 what happens? You have now maximize muscle glucose uptake. But in reality, even in an insulin sensitive person, yes. And just to make sure I understand what you're saying, you're saying that if you took an insulin sensitive individual at 100 units of insulin versus 200, you will actually drive more glucose uptake. You haven't saturated the Glute 4 Transporter at 100. Yeah, probably about 25% more uptake is you go from 100 to 200. Wow. And these are all early studies that we did. So when we talk about insulin resistance, that's why I said, you need to know which tissue you're talking about and which metabolic pathway. And if you want to talk about enzymes, you need to talk at what specific enzyme because insulin resistance needs to be related to the tissue you're talking about in the process within the tissue that you're talking about. So insulin resistance is a very important concept, but you all have to be a little bit more specific about what aspect you want to address. So you can have insulin resistance in the fat you can have insulin resistance in the muscle and then something that's now pretty exciting you may have insulin resistance in the brain and the suggestions now. And there are many insulin receptors in the brain, Jesse Roth, you know, very famous diabetes person, you know, maybe 50 or 60 years ago was the first to describe insulin receptors in the brain. And this is an area that's now starting to unfold. It may have some relationship to neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, you know, some people say that Alzheimer's disease is diabetes type 3, I'm not sure. Brain diabetes, yes. So the insulin resistance is a very important concept. And unfortunately, I would say let's say we're going to talk about diabetes. Even though there's an ominous octet that I developed that's used everywhere in the world for the pathophysiology of that two diabetes, if we really wanted to take and solidify it and say, what are the two big concepts? Insulin resistance would be here and the other hand would be impaired beta cell function, okay? So if you are insulin resistant and your beta cells work well, they know how to read the insulin resistance, they'll make enough insulin, you won't become diabetic. The hyperincinemia can damage you in other ways, but you won't become diabetic. But what happens is if you're insulin resistant, and particularly if you have a genetic predisposition, if your beta cells have to continuously pour out insulin, they start to exhaust. And so insulin resistance is a disaster for someone who has a genetic predisposition is going to bring out the diabetes. Insulin resistance, in my opinion, is intimately related to cardiovascular disease. That is why you see a diabetic patient, 10% of them. You walk in, you have diabetes, first time I see you, 10% and 15% of the people already have clinically significant cardiovascular disease. And if you look carefully, virtually 100% of them do. And so, Ralph, do you think that that is a result of the hyperincinemia or the untreated or poorly treated hyperglycemia? All of the above, but more importantly, what we showed, and we were, again, the first people to show this. And the cardiologist, they're kind of human dynamically oriented, they're looking at, you know, vessels, starter, classic, but if you look at the insulin signaling pathway, insulin has got a bind to its receptor, and then there's a signaling pathway. I can tell you all the molecules in there, which I'm not. And then glucose gets transported in the cell. We were the first people to show in humans that that pathway doesn't work normally. In some will bind to the receptor, it will activate the receptor. But the next molecule, IRS 1, PIT, 3, Kines, all those molecules don't get activated. So glucose doesn't get into the cell, that's diabetes. That's the same pathway activates nitric oxide synthase. And that generates nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is the most potent vasodilator in the human body. It's the most potent anti-athogenic molecule in the human body. So this defect that's in muscle, and it's in cardiac muscle, and it's in skeletal muscle. This all human-dated, I'm talking about not animal data, when you get a defect in that insulin signaling pathway, that's going to cause diabetes, and it's going to promote cardiovascular disease. And that is why you can never separate cardiovascular disease from diabetes. Now, as you point it out rightfully so, I believe that high levels of insulin are also athrogenic. Now, I don't want people saying Dr. DeFranso said you shouldn't be giving insulin the people who needed. Of course, if people need insulin, you need to give them insulin. But our beta cells make 35 units of insulin if you're a type one diabetic in the GANS. What do you mean? So you're going to have your breakfast, you're going to have your lunch, you're going to have your dinner, and 35 units. I thought you meant micro units. Not it. So the third point is that they have 35 units of insulin. So we showed this many years ago, and actually it was that if you would take a type one patient and they were lean, they would only need 35 or 40 units of insulin to get their glucose control. The sum you gave the doses at the right time. But we have a lot of people who are taking 100 units of insulin, both type ones and type do's. So three ex physiologic. Yes. That kind of hyperincinemia, I think there's evidence to support that's athrogenic. But now we have a problem. Can you have the glucose remain high? Yeah, it's a question if do you want to die quickly or slowly? But yes, really good drugs. Yes, yes, but if you were only doing this with insulin, it's an awful trade-off. It's you're going to die very quickly from hyperglycemia if you're left untreated. But if we overdue it with insulin to maintain normal glycemia, we're going to kill you slowly. It's a cogma. You're stuck. Yep. You have to treat, but you also know that when you're giving these big doses of insulin, there may be some side effects. This is something Ralph, I don't think that has been necessarily appreciated by the medical community. Absolutely not. Yeah, there has generally been an ethos of when I've talked to patients with type 2 diabetes. What they've been told is I'm told to cover with as much insulin as is necessary to maintain my glucose levels in this range. It means I can eat whatever I want. It's okay if I have all the pasta and bread and sugar in the world because as long as I'm covering it with insulin, I'm okay. And then you find out, wow, you're taking 150 units of insulin a day in all of its forms, the short acting, the long acting, etc. But I didn't actually realize that what we would consider physiologic is 35. I may have known that at one point in absence for gotten, but that's a great reference. So basically, if there's a person with type 2 diabetes listening to us today, and they're taking 75 units of insulin, that one of the takeaways should be, what do I need to do with my nutrition and other pharmacologic activities plus exercise plus everything that's on my control to maybe get that down to 35 where I would be at a physiologic level. Absolutely. There are things that you already insinuated way loss if you can get people to do it at and then we can add medications in combination with insulin, insulin sensitizers or some drugs to help you lose weight that will also allow you to get that dose of insulin reduced. The other thing we showed in this study, Dr. Del Prado, who's past president of the European Diabetes Association, we took normal healthy lean kids 18, 25 years of age and we gave them, we put them on the clinical research center for three days and we gave them a very, very low dose of insulin infusion and we raised their fasting insulin from eight, which is what a normal person would be to 20, which is really quite low and within 48 to 72 hours, they were as insulin resistant as a type 2 diabetic patient. So hyperinsulinemia induces insulin resistance. This is, why is that the case? So what insulin does is it down regulates the insulin signaling transduction system. So that insulin binds to its receptor and then it activates Iris, one, and P.I.3 kinase and A.K.D. That system is down regulated by hyperinsulinemia. All of this that I'm telling you about, it's all published, these are all studies that in in in in humans and this also been shown in in in rodent models as as well. So this is another reason why we don't want people to be hyperinsulinemic. You have to explain that to me again, rough, that is mind-boggling to me. I would never, I would never have predicted that. So let me say it back to you because I feel like I missed it when I was writing something down. You took normal volunteers, who had a fasting insulin of eight. Yep. And they're lean healthy. Okay. And you simply infused insulin in them, presumably with glucose. Oh, yes, of course. On the clinical research center, we can monitor, keep the glucose perfectly constant. We're not letting the glucose change. So person shows up insulin eight glucose is 90. Yep. You do a U.G.C. McClamp where you bring insulin up only to 20. One and a half per one and a half. Much less than B when you eat a meal. Exactly. Not even a post-prandial bump. But now it's constrictively sitting there at 20. Yep. And you've obviously had to bring glucose. You're doing a few glucose to maintain U.G.C. Mea. Correct. Did you say that in four days, 48 to 72 hours, and these people are as insulin resistant as type 2 diabetics. Okay. Again, very, very counterintuitive because if our, if our model is that insulin resistance, which is the hallmark factor contributing to type 2 diabetes in the combination of beta cell fatigue, is driven by lipotoxicity, which we're going to come to. That's an important one. Yes. These people didn't have any of that. No, these people didn't have any of the intramyosolular lipid that we talked about with your colleague. No, Jerry Reven as a predisposing factor. It's the direct effect of insulin down regulating the insulin signaling system and probably other distal metabolic within the cell as well. Okay. So then when you turn the clamp off, let's just say we ran this for 72 hours. We've made them functionally diabetic. Turn the clamps off. How many hours or did you do that? What would you predict? I would predict probably within 24 to 48 hours. They would return to normal because we did this acutely. Now, if we were able to do this for several months, then I would anticipate that the insulin resistance would remain for a long period of time. And remember, when we treat type 1 diabetics, we're always giving the insulin into the periphery. You arrive when you ingest the meal, where does the insulin go? It goes into the portal vein. So the liver is seeing a high level of insulin. That's good. It says stop making glucose. But now, it removes half of the insulin. So how much insulin gets into the periphery? Half of what you secreted. Why? Because we don't want the insulin in the periphery over insulinizing the periphery because we would make the muscle tissue very insulin resistant. So the portal, the pancreas, secreting insulin into the portal circulation, liver sees the insulin good. It's not making glucose, but it also takes up half of the insulin. So less insulin gets enough to nourish the muscle. Okay? Enough to shut down the fat producing free fatty acids, but not enough to hyperinsenize the system. And in a certain way, if you're a diabetic and you are insulin resistant or an obese person and you are insulin resistant and you're a hypersecrating insulin, it's kind of working against you because it's a reverberating system that's making the insulin resistance aggravated. So one of the big things that we've forgotten is that insulin, I told you, there are two problems in diabetes. One is you don't make an ovenslint. The other is your insulin resistant. You need to attack both problems. And the paper that I recently published, which is a perspective in Lancet Diabetes and a chronology, was to bring people back to look, we're focusing on obesity and weight loss and we should. But we need to remember that we still have a genetic cause for the insulin resistance. You go back to 1950, you know, the incident's diabetes was 2%. I've seen even data that says it was 1%. As recent as 1970, it's very low. Yeah. But these people were all lean and they're insulin resistant. So there's a genetic cause of the insulin resistance. And you think Ralph, that the greater genetic effect is on the insulin resistance side or on the beta cell fatigue side. So let's tackle each. Since you started with insulin resistance, let's go there. Yeah. Let's talk about what we know about the genetics of insulin resistance. That's easy. Nothing. Truly nothing. No, I joke. But if you let's say 20 years ago, we got involved in one of the biggest genetics studies called the vagus study, Veterans Administration, Genetic Epidemiologic Study. And we were convinced that we would do a G, we were one of the people to do the first G was studies. That we would define all the genes that are responsible. Well, we were not very successful. Even if you took the subset of people with type 2 diabetes who were lean and you compared them to people who were lean and non-diabetic versus obese and diabetic. A G was was not able to identify a signal in those three cohorts. We identified several and remember there are associations. There. Of course. And they're in non-coding regions. So like the TCF70T2 gene, that we found that. But that had already been described by Dr. Michael Sterns in Antonio many years before. So we repeated with Michael showed. And other people have shown that. So there are a number of associations. And again, if you ask me, how many genes have we truly established that are really important in terms of causing type 2 diabetes, I would say very, very few. I know the genetics people out there probably hate this. And they'll say that we can put together a genetic score. But you know when they talk about a genetic score, it's not that they've causably associated with gene with that. It's an association. It's an association. It's an association. We have a whole different approach that, well, if you want, I can tell you what we're doing that may give some insight. And then people have started to think about rare diseases. That maybe the problem is in one family you have this particular genetic mutation. Another family you have a different genetic mutation, a third family a different genetic mutation. And then when you do the GW study, you got this mixture of individual genes. What about the phenotype? So I've taken care of. I've taken care of a couple of patients with type two diabetes who are very lean. Including one patient whose body fat by Dexa was about 8% so for people listening, that is insanely lean, very lean. So you take an individual who's body fat is 8% and yet they have type two diabetes. The first thing that comes to my mind is a lightendestrophy is this an individual whose adipostissue is the problem. In other words, they're not able to assimilate enough excess nutrient i.e. glucose into the fat cell. And so they're undergoing the toxicity associated with an insufficient reservoir. Is that what could be the causal? Not that I can tell you what's causing the lightendestrophy, but is the lightendestrophy the issue that's driving the diabetes here. The answer to that is it's very clear that lightendestrophy can cause diabetes. This would say a very, very rare and unusual cause, but well established. But that's, but you're saying that's not what would explain 1% of diabetics. That's too. Okay. And Jerry Schumman has that some beautiful work in this area. So it's unequivocal that lightendestrophy, profit people because their fat cells can't take up the fat. It ends up in your myocardium, it has heart disease. That's up in the beta cells. It's the beta cell in the muscle. But that's a very, very, very small percentage. So the basic genetic ideology of the insulin resistance, the number the P.P.R. Yama gene is been associated. There are about 7 or 8 genes. There's a recent study, I think it's in nature genetics by Brown. Were they identified? And again, there are associations. Except that would say the P.P.R. Yama gene that is, it's pretty clear that's a causal. Did Mitchell is R do some of this work? Pardon? Mitchell is R do some of this work. And he's worked in this area. But again, the number of, in my opinion, the long list of folks at this point. Oh, yes. The number of genes that have been described. So one of the, and the other thing people said, well, maybe there are 20 genes involved, each giving a small component. And that's why it's so difficult. Well, all of these hypotheses have been difficult to approve, approve. And the simple fact is, we don't understand the genetic basis. In part, because diabetes, in my opinion, is a very poor phenotype. Diabetes are very heterogeneous disease. So when we talk about diabetes, if that's your phenotype, it's not surprising to me that it's going to be difficult to define genes that are related to diabetes. So what I'm going to tell you about, I don't want to take the credit for this. Okay. So one of the people in my division, Dr. Lou Norton working with Steve Parker at Michigan, I'm involved because I'm doing the insulin clamp studies. We're taking as a phenotype muscle insulin resistance. This is a very, very specific phenotype. Okay. This is not diabetes. The ominous octet, my pathophysiology. That's eight problems. Okay. This is muscle insulin resistance. I'm going to do an insulin clamp now. And then I'm going to do a muscle biopsy before I do the insulin clamp. And I'm going to do a muscle biopsy at the end of the insulin clamp. And what happens? Okay. Well, during the insulin clamp, I know exactly how sensitive are resistant you are to insulin. I've got the most definitive phenotype in the world. No one gets this kind of phenotype. And now what do I see? In enormous amount of chromatin opens up. This is the epigenetic component. Genes in chromatin area, you never ever going to see in the baseless thing. And that's why we think this is hypothesis. Now that why it's been so difficult with all of these GW studies to identify genes that are associated with diabetes. And now we're starting to see diabetic people and non diabetic people. We're starting to see some associations which we think now are causal and we can relate to the insulin resistance with the clamp. So the first paper along these lines. Let's just pause there for a second, we're off. I want to make sure everybody's following what you're saying. You're saying look, one of the challenges of having a disease that isn't perfectly perfectly clearly defined where every single member of the class that has the disease looks exactly the same. With the word for that is heterogeneous. So let's take an example where the disease is very heterogeneous. Sickle cell anemia. Correct. Everybody who has sickle cell anemia from a pathophysiology standpoint is identical. Okay. And guess what? There's a single mutation that defines the disease. So because you have a single gene that defines the disease, one gene mutated produces one change in one base pair that changes one amino acid that changes the property of the hemoglobin molecule and everybody looks the same. But you're saying Peter, it's totally different. With type 2 diabetes, we have some people that are thin, some people that are fat, some people that have lots of insulin resistance in the muscle, some people that don't seem to have much, but it's all in the liver. We're going to go through. I want to hear, I want to make sure we define the octet, the ominous octet. But if that's the case, why would you ever expect to find a simple genetic answer by definition, it's going to be a mess. Absolutely. Yeah. And so if you don't have a very definitive phenotype, it's going to be difficult to find a medication by the way is any physician who approaches a patient with type 2 diabetes as a single entity is going to be providing suboptimal care. Yes. And I've been fighting for 20 years to convince people you need to start with combination therapy from the beginning. Finally, 2022, the American Diabetes Association has made a comment. And for the first time, suggests that you should consider starting with combination therapy. We can talk about therapy later. We're going to talk about the therapies in detail. But yes, it's a, you have to take a precision medicine approach to type 2 diabetes, which begins by trying to identify which phenotype your patient is. Before we continue, I just want to make sure that everybody understands it's looped not in in state parker. And they're the, you know, the brain child, you know, of course I'm involved. I understand the disease. We're doing the insulin clamps. We're giving them the phenotype. And they're doing single cell. And it turns out like there are 10, 12 different types of cells within the muscle. So we tend to think the muscle all this a myocite. That's the problem. But it's probably cells also talking to each other, making it even more complex. So we're at an early stage in the development. But we're enthusiastic. We think this is, I mean, we really have not discovered these genes. So we think that epigenetics are important. And this is part of the epigenetic phenomenon. We'll see where it takes us. But we're pretty excited about these findings. Let's go back to the ominous octet. Make sure I have that defined them all our listeners do. Yeah. So in 2008 at the Banting Lecture at the American Diabetes Association, the title of the Banting Lecture was from the Triamberate to the ominous octet. So what was the Triamberate? I got the young investigator award, the Lily Ward from the ADA 1987. So the Triamberate was very simple. The beta cell, it fails. Insan resistance in the muscle. When you ingested a meal, the muscle didn't take up the glucose because you're insulin resistant. And insulin resistance in the liver. When you ate a meal, insulin didn't shut down the liver. So that was the Triamberate. So from the Triamberate to the ominous octet, we needed to add five more players. So who were the new five players? So number four on the list was the fat cell. In a very deserving guy. So the fat cell is your friend initially. You over-eat, you take in excess calories, you store them in the fats on the cat hurts you there. But if you keep expanding those fat cells, the fat cells become very, very resistant to the anti-lippulative effects of insulin. And now you start to pour fat out into the bloodstream. We've shown this as a big interest to very counterintuitive. It counterintuitive. But very, very well, but not in the you have a, not that we should mire ourselves in teelologic things. Do you have a sense of why? Yeah. So the insulin signaling system in multiple early steps, become severely impaired. And when you get insulin resistance in the glucose metabolic pathway, there are changes that alter the cell metabolism. So you become very resistant to insulin's anti-lippulative effect. And so now, if you look at people who are obese or people who have type two diabetes, there are plasma FFA levels are very, very high. And those FFA levels, and this is lipotoxicity, and we've got a long history of studying this. I FFA levels impair insulin secretion. High FFA levels cause insulin resistance in the muscle. High FFA levels cause insulin resistance in the liver. High FFA levels impair the insulin signaling, transduction system. And in fact, one of my previous fellows who's now back with me here in UT, Dr. Belfort was the first author on this paper showing that just physiologic rises in the plasma FFA literally obliterate the insulin signal transduction system, which is the first step in glucose metabolism. I always thought that the reason we saw high free fatty acids in people with type two diabetes was not because the fat cells were undergoing more lipoluses. But because the fat cells were themselves becoming resistant to insulin and not able to take up fat. So same net effect, but I was kind of drawing the arrow of causality in the other direction. No, the the arrow is more in the other side. The fat is pouring in fat. Yeah. And you can show that the lipolitic enzymes are all resistant to insulin. They don't we've shown this other position. So these elevated FFA levels are a disaster. So the fat cell initially easier. Because your friend goes to foe. And then you can go to bed. Bed guy. Okay. So that's number four. Number five is the gastrointestinal tract. And of course, I'm sure I talk more about this when we talk about treatment. But when you eat a meal, you release two Inquitin hormones. GLP1 and GIP, a glucone-like peptide one, a glucose dependent insulin trophic polypeptide. Those two Inquitin hormones when you eat a meal account for about 70% of the insulin that's released in response to the meal. So now what is the problem? Is the problem that you don't release enough GLP1 in GIP? Or is it that your beta cell is refractory to the GLP1 in GIP? Well, it's the later. Just so let's say that again. I want to make sure people understand this. And the reason it's important is obviously everybody listening to us right now is very familiar with drugs like semigluitide and trisepotide. But I want people to understand why those drugs were developed. And of course, semigluitides already probably what the third generation of it anyway. So when we go back in time, we'll understand why people try to develop these drugs. But just say that again. So you eat your meal. Yep. GIP, GLP1 are increased. And they come out normally. Yep. That's not the problem. And they're telling the beta cell. Hey, make more insulin. Metis cells deaf, not listening. Is resistant to the GLP1 in GIP? And he should be responding to 70% of his input should come from that cell. 70% of the insulin that's going to come out. Is there any response to that on that GLP1 in GIP? So you can imagine that that's a huge problem at the level of the beta cell in terms of the defect and insulin secretion. And tell me, why is it mechanistically that the beta cell becomes deaf? Yeah. The GLP1 in GIP. I don't know that we know the answer to that. So it's just another horrible piece of this puzzle where everything starts to work against the patient. So this is an area of course intense investigation. But the clinical counterpart of this is you've already mentioned the drugs that are out there. The GLP1 receptor agonist. What I'm doing is I'm giving you a pharmacologic dose of GLP1. And I'm overcoming the resistance at the level of the beta cell. Now there's another component to this that we'll get to. And that's a glucose toxicity. So, and these are studies that were done by Yens' tolls in the group in Denmark that they took people and they infused GIP. We're talking about GIP. And you don't respond to the GIP. These are type two diabetics. And then they intensively treated them with insulin and lower their glucose. And then when they come back with the GIP, you're in a normal amount of insulin. So this is a glucose toxic effect. So you ask me mechanism. So we know that at least for the GIP, the glucose toxicity is impairing the ability of the beta cell to respond to the GIP. But not necessarily GLP1. No, no, and that doesn't correct the GLP1 problem. So there's true resistance still, even though I normalize the glucose in terms of GLP1. So this Inquitant Axis, the gut is a very important endocrine organ. And that's number five in the ominous octet. Number six in the ominous octet is the alpha cell. And sort of the I would say the father of hyperguguinemia, this doctor, Roger Unger, and Dallas. And you know, he was one of the very first people to show the diabetics had very high gluguin levels. And gluguin types. Yeah, gluguin is it drives a pedagluose production. So if your glucose gets too low, your alpha cells will release gluguga. So the alpha cell can sense the glucose. And so if your hypoglycemic, this is an important defense mechanism. You release gluguguin, and that stimulates your liver and the glucose production goes up, a return to glucose to normal. But a diabetic already has a high glucose. We don't want high gluguin levels. So paradoxically, there's very high gluguin levels in the diabetic. And those high gluguin levels are very important contributor to the hepatic insulin resistance, because they're driving the liver to make glucose. And so I just make sure, because I'm embarrassed to say I forget this from biochemistry, is it driving the liver to make glucose out of, for example, glycerol amino acids or the organic, organic pathway in glycogenoluses. But on a more chronic acutely. So if I acutely give you a gluguin on the first thing that happens, you break down glycogen. But very quickly, you get rid of all the glycogen that's in the liver. And so chronically, now, you're running on gluguinia genesis. But gluguin stimulates both pathways. And does it also drive hepatic glucose output? And does it just drive the creation of glucose? No, no, no, in absolute terms. It increases hepatic glucose output as well as gluconeogenesis. Yes. And that's a important reason why you have fasting hyperglycemia. So when you wake up in the morning, yeah, and your blood sugar is 110 milligrams per death. That's the liver. And part of that is because your liver is intrinsically resistant to insulin. Part of it is because the liver is now responding to the gluguin and producing an excess amount of glucose, both through gluconeogenesis and through glycogenoluses. Although I would say the major contributor is the gluconeogenic pathway. Now, that gluconeogenic pathway is also turned on because fat is coming from the fat cell. Remember, I told you the FFA is high. Yes. Glissorals coming from the fats. Yes. So in Jerry, you know, we talked about some of the work that Jerry did. This Jerry's work showing that glissoral coming from the fat cell is an important driver of gluconeogenesis. And then hepatic fatty acylcoa levels are up because you have all this fat pouring in. And that's activating the enzymes, pyruvate cobalt salace that are driving the gluconeogenic pathway. So the metabolic, the actual pathways, I think, are very well worked out. So glucone, alpha cell, bad guy. Okay. And so as the alpha cell over producing glucodon in the state? Yes. Absolutely. And this is really ragerongering dialysis. And again, why is it over producing? Why is it doing something that doesn't make any sense in the context of what's happening? And to certain way, this is also in some resistance because hyperincinemia shuts down, uh, glugoguin. And we have very high fasting insulin levels in the diabetic. Okay. Now, what is it? What's the sensing mechanism within? It's counterintuitive. Usually when things go wrong, they get attenuated, right? Like it makes sense that the beta cell eventually fatigues because that's an attenuation of doing something that it's getting tired of doing. The, the, the alpha cell ramping up is a little less intuitive. You're going to see it gets even worse when we talk about the kidney, which is number seven on the list. All right. Let's go to number seven. Okay. So people don't know, I'm, uh, you know, also board certified in the biology. Uh, so in, in the old days, I trained as a micro punctureist. I used to sit with a microscope. I, I would draw my little pipettes out the night before and then I would put the little micro pipette in the tubules and I collect two be look fluid. And what I was interested in, uh, and this is when I was a, uh, a renal fellow University of Pennsylvania, I was interested in glucose and phosphate transport. And I published the series and I, I'd say the pretty elegant papers in the JCI, looking at how glucose and what regulated glucose in phosphate transport. And I knew that there was a molecule called fluorescent that block glucose transport, uh, in the kidney. And so I took this molecule called fluorescent and it blocks, uh, glucose transporters. There are two transporters in the kidney, SGLT2 and SGLT1. SGLT2 takes back 90% of the glucose. If it does its job, SGLT1 takes back the other 10% and then in URI, even though we filter 180 grams of glucose per day, no glucose appears in the urine. But what I showed is that fluorescent it block both SGLT2 and SGLT1. It block glucose transport, uh, and it also block phosphate transport. And I showed that glucose in phosphate transport were called coupled. But when I was doing these studies, even though I was in the phylog, uh, I had previous than my endocrine fellowship at the NIH and Baltimore City hospitals. So I, I had an interest in diabetes and I said, this would be a great way to treat diabetes. So in the old days, you know, we did things for science and I published a series of four papers in the JCI and, uh, I never even thought of the be honest with you of patting this. Okay. And I have a significant other who said to me one day, she said, Ralph, you want the smartest guys I ever met and I said, yeah, I know that and she said, you know, you're probably the stupidest guy ever met. And I said, why? She said, you're going to patting it this drug. And so I actually worked with Bristlemaia's squib and then AstraZeneca and that I've actually led to the, uh, that gli, closing coming to the market. But what we showed and this is human bias, which is the first SGLT2 inhibitor. That's correct. Yes. Brand name on that one. Uh, for C for C. Yeah. And so Can I get flows in was that? Uh, ampigliflozant, uh, and then can't get flows in or to glyphlozant, we have a bunch of them. And they all made other all very good basically do the same thing. But what we showed was the SGLT2 transporter was markedly upregulated in the kidney. Okay. And uh, the original studies that we do. I'm let's just let's just wrap our heads around this again. This is so counterintuitive. I know. Okay. This does not make any sense. Right. So you take it. Let's I want to just bring it back to people listening. So they understand what we're talking about here. The kidney is this massive filtration. Another remarkable organ. Not, no offense to the nephrologist. Not as remarkable as the liver. But every bit is remarkable in terms of, I think it's more remarkable than the liver guy. So that's okay. All right. So so, so everything that's floating through our plasma is, you know, our, our kidneys, by the way, represent what they take 25% of our cardiac output. Jews. Yeah. So it's massive. This organ weighs 2% of our weight and takes 25% of our cardiac output. Why? Because we have to take everything that is in our circulation and dump it out. Yeah. And then the kidney has to selectively bring back in what's normal. This was explained to me. I still remember in medical school as kind of a brilliant trick of evolution. Evolution was never going to be able to predict every toxic thing we might encounter. And therefore teaching the kidney, how to spot toxic things and get rid of them would have been a failed mission. Rather, it was better to teach the kidney what was absolutely necessary and to discard all other things. So reasonable way. Yep. So it's the take everything out of your drawer and dump it out and only bring back the socks and underwear that you need. Yeah. So glucose, potassium, sodium, you name it, chloride, phosphate. All of these things get dumped along with everything else. Yeah. And then it knows I need this much glucose. I need this much sodium. I need this much potassium. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. So so SGLT2 does the lion's share of this. It takes back 90% of the glucose. And now. So here's a diabetic with a very high glucose. Right. So my point was SGLT2 if it had a brain would say, oh, you have too much glucose to turn it off. Turn it off. How about we just stop reabsorbing all the glucose? It's why you said it's the opposite. I told you earlier, it's going to get worse. It ramps up SGLT2. So as a doctor, I want the kidney to dump the glucose out in the urine. Yeah. But what is the kidney doing? It's doing the opposite. It's holding on to the glucose. And so even as the renal fellow became clear to me, this is such a simple way to treat diabetes. And the fact is, it's so simple. No one thought about it. Okay. The only dumb thing that I did was I didn't pat in it, which I should have done. I probably never have to write another NIH grant for the rest of my life. And then we went on to show. And in fact, this is the first definitive proof of the glucose toxicity hypothesis. So we did all of these studies initially in animals. And this was all published in the JCI. And Luciano Rosetti is one of the fellows at this time. Actually, Jerry Schumman was a fellow on the papers as well. And what we showed was that you could take a different types of diabetic animal models. And you could show that there reabsorbing excessive amounts of glucose. And then if I treated them with flores in, because that's what was available, they simply pee the glucose out in the urine. And now all of a sudden, their beta cell started functioning normally. Muscle insulin sensitivity improved. So of course, that's wonderful if you were a mouse or a rat. So we said, well, what about humans? And so the original studies actually were done. It's kind of an interesting story behind this. But the initial studies were done with double glyphosin. And we showed with just 14 days of treatment with double glyphosin, we markedly lowered the fasting and post-prandial glucose. We improved insulin sensitivity by 35 percent. And we made a major improvement in beta cell function. Now, the beauty of this, SGLT2 inhibitors are only in the kidney. They're not in your muscle, they're not in your beta cell. And the only thing that the SGLT2 inhibitors do, make you put glucose out in the urine. The only change in the plasma was the glucose came down. And now insulin sensitivity improved in muscle and beta cell function improved. And this was the first nine humans, even though the original studies were done in the animals. First, studies to show an improvement in the reality in Cuco, toxicity. What was interesting is that when we started to work on developing this with BMS in AstraZeneca, the company decided, well, we should get some nephrologist in the sea about this story. And they said, look, if you listen to what Dr. DeFranso says, this will be a disaster. They said, why? Because you put glucose in the urine, it will glycosulate the proteins, then you'll cause kidney damage. And they actually held up the development of the SGLT2 inhibitors. And the way we finally convinced them to go ahead was that this is a disease called familial renal glucoseuria. They, from day one of their life, they're being out tremendous amounts of glucose that perfectly normal kidney function. How many grams of glucose can be differentiated basically in the presence of an SGLT2 inhibitor today? Upwards, it kind of depends on what the level you're referring to. But it could be anywhere from 40 to 60 grams up to 120 grams of glucose. And the higher would be in somebody with a higher gradient. Yeah, the higher the glucose. The higher the, yes, because you filter more glucose, then this more glucose to be blocked at the level of the kidney. And these drugs are very, very good. Now, I actually in developing these drugs, as I said, I'm also an aphrologist based on the very Brenner hypothesis. I predicted these drugs would save you kidneys, according to the Brenner hypothesis. And that's all turned out to be correct. These drugs are great for the kidney. What I never, ever envisioned at that these drugs were going to save a heart. That was like that came, I mean. So I want to come back to that because I'm making notes of other things I want to come back to. And so I want to come back to just so you can hear me say it now. And we remember, I want to come back to combined inhibitors, the SGLT2 SGLT1 inhibitor. There's a, I think there's a new drug that's now. So to life, those. Yeah, that it does both. Well, just touch on that. And then I want to also come back to the broader zero protective nature of the SGLT2s as documented by the ITP in mice and then also in the human studies for cardiovascular protection. But let's before we do this. Let's go to finish the omelette. We got to go exactly. Let's go about number eight. The brain. Okay. Okay. So the brain plays a role in the somewhat indirect way. So every day, you know, you have your breakfast, your lunch. I actually eat only once a day. But at some point, you eat a meal. And at some time during the meal, I'll say, okay, I'm hungry. I stop eating. Why do you ever think? Why does that happen? Well, because there are certain hormones that are released or inhibited that tell you, okay, you're saying it's stopped eating. Well, one of the very important ones is GLP1. That same thing that's increasing insulin secretion, your brain has become very resistant to GLP1. When you eat a meal, amyline comes out. It comes out in the one ratio with insulin. Your brain has become resistant to amyline. Your brain is resistant to leptin. So there are a lot of these inorectic molecules that your brain has become resistant to. And these molecules, it's another area of interest of mine, these, they work in the hedonic areas in the brain. So in the putem and the prefrontal cortex, and they tell you to stop eating. And unfortunately, there is, and this is the big unknown is what's going on in the brain. The neuropsychotry is clearly distorted. Not only is the neuropsychotry distorted, one of the big things that we are interested in, Dr. Peter Fox and myself at UT is if you look at the gray matter in these areas, in the areas that are critically important and regulating your appetite, there's shrinkage of the gray matter area. Okay. And in these areas, if you do an insulin clamp, okay, the brain is insensitive to insulin in your eye. In obese people, these areas in the brain with his abnormal mocked increase in glucose uptake. Incredible finding. Who would have thought? I'm sorry. You're saying that these are the few areas in my brain in your brain that are actually default insulin insensitive. Yes. Don't take up glucose. Correct. If I do an insulin clamp. So what is their fuel source? Like a? Well, they are saturated. I'm sorry. In response to insulin, they don't take up more glucose. Oh, okay. Sorry. Because remember, this is from the K-Hill studies. As long as your glucose is about 50, your brain is happy. So this is actually in the evolution of the human being. This is phenomenal. Because in the old days, you may not eat for, you may slaughter one of these beasts that you're not eating for days. You're not eating for days. So your glucose would drop. So if your normal fasting was 80, if it dropped to 40, you're okay because your brain saturated in 40. You got below 40, you're in trouble. So you have a big sort of buffer here. But now if I am few as insulin in your glucose is 80, your brain doesn't take it up more glucose. It's quote insulin insensitive in a certain way. Now, of course, if you take people with mild cognitive impairment, there's been some experiments that I've seen suggest in these people. Insulin infusion can transiently improve glucose uptake. But presumably that's because they're insufficiently getting glucose in the disease state. Yes. This has been postulated. And there's also suggested that there's brain insulin resistance, which is, I'd say an interesting concept and may play some role in this neurocognitive dysfunction Alzheimer's whole kind of different story that's sort of in evolution. But to come back to the ominous octet though, if you overeat what happens, you gain weight. And when you gain weight, you become insulin resistant, severely in some resistant. That's lipo toxicity. Okay. And we've done studies in both directions. I can put an IV and I can infuse an emotion of free fatty acids. And I can show within 20, within four hours, two to four hours. I induce severe insulin resistance in the muscle. In the liver, and I'm marketing impaired based whole function. And then we don't have this drug in the United States. But there's a drug that's available in Europe and I have an I indeed use it's called the sippamox. It inhibits lipoluses. It's like STLT2 inhibitor. The only thing to do is block glucose reabsorption in the kidney. A sippamox all it does is do block lipoluses. It lowers your FFA level. And we've done this. Is it result in any meaningful clinical increase in adiposity or is it so subtle that you don't notice it? Over 12 days, no change in adiposity, huge improvement in insulin sensitivity and muscle. You can show all of these major bias. Why is it not approved in the US? I don't know the company that developed in Europe ever tried to get it approved in the US. I would say, modestly effective in lowering triglycerides. And we have phenofibrates which are much more effective. So that may be the reason all of this drug been around for... But the triglyceride in the FFA are not the same thing. No. But that's the reason why it's approved in Europe. But if you lower the FFA, that's the precursor for triglycerides synthesis. So it has an effect to lower the triglycerides. But the key thing is if you lower the FFA and we did this for 12 days, we did it both obese people in adibetic. You markedly improve insulin sensitivity in the muscle. If using MRI, you can measure muscle fat. It goes down dramatically and correlates with the improvement in insulin sensitivity. We also measured ATP generation because this issue is this clearly mitochondrial dysfunction. If you are diabetic, that's unequivocal. The controversy is the mitochondrial dysfunction causing the insulin resistance or the insulin resistance causing the mitochondrial dysfunction. So in this study that we did when we lowered the FFA and lowered the muscle content, we saw about a 50% improvement in ATP generation, mitochondrial ATP generation. So at least this says that part of the mitochondrial dysfunction is secondary to the lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. But this still remains, I would say, a controversial topic. Clearly, it's mitochondrial dysfunction. If you can improve it, that's going to improve insulin sensitivity. Is there anything that improves mitochondrial function more than aerobic exercise training? Pile glycosm. The drugs also. I can't get people to use, which is a phenomena. By activating Pepar Gema, it does a lot of good things. One of the important things that it does, it has a huge effect to improve mitochondrial dysfunction. It has direct effects. It also works directly through Pepar Gema to do this. It also binds directly to the mitochondrial pyrovac carrier. That influence is flux through the, through the mitochondrial chain. Why don't people use this drug today? Huge misconceptions. I guess we'll talk about therapy. We'll come back to it. It's a part of my triple therapy regimen. I use a GLP1 receptor agonist. I use Pile glycosm and I use an STLT2 inhibitor. There's a fourth good drug and that's metphorman. You might ask, well, why is metphorman number for amylist the good drug? Since I single-handedly brought metphorman to the United States in 1995. No other antichronolus involved in this. 1995 metphorman was a revolutionary drug. Why? We had insulin and cell phone Ureus. Now we had a drug that really could work. It's still a very good drug. Of course, it's cheap. It's $5 a month in the state of Texas. We have much better drugs. Pile glycosm causes weight gain. Here's the problem. It'll become very obvious. We talk about these paradoxes. The more weight gain, the greater the drop in A1C. The more weight gain, the greater the improvement in insulin sensitivity. And is it fat gain specifically? No. I'll come back to that in a second. It is fat weight gain and I also believe muscle weight gain. The more weight gain, the greater the improvement in beta cell function. The more weight gain, the greater the drop in blood pressure. The more weight you gain, the greater the drop in triglycerides. The more weight you gain, the rise in the higher the rise in H. The L cholesterol. Sounds like terrible drug, right? So here's another one of those paradoxes. So why would we know if you overeat in gain weight? That's a disaster. But with Pile glycosm, the more weight you gain, everything gets better. What Pile glycosm does is it shifts weight around in the body. In my opinion, it's the best drug for treating Nash. No drug is going to be Pile glycosm. Okay? And the pharmaceutical companies, they don't. If you had to go up against Pile glycosm, all these Nash drugs, I don't believe you can be Pile glycosm. What's the brand name for Pile glycosm? Attoes. Okay? So, the, as I said, there's this, no paradox. So why do you gain weight? Pile glycosm. It redistributes fat in the body. It gets it out of the muscle, puts it in subcutaneous tissue. It gets it out of the liver, puts in subcutaneous tissue. It gets it out of your beta cells, puts it in subcutaneous tissue. That's not going to make you gain weight. The richest density of Pile glycosm receptors in the hypothalamus. So when I activate these Pile glycosm receptors in the hypothalamus, you eat. Okay? Makes you hungry. That's got nothing to do with redistributing the fat in the body, except they parallel each other in association. And so you see the weight gain and people say, well, that's bad. But what's really doing the thing is this recycling. Okay? And moving the fat around. The other negative thing about Pile glycosm is it causes fluid retention. Okay? So people have associated fluid retention with heart failure. Now, why do you get fluid retention? Again, this is people do not understand. Pile glycosm, the only thing, the only drug that is a true insulin sensitizer is Pile glycosm. Met form and it's not a true insulin sensitizer. That total misconception. Pile glycosm, that insulin signaling defect that I told you about. Pile glycosm corrects that defect. It's incredible. So we kind of glossed over this Ralph because we're going to spare people the details, but it's probably worth just reminding people. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor. Yep. That's outside the cell. Yep. Is that a, that's a, that's a, that's a kinase receptor correct. The three tyrosine molecules. Yep. And they have to be phosphorylated. Yep. And if you, in these are studies, then Ron kind of the people embossed. And you mutate one of those tyrosines. You come a little insulin resistant. You mutate two of them. You become moderately insulin resistant. You mutate three of them. You're severely insulin resistant. Insulin binds to the receptor. Yep. Okay. That happens normally in diabetics. We showed that there's no problem there. Then IRS one, insulin receptor substrate one, moves in which is inside the cell, comes up. Yes. Yep. And it, it interacts with the insulin receptor. And it gets, it falls for related on the same three tyrosine molecules. And then you activate P. I. Three kinase, AKT, AS110. We could add some more molecules in here. But this is the insulin signaling pathway. That's the pathway. The earliest defect that you can show in diabetics is in that pathway. Okay. And if I recall, didn't, isn't this where Jerry argued that the intramyicellular lipid was creating the defect in that pathway, the accumulation of intramyicellular lipid? So what Jerry showed very elegantly, okay, is that there are certain lipids. D. G. That is, and it's a specific D. G. They're like several types of D. G. At molecules, which has confused things. So you show, and this is a specific one of the D. G. That activates these eight, eight typical P. K. C. molecules. And that serene phosphorylates the insulin receptor. When you serene phosphorylate the molecules in that pathway, it interacts with them. Okay. And so he's done these very nice elegance that he's both in, in, perform muscle and in the liver showing that this plays a very, very important role in the insulin resistance. This is part of the lipo toxicity. I don't believe that this is the genetic basis, the genetic ideology. This is, you get fat and you start putting fat everywhere. This is very important, critically important. And that was when he gave his banting lecture. And I might say, I'm delighted that I got to write his letter of nomination for the Banting Lecture. He was incredibly deserving. He's done phenomenal work in this area. But that was his Banting Lecture. And you're right. Very, very, very important mechanism of insulin resistance. And so given that that's both a very important and very common pathway towards insulin resistance, bringing it back to P. Pargamma. P. Pargamma is part of the pathway. It's part of the IRS one P. Pargamma P. I. Three K. Yes. Glute for bringing the glucose in the cell. In other words, if people don't want to get mire down in this, which is totally understandable, insulin hits a receptor, that receptor kicks off a cascade that ultimately results in a little tube, being like a little straw that goes into the cell surface that allows glucose to freely flow in against its in its gradient. But remember that same pathway also activates natural oxide synthase. That's right. Generates nitrogoxide. And that's why we see in patients with insulin resistance, even if glucose is controlled cardiovascular disease is still a very important, very important point. So back to actos. Yeah. So it is. So now what does it do? It activates that signaling pathway. You generate nitrogoxide. Now you vasodilate. That's why the blood pressure drops. When you vasodilate, so I'm in a phrologist, I understand this very clearly. Anytime you end up refuse the kidney, you're a whole lot of salt and mortar. You become a deminist. Okay. And so people associate fluid retention in a demon with heart failure. So we did the definitive study. It's published in diabetes care in 2017. People just don't read. Okay. So we took people who had diabetes and we treated them with paleolidism. And then using NMR, very, very sophisticated techniques. What we showed is pale glittersone. Markidly improved my cardiovascular blood flow. Now these numbers are going to blow your mind away. Markardial insulin sensitivity with pet and flow deoxy glucose improved by 75%. Your heart we showed this before is severely ins and resistant. I came pretty damn close to normalizing it's an insulin sensitivity in your heart. Now since we're doing the insulin clamp with treated glucose, you can track it. 74% improvement in skeletal muscle insulin sense. Exactly the same. If you look at ejection fraction, it went up by 5 to 10%. Not down. It went up. If you look at every measure of diastolic dysfunction, E over E over E prime, LV peak filling pressures, et cetera, cardiology people understand this. The point is whether you're looking at systolic function or that is not function, it all got better. So it's a bit of a maybe not so nuanced thinking about the drug. Yeah. Now the critic would push back and say, okay Ralph, but don't we have better drugs like I mean? No drug that they corrects insulin resistance. That form is not an insulin sense thizer and people keep going back to this. So I brought my form into the US in 1995. I know this I did all the mechanism of action studies. And what we showed was the insulin clamp. The drug absolutely does not improve insulin sensitivity. So let's talk about that form and everybody wants to know if metformin is geo-protective, but let's just remind people. Metformin inhibits complex one of the mitochondria is that electron transport chain is that given. Yes, and I'd say this is still controversial. And high doses for sure, yes. And the kind of doses you see with giving metformin, I would say somewhat equivocal in my opinion. So is the belief that metformin's efficacy in diabetes is through reducing hepatic glucose output? That is a hundred percent true. Okay. And what's the mechanism by which it reduces hepatic glucose output? Inhibiting the mitochondrial chain and inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Well, for sure it inhibits gluconeogenesis. Okay. Now metformin gets into cells through the organic cat ion transporter. The organic cat ion transporter doesn't exist in muscle. It can't possibly be an insulin sense thizer and muscle. You're asking the drug to do something that's impossible. And if you give labelled metformin. Does it get into muscle mitochondria? No, it doesn't get into muscle at all. Why does lactate go up when people are taking metformin? Level of the liver. It's interfering with a robotic metabolism. And so there's a block. And this is very important. I have erroneously always believed that some really happy to be corrected. I love being proved wrong. I have always believed that the reason we saw an increase in fasting lactate, even in healthy people if they took metformin was because of the inhibition of the ECT in skeletal muscle. No, no. And you're saying Peter's all in this not possible. It can't get into skeletal muscle? As absolutely not a single molecule in the world of metformin has ever gotten into any skeletal muscle anywhere. And tell me again why what's the transporter? The organic cat ion transporter. That's the transporter at by which metformin enters cells. It does not exist in skeletal muscle. It does not exist in cardiac muscle. So metformin cannot get into these tissues. It's a huge major misconception. It can, if you have very, very high doses that can occur when you have very low GFR because metformin is excretive by the kidney. If the metformin levels build up, you can get lactate gas doses. That's a very, very rare complication. This is not a reason why you shouldn't be using the metformin. And I'm not saying that metformin is not a good drug. It is a good drug. I don't think it's as good as the other three drugs we talked about. But yes, it does at high doses increase elactate level, all in effect on the liver. And the old drug that caused all the problem was fenformin, and by one eye as well. But it had a powerful effect. Your fenformin was much more powerful. Yes. And that's why people were afraid to bring metformin to the US. And when you say high dose, I mean, is two grams a day of metformin? No, that's the normal dose. That's normal dose. Okay. So metformin has the following going for it. It's free. Yes, it's basically free. Yes, it's free. Absolutely. And it does a pretty good job at reducing hepatic glucose output. And it has no myotoxicity. Correct. Frankly, any toxicity. Yeah, the GI, but you can usually overcome that with a slow ramp up. Yeah. And see, this is the reason why some people thought it's an insulin sensor dizer. 15 to 20% of people have significant GI side effects and they lose weight. And if you look at the studies on average, there's about a three kilogram weight loss with metformin. And when you lose weight, you can improve insulin sensitivity. So I think this is what's confused some of the old literature to make people think that metformin was an insulin sensor dizer. But when we developed metformin, and I did all of the work that went to the FDA, if you look at the New England Journal Medicine article, 1995, they're only two names on the paper, myself and a PhD oncology lady who was the person from Leapha Farm Bersuticals. We did insulin clamps. Many of them. We never could show metformin improvements. And then you said, David, using the gold standard with rayo isotopes. Do you think many people, I feel like I'm asking you this question a lot and it's getting a little old. But do you get the sense that most people are still thinking what I think? Which is that metformin gets into the muscle, metformin's an insulin sensor dizer. And it's an insulin sensor dizer by getting into the muscle and inhibiting complex one. Absolutely. Yeah, okay. People have done pet studies. So you can label metformin and you give it. Okay. And then where do you see? It's all accumulating in the liver. Okay. And the first three, four, five, ten minutes. And then what happens? You start to see it accumulating in the kidney. Okay. Why? Because that's where it's excreted. And then wait another five or ten minutes. You see water. Water. Okay. And that's the only place where you see metformin. You never see it in a muscle. Okay. And that's even more graphic demonstration. You know, that metformin is not getting into muscle. And it is definitely not an insulin sensor dizer. Is there a downside to using metformin in combination with the other three drugs of which we know? Nope. The classic study which we'll talk about, which to me should change the entire approach to treating diabetes. It's called the E-DIC study. And in the E-DIC study, what we did is we used triple therapy right from the beginning. And my point of the banting lecture, the ominous octet. If you have eight problems, and I'm sure it's going to be more to be found than I can give you a few more if you want. But if you have eight problems, why in the world do you think one drug is going to correct eight problems? And it could happen in our lifetime. So the point was you need to use drugs in combination. So we said we're going to use what, what we think are the best drugs at the time. So we started with metformin with the Xenotite. And all time GLP one. This is not the kingpin. This is the pre-lear glutite. Yeah, exactly. Because that's what was available. That drug was useless. Wasn't it? No, it's a good drug. Wait, sure. It's not some a glutite. Yeah, it's not that. But you have to start some. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Let's pay it. It's due as being the Gen 1 OG version of that drug. Was that which we might not have? We wouldn't have some a glutite or a chisper type. Yes. So it's kind of an old time. And in P.O. Lidso that was the triple therapy. Okay. And then we said every diabetic patient that 315 people in the study, they're having insulin clamps, hyperglycemia clamps, muscle biceps, known in the world can do this study. 315 people follow for six years. Okay. So we said, this is what we believe is the appropriate therapy. And then we said, we'll use the ADA approach. The ADA approach is you start a metformant. Okay. And when you fail, even not explicitly said the next drug that you use this cell phone, you're is. And then the third drug that's added is insulin. And we said that the goal of therapy was an A1C of six and a half. Okay. And that if you're A1C rose above six and a half, either on archipel therapy or on the stepwise treat to fail approach that the ADA says, ADA says, start metformant. You fail. You add cell phone. You're real. You fail. You add insulin. You titrate the insulin basal insulin. So it's up to 60 units. And we said 60 units is really will cap it because you're already a two X physical object. And now you have to now split the dose of insulin. You have to be adding rapid acting insulin. I think this is quite reasonable. Six years later. Okay. 29% of the people with the ADA approach have failed. The A1C is above six and a half. Six years later with our approach, 70% of the people have an A1C that's less than six and a half. Why? Insulin clamp. Huge improvement with our therapy. Okay. This is the EDX study. The three-year data published the six-year data we're writing it up. How much improvement in insulin sensitivity with the ADA approach? Zero. Beta cell function. You have almost a normal beta cell. Who are off? Why the disconnect between between what you're seeing in the EDX study and what the ADA is promoting? You have to ask the ADA. What's their answer? If I'm a patient and I'm or if I'm a physician who's treating these patients and I'm saying guys I'm confused. I'm looking at the literature. I'm seeing this. I'm looking at your- I'm by the way, I see this with the AHA and cardiovascular guidance. So I'm not singling out you or your- Yeah. But like, is this simply a question of the pace at which medicine moves is so glacial? That's part of it. Plus, remember, if to do three and a 15 people, follow them for 16 years and do all this stuff we did, it's not equivocal. And why has there not been political pressure? Because the cost of insulin is enormous and more approach is going to be less expensive. They finally said in 2022, this is statement. The ADA approach is not based on pathophysiology. I view myself as a scientist, okay? As well as a clinician. As a good clinician, I taken care of hundreds of thousands of patients and I've done 850 publications. I do clinical research. I work in people. When I do an insulin clamp study and I see an improvement in insulin sensitivity, I do a hyperglycemic clamp and I see in 315 people, your base of function, I don't need 5,000 people. I don't need- I can't do this study in 5,000 people. No one can do this study. But the tools that we're using are so powerful. Look, if I normalize your insulin sensitivity and I give you a normal beta cell and your A1C is less than 6 and a half and it's half of the 315 people, why you not think that's the best therapy. Okay? And now on the other side, I have this metformin-SU insulin and that 71% of the people have failed. There's zero improvement in insulin sensitivity. Zero improvement in beta cell function. Well, you think that's a good regimen. And now above and beyond all that, I didn't do this study. This is the great study. G-R-A-D-E. It's sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. And what the great study said is- and I have to say this is the third study that's shown when I'm going to tell you. Dr. Robert Turner's United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Studies showed this in your 1990. Stephen Kahn showed this in the adopt study in year 2005. And now we have the great study. 2020. I called this the 15-year Revolution. Revelation. We saw what didn't work 1990. Oh, Stephen Kahn did it again. Oh, it didn't work in 2005. And now 2020, and I did it. You know what? All show the same thing. And this was a sequential approach. You had to fail on metformin to get into this study. Okay, so you failed in metformin. Then you entered the study. Then we go single agent. I can, they, they want to know what's the best next drug to add to metformin. I can add a cell for all you're, yeah. A when see went down in year one, up straight. I can add, tell folks how a cell for all your rear works. Yeah, cell for all your rear is our old time drugs. They bind to the cell phone area receptor on the beta cell and the kick out insulin. And they're very good drugs in the first year. And then they burn out the pancreas. And well, they stop working. Yeah, I mean basically, they don't, they kick the can down the road without addressing the pathophysiology. It, that, I like that way. Yes. Then, other drug, DPP for inhibitor. Tell people how those work. So a DPP for inhibitor increases your GLP1 and your GIP level. And, and dodgously, it makes your gastrointestinal cells the K and the L cells that secret the GLP1 and GIP makes them make more GLP1 and GIP. But it, it doesn't increase the GLP1 and GIP enough to really give you a knockout punch. I give you an injection. You all, people are out there, uh, MontGiro or SamogluTide. That's the knockout punch. Okay. When I give you the DPP for inhibitors, they, yeah, they, they do increase the GLP1 and GIP a little bit, but not powerful enough to give you a long lasting effect. So first year, A1C comes down, A1C goes up. Uh, third drug, that, this was very surprising to me. This was LerigluTide. This is one of the earlier GLP1 receptor drugs. Yeah. I thought that was going to work the best. It failed. It worked in the first year and then failed. And then the fourth drug was insulin. And the, the docs just didn't type to ate the insulin enough. So A1C had that and then they failed. So five years later, all four of those regimens added to metphonement failed. Triple therapy, Exendotype, an old time GLP1, PLL, which people don't appreciate. The only true insulin sets thyser and metphonement, six years later, you're 70% of the people have an A1C less than seven. And, and let's just go back. Metphonement is free. The Gen 1, uh, Exendotype. Exendotype. Exendotype. Basically free. It's basically free now. PLL Litison is five dollars a month. Okay. So we have three free drugs that work better. Correct. Now it's interesting. When you talk about today's triple therapy, which is way more efficacious, different to those three drugs are very expensive. Yes. Yes. GLT2 inhibitors are very expensive and the modern day Gen 3, Gen 4, and soon we'll have a Gen 5. Yeah. GLP1, they're very pricey. If they're $1000 a month for the, yeah. Now are they great drugs? So the question is of course. Yes. But, but I guess the question is, do they do you need to be on those drugs if your old version of triple therapy? Our old version is incredibly effective. The problem is you can't get people to use PLL Litison. And the reason is the patients are frustrated with the fact that they're retaining water? Uh, no, more that they, they wait game weight. How much weight do they gain typically? How many do they gain? The pens on the dose. Like I don't go to the 45 milligrams, those. So at the end of the year, they may gain two or two and a half kilos at the 15 and 30 milligrams dose. Okay. But there anyone sees control? So you have to explain to people. Here's another incredible thing. So there was a cardiovascular. This is truly incredible. By the way, I'm sorry to interrupt you again. If you give PO plus a modern day G, G, 1, we've done offset the weight. Okay. Oh, you lose all the weight. You go lose with the G, L, and receptor. So if a patient is willing to go down the path of a modern day G, L, P, 1, that's because of that completely eliminate. Absolutely. And he also gets rid of the edema. Yeah. And believe me, there, everyone sees her down in the normal range. You know, if you took my hands. So let me tell you this first thing about PO, L, is on an proactive comeback movement. Yeah. If this. So in the proactive study, this was done long time ago. You have to show cardiovascular safety. 5,238 people to get in the study. You had to have an MI stroke of something bad. Have people on PO, L, is on have to people on placebo. Okay. And the MACE endpoint, major adverse cardiovascular events, which is non-failm i, non-fatal stroke cardiovascular mortality, you have to show the benefit to get approval by the FDA. The MACE endpoint was positive. Okay. And so when I talk to cardiologists, I like to say, what was the one thing in the PO glycosone that predicted that you would not die? They don't know. You know what the one thing that predicted that you wouldn't die? Wait game. Hmm. So I jokingly say, look, you can either be a little fat in alive or you can be lean in dead, which one you're going to pick. I think I go for being a little bit chubby. So again, but now, that's not even a necessary comparison. You don't even need to make that trade off with a modern day GOP, what I'm going to say. And we've done this and we've done this. If you tied my hands behind my back and said, Ralph, you can only pick one drug. I would pick one of the newer GOP ones. They're incredible drugs. Now, but that's not what I'm going to do. Even for a lean diabetic? They're a little bit different story, but the answer is basically yes. Okay. But let me narrow that down a little bit. If I had to pick two drugs, I would pick peeled littison with one of the newer drugs. And for sure, if you had any kind of renal of cardiac disease, I'm going to pick an STLT2 inhibitor. But I would say, although this study will never be done, if you're a newly diagnosed diabetic, you don't have any cardiac symptoms. Why do you think that the STLT2 inhibitor is not doing all of the beneficial things in that newly diagnosed diabetic that it's doing and the people who get into these studies already have cardiac disease. So if you have a cardiac problem, I put you on the STLT2 inhibitor. You're less likely to have MI stroke, et cetera. It's doing good things. It's doing, in my opinion, the exact same good thing and someone who I'm just diagnosing for the first time when I put them on the STLT2 inhibitor. But no one is ever going to do a study. It's impossible. I'm going to take 1,000 people you have to take 5, you probably have to take 20,000 people, newly diagnosed. And then 10,000 going, STLT2 and 10,000 on placebo. I'm going to follow them for 20 years to see who's going to have their heart attack. No one's going to do that study. Are they going to get all kinds of drugs? So no one is going to be able to show. But that's sort of like, yeah, that's never going to happen. But I also don't think it needs to happen in the same way that I agree with you. In the same way that we saw, for example, you know, PCSK9 inhibitors reduced mace in people with secondary prevention. Yeah. Take people who had already suffered mace, put them on a PSPSK9 inhibitor, you secondary prevention reduce subsequent. Well, of course, everybody's using these for primary prevention. Now that's effectively what you're saying. Sure. We already know the STLT2 works for secondary prevention that may never get approval for primary prevention. But it probably justifies it's a way of playing it. Yeah. I agree with you 100%. So just to make sure I'm synthesizing what you're saying, Ralph, if you only get one drug and your price agnostic, GOP1 agnist, if you get to add a second drug, you're going to add PO. If you get a third drug, especially if you care about your heart, STLT2. Yes, STLT2. What's amazing is metformin didn't even make the top three in your list. But it's never for it. But so here's my question. Given that metformin is free, yeah. Should we just be adding it the second we put on the GOP1? I don't have any problem with that. Yep. And also we have to be cognizant of the fact, you know, these new GOP ones, they're what they're supposed to be. Yeah, but they're $1000 a month. Yeah. So, you know, I want to ask you about that. So, so the just again for the listeners, right? The semi-glutides Gen 3 Trezzepotide is Gen 4. Reddit TrueTide is coming out assuming the phase 3 goes according to plan. And Kagee Sema is the new Nova one. Yeah. So here, let's go back to Reddit TrueTry. Yeah. GLP1. Yeah. GIP. And Glucogon. Glucogon. Can you explain that in the context of the octet? Where Glucogon is going up? Yeah. I can. I think. Okay. But it's not proving. All right. Okay. So, remember, I told you that insulin knocks down Glucogon. So, if I give you a GLP1 receptor agonist and I kick out insulin and I get you well insulinized, any negative effect that might be related to Glucogon is going to be updated. Okay. So, that Glucogon effect to drive a paddock glucose production will be totally blunted by the insulin secretory effect. And see, this is the other thing about this is me about these GLP1s. These are the best drugs in the world for losing weight. These are the best drugs in the world for saving your beta cell. People, I told you that when you eat a meal 70% of the insulin that's secreted is coming from the GLP1 and the GIP. People are not talking about this effect on the beta cell. This, I told you, if you want to look at type 2 diabetes, big problems beta cell failure insulin resistance. These GLP1s, they're saving your beta cell. I mean, we forgot about we've come so enamored with the weight loss. And I don't want to downplay that at all because the weight loss and the lipo toxicity, a huge problem is causing the insulin resistance. But people are forgotten how powerful the drugs are on the beta cell. So, when I give you this drug and they work on the beta cell with kick out insulin, any negative thing that GLP1s doing will be totally negated. Now, you may see some good things that GLP1s are doing that we couldn't appreciate before. So, what are the good things? Some people have suggested that the increase is thermogenesis energy expenditure. I don't believe that. There are animal data. I don't believe this in human. I believe that it's exerting an inorectic effect in the central nervous system. That is, I think, yet to be established. Pretty sure there's that is going on now at the Pennington Institute. And maybe also in Orlando where they have these chambers where you can. Yeah, yeah. So, I think we'll get an answer about you know, energy expenditure. I, yeah, I would be surprised if they're going to see a clinically meaningful increase in non-involent energy expenditure. I think it's all appetite. And here's another issue, okay? So, it is very interesting if you look at all these big GLP1s studies, cardiovascular. What's the reduction in cardiovascular events? Almost uniformly 20%. All dudes, ex-enitide, et cetera, Lyrgyl, et new dudes, 20%. Even though the weight loss with the new ones is much greater. I suspect in terms of cardiovascular benefit, there is a cap that once you've lost a certain amount of weight and you've gotten a certain amount of lipo toxicity and all the good things that these drugs are doing, you don't go beyond that. Even though you're losing more weight. And also, if you look at the A1c, you know, yes, Monjaro does drop the A1c a little bit more than Semaglu-Tide, but they're both pretty powerful. Retouritide does a little bit more than the Cardi-Cardi-Sema do a little bit more, but they don't do a lot more. So, I also think there's also going to be a somewhat of a cap on how much you drop the A1c. You know, you get two and a half percent drop. Can you drop it three? Do you need to drop it three? So, you're saying if a person shows up with a, let me go up in A1c of nine and a half percent. Yep. This is a person who hasn't come to medical attention soon enough. And I'm going to give you the answer definitively, but I'm a little bit just to ask the question. You're happy if they only go from nine and a half percent to seven percent. If they only had a two and a half percent drop, you wouldn't try to get them down to six percent. I would and we've done this study. Okay. All-time guys, all right. So, this is called the Cotars Study. So, there's this concept that's out there and again, people don't what's always amazing to me. What drives me as science? If you understand pathophysiology and this in abnormality and you correct the abnormality, things get better. Okay? So, in the Cotars Study, and there are 220 people who are so in the study. To get into the Cotars Study, you had to be poorly controlled and met form in cell following real. So, you had to have failed on this. And the average A1c was about 10. And about a third of these people were symptomatic, meaning they had polyuretholic dips here, they were losing weight. And so, the current concept is, in those people, you would put them on a mixed split insulin regimen. You would get rid of the glucotoxicity, you would get rid of the lipotoxicity, and you get their A1c down to six and a half. And then, now you could put them back on the oral medications or whatever. And now they respond because you got rid of the glucotoxicity in lipotoxicity. We said, well, that may or may not be true. So, we said, well, half of these people are starting with an A1c above 10. We'll go on a mixed split insulin regimen, okay? With a large union of rapid acting insulin. And the other half, I got to go on that old dude, ex-editide, MPO-gletizo, one of the people I like to use, okay? Three years later, the A1c in the group with the mixed split insulin regimen is 7.1%. And we're very good at insulin. Why couldn't we go lower? Because we got into trouble with hypoglycemia, okay? The A1c in the group, treated with ex-editide and PO-litisone is 6.1%. And so, then we said, okay, look, we'll do a subgroup analysis. And so, about one third of the people were, we'll just look at the people who are symptomatic. The starting A1c is 12.2. Three years later, their A1c is 6.1. How long? 6.1? Three years later? 12? Yeah. 12.2 symptomatic. On which combination? He's an Italian PO-gletisone. Without even metformin. Without they'd fail or metformin, they'd get into the study, okay? So, what we're saying? Look, if you have drugs that correct the insulin resistance, that's PO-gletisone. Again, Ralph, this is almost impossible for me to imagine. I can send you all the papers. I'll publish, but I just, I hope every single family medicine internist, everyone who ever takes care of somebody with diabetes is listening. I also do, because you're basically saying, we can take these two old, cheap drugs and take someone from the most brittle type two diabetes. I mean, a hemoglobin A1c of 12, very mad. We're knocking on death's door. Correct. You're going to go blind. Yep. You're going to have your toes amputated. You're not ever going to have an erection again. And you're going to die of cardiovascular disease or kidney disease or Alzheimer's disease quickly. These numbers, I don't have a telly there right from the paper, and it's a lie. It's over 200 people. And in a couple of years, on two old, cheap drugs, you're normal. Yep. And what makes these studies so solid is we have very sophisticated pathophysiologic measurements. No one can do what we do. So the only way back is those patients are going to have to gain a couple of kilograms of, but of course, if you're willing to now spend a bit more money and switch them from Gen 1 to Gen 3 to Gen 4, GLP 1, Agnist and GIP, then all of a sudden you ameliorate that and you get all the benefits. This becomes an on-issue. If it puts costs the side. In fact, if you, I would wonder if you add metformin, you almost cancel out the weight gain a little bit. Because you might get a little bit of the GI improvement and you get the two to three kilos of weight loss there. Minus. These drugs are so powerful and you put them with peel, lit a zone. You don't get the, you lose almost the same amount of weight. They're huge in terms of getting you to lose, lose weight. Which was that study? This is called the Qatar. It was done in Qatar. QA. I think Qatar are the country. The country. I need to give credit to Dr. Muhammad Abdu Ghani, who's been my coworker and all of these studies. My amends on the faculty at UT in our diabetes division. Can we at least assume that the Gulf states are paying attention to this? A the study was done in Qatar. B the Gulf states are disproportionately ravaged by Type II diabetes. Yep. Is it at least being heated there? They are. And I can tell you we have a big program that's going on there as well as in Kuwait. And we actually have a formal cooperative agreement with the Kuwaiti people. So at the Dazman Diabetes Institute, we have trained them. My people have been there, trained them how to do these insulin collapse and sophisticated metabolic studies. And they take here the patients and we're comparing the genetic. So here's another thing that's pretty exciting that we're doing. So again, it's looking for genes that cause diabetes. So you eat a meal. Okay, you eat a meal. Your glucose goes up. That's a great insulin. There's, I mean, no acids in the meal. That's a great insulin. And GLP1 goes up and that's a great insulin. So now, when you eat a meal, there are already three stimuli. And now you're looking for a gene or a set of genes that might be associated with beta cell failure. When you have three stimuli, now that's going to be pretty confusing. So what we said, what maybe what we should do is that we should do a three step hybrid lysemic clamp. So we give you three steps of glucose and we can get beta cell sensitivity to glucose. From the slope, I give you a little rise in glucose and other rise in glucose and other rise in glucose. I see how much CPAPTide comes up. The slope of that curve is that's beta cell sensitivity to glucose. And then the M value is where it hits the axis. And then I can get glucose. But this is just now I'm going to focus on the beta cell. Okay. Because the hyper lysemic clamp is just for beta cell okay. And then after that, now I'm going to give you GLP1 infusion. And I'm going to see how much insulin comes out. And then after that, I'm going to give you an balanced amino acid infusion. I'm going to see how much insulin comes out. So you can sequentially measure the different three different stimuli. And now what we see is different low-side. Some are associated with the effect in glucose. Some are associated with the defect in amino acid. So again, the more you can refine the phenotype, the more likely you are to identify defects that are at the level of the beta cell. Let's go back to the guitar study for a second. How many people were in that study? About 2020. Okay. Big study when you do these insulin clamps, these kind of measurements are not easy to do. That was published one. Let's see. I would say the one and a half year data would probably about 2018. And the three year data I would say 2021-22, something like that. I can send you all the references. Will link to all of these in our show notes for folks. Yeah, just simply phenomenal. Let me ask a question. If you take an individual with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance and you presumably collecting urinary CPAP type for 24 hours is the best surrogate for insulin, total insulin secretion? No. Well, it's an index. Okay. So if you could quantify total area under the curve of insulin for a person and then you gave them a GLP1 agonist, is total insulin going up or down? The pens. Because you have competing factors going on here. And I'm not trying to be elusive because I don't know. What I'm telling you is actually real. It's what happens. So the drug is going to kick out insulin and CPAP type is going to go up. And now the glucose is going to come down. And then you need less insulin. And then you need less. So depending upon the relationship, okay, when you look at absolute terms, okay, the CPAP that insulin levels actually may be lower. But now when you express how much CPAP type comes up for the rise in glucose, huge increase. Okay. So you always have to have in a something that you compare it to and that's the increment in glucose. And anytime you look at how much insulin comes out or CPAP type, which is another confusing fact, which I'll mention in a second, you always have to relate it to the glucose area. When you do that, a huge increase in beta cell function. Okay. And the other thing you have to be very careful about is you need to be measuring CPAP type not insulin. And because what we've shown is that when, and this is a compensatory mechanism. Maybe just tell folks, I threw out CPAP type as though everybody knew what it is. That's a mistake. Tell people what CPAP type isn't what its relationship is to insulin. Yeah. So when you ingest a meal, you, they're saying precursor that contains both CPAP type and insulin pro-insulin. And so you split off CPAP type and you split off insulin. And they both come out in the one-to-one molaracio. The problem is half of the insulin that comes out is taken up by the liver. So you never see it in the circulating bloodstream. The CPAP type is not taken up by the liver. So everything that comes out you see in the circulation. So when we want to know how much insulin was secreted, we actually don't measure the insulin. We measure the CPAP type. And that's the true measure. Now the other confounding feature here is we show this and this is now been reproduced by many other people is that when you become insulin resistant in diabetic, your beta cells don't secret enough insulin. That's one of the big defects. How do you compensate? You don't destroy the insulin that's secreted. So the degradation of insulin becomes markedly impaired. So you can have a high insulin level either because you secret too much insulin or because you don't destroy the insulin. So measuring the insulin level is not a good measure of beta cell function. If you want to know about insulin secretion, measure the CPAP type and express it per rise in glucose. It gets a little bit more clouded because your beta cell also can recognize how insulin resistant you are. And so it knows, look, if you're this insulin resistant, I need to secret more insulin. If you're a very insulin sensitive like your lean person with normal glucose tolerance, you don't want to secret much insulin or you get high-bolglycemic. How does your beta cell recognize that? Well that's some controversial, I can give you my thoughts about it. But in either case, so measuring beta cell function is not just simply measuring insulin. That's probably bad. Your measuring CPAP that is better. measuring CPAP type, paris and glucose is better. And then for somewhere and other, if you can express this all, per insulin resistance, this is called the disposition index, something that Dr. Stephen Kahn developed with Daniel Port many, many years ago. So simply looking as I said as insulin or trying to do an OGTT and come up and say you know how the beta cell is working, that's not so good. And that's why I say like in the contours study in the EDIC study, we're doing such sophisticated measures of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. You do 350 people, that's like doing one of these big cardiovascular studies with 5000 people in it. The pathophysiology will always tell you the truth in my opinion. If you know what the problem is and you correct the problem, the A1C is going to get better. A8A does not emphasize pathophysiology, you know? You had geracial men on it. I'm sure Gerrie will tell you exactly the same in I think very simply, you understand what causes a disease and then you can come with the treatment that will make it work. Do you have any concerns with long-term safety or anything other than simply the economics of the GLP ones in this current generation? Again, huge, huge leap forward between Lyra Glutide and Semiclutide. And I've discussed briefly elsewhere on the podcast what the roadmap looks like for how many of these drugs are in the pipeline. Oh yeah. There seems to be no end in sight. We're going to look back at Semiclutide and say God, that thing was pedestrian. That's going to happen. So give us the bear case. What should we be concerned with? What should be at least looking out for it? Yeah. I would say, overall at the present time, I would consider these drugs to be quite safe. The major issues, Jeff, they'll go slow because of the GI toxicity. Where is the controversy involved and it's something that I'm involved with myself? When you lose 20 or 30% of your body weight, you lose muscle mass. Okay? Now, I just gave a talk on this to one of the pharmaceutical companies that involved in this area. I'm not going to name the name of the pharmaceutical company. But I started off by saying, look, here is now a study with real data. This is a gastric bypass surgery study, room-wide bypass. And the people lost, I think it was 33% of their body weight. And their lean body mass came down quite significantly. One of the problems is people make your lean body mass and that's not a real measure of muscle mass. In fact, it can be a very bad measure. You should measure muscle mass. But let's assume that the lean body mass largely reflects the reasonable assumption of muscle mass. So muscle mass came down. Okay? So why is that so bad? But how much did it come down? Because if your total body mass came down by 33% but three quarters of that mass was fat. Yeah. And only one quarter of that was lean. We would consider that acceptable. And this is where the controversy is because no one is really measured muscle mass. That's right. We're doing it. Okay. We will have it definitively. And you're doing that with MR. Yeah. Okay. So it's gold standard. Okay. But now I said, look, in this study, they measured absolute strength. You can do grip strength or leg strength. And absolute strength went down a little bit. Okay? Maybe 25%. With these patients exercising during the period. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. No. No. Then they said, let's express strength as a weight loss. Yeah. Who? By 50%. Per appendicular goes up by 50%. And then they said, how far can they walk? They went from walking 200 yards to two miles. And then say, one of the things is how many times can you get up out of a chair in a certain period of time? And it increased like three or four fold. And they measured your VO2 max. Of course, which is heavily dependent on weight as well. Yeah. It all got better. But in absolute terms, the VO2 max get better, not necessarily. The total VO2, not normalized per kilogram. No. Everything got better. Okay. So I said, so why you guys? That's counterintuitive, by the way. Normally when you lose weight, VO2 max and leaders per minute does not improve because you have less metabolic tissue. But here, for whatever the reasons are maybe all of the fat that's pushing on your lungs. So you can't oxygenate the epocardial fat that's not allowed in the heart to contract. The fat that's in the heart is causing myocardial lipotoxid, which I believe is real. These things are all changing in a positive way. So again, it's a balance. So yeah. So of course, they don't like this. Because if the people in, they had all kinds of psychological questionnaires. Why weren't they happy with these results? Well, because they, now the companies are all looking at developing drugs that will preserve the muscle mass or increase the muscle mass. But basically what I'm saying is that look, there's a huge, it's lean body mass. But we have to say, it's reflecting muscle mass. Everything gets better. The patient feels better. They can walk better. They feel stronger, et cetera, et cetera. Why are you so worried about muscle mass? Like, I look all these gloomy faces because they're all developing mice that inhibitors are and so then the next slide comes up and says, retort. Here's a good thing. Okay. So now, if you lose all of this body weight and you improve insulin sensitivity and muscle, and you improve it in the heart and there are cardiovascular benefits and you correct the improvement in all of the cardiovascular risk factors. Now, even though you lost muscle mass, if you've improved insulin sensitivity, there may be any enormous benefit of seeing the improvement in the muscle insulin sensitivity, even though you've lost muscle mass. And they do have some concerns about these drugs, these amounts that never, that actually may have some negative effects in the heart. And my suggestion is actually, you may find a big improvement in my cart of function from these, how cl- where are myostatin inhibitors in their development, right? Thanks, too. Yeah. And of course, I think we've talked about myostatin before on the podcast. When you inhibit myostatin, you increase the expression of striated muscle, of which cardiac is striated. It was through the event to A and to B system. Do you think that's a more promising pathway than the follow-statin pathway where follow-statin Yes, I do. Increasing, increasing follow-statin inhibits myostatin, but this is a more direct way to go about it. This is a more direct way to do it. So you can either have their antibodies by a group of to myostatin or you can interfere with the signaling receptor itself. And we think that this can still be effective in a fully developed and mature adult. I mean, clearly this would be effective during development. And we see that in the animal. Yeah. Is it how effective is it? Because a lot of the animal work is sort of a character sure stuff. It's knockouts, right? They take myostatin knockouts and they look like bodybuilders. Yeah. But if you take a mature chicken or a mouse that's two years old and you give it a myostatin antibody, how robust is the response? Even more so, let about in human. Yeah, exactly. We don't know the answer to that. So what the phase two studies, obviously the toxicity passed in phase one. Yes, yeah. I'm not concerned. There doesn't seem to be any adverse effect of these drugs or they wouldn't got through phase two. And there are actually some fairly large phase two medication. The indica. Is it a sarcopeneo? I don't know. You know, the FDA, if you have a sarcopeneic disease, there are criteria that the FDA has established. If you want to develop a drug that you have to meet certain criteria, I'm not an expert in this. So I can't tell you exactly what these criteria are. But they're pretty well established. Okay? Now, for these kind of people and I'm going to come back, you asked me about lean people, come back that in a second, because this is really an issue. What? Let's say I put you on a gelp1 receptor against the new loss 25% of your body weight. And I put you on a mice that inhibitor and that prevented the muscle loss didn't increase it, but just prevented it. So relatively. But that would be ridiculous. I mean, if you took a 200 pound individual, whose 30% body fat. So they've got 60 pounds of adipose tissue on them. Yep. If you took 25% of their body weight off, you take them down to 150 pounds. But you're telling me potentially we prevent any deterioration of lean mass. Yeah. That means they're down to 10 pounds of fat mass on 150 pounds of lean. So I'm making an assumption. Okay. This is remarkable. Yeah. So let's say that happened. Okay. What would be the FDA's criteria? I'm going to give you approval for this drug. I think the FDA would ask that you've also improved function in some way. Yes. And the function would probably be have to be determined through absolute strength, not relative strength would be my guess. So I don't know the answer to this question. Because that's it. Because the way I think about these drugs is less about that situation. It's more in the it's more in the sarcopenic adult. This is the lead, particularly the old person. That's right. That's right. This is the elderly individual who's sarcopenic. Yes. Fall risk is enormous. Yes. And their risk of fall and morbidity and mortality is very high. Yeah. And in that individual, I don't think the FDA will be satisfied with simply an increase in lean body mass unless it is accompanied by strength. Now, I think that some of the tests that are used here are silly. I think the six minute walk test should be folded up. This card put in the waist basket and never discussed again. It is such a stupid test. They do it all the time. I know they do and kind of just makes me want to scream. Yeah. We need much more rigorous tests than a six minute walk test. We need a test that is actually more of a sub maximal test. So if we're testing cardi respiratory fitness or some sort of peak aerobic fitness, we have to do more than walking. And if we're testing strength, I much prefer grip strength, leg extension, bench press. Again, these can be done with machines. They can be done very safely. But we really need to test strength. Well, you see, you're raising very important in critical issues. Because there are many, many companies that are going ahead with these drugs. That increase muscle mass. But to me, okay, increasing muscle mass, what does that mean? It needs to be some functional translation of that. And by the way, there could be other functional benefits that exceed strength. For example, glucose disposal could be a function. That's the one that's put at the top of the list. That's right. Get rid of the insulin resistance. That they have to, they won't give them credit for that. I don't think. Yeah. But I think that again, it's harder to tease out because there's more moving pieces and they might argue there are easier ways to increase insulin sensitivity glucose disposal. But one way to think about this is to go back to what if you did it the old fashion way? What if you got in the gym and lifted a bunch of weights? That's been done. Yeah. And it increases insulin sensitivity and functional strength. And so the question is, can we replicate that pharmacologically? And that is actually exactly the way I ended my discussion to these people. I showed them what resistance training did. And if you could show what resistance training did with your muscle mass increase, then you'd have something. But you need to design this studies appropriately. And as I said, as you said, I don't know what the criteria are going to be that the FDA uses to judge these things. They do have a sarcopenia set of criteria. But that's a very different group of people that we're talking about. But this comes and hits on one of the things you asked me earlier. What about the lean person who's 80 years of age? Is this the right drug for that person? I don't know. Maybe not. But now let's say you have a healthy, 80 year old person and everybody in the family lives to be 105. And they have diabetes. Well, they're at risk to, you know, the toxic effects of hyperlaseemia would it be reasonable to treat that person? We know this powerful effects on the beta cell. I would say it would be quite reasonable. But I think you need to monitor what's happening to their weight and other features. Here's a bigger issue. Childhood obesity. You are obese when you're four years of age. You're going to be obese when you're at that. And your life expectancy will be significantly and your quality of life will be significantly reduced. Now, I can even better. At lessons, these young kids with diabetes, they don't respond to any of the drugs. What is the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in under 18? It's increasing, but I would say maybe around 4 or 5 percent something like that. 5, 120 teenagers has type 2 diabetes. I guess I'm biased by San Antonio, because we have more people with type 2 diabetes in our clinic. But you could say potentially in San Antonio, one out of 2018 and you're going to be very high. That is for average or pre-divies. And I'll tell you about the pre-divies that we did. So now, let's say you're, and we know these studies are out there. These kids, and this began in age, sponsored study. They don't respond to metform itself, all you read is they don't respond to any drugs very well. Even the GOP one I can ask? The first study has just come out that respond better. It's a little agglutite study. They don't have any of the two. But if you're just clinically, if you're in the clinic, and you're treating them without, you know, you're using the best drugs you have available. Here's, here's your travel. And we know, why? Because you can't get them control. Why? There's an ink. There are so insulin resistant, much more more so than adults. These are well published studies. Is this not so much? Is the causality here not? Is this really a selection bias where for someone to develop type 2 diabetes as a 16 year old, the underlying genetics and pathology are so severe that the current crop of drugs are the problem as opposed to when you take the current crop of drugs and you apply them to people who are young, they don't work. All three, because I'm a bit more, genetic predisposition. So Hispanic population is problem. Obesity, all of these kids are huge. Okay. So you don't have the lean diabetic phenotype in the age. Nine of these people. And then the drugs don't work very well. And so all three of these things. And what now is come. It's called the rise study. And these kids have been followed up. They're starting to develop kidney disease. They're even, I'm told a couple of people have had MIs in their 20s. They're incredibly difficult to control. What do you think? I mean, not that, I mean, yes, we're going to argue that these kids are that this is due to what they're eating. But what is it in the environment that is so a piece of genetic to these kids? I'll come back to this in a second. But I want to raise the issue now. Let's say you're 16 and you don't met moments of these drugs or not. You're anyone see us nine? You can put someone on my jarrel. And they're going to have to take this for the rest of their life. Because as soon as you stop the drug goes on. So this is what I treat the person, of course. I can't let the A would see nine. But if you take that 16 year old with a hemoglobin one, two, nine, and you give them a jarrel. Where are they in a year? I think that if they can afford the drug and they stay on the drug, the three big gifts, if the doctor knows what to do, I know what to do. If the patient will cooperate with you, if you don't, they'll lose every time. And if they can afford. If you can satisfy those three F's, that person we know from the studies be pretty well controlled. And insurance, what fraction of insured patients will have coverage on Mingero if their A1C is nine? I don't, I can't answer that. But does CMS cover it? Does Medicaid cover that? Yes, if you have diabetes. I don't know. The Mingero coverage I think is pretty good if you have diabetes. If you have obesity, that's a different, if you have obesity without. That's a whole different issue. Should you be treating these young kids who are obesity is a disease. It's got all kinds of problems. Should you put these young kids on these newer drugs? And knowing that all I did is change you from food addiction to drug addiction. I didn't do anything else. It's almost like alcohol addiction, okay? There are drugs that things I can give you that can help you, but it tend to relapse. Food addiction, I put you on the drug, you lose weight. You stop the drug, you regain the weight. This is a huge public health concern. It's almost way beyond my capacity because finances are involved here. Can we afford to treat 42% of the people in the US or obese? Or is there some way amongst the 42% we can define who are the people who are in some resistant, who are the people of the metabolic syndrome that we know they're at risk, that we can treat them. My guess is that's the great majority of that 42% of the people. Can we treat all of those people? And moreover, they're going to stay on the drug. We know on average what the data is saying. I put you on the drug. We don't know all the reasons why, but within a year, half of the people stop the drug. Yeah, it's probably a combination of cost and side effects. Yeah. And my patients very commonly tell me, you know, say Ralph, I enjoy eating. I can't eat anymore. And some people just tell me they just want to eat. And so I'm going to get fat against. So when you eat, some is GI side effects. And some is cost. $1000 a month. There's a lot of money for it. Yeah, it's insane. Yeah. For the people. So Ralph again, I just kind of bring it back to this question, which I mean, everybody wants to understand this, which is what has changed so much in the last 30 years that has created this epidemic. And, you know, everybody has their favorite pet theory for what it is. It's the sugar. It's the carbs. It's the plastics. It's the video games. It's the internet. It's the whatever. Perhaps suggesting that it's many, many things. What is what is your best explanation for what's going on? I would say all of the above process foods, chlorically dense foods, lack of exercise, a critical. But these are, I would say, the stimuli that has done something that's changed the North circuitry in the brain. So yes, there's a stimulus. And because now you've been oversubscribed to these stimuli, that's now initiated a process in the brain, which is going to be a self-fulfilling process. This is something that I'm very interested in, Dr. Peter Fox and I at the Health Science Center. But if you go through the literature, and we've published on this as well, in the areas of the brain that control food intake. And I'm not talking about the hypothalamus, that kind of regulate your basal energy intake. What you need to be, keep your BMI of 25, do what you do during the day. But what is it that makes you a BMI go to 35? That's all related to the hedonic areas in the brain. The putin, the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, et cetera. And then when you do structural MRI, what you can show is that those areas in the brain, the gray matter, is shrunk down. And if you now map the neural circuitry, which Peter Fox has been involved with, you can see that this clear disruption using functional MRI of the neural circuitry in the brain. We have a particular interest in defining where this function occurs. And we have some ideas which I'm not going to go into, but how we might be able to sort of reprogram the brain. And sort of in concert with this, these are not updated, but these are data that are published in the literature. And I think I mentioned this earlier, if you do an insulin clamp, I told you that in your brain doesn't respond by taking up glucose, but in people who are obese, actually almost improposited to how obese you are in these areas in the brain, hedonic areas, there's a marked increase in, it's called Florida deoxy glucose, which is the pet railway step tray, so we use in these areas. And that correlates inversely with the muscle insulin resistance. The more insulin resistant they are in the muscle, the more FDG glucose. I'll take there is in the brain. Now this is very interesting because what it's saying, there's a connection that somehow or another, we believe that the brain is talking to the muscle, or the muscle is talking to the brain, and that somehow or rather the brain is playing a very important role in the development of the insulin resistance and that in large part that this deranged neurosurgery, which is related to food intake, is now making you overeat. And as you overeat, then all of the things that we know that we've studied, that other people have studied, that go with lipo toxicity, you put fat in the muscle, you're insulin resistant, you put fat in the lip you got nationalneffled, what people have totally overlooked, you put fat in the kidney disease, you put fat in the heart, yeah, yeah. So you've been in San Antonio since the late eighties, when did you really start to notice this was a problem at least in your community? Almost intangiously because I've run the text, even in kids, even in kids. It was very cool. We can't blame video games, we can't blame social media because that wasn't going on in the late eighties. So I never saw fat kids at Yale, and I was on the faculty from 75 to 88, and I kind of thought back, now I would say New Haven's not a large Hispanic, but it's more African-American, but I don't remember seeing 12-year-old kids with type 2 diabetes, and when I came here, and I remember this very distinctly, they're saying, oh, you're crazy. You can't, you don't see kids with type 2 diabetes. Believe me, I see them. And what did your colleagues at San Antonio tell you as far as when they started to notice that in the Hispanic kids? I think they just, I don't know I can give you a specific time that they told me except they knew it. But so okay, what about in non-Hispanic kids? Because if the Hispanic kids are genetically predisposed, then the question becomes, when did you begin to see this in African-American kids and Caucasian kids? Yeah, so we don't have a large African-American population here, but like in Philadelphia, there's a lady, so we're so far as slabian, she sees the same thing, and she sees, I think it's a significant African-American population. So I think that in certain ethnic minorities were the genes for diabetes are enriched, that those are the populations that are predisposed. And do you think this is mostly an energy balance issue and therefore it's mostly a food environment issue? No, I think it's both. So I told you I'd come back to the genetics study that we did. So we, in the Italian fellows with me, Giovanni Gulli, a long, long time ago here in San Antonio, we wanted to know what is the earliest defect that you can see in people who are going to develop type 2 diabetes. So we said, okay, in the Hispanic community it's very common to see mom and dad with diabetes. And it's very common to see a lot of children in these families. So we said, why don't we go look at the children? And let's see if we can define because they're at high risk. Yeah. And if you have mom and dad with diabetes, you probably have a 78% chance if you're Hispanic. If you're born in that family developing diabetes. It was very easy to find the children. The problem was we couldn't find lean children. So it took us a while because if you're obese, then you got the lipo toxicity. So we finally found them. This is a JCI paper I believe. And so we did an insulin clamp. Here is resistant is their parents. They have normal glucose tolerance. Why? Because the insulin levels are astronomical. And then we do a muscle count. How high just for understanding? Oh, they're like two times normal. Even higher than that. We do a muscle biopsy. The same defect in the insulin signaling pathway. How many of the, how many of the tyrosine kinase defects do they have? They have starts at IRS 1. Uh-huh. Insulin bind to the receptor is okay, just like their parents. The ability to activate these insulin signaling pathway, the level of IRS 1, it's already well established. Which enzyme in particular? It starts at the level of IRS 1. It starts at the first one. Yeah. Also it's not just one enzyme. Well, it no, it's IRS 1. You can't tyrosine phosphorylated. You cannot activate P.L. I see. Okay, so it starts at IRS 1. Yeah. And then the other thing, Jerry and I have both done this in somewhat different ways. So Jerry, I'm talking about Jerry Schultm. He uses NMR by looking at phosphate derivatives. Even though I believe the primary defect is in the signaling pathway, there's clearly severe impairments and glucose transporting phosphorylation. His work would suggest that the primary defect is at the level of glucose transport. We did, we developed a novel triple tracer technique using three isotopes infused into the breakout artery. We believed that the primary defect is at the level of hexokinase and phosphorylating glucose. So we kind of agreed to disagree because we can't do this study. And we'd have to do the MRI study at the same time we're doing the triple tracer technique. In addition to the incident's signaling defect, there's a severe defect in glucose transport and phosphorylation. Once, let's just make sure people understand this is we're kind of getting into some biochemistry here. Yeah. When glucose enters the cell, passively, there goes for transgloat for transporter. Yeah. It gets pre glucose in the cell. Yes. Then to metabolize it. Yeah, first and then phosphate. Yeah, the first step to that is hexokinase, which takes a phosphate off ATP and puts it on the six position if we're not able to do this. It's a specific type of hexokinase that's hexokinase do. Yeah, because there's a different one in the muscle and the liver, correct? And that is correct. So, Gerry would say the primary defect is in Glutin for the transporter. Yes. I would say yes, that is severely impaired, but even more severe. What does remind me what Gerry believes is wrong with the Glutinase transporter? That it doesn't work normally. I thought it worked fine. It's just not getting the signal to work because of IRS 1. That's where the controversy is. How, how, how when you have a severe, we are, we were the first to show this defect in muscle. But with the old people, I think they're showing this in human muscle. It's been shown in rats, et cetera. That to me, metabolism and rats and mice, so different, this is all people data. So you're saying but it's possible that just having the IRS 1 problem is enough. It's also possible that even if IRS 1 is functioning reasonably, if Glutinase is not getting up, and there is evidence to support that. And then it's also possible that even if all those things work, if you don't get hexaclinase to phosphorylate glucose, you back up the whole system. And I can show you this is a primary defect in pyruvate dehydrogenase in in Glutinase. This comes back. I have an ominous octet for the insulin resistance. Okay. This, this why people don't understand. Look, there are eight organ sort of things that are a problem. There are eight problems I can show you within the muscle. Why you think one drug is going to correct all these problems? We need drugs to work on the beta. So we need insulin sensitizes. We probably need different types of insulin sensitizing drugs. We need drugs that reverse the lipo toxicity. And you know, will we ever have a single magic bullet that corrects all of these? You know, probably not. I think until we discovered the genetic basis and remember, I said the diabetes is a heterogeneous disease. And I did, in diabetes metabolism reviews, I would say 30 years ago, I wrote a review article that said, I can put a defect in the muscle in reproduce diabetes. I can put a defect in the liver and reproduce diabetes. I can put a defect in the fat cell and reproduce diabetes. I can put a defect in the beta cell and reproduce diabetes. And I went back and read that and I said, I can put a defect that starts in the brain and reproduce diabetes. So we see some of the day when see you eight or nine. All these defects we've been talking about, they're already there. So you put that defect in the fat cell. They can look lean. And there's a syndrome called Alzheimer's syndrome. There's a specific defect. And this is white adipose. This is Phil Cher, who will love me for saying this. He's the top guru in adipose, metabolism up in Dallas. And it's also from syndrome. There's a specific defect in the glucose transporter and white adipose tissue. You know what happens? You become diabetic. You know what happens? You game weight. You know what happens? You get nash. So here's a defect that I said, like 30 years ago, I just postulated and said, here's a syndrome. And not only that, now that they define this in people in this paper, they then went to the animal model and they knocked out the gene that's causing the defect and they reproduce diabetes in the normal rat model of the model. So we're off. I want to close by bringing it back to something that people can do to help understand if they're at risk, either lean or otherwise. We talked about it at the outset, but didn't go into it in detail, which is the OGT. Yeah. The oral glucose tolerance test. Now again, none of us have the privilege of being able to use a euglycemic clamp both clinically as physicians or as experienced at his patients. So we're going to have to kind of rely on other things. We're going to have to rely on body fat. We're going to have to rely on triglycerides. We're going to have to rely on hemoglobin A1C, although I find that to be a particularly useless metric. Not that useless, but the individual level I find it very unhelpful. I think at the population level it's great and in deltas it's great. But boy, the correlation between an e-moglobin A1C and realized glucose levels it's pretty weak. But let's talk about the OGT because this is not a test that is done frequently. I believe it should be. And I'd love to have you walk us through the interpretation of the following. I'm going to give you a couple scenarios. So case one, I'm making this up as we go. So you got a person who starts out all these people are going to start out normal. They're going to start out with a glucose of 90 in an insulin of 6. At 30 minutes, this is after 75 grams of oral glucose. The insulin rises to 90. The glucose rises to 130. At 60 minutes, the glucose is down to 100. The insulin is down to 60. And we'll just do one more check at two hours. The glucose at this point is 60. And the insulin is 20. That is a pre-diabatic state. This is a very insulin resistant person. And two, our later hypoglycemia is a reflection of the beta cells early insulin situation. This is kind of a pre-diabatic state. Yeah. And it's so agree with you completely. And we see this all the time. This is a person, by the way, with a perfectly normal hemoglobin A1C. Yes. And this is a person who gets passed all the time as totally normal. This is really an sum of reasons. Because your, the beta cells are not as 90. Your hemoglobin A1C is normal and your insulin is 6. Even if the doctors check insulin, but as you point out, the thing that trips you off is not their glucose. 90 to 132 a 100 is amazing. It's 90 was how high the insulin was at 30 seconds. And of course, they overshot, which is why they become hypoglycemic. Yes. Okay. Well known. Yep. Okay. Go another one. This person also starts at 90 and 6 at 30 minutes. They go to 180. Yep. Insulin goes to 30. Yep. At 60 minutes, they go to 200. Insulin is 40. They diabetic. We showed one. But just be clear. This is a person. These are almost real cases. By the way, this person who's hemoglobin A1C is 5.6. Got it. We already published this. Yep. The best predictor who's going to get diabetes is a one hour glucose greater than 155. And this is from prospective data from the San Antonio Hardsteady also from the botanious study where these people have been followed up. We were the first people to publish this. Oh, I'd say 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago. They're banned. I'd say at least 15 to 20 studies that have reproduced what we showed 10 years ago. It's a one hour glucose is more than 155. Yeah. And that's a great predictor of type 2 diabetes regardless of all the other metrics. Yes. And if you also happen to be hypoluncinlymic, that adds more to the addictive value. But just pick one 55 without knowing the insulin, that's a huge predictor of whether you're going to develop diabetes and that's from the San Antonio Hardsteady and that's also from the botanious study and also from our various study. Okay. Next case. I'm not even going to give you the numbers. I'll just describe it. This is a person who has a delayed onset of insulin. So in other words, they start out normal at 90. 30 minutes insulin is deficient. That's a predictor as well. Yes. So what's going on in this person? We're 30 minute insulin does nothing. Glucose rises. Yeah. And then in an hour and 90 minutes, the pancreas kicks on and starts to dispose of glucose. What's happening in that person? That's a bit primary beta cell defect. And one of the earliest things you can detect in people who are predisposed to develop diabetes is loss of first phase insulin secretion. Now first phase insulin secretion is strictly speaking can only be measured with the hyperglycemic clamp that we develop. So when I acutely raise the glucose from say, you know 90 and I raise it to 200. And the first 10 minutes is a big spike of insulin that comes out. That is typically lost in people who are going to develop type 2 diabetes. And it's counterpart during the OGTT is the insulin level at 30 minutes. Okay. So when you ingest the glucose, of course the rising glucose is more gentle. When I acutely raise your glucose from 90 to 200, that big spike of glucose gives the first phase. But a low insulin response in the first 30 minutes is another predictor of who's going to get into trouble. We use the following numbers in our practice as what we consider what we want to see. Do you think we're being too aggressive? At time zero we want to see you less than 90 and less than six. At time 30 minutes we want to see you less than 140 and less than 40. At time 60 minutes we want to see you less than 130 and less than 30 and at two hours we want to see you less than, sorry, at 90 minutes we want to see you less than 110 and less than 20. Do you think we're being too hard? Yeah, you might be being overly aggressive. But for sure, if they meet those numbers, you're probably safe. Ralph, I don't know where the time went today, but it went. And this was a fascinating discussion. I could talk about this stuff all day long. And it's interesting because someone listening to this podcast who heard the podcast with Jerry Shulman from probably three years ago will be pleased because the overlap is virtually zero. That's what's amazing about a topic as rich as this. As you can talk to two of the world's experts and have two completely different conversations. Conversation with Jerry focused so much on the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Here we focused much more on the actual organ specific aspect of type 2 diabetes. We got a master class in the pharmacology of it. And then I think kind of brought it back to ways to diagnose it. If you're slumming it with those of us in the clinic, who don't have claims. So maybe we should in the future we do them with both Jerry and I. I will 100% agree that in a few years we come back and we do a double version of this. I really do fantastic. I sign up. Ralph, thank you so much. Not just obviously for this, but for your contribution to this field. Okay, I appreciate it. This is wonderful.

talk a little bit about this loaded word of trauma. Really embracing a definition, moments of perceived helplessness. You know, that's what's going to activate the limbic system. What would you say to a person who's listening to us, who's trying to even understand if they've experienced trauma? Learning coping skills in safe offices with therapists. It's really hard to recreate that back at home. I'm going to day two of my journal here. I can't help but feel like it's a mistake to be here. How could this place, this experience, possibly make a meaningful difference in my life, trust the process they say, surrender to it in quotes. I'm told, okay, I'm here and I guess I'll try. This is hard work and this is uncomfortable. And if it wasn't, there would be a lot of people all the way back out that heel trying to get in here. But if you noticed, there's no line. There's no line to get in there. You know, if someone's listening to us and they're sort of contemplating, either dipping their toe in, you know, by working with a therapist and trying to probe some of these things, or if they're thinking about jumping in the lake and then going to a residential place like the bridge. What would you say to them? If there's a voice saying it, listen, if there's a voice, even if it's a whisper, it's there for a reason. And I say more important than anything else. You're either going to deal with it or it's going to deal with you. Hey, everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Jeff, Peter, kind of hard to believe we're sitting here, huh? Yeah, it is hard to believe. And it's amazing. And it's good to see you. Likewise. I thought long and hard about how I wanted to sort of structure our discussion today, knowing that this was a conversation I wanted to have for a very long time. And, you know, I think maybe the easiest way to start is just to kind of talk a little bit about this loaded word of trauma. When I first was introduced to this idea of trauma, I didn't know what it meant. And I think today it's become such a catchy buzzword that everybody is traumatized by something. And I don't know if that represents a pendulum, swing, or a normalization, or what. But why don't we just start with kind of how you describe trauma as a trauma therapist. And as someone who's been doing trauma therapy for many years, not just in the, you know, in the recent trendy years for whatever that means. But how do you describe this to people? Well, I would have described the same way that you described it initially, you know, back in the day, you know, trauma. You know, I have to have been at Vietnam for a time, nine, eleven. These are those big tea traumas you hear some folks use that type of terminology. But within the spirit of the work, the need and the work, really embracing a definition, moments of perceived helplessness. So, you know, that's what's going to activate the limbic system. So, who is to say what one limbic system evaluates as helplessness versus another? All right. So, that's when we get into this, I think, discovery of most of the people that I meet. Have been meeting over the last several years. Or the ones, wow. Like, I think I did experience trauma, right. You mentioned it's, it's a much more popular thing. And now are we trending in a different direction. So, and a lot of my work with clients individually or groups, you know, I say, I hate to over-simple five things. But I think sometimes we just make things to damn complex. Okay. And so, you know, a lot of what I do is try to depolarize for folks, you know, and we get into these situations to where, you know, we live in this world of get over it. It doesn't matter versus, like you mentioned, perhaps. Stay stuck in it, right? So, but yeah, moments of perceived helplessness, you know, activating that limbic system. And these things can happen, you know, sometimes the bridge you remember we talked about wounding events. And one of those would be a tragic event. You know, life seems to be going one way before this thing happens. And then this thing happens. And life changes. And everything is different on the other side of that, right? A big T event versus someone again who, maybe you could describe it as a thousand paper cuts, right? Someone growing up going through childhood daily, being limbicly activated. But moments of perceived helplessness, that stuck for me. And it stuck for a lot of clients. I've written about this in the book, which is that, you know, even I met at a place called the bridge to recovery in December of 2017. So hours ago. And, you know, that was a very hard chapter for me to write. And one, I wrote somewhat reluctantly. But also in the unfelt I couldn't not write it. So the book was sort of incomplete without that chapter. So maybe we can even frame this discussion around how a place like that comes to exist and how therapists like you work at places like that. I'll throw a one idea out that's worth discussing, but it's literally one of a hundred, which is it might be shocking to some to realize how much group therapy is done at a place like the bridge to recovery. In fact, as I looked through my journal, which I brought back, looking through the notes, it's amazing how complex it was for me to be able to open up in front of a group. And how I spent the first few days saying virtually nothing, largely because of, I think, that that discomfort. Sure. So maybe tell folks a little bit about the bridge, the type of work that's done there. I forget exactly how I described it in the book, but I described it as this wonderful horrible place in the woods of Bowling Green Kentucky. Yeah. Some folks call it a residential treatment, some people call it trauma camp. There's a lot of different. Well, I wrote some other names down here. Do you know what I have? I have camp misery, the sadness factory and the tree of pain. Yeah. Those are the names I wrote down for. And I could argue with any of those. So what is it? It could be described as residential treatment, and I would describe it as residential treatment for disconnection. Okay. So when folks think of, I think when most folks think of disconnection, they get a little like well, that's vague. Okay. But when most folks think about residential treatment, we tend to jump to substance abuse. That's where people go so that they can go away and get sober. Okay. And so oftentimes the question would be like, well, why would somebody go to a place like this that's not an addict? I want to use that type of terminology. Well, disconnection is just the concept that's used at the bridge. And it's a word that describes one way of disconnecting is substance abuse, but also screens, sex relationships, ego, anger. So you just take away the substance, take away the word alcohol, and plug in whatever word you want to. You mentioned the group process. So you might have a group of eight folks and there may be three folks in there that identify as substance abusers and there could be two work of hallics in that room. Right. And so the commonality within the circle is going to be, you know, you may disconnect differently than I do, Peter. But the commonality is that when especially when life throws us a curveball, this disconnected version of me seems to come out, jumping my driver's seat, if you will. And that's probably been happening a lot as far as a cutie goes if that's where how you find yourself at the bridge. Yeah, they'll say and there's nobody gets there because it's a slow Monday. Okay. So and then the big word that you use, which I think is, it doesn't matter. There's a part of me that wants to say like, oh, don't give away the secret, so let the magic happen. But I also, you know, going through the program to work there and know that you can know everything that's going to happen and then you start going through the process and discomfort towards it's all about. Right. That's when my stuff comes up. So that's the whole idea. Right. So when folks, you know, if you remember admissions days on a Monday, so we would usually meet the groups on by Tuesday and countless times, I've tried to help talk folks off the ledge of leaving. And in summary, there are reason all of them different details. But you know, I came to the bridge and my anxiety was at a seven right now. I think it's a nine. I need to get the heck out of here. This place ain't for me. You know, and sometimes I look at me like I've got, you know, two heads. When I say, you know, actually you're provide an evidence that this is exactly the type of place for you. So yeah, that first day there, that Monday is, um, is a very, very, I mean, it's a very unpleasant day. I'm sure for everybody. I don't, I don't think that's a stretch to take my experience and say that that that was unique um, the, um, maybe it's worth kind of explaining again how what, what are the objectives of this phase one that you describe? From the beginning, I would say getting my history straight. Okay, the telling of my life story. Same sample. Several folks, many folks have done it before, but within and through the lens of what we introduce as far as the trauma tree that you referred to, like, it's the what happened to me. Story and so many of us for so many years, sometimes decades, have been telling the story of what's wrong with me. And so from the very beginning, the shift is to it, the hope is to move a little bit closer to what happened to me, right? Not within the spirit of an excuse, but an explanation, right? Like, oh, wait a second, it makes sense that I do this thing now. This, there was a utility to this behavior, right? The group process, it's just, it just brings up the stuff. I call them the guards, parts there, pistol call them protective parts, but this isn't new. There's something that we use terminology that's new, but it's ego states. But when I say guard, this protective side of Jeff that comes up when he gets vulnerable. And when do I get vulnerable? Typically, when I get dropped into a different situation. So that first week, I'm going to live with some new people. I'm going to eat with some new people. I'm going to share story, share deep information about myself. And that's really the objective is to start. Within the technical thing that's happening therapeutically, there's a window of tolerance that we all don't have, right? And so we don't want to drop into week two or can we start doing these experiential therapies, right? But within the spirit of a window of tolerance and experiential therapy, telling your life story is experiential therapy, right? The contents important, Peter, but so many times the way the story is told is more important or as important, at least as the content of the life story. You talked about the trauma tree, maybe we can describe the roots and branches of that tree in some detail because that is kind of the meta structure that I think that story gets told. It's the cause and effect piece of it. At least that's how I sort of came to understand it. Right. I've seen many different ways that trauma is described. Obviously since I left the bridge, I've been to the topic. I'm personally very interested in for myself for patients, et cetera. But I say, Jeff, I always come back to that structure and I think it is the single best one I've seen. Now that doesn't mean that it is the best one. It's just the one that resonates the most with me because causality means so much in my world. And I like the idea that even though it's not a one to one mapping, everyone who experiences this trauma will have this manifestation, not, but if you accept a little bit of the randomness in the system, it's pretty powerful. So maybe walk people through the five roots and the four branches of the trauma tree. The five roots of the trauma tree, that's the what happened to me. Okay. So this can be seen through the lens of trauma. And for folks where trauma is just too big of a word, I can't I can you believe I'm saying that on this podcast. But okay, then lose it. Right. Highly stressful events. Okay. So abuse tends to be the one that we talk really the least about at the bridge because that's the one that folks tend to know the most about. That's not to mean that we minimize it. There's just so many different forms of abuse, physical, emotional, abject, social. So you move over from abuse and you look at something like neglect, which can be very tricky. So many folks that have experienced neglect. It's an eye opening experience. Because while something like abuse is something that happened to me, neglect is something that failed to happen for me. Right. And so to see that through the lens of high stress or pain, so many different ways one can be neglected. You know, an example that's used there is the little boy that is going to school and he's being bullied. Okay. And he's got these parents who are professionals and they're successful and they're busy and they've got the best of intentions. But they're missing it. They're missing the look on this kid's face when he comes in every day and before he gets on that bus every morning. That question's not being asked. What's happening? And so every day, this little person's being required to go to this place where this thing's going to happen and evidently these folks at my house don't have time. Right. And it's important to emphasize, I think, the word intention because intention is not required. Right. How many times have I said, have I heard, well, they had the best of intentions that tried that it still happened or in the case of neglect. It failed to happen. Okay. In measurement, that's a wounding experience where you've got a boundary violation. Right. So that can happen within the spirit of what we call emotional insist. Where a child is put in an inappropriate and age inappropriate position. Maybe the child becomes best friend, counselor and confident for a mom or dad. And then you've just got this in golfing and measurement, which happens a lot of times in successful families where outcomes and expectations are celebrated and they're not so much the journey. And so that in golfing and measurement can be one of those situations where this is the way to be more of a me mini me relationship between a parent and a child instead of that eye valve relationship. And so in in those situations with with a measurement, what typically happens is either drink the kool-aid, get on board with it or what do we do? We rebel. And I'm not going to do anything that looks anything like this. Neither of those things is probably who I was meant to develop into. Yes. I think probably in my opinion the umbrella wound or we're talking about the tree and the root of the tree would be abandonment. Okay. And physical desertion or abandonment, that's low hanging fruit as far as I think the general public and knowledge just when somebody leaves. Now a permanent abandonment obviously someone passes away, there's death, there's seasonals, folks leave for work, military deployment, folks go to prison, parents get separated, parents leave, come back. Now emotional abandonment. That's that situation where someone's there, but they're really not there. And this emotional self gets denied. And a lot of times when you're emotionally abandoned, it can be a situation where it's emotionally cut back, meaning the house I grew up in, we did anger. That's what we did. What no k to be sad, what no k to be scared, but we did anger. Okay. So it wasn't like we were emotion free. It was just we were cut back to that one. That's the one that I saw the most. And then sometimes it's just the situation where it's cut off and splank in no emotion. And I mentioned already the tragic event route of that trauma tree. And so I guess what I mean by the abandonment for me being this umbrella wound is, is when you abuse me, you abandoned me. I keep going to parents because those are the folks that we spend the most of our time within those formative years, but any of these wounds can happen with anybody in our life. And they can also happen anytime in life. It's not limited to childhood. When you get something happening when the brain and the body's developing, right? You get something what I call, it gets concrete. You know, that gets cemented. It gets burnt in. And that thing that I'm talking about getting burnt in is how I adapted. All right. I mentioned that the question is what happened to me, but I believe the most important discovery is how I adapted. Okay. We talk about that tree and you were talking about the roots being the wounding experiences. And then that's top of that tree is the manifestations if you will of the wound in this, right? This is how I survived. And so you have codependence. You have addictive patterns. You have attachment issues. And a whole slew of just survival strategies. Mallow adaptive survival strategies. And as I say that word, maladaptive, I want to wash my mouth out with soap. Okay? Because they are ingenious damage control strategies. The way I describe them, it's an old friend that served me well. And perhaps now it's making life hard. And the best example of I can give is have a four-year-old boy spending a lot of time in his bedroom playing with the door closed, playing loud. So that he doesn't have to hear what's going on in the rest of the house. And then one particular day, he hears his mother and a voice he has never heard before. Tell his father that she thinks her arms are going to be broken and he has to open the door. And when he opens the door, he sees his mother up against the refrigerator. And her father, the boy's father, he's got her in a hammer lock, arms behind her. And the little boy's got to do something. Right? And he's really outgunned. Because let's say dad's 35 and he's four. So he starts walking towards them. And the first room on the right is a bathroom. And he goes into the bathroom and he lifts the lid on the toilet and he faints, fakes, acts as if he's vomiting. And the next thing he hears is, do you hear that your son's getting sick? And dad, let's mom go. Now, there's the boy go back into his bedroom and get out a little journal and write down manipulation and deception or very effective in life. Probably not. But I say he learned a powerful lesson that day about deception and manipulation. Right? He got him out of trouble. He got his mom out of trouble that day. Right? And old friend, that served him well. But perhaps has made him life hard. Because healthy folks in adult relationships, Peter, they don't dig deception and manipulation. Right? So that's where my old friend can get in my driver's seat. You could say, and make life hard for me. But a very adaptive skill, I would call it a skill. Some folks would use the language of a character defect, not against that language. I just prefer a skill. I really think that's a powerful bucket because it has enough breadth to include things that don't easily pathologize. Maybe for the sake of completeness, we could just go back and talk about the codependencies, addictions and attachment issues. I think everybody's familiar with the terminology, but just as within abuse, there are things that people don't quite think. Everybody thinks of sexual and physical abuse. Very few people think of emotional abuse or religious abuse. Those kinds of things. So similarly, maybe talk through the breadth of what we think of as addiction, codependency and attachment disorders. Yeah, codependency, it's the spirit of it. It's not my definition. It's an old one, but it's the one I prefer. It's an outer reach for inner security. I can't draw that thing from inside of me. I have to get that from something or someone else. You let Jeff know he's okay. I can be okay. But if you're not okay with Jeff, it's hard for me to be okay with Jeff. That's a blanket summary, and I think an accurate summary of codependence. And your addictive patterns, addictions, addictive patterns. I mean, again, these can be substances. These can be processed. When I talk about the ego states, the parts, my guards, those parts of me that jump in my driver's seat, I look at those through the lens of addictive patterns because it's that concept of powerlessness. You'll hear folks that are in the programs, such as 12-step programs, they talk about being powerless to something. You know, and to get into the surrender of being powerless. So you can just, again, you can take the war alcohol, remove it and replace it with whatever that behavior is. It's the thing that I do. It's not a bad thing that I can do it. Sometimes, the problem is I can't not do it. So again, this could be work. This could be ambition. This could be anger. This could be many things. And usually, these things, they're there for a reason. And again, we're back to vulnerability is the enemy. So the goal of all of these maladaptive coping skills, patterns, whatever we want to call them is, we've got to keep Jeff from being vulnerable. We've got to keep that little boy that had that situation with his mother and that refrigerator. We've had a bad experience of vulnerability. So all these parts of me that step in to my driver's seat, they've got to go and they do their job in different ways, but the goal is to keep me from being vulnerable. Attachment style. You know, you get four books. You're probably going to get four different numbers of attachment styles. I like simplicity. You'll probably hear me say that more than once. But simplicity, let's just the three, the three, the three most popular, right? So you've got anxious attachment. It can be charming. It can be charming. You know, it can look a lot of different ways. But the more of me, I give to you, the more of you I expect from you, that's going to be the best chance to keep this thing going. Now avoidance attachment. Right? The distance. I can be in a relationship and still not give you all of me. I can be in with a person, but still have distance. Right? And then there's, I'm not crazy about it, but disorganized attachment, which is kind of a mixed bag of, you know, a familiar, familiar, familiar, familiar, now get away. You know, you've got your close now and the now needs you to get back. And you know, that's what happens, unfortunately, with these wounding, a lot of these wounding situations, the thing that we were created for, right? Belonging. Connection. All right? Oftentimes that gets coupled with fear. So that's a powerful thing when you get fear intensity, things of that coupled with belonging. And you can have ten different attachment styles, unhealthy attachment styles, if you will, but the commonality, the common denominator is going to be the insecurity. They may play out differently behaviorally, but it's the insecurity. Right? What is secure attachment? Look like Jeff, well, I don't know. I don't meet those people, right? But it exists because those folks have trust. And if we go back to the tree, I often think that the wounds or the roots that you keep referring to, it's really the story of my broken trust. Right? How did my trust get broken? And here are all these things that I do ingeniously to handle that. Jeff, when we examine ourselves or we examine, you know, or witness others where one or more of the branches of the tree, I eat the manifestations of trauma or present, is it your belief that that automatically implies there is at least one tie to a root. In other words, is there a scenario whereby these manifestations exist minus the injuring events? I mean, I suppose anything's possible. But with the folks that I've met crosspass with, had the honor to work with, they're repeatedly, there's typically always a connection, you know? And, you know, it's, it gets so tricky because it doesn't really need to be an A plus B equals C. It's, you know, it's the science of this kind of undo, undoes itself, so to speak. But like, when you, when you bring this up, this question up for me, it brings a stumbling block that I've witnessed a lot with, with clients within the spirit of or before they even become clients. And what I'm getting at is, is like, nothing happened to me. I don't think about that. Why do I need to talk about that? Right? And that, I honor that, is someone's truth, right? And, of course, the answer there, politically, within the setting of somewhere like the bridge is, well, that, okay, like I believe you, so you won't have any trouble telling your story, right? It'll be a breeze for you, you know? So, you got a role with that resistance. But the example that comes up for me, and that's where we get into implicit and explicit memory, okay? And this is, it's a scenario of a good example, I think, is flashbacks, right? Like, so, you know, go back to the example of something where if somebody has an image. I think what comes to mind for most folks is an image. Like, I see this thing. So then, back to this other person who says, I don't think about this stuff anymore. Like, I didn't, I don't go into the room and think about my dad cheating on my mother. Like, I don't remember that stuff. And often times the answer is, sure you do. What do you mean, well, you remember through your anxiety, perhaps, right? Maybe it's not an image, maybe it's not a sound, maybe it's not a smell. But that thing that that discomfort that you're experiencing, maybe that's the way you remember it. Something that's coming up for me. And again, there's so many case studies, if you will, but within the spirit of making the implicit explicit, in the example that I just gave, you know how that process works at the bridge. So after the groups over in the evenings, we have usually have meetings where the folks can experience some type of maybe a 12-step meeting, some kind of meeting. And, you know, it's part of the curriculum, if you will, and it's, you know, it's mandatory. And so, we've had clients, you know, have panic attacks. I would qualify some of those as that in these situations. And so, you know, the next day, when you're in group trying to unravel something that happened on the previous night, you know, and we're talking about a client that I've been describing and they're like, you know, I don't know what, you know, like I need to, obviously, I need to see a medical doctor because that's like, well, possibly you do. Well, let's try to work in a both hand. Like, let's, let's unravel this. What was going, you know, well, let's, there's process. You give up a certain amount of control. This client, let's say this client had control issues, right? And so, between things we asked you do, is give up control at the bridge, right? And so, in clients' client X says, yes, yes, yes, that's right. So, okay, so you're sitting here and, you know, you know, there's exits. You know the people are in the room. You know all the players are here, but for some reason, your anxious, that your anxiety's building to the point to where you experience or you describe this thing as a panic attack. I said, right, exactly. And I don't need to talk about any of this stuff that you guys are talking about. I said, okay, great. So, but just play along with me. Who's the most controlling person that you've ever met in your life? Oh, you should have met my grandmother. Okay. Well, tell me one of the most controlling things your grandmother may have done. Well, you know, I lived with her for, you know, three or four years in my childhood. You know, there was that deal with, you know, the basement. You know, when I was in trouble, the deal with the basement. You know, can you say more about that? You know, maybe you get locked down there. How long? I don't know. It was dark and they'll learn how to not think about it. You know, so back to the implicit with that explicit. So I think it's about this like files. Like there's this loss of control file in the traumatized brain, right? Does can I prove that a plus B equals C? No, I can't. All right. There's not going to be anything evidence based that says that was a situation based on that grandmother's control and abuse in childhood. That is why that panic attack happened. But it certainly gives us something to look at. It's like coordinates on this warboard, if you will, and therapy. Wow, there's a part of you that really gets activated when you seemingly don't have control and can't leave a situation. So, and the hope that can come out of that, right? Like to see someone who could have been described as resistant to the process, all of a sudden, at least start to like you're doing right now, not in your head. I'm going to start thinking about this. Maybe I'm not buying into it. Maybe something did happen. I think that's one of the, I mean, gosh, Jeff, I don't even know where to start. I think there are so many huge hurdles for for people to get over when they, when they at least begin to enter pain the idea that this is something they should look at. So that's the first one, right? So the first one is there's something wrong. Unfortunately, as a species, I suppose we have so many remarkable layers of protection that we have to be suffering quite a bit to go through this. I, again, I go back to some amazing lines in my journal. No one showed up here on a winning streak. Like, I mean, could not, I'm not going to name who said that, but I bet you can remember who said that. I mean, could not be more true when I think back to us all sitting there on day one, the 12 of us, I mean, what a collection of losers we were. I mean, if we're just being honest, like we were, we were all on the outs. We had lost everything and we were there not because we wanted to be, but almost because we had no choice. How often do you see that? And how often do you see people that somehow manage to show up there on the basis of pure introspection as opposed to, if I don't do this, I'm going to lose my family. If I don't do this, I'm going to lose my job. If I don't do this, I'm going to lose my life. Well, what you just described, I'll call that answer B, is that's the status quo. That's usually how folks get there, right? Every now and then, some of them may come in, you know, maybe maybe I could call the tourist or what, not, but that doesn't happen much. You know, it's like, like we would say, and if you really, if you remember how that property is, you kind of drive down into it, right? And all the things that are Kentucky, you see on the way in. And so we used to, we used to play around with this, like, yes, this is hard work, and this is uncomfortable. And if it wasn't, there would be a lot of people, all the way back up there, he'll try to get in here. But if you noticed, there's no line. There's no line to get in here, right? And there's also no gate on this place, meaning, you know, you're free to go. Also. So, and, you know, I think about, I use, it's just an average seven or eight, when I think of groups, they could be 10, but I use seven and eight. I think about those folks in that room, you know, and like there's so many different stories. And in some, just about every group has got somebody in it that's pretty close if not right on surrender, you know? And surrender within the spirit of my way does not work, right? I don't know if you're always going to work, Jeff, but I'm willing to try it on for a couple of weeks, because my way does not work. Now, that is a wonderful place to get to that I believe most people don't. It's what meaning most people don't show up there. Don't get to that type of surrender. I spent many decades, this may sound familiar, in this space right here. Well, I was pretty bad, and I hear what you're saying, but I still think I know what's best for me. And I think that's where most of us spend a lot of time, but when you get in that circle, see, to me, that never matter, because if you were there, you had a chance. You had a chance to get some different perspective, right? And if you're not there, you know, I think just about every group that I've worked with has had at least one person in there that's their out of obligation, just to get somebody off their ass, right? And quite honest with you to do the thing so that they can go back and say, I tried your thing and it didn't work. Right? Like I've seen that quite a bit, but there's still a chance for something to happen, right? Within that group dynamic. If, you know, if I tell somebody their an asshole, I might just be saying that from therapy heal. And maybe that's the same thing that their spouse has been telling. Okay? But if somebody in this circle that's living with you, eating with you, doing this uncomfortable thing with you, if they in some way let you know that they don't dig that thing that you do, I eat a thing that makes you maybe an asshole, then hmm, okay. So maybe my spouse ate in the only one saying this, right? Now if you like it, I love it. I tried to retire from force and change on folks, but if you examine that, that thing. Hmm, this person's letting me know they don't dig that either. Now I've got a chance to think about doing something different, right? And to pinpoint the explanation for why is it's hard for me not to do that. Right? So it can be so fruitful, even with folks there that have less than what I would call healthy intentions because they do show up there. You alluded to control one of the huge impediments to people, I think, making the journey to a place like the bridge is that you have to completely see control. So you show up and you hand over your phone and you go to your room, which is literally like a room from a camp with a your sharing room with somebody else, sleeping on a cot, that's not comfortable. And there's no luxury and your sharing bathrooms with a bunch of other people. And they rummage through your books and make sure you they sign off on everything. I mean, I, I, I don't think they, I didn't bring any contraband, but I, I know that there was very limited in what I could bring. Basically, you didn't want anything there that would distract me. Right. I don't think I could have brought books about F1 and sports or whatever, right? So so talk a little bit about the control because that for many people is this, that I know many people who have ultimately gone to the bridge and this was the thing that made it almost impossible for them to go and they had to fall to a certain level of pain before they would go and I know other people who who just haven't been able to pull the trigger and I put myself almost in the situation, which is I can't go off the grid for two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, that's not possible. You don't understand the complexity of my life. Mm-hmm. Surely knowing that you must have a very strong conviction for why it's required. And it's such a real thing, too. And you know, and it's, it, it's true. Some folks can't do it, you know? And we can't box ourselves into a world where we're talking about all the fruits of residential programs, right? But this doesn't have to be an either or thing. But within the spirit of that residential process that you described, so many different ways that I love the titles that you gave to the place, right? But the control, it's got vulnerability written all over it. I keep going back to that word. We're in introducing vulnerability. I don't, we don't try to induce suffering, okay? But distractions. You mentioned the word distraction. We don't take away as many distractions as possible. I don't pretend to know what you need to happen. What the magic's going to be. But I know that we got a hell of a lot better chance of it happening. If you don't have your phone, if you don't have your cigarettes, if you don't have all of these things that help you disconnect, because I need you to be present. Right? And for some of us, that's the vulnerability. It's being present where my feet are. You still, the one thing you didn't take away that I don't, I think if had had been taken, I'd not try to go on was exercise. So I was still able to run at 530 in the morning in the woods and do some pushups and stuff like that. Had I not been permitted to do that, I might have lost my mind. Have you guys ever, has that ever been question that, hey, for some people exercises is also a bit of a numbing distraction? That's an excellent point because each case is different. There's no one size fits all. Disprings up to me how many times the clients come to me when group breaks and everybody's going to the bathroom that come up to me and they're like, what do I need to do on breaks or in the evenings? Like, what am I going to do with this downtime? And the answer is, you know, some folks need to get serious. So they might want to pick up one of those books on the shelf and read a little bit in our library, you know, some people need to get serious. And some people need to play ping pong. You know, what might look different for you? I did a lot of coloring. Okay. And I did a lot of dot to dot. You know, you guys had a book of super elaborate dot to dots like a thousand dot puzzles that actually make beautiful pictures. And never thought I could find something like that so interesting, but I enjoyed it. Well, you know, and one might say you had the disconnect and come to the hills of Kentucky to find a space to even discover that or rediscover that, right? But that control thing that is such a player for so many. It's a human thing. It's not just a client thing. It's a human thing. It's like, everyone, I believe, wants to have a sense of some a certain sense of control, right? And most folks who have a hysterical reaction, as we say, if it's a hysterical, it's a historical to the sense of a lost piece of control. You know, that's where we get back into, there's probably a precipitating event. There could be something that needs to be healed here. And that's tricky to healing versus integration. How can we integrate this trauma, this thing that happened, right? All these words bring up so much for me, but I do want to mention with control because again, it's case study and it's, and it's everything is so connected to these, in my experience, to the trauma. You know, let's take another client. For instance, we're going to stay on this control. This control topic. So let's say this client comes into the group room. And this client is getting ready to check in. You know how that thing starts. Like, we kind of just like say something to start today, and everything gets quiet until somebody gets nervous enough that can't stand the silence and starts checking in, right? Somebody always does it. Can you describe what a check-in is because it, it is actually a pretty interesting experience and I needed a piece of paper to help me do it because I didn't know what the words were. We try to let folks experience or start practicing letting their outside match their inside. And that sounds like a simple goal and it is, but it's a complex scenario because again, some of us have paid a price for letting our outside match our inside, right? And so that's really the spirit of the check-in. It's to get some practice doing that just kind of rigorously with as much honesty as possible. How am I starting this day? Where am I right now? What's on my heart? You know, bringing the heart and head together. This kind of how I describe that. Some folks, you know, it's very personal and sometimes it's group dynamics. We want to introduce that, you know, but again, it's just just get honest. You know, let's get honest because I think that's the beautiful thing about the group. And again, this scenario where, you know, if you can't do it with some yay who had to bridge, like I hope everybody's Facebook friends for the rest of their life. But the fact of matter is you don't ever have to say these people again. So if you can't get honest with someone so or in front of someone so, how can you do it on the couch with the people that are closest to your heart? Because those are the people who end up being, if we want to fall back on the trauma word, our biggest trauma triggers are the people that are closest to our heart. So what, maybe I can build some muscle memory and be vulnerable in a scenario like we've been describing. So, you know, that's the spirit of the check-in. And the example that I'm given where this client is in this rocking back and forth. Like I believe I can take this client's pulse from where I'm sitting at. Okay? So I'm going to suggest that that client checks in first. It's kind of my job. I've noticed something like that. Yeah. And so, they haven't set a crossword in my experience in the first three or four days of their journey. I haven't started, I heard them say the word hell. Okay? And I'm going to flat out here's what, you know, that was a bunch of bullshit last night. Bunch of bullshit. Nobody told us that we were going to that place. I had to sit and I had to sit out there. I wouldn't go in. Nobody told us anything about that. And let's say this client that they're one of their calling cards when they approached the bridge. Was that they were really thrilled about, you know, you mentioned about nobody on a winning streak. But one of wins, they're not void of wins. One of these clients wins. Let's say is that like their medication management finally, like finally was dialed in. The finally got their anxiety medication dialed in, right? And so, you know, this thing happened in 18 hours later. I'm looking at this person having this response to literally what it was. Was I didn't write on the board every detail that was going to happen that particular day, especially what was going to happen in the evening when you guys went to a 12-step program offsite. Right. Exactly. In this example. So, yeah. So, and this is the type of reaction. Still 16 hours later. Okay. Right. Now, you know, in this scenario, perhaps I rolled the therapy dice. If I have the rapport and say something to the effect of, well, at least the medications are dialed in. Perhaps there's an uncomfortable silence that's probably five seconds, but it seems like five minutes. Right. And then maybe in this scenario, we all sigh of relief because this pissed off client smiles and laughs a little. And knowing the journey, let's say this client a day later tells her story. And they tell story about spending a significant amount of time with a spouse who is controlling and emotionally abusive and the spirit of their relationships sounded kind of like this. Get in the car. You'll know when you get there. Right. So, you see where now we did this client have back to flashbacks of this, but there seems to be a file based on this trauma, based on this wounding experience that was able to push through the medication. So don't hear me saying, medications go on the wrong way. But in this example, I think the discovery inspires hope in a situation where there seems to be so little hope in in this scenario that I'm making up, you know, what's the answer? Do I just need to go? No, do I just keep up in the dosage? Well, that thing happened to me. So that must mean we need right. So is that the answer? So back to this both and maybe there's something to look at here. Maybe there's a file. I think that's profound actually because you could argue if you simply look at that experience and say I need to up the dos up the dos up the dos. I mean at some point you're going to become a toast. Right. So so there's there probably is a dos at which there will never be a breakthrough. Right. But then you're also not alive. Right. So maybe we're better off as you said, taking this as a gift saying, wow, the fact that I got hysterical is now going to point me to something historical that I still need to go and resolve. Maybe there's some work that can be done. Maybe I do need to be on medication to get stabilized. Maybe the medication will help me be stabilized enough to build the window of tolerance that I need to do this type of historical work. But there's also some work that can be done. Right. We're not just treating symptoms. Right. I'm going to day two of my journal here. I can't help but feel like it's a mistake to be here. How could this pay? How could this place? This experience possibly make a meaningful difference in my life. Trust the process they say. Surrender to it. In quotes. I'm told. Okay. I'm here. And I guess I'll try. That was day two. It is I didn't journal until I got to the bridge. Now it's been, you know, it's a, I have reams and reams of journals that have been filled since. What did you have sent to how many, what fraction of folks show up there with the journal? 20%. Okay. You know, and now that number goes up, oftentimes the way you just described it. And that's found out something different a different way to do your day. Right. It is an artificial environment. One could say. When we're talking about still talking about the bridge. And also it's a metaphor for me in real life. Right. And so, you know, it's not just these therapeutic interventions or what some group members says or what some therapist says. Like all those things can be powerful. But like what are the things that you added to your day? You know, and how can you take that back with you? Right. Doing your day different checking in with which means in the driver's seat. And like, journaling is an excellent way to do that. Or just simply some mindfulness and some meditation and some just like a, you know, life's busy. We don't always have time to do these things. But take a minute, you know, which means in the driver's seat. That's the question. So let's talk about the different versions of the kid. Okay. There's the kid that's born the unwounded child. Right. What does it remind me the name of that child again? The inner child. Inner child. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So inner child. Some folks will refer to the inner child. Some folks prefer the original child. The original, the original me authentic me. But yes. And then we have a wounded child that goes through this this experience or these experiences. Again, very important to remind everybody this could be a bunch of little teas, none of which look like much. It's it's too easy. I think to look at the big teas and and say, I don't know, I'm a big tea like a fork. It could be that the the some of the little teas actually matters more than a big tea in some individuals. And then you have this adaptive child. So the example is that kid who figured out that by being deceptive he could protect his mom. And that's that was the right thing to do. Clearly the right thing to do. He should do that all day every day. Yeah. The more time it's done successfully, the more power it takes on. Talk about some other examples of how these adaptations that occur to trauma are really valuable. And then start to slowly lose their their their their their they start to become net negative as opposed to net positive. Because again, I think this to me is the Darwinian nature of trauma. Right. Like we're such resilient adaptive creatures that. You know, like the case of this kid, right? Like it's that's that's that's brilliant. That's adaptive. That's that's that's great. Like all the things that we do to not succumb. Maybe just share a few other clinical examples so that people get a sense of of how insidious this can be and why when that kid is 30 and he's in a relationship and he's misbehaving and manipulating his spouse who's not his father it starts to backfire. Right. Right. And so it would it brings up for me so many things. But this concept that I'd prefer, it's not going to sound very clinical at all. It's grit. Grit is something that I think we all have. I think we're all born with it. And you talk about this wounded child, these wounded events. These something happens and a lot of us out of that are grit gets covered up. And so I've met so many people that to survive they did it by submitting. Okay. And so losing their voice becoming compliant. Right. And so to spend decades trying to find their grit. While another another human being out of their woundedness may have survived from grit and they live from it. They can't not live from it. Then they live from it from decades and so the question tends to be at what cost. At what cost. When does this thing that was a utility to when is it enough? And I've always fall back on it's not typically the thing that's bad. Right. It's not it's not the fact that I can do it. It's the fact that I can't not do it. It seems like I can't not do it. Right. That's where that takes me with the utility. And when you mentioned the big tea in a little tea or those thousand paper cuts, it brings up post-traumatic stress and complex post-traumatic stress. And in no way do I want to minimize what we or a lot of us would describe as big tea traumas when we talk about those tragic event, those one-time events. But in the spirit of unraveling things and the healing journey and integration as a clinician, I would prefer. Not this is human had to go through that. But as far as there's that thing, there's the thing we need to work on. I know there's several interventions that have been very successful working on that thing. Versus this other thing that again, going back to the example of the child with neglect. And every single day, going to school, knowing for three years that he was going to be bullied. Right. And knowing that no one was noticing and so having to develop something to survive that. Living in limbic activation. Right. Just think about that. And so how many times, how many years that muscle memory created of going back to the part-slang which or of that guard, of that adaptive child unraveling something like that is a whole another ballgame. Again, please don't hear me minimizing big tea trauma. But within unraveling and the integration, that's just repetitive. And these limbic systems, we only know what we experience. Right. So, object abuse. You know, I've heard horrible stories. You've heard horrible stories. But let's take a child that knows that when mom gets home because of what's happened, her ear is going to be held to the burner on the stove. Object abuse. Right. Let's take another child that knows their portions laid out on their plate. That will be eaten in a certain way, in a certain manner, at a certain speed. And after that meal, they will be weighed. And their thought will be pinched. And should things not be as expected, there will be a lecture. Okay. Who's to say that which one of those humans are more limbically activated? The one doesn't know the experience of the other. Right. It's helplessness. I can't get out of this thing. This thing I'm getting ready to have to do. So again, how can I survive it? And how many times does that happen? And how many years does that take place? And then we get frustrated and we have the shame bug that goes along with it because we're back to the what's wrong with me. Why can I not do this thing? I got to know this thing's not doing me serving me well now, but I just can't not do it. Right. Yeah, the utility of the behavior. How do you differentiate for folks the difference between shame and guilt? Because for many people when you show up at the bridge, there's a component of something that you've done that's wrong. Right. You've hurt people along the way. Again, that's I think part of the hitting rock bottom that gets you there. It's not just that you've hurt yourself. You've probably injured others. Right. Now, and that's a part of this maladaptive behavior that's now kind of spiraling out of just being adaptive. So how how do you talk about the difference between guilt and shame and how do you work somebody out of that? Shams about will guilt about making a mistake. Shams about being a mistake. Right. You know guilt. I did something I made a mistake. I did something that I wish I had not done. I need to make an apology. Right. And there's a way back from that. I think in this classic John Bradshaw, we're talking about healthy shame versus toxic shame. And what when you talk about a difference between guilt and shame, we're talking about toxic shame. Right. That there's something flawed. This flawed defective core, if you will, my identity. There's something wrong with me. There's a way back from the guilt. Shame registers so differently. So when we talk about folks being wounded and shame and that's how the shame gets registered. Somebody once told me that that my father never had to get sober because he had me and my mother and my sister to carry a shame for. Okay. So it can be a generational thing and it comes from somewhere else. But shame can play out two different ways. Some of us add when we're living from our shame, we live out of superiority. So grandios shame. Grandiosity. I control, I perfect, I judge, I criticize, out of my wound as it is, out of my shame, that can be the me that you see on the outside. And some folks, the other side of that coin, of course, is inferiority. Broken, worthless. You know, I am my pathology. Why do you think one chooses preferentially one of those? I mean, I know that my tendency is always more towards the grandiosity than inferiority. What do you think it is in some individuals that steer them one way or the other when they're in that? And by the way, I love that these are, I don't even say this to be judgmental. I just think that this is a really interesting way to observe. But I know that when my inner monologue becomes more judgmental, that's a great yellow light for me. It's like, oh, look at the judgey word you're using. Look at the black and white thinking that permeates every statement that you're making. But again, that's just the tends to be the gravitational pull. Why do you think certain people have them? The thing you just said is the thing, though, that I can't not hold focus on, like that little conversation that you just had with self. Now, you've done the work. You're still doing the work. I'm looking at the journals sitting in front of me. That's just a portion of work, right? But having that voice that you've obviously cultivated, that's where the hope is because again, to live in simplicity. I say, I hate to over simple fight, but I don't. At the end of the day, I got bad news for the folks up there who think that there's going to come a time through my healing that I just never get triggered. Again, especially those of us who have experienced trauma, bad news, you will be triggered again. In this whole integration game is about starting to live a life where I tell stories that go like this. I noticed that I was starting to be really judgmental. I noticed I was getting triggered. I had this little short subtle thought conversation, whatever that looked like. Maybe there was something somatic that happened with my body that I did, but I had this thing that I cultivated, this new muscle that gave me enough space to choose my next step. When so many of us, especially out of our shame, out of our trauma, have lived a life telling so many stories that go like this, I got triggered and then I did this. And that's the reaction versus the response. Simple goal, right? Complex process. Yeah, absolutely simple and complex and ever to be distinguished. There were a bunch of interesting rules at the bridge. No minimizing. You got to stand up to get your own clean-ups. Tell me again some of the rules and the reasons behind them. First thing is trying to create an emotionally safe place. If we can create a space where folks feel like they can let their outside match their inside, then we got a chance for the magic to have right? So learning a new language, one of those things is eye statements. You know, when so many of us want to make statements for the world, the we. It's a lot easier to address someone's behavior. We're tired of this or we're tired of you doing that. How many times a client may come up to me and say something to the effect of when is somebody going to say something to Peter about being 10 minutes late to group. You were never. But hear me out here. And the answer is, I think the appropriate answer is, we're wondering the same thing. Okay, because if I say it, it weighs about 10 pounds. But again, within that group process, if another peer going through this rigorous journey with me says it, it sends away a little bit more. You know, that clean-ext rule, you mentioned that. It's there's so much that comes out of I don't even know what a box of clean-ext costs nowadays. But like, I used to say 99 cents, right? Like so much can come out of that. Like how hard it is for for some clients, not to give somebody a clean-ext. Right? You can have the best of intentions in the world, right? But out of our windedness, our trauma, our shame, so many of us, the commonality is professional feeling stuffers. Right? Like a lot of muscle memory and stuffing emotions, especially sadness. Right? And so the very act of handing someone to clean-ext can cut off something that maybe had been 25 years in the making. Right? And there's so much more that can come out of that. Because, you know, for the person who's having the emotion, like, I think about my healing journey that I'm still on and like out of my code, depend and it's like I expected a lot of people to read my mind. Right? I don't ask for what I need, but maybe I'm sitting there thinking, why the hell isn't somebody giving me a clean-ext? Can't they say I'm crying? The answer is because you're a grown man, you need to ask for them, and go get them yourself, Jeff. Right? But like, and it is the person rescuing me from my pain, or are they rescuing themselves? Right? Language that feels guilty, part of those rules, back to the eye statements, and learning how to have, I'm not crazy about the word confrontation, but like it's group, it's group dynamics, right? So I need to let my outside match my inside. So how can I tell another human being that I've got issue with this thing that they're doing? You know, and to learn how to say, I get angry when you check in every day, as if you love this place, and then on our walks in the afternoon, you're making front of the process, and you're making front of the therapist, and you're talking about the sick behavior you're going to do as soon as you get back home. Right? I didn't grow up in a house where we talked like that when you I feel. Okay? So it's so, it just feels clumsy. It's just to learn to, again, to create some new muscle memory, and to listen, to be able to listen to somebody. You know, we asked for folks to be present. That sounds like president's supportive. Sounds like the easiest rule. You could, like, why would you have to explain that? But like, it's hard to be present when you're not in the room. That's why if you remember, we take breaks as a group, right? We try to take them every hour, every 50 minutes, but sometimes, you know, we always encourage the clients. If you need to answer the call on nature before then, just let us know and we'll, you know, we'll take a break. Because it can be also really handy to go and use the restroom when Jane checks in because Jane gets underneath my skin every day. Right? And that and brings up something for me that I need to say out loud. So the rules are there to create hopefully, hopefully the safety, so that the magic if you will can happen. And also to give folks a chance it's a new muscle memory. And I encourage clients in these scenarios, like, start it off by acknowledging you're taking a risk. I'm getting ready to take a risk. Peter, I need to say something to you. And that's the spirit of the rules. And what about minimizing? That was a very interesting rule. Yeah. Well, and I mean, minimizing is an ingenious damage control strategy. Back to the utility of behaviors, right? Like, if it wasn't that bad, then I don't need to address it, right? But my behaviors also affect other folks. So when I minimize, let's say, for example, a client, you know, like, it doesn't matter, you know, like, I got abused. So what? A lot of people get abused. You know, you get over it. And then having the effect on me doesn't have any effect, like, in another client, hopefully using some healthy language, when you speak as if child abuse, especially physical child abuse, does an effect that child, I feel sad and I feel angry because you've got to write to your own truth. But I know how much that abuse affected me. You know? So that minimizing, again, it's very adaptive, but also if it didn't matter, you know, if none of this stuff matters, then I just am, right? And I think you've proven the theory, something's wrong with me. Or nothing's wrong with me. Superiority or inferiority. How many folks find themselves in a situation where, and I say this because I definitely had a bit of this feeling myself, and I can't imagine I was alone, where there's almost a reluctance to get better because there's also a belief that, yeah, I get it, like my life's a bit messy right now. And I, you know, my, my, my response is spilling out into bad areas, but look at all the good. Like, you know, I, I remember in particular, one of the, one of the rants I went on was about how much good has come from my trauma. I, I think, in telling my life story, it was virtually all good. It was, look at this good thing and this good thing and this good thing and like, why, you know, I mean, we don't want to erase any of this stuff. And, and I, and I, and I suspect you have a number of people who show up. And yes, they're, you know, it sounds ridiculous because on the one hand, there's clearly a bunch of things that are not good, but they're sort of like, okay, but that's a, maybe that's a reasonable price to pay and exchange for all this other stuff. How, how do you, how do you help people think through that process and what the trade-offs are? Yeah. You, when you describe that scenario, it's like you have to say it was your fuel, right? And I'm using the language of parts, when I, or guards, I call them guards, these protective parts, these protective adaptive behaviors. And I've looked at many of folks in, in your example of the, thank God you've got ambition. Thank God you've got grit. Thank God you can get angry and you've got a voice. Like, I don't believe I would have met you if you didn't. I'd say the same thing to somebody who was an alcoholic. Like, like, thank God you had that then. I don't think I would have met you. Would, should you not have had that, right? But now, you know, again, can we look at this thing and can we just at least look through the lens of, is it making life hard? An important thing for folks to remember going into, am I going to do the work? Do I need to do the work? Am I working on a part of me? Is that these guards, these protective parts of self? We are not necessarily trying to retire them. And that's what happens, I think, to a lot of folks is, is that part of them, there's almost a fear of like, how do I exist? Does that mean that ambitious, at times perfection, this Peter has to go away, right? Think of think of folks who go through life out of their woundedness that we might describe as they're always waiting for the other shoe to drop, right? I mean, I can think of clients, multiple clients who have said, it's not if it's going to drop, it's when and how loud, right? So they are really good detailed at finding negativity, at finding danger, and they'd be a hell of a good person to have a long on a walk in a bad side of town, right? Like, I'm sure if they were a building inspector, they'd be the best damn one out there, okay? But can you not do that thing when you go home and sit on your couch? Right? That's the spirit of, and back to the process and the vulnerability, the vulnerability can get brought up so many different ways. We keep talking about this group process that you experience. There's so many different ways, but the common denominator is the vulnerability is what triggers this protective side, this protective behavior to step in. And when that happens, we can work on it in real time, should that person be in at least consideration of doing something different? Every time I see you reading your journal, I think to myself, what must that be like? It's surreal actually. I'm looking at a note, this must have been about day four, no, this is day five. So we went to 12 step meetings every night and I found it very difficult and awkward. I was, I didn't understand why we were doing it. Why was I don't have a drinking problem? Why I met an AA meeting? I don't have a sex addiction problem. Why am I an essay meeting? I don't have a drug problem. Why I met the narcotics and anonymous meeting? I get just kept. We just kept going from one to the next to the next to the next. But I wrote something here, said the essay meeting last night was amazing. Three men shared painful, shameful stories. One of them said that he was getting, I can't even read my handwriting. Something his wife said things about him and his kids. He was basically he was losing his family, right? He was losing his wife. He was losing his kids and he was so upset. But his sponsor told him that he had no right to complain about how his wife feels. I found that very powerful and it was like he was taking responsibility for his action. And this was interesting because I remember walking into that meeting kind of thinking, good, the Lord, another one of these meetings, how many of these things I have to sit through. And yet, and I think it's people have to remember too. We're doing these meetings in a part of town where you're seeing people on the wrong side of the tracks. You are not looking at the affluent part of society showing up to these meetings. You're really seeing people who are hurting beyond just this is my dirty little secret. How many people have the same reaction I do initially, which is I'm not a fill in the blank addict. Why do you keep making me go to these meetings every night? By the way, I've already done 12 hours of group therapy. Can I just go to sleep? Yeah, just about 100% of the folks who survival strategy is not substance as far as that type of reaction. What am I going to do during the 12-step meeting? Well, you're going to hopefully set there and get something out of it. You're just going to take alcohol and put in caretaking, put in control, fill in the blank with your word. You know, helping folks wrap their brain around there, their compulsive, they're having an area of powerlessness. It's not always well-received at first. For example, let's say that clients there because he's married. Let's say he's married to an addict. Why is an addict? He's considered in the same thing. Why do I got it? She's the addict or whatever. And so within the spirit of sharing, maybe not in the group, maybe it was overheard. But anyway, the information comes out that this husband talking about his teenage daughter and going through the laundry found birth controls. So discovers that teenage daughter is on birth controls. And so the first words that come out of his mouth what are what if the people at charge find out? And so, you know, when you can in some way try to help someone use a different lens, you know, one would say and I would say this. You know, one might say that you're no less powerless to your image management than your life is to alcohol. Right? Because you can't get into couples therapy. You're not going to, you're not going to not go to church on Wednesday night and tell the people that you're married to an alcoholic. Right? So the area of powerlessness is image management. So back to that meeting, you know, you're just going to, you're going to fill in image management in that blank where everybody else or some of those people who got alcohol and some of those people who got cocaine. And again, to tell someone that they've got an area of powerlessness or to suggest it, it's not, it's not always received well initially. But it can be an aha, eventually an aha moment. So if I recall, Jeff, the end of week one was when we do our story, right? Kind of depending on where you were in the order, but yet, it tends to be the last few days of week one. Talk about what the instruction set was for how for each of us as we went off and prepared to do that. Well, the guidelines that we would typically give folks again was just, you know, we all, well, well, we always suggest that the clients, you know, write something out bullet point at. And we'd ask that the story be told within the framework of the trauma tree. So these stories don't need to be void of success and great moments. And if it wasn't for my grandfather and that stuff, but you know, there's a thing we're here to focus on as well, right? So what happened to me? And that we'd be given the 45 minutes to tell your story. And we try to stay out of the way as much as possible, okay? Unless it's therapeutically necessary, you know, some folks, you know, not rescue would be the wrong word, but some folks need to get to go and down the rabbit hole of dysregulation with their emotions and going into detail. So that client may need a little help moving forward, right? Whereas another client may machine gun through a story, right? And that's ingenious too, right? Don't have to fill it if I don't stuff and we might need to slow that client down, right? But the essence of the story again is just to tell the what happened to me. And then I think where the real magic can happen is during the feedback. Because you get 45 minutes to use your mouth and then we ask you to use your ears. And we ask folks to play by one more rule. And that is, please do not give feedback to the feedback. And then we're back to the control word, right? Because I've got this thing I'm ready to present and perhaps I've presented it 10 times and I've got it written out or I've at least got bullet points. So I feel good about no problem. But you start telling me how you felt and what came up for you Peter when I was talking about my dad and what he did, I don't know how that's going to fill for me, right? And so in so many times, almost 100% of the time within the spirit of not giving feedback to feedback is feedback is, feedback is almost like equates to I'm going to throw some love on you. Okay? Like maybe I didn't have anything in the world of common with you, but when you talked about that thing at eight years old, I felt myself getting angry. And that's how somebody lets somebody know, I was listening to you. I was there with you, right? And 90% of the time at least when it's so hard for folks to not give to just sit there and let somebody share from the heart and to not give feedback to that feedback, right? And but so many times it's like, well, but my brother had it, my brother had it a lot worse. It just and it's like, and it's like, I just throw my hands down and I'm like, it happens almost that's why we do. It's like somebody throws some love on you and it's almost like out of my shame and my wound in this, I need to remind you that I'm a piece of shit. It had happened so often. So we're just like, you get to, you get to talk about it. How do you break that cycle? It's very, very difficult. A lot of folks they think that change is about announcing what that they've been know what they're about to do, right? I know this is going to sound code dependent. All right? Well, if you're firing on all pistons as a therapist, the response should be then don't say it. Right? Because there's enough muscle memory there. We need to practice the uncomfortable thing of not saying the thing you've been saying for years, not doing the same. I'm the last person to be black and white about many things. I think much of my work with clients individually in groups, what have you with human beings is finding the gray, right? And but I tell you, well, when it comes to compulsive behaviors, complex, post-traumatic stress, these things that we've been doing for years and decades, you're either eye-mise or strengthening an old connection or I'm building the new one. You know? And so that's back to the when those clients say, what should I do? When I leave this group room, do something different. And experience what it's like to do something different. And so many times it's not doing something, right? I mean, we've took the vacuum cleaner away from clients before. I mean, it's an ingenious damage control strategy. It's a safety man. I mean, it's like it's written all over the walls. You know, we're here to talk about some deep stuff. And I'm finally going to be expected to talk about my stuff, all right? So, and we we've encouraged other clients to break rules. Some folks at the bridge, you know, might not like that, but it's like you need going that you need to go take some coffee into the morning meeting. Even a real follow your whole life. Yeah, we were only allowed one coffee a day or something. Right. Yeah. First that's not much. What I understand, it's not the strongest coffee in the world. You do a lot of work now with clients individually as well. I wonder how that is different. You know, I've obviously, I've recommended a number of people go to the bridge, I've recommended a number of people go to PCS, a place I went to three years later and taken together those two places changed my life. And one of the things I've said when people ask me, you have a bit Peter, it's just such a huge commitment, do I really need to do it? I don't know the answer to that question. I'd love to hear your thoughts. But what I do say is for me in the state that I was in, it could not have been done any other way. I had to have immersion. And I say, I suppose it's not unlike learning a new language where if I decide I want to learn Portuguese and I'm willing to take lessons two hours a week, I'll get there. But if I move to Brazil and no one speaks English to me for a month, I think I'm going to get there a lot faster and it's not just the sum of the hours. There's something agreed of about the total and utter immersion literally in the experience, the changes it. So how do you think about the difference between the work you do and have done at the bridge, which is indeed what we're talking about here. This immersive residential type of treatment versus someone who's listening to us that says, I hear everything you guys are saying, I just don't. I can't do that. Can't go there yet. Is there something in between? Can I start by working with Jeff just an hour or two a week? How does your work with clients differ? And how do you help somebody decide, maybe I'll start with this question, how would you give somebody the way to think about whether or not they could find some success in individual therapy versus whether or not it's really just rearranging the deck chairs and the Titanic. You got to go hardcore. Yeah, so the answer would be yes to the can I do this or can I do that? Yes, because it's not a linear path. Okay? And whatever it takes, whatever works, right? So I know that before I started doing this gig, before I found the bridge, I know that I never thought about doing anything residential when it came to mental health and being a professional, being a therapist. And then all of a sudden, I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. You know, and I couldn't imagine doing it without the group process because all those things that I'm talking about, they're so meant. So so much access to vulnerability and all of that. But let's not box ourselves in. Right? Because some folks, it's their truth. Some folks that can't, they just can't go do something like that. And so the way that it's changed the way that I approach the individual dynamic, the individual therapy, um, efficiency, right? Not rush. But I think that through all of the years and all of the clients within the group process and how, how I could see that works and to be able to somehow synthesize that into my individual assessments and the way that I can work with clients to that discovery process doesn't have to be as long as sometimes it plays out to be. Right? So within the spirit of the individual process, it's like we may reach a point to where it's like, you know, and here's the next level. You know, here's the, but the same could be said on the opposite side of that coin. Somebody might be like, I'm going to a residential program, right? And then they find out all this stuff and we can take that and to great that into the individual therapy. So, but I'm practicing individually, would have looked so different 10 years ago because of how the trauma and the unf. It's, it's something that, it's, it's no one's sauce fits all. And so to think that this intervention needs to be used because it's my specialty or this has to happen or this is exactly how long it takes for someone to have a window of tolerance like every human being is different. And I haven't seen everything because every Tuesday at the bridge will remind you of that, okay? But I've seen a lot, right? And so my hope is that most people that I meet or I have, I've met so many people and continue to meet them that are you've described, so you described them when you talk about folks like I've got a lot like if you want to call it half functioning like I've got a lot, right? But there's something missing. Now they won't all say that initially, but that tends to be the truth. There's still something missing. There's a hole there. Something's just not right. And so, so why are they with you? Why are they with me? Meaning what, from their end, from their standpoint, why are they seeking therapy if it seems all right? Well, it could be because they've just discovered. They've this been exposed to something that happened to let them know. Maybe not. Oftentimes that client that I just described may have got to see me to get somebody off their back. Okay? Like you need to go do some more. You need to go get some help. You need to go help. So that's, you know? And then it becomes pretty evident whether the person's there for that reason or for something a little more authentic and for self. You know, I think part of my paperwork should also include Jeff English cannot fit a square peg into a round hole, right? Which oftentimes translates into, I can't change somebody else's behavior in your life. That's a lot of that you see that a lot too, right? But like this person that is found to get into a point of where they have been willing to go talk to somebody, right? And so that is so often those are the people that I'm seeing. One of the things about the bridge that I assume it's still true, but it, it was remarkable to me was that everybody who worked there had been a client there. Is that still the case? Outside of some staff members, certainly all of the clinicians, most of the staff members. And that is, I can't imagine being a clinician there or working there without having done that. And that honestly has been the reason why some folks won't work at the bridge, right? So we don't operate from therapy, he'll. Right? So I'm in my own journey to get my challenges as well, yes. And so to know, I'm going to have to do some work, right? And then to wrap your brain around, you know, these are the people I'm going to work with. Right? But to be able to look at a client, like yourself and say, I'm not going to, I'm literally not going to ask you to do anything that I haven't done and to be able to say that from the heart. Yeah, that's, that's that's really an amazing feature. And I sort of imagine that through the lens of anyone who takes care of another person, right? And sort of like, you know, people, I think are right to sort of be frustrated when they have a doctor who's asking them to take care of themselves when the doctor clearly doesn't take care of themselves, right? Like how, how is it that you can tell me that I need to eat better and exercise when looking at you? It's clear you're not doing those things, right? Right? It's, it doesn't mean that the advice is incorrect or that you shouldn't listen to it. Right? It's just, you're asking me to do something you won't do. Right? Right? Whereas, yeah, at the bridge, you know, we, we can talk about some of the other things that are very difficult to do there, such as in the second week when you're kind of beating the shit out of things, that those are not easy things to do. But to know that your, you know, when Jeff and Julie are asking you to do it, they did it. Yeah, absolutely. And if you think though, to the way the journey starts, you know, is we disclose, you know, in some professionals, but I could, you don't, be careful with self disclosure, you know, and it's not about me, it's about them, but like, hey, we're going to ask you all pretty quickly to start showing us a pace of your soul, so to speak. Right? So I'm going to tell you a little bit about mine. And that's that hopefully we can start building that rapport early. Like, I think we can trust these folks, I think it would get, I think, I think that they can lead us. Maybe not everybody, but I'd like to introduce that because, like you say, in week two, we ask folks to go places with us, right? And, you know, it's, you know, that experiential therapy, and you mentioned one way of doing experiential therapy, the somatic part of what we do, but, you know, things have come a long way. And, within the, the spirit of that process, and when you talked about that learning a language, I love that analogy, you know, because you are immersed in that, but, you know, it's, it's that being able to experience the emotion, right? The hijacking, if you will, of the emotional brain. I like in it to, we're going to walk you down to the edge of the river, okay? And we're going to put your foot into the water, not the water being here, your past, your pain, right? Because we want you to fill a little bit of the temperature, right? But we're going to stand here right beside of you and our job is to keep you in 2024, 25, whatever year, right? Like, we're going to go there, but we're going to stay here, dual awareness, right? That's the integrative part, right? Some people need to yell because they haven't had a voice. Some people need to know, need to learn that they yelled and they were able to not get lost in it, right? And everybody's journey being different and befriending, but that, you know, it's, it's almost like some people say, why can't put my finger on what it was? But I just something was different, right? And it's like, what did what happened? What is it that you did? I say, well, sometimes you might say, we were activating your limbic system so that you could do something different while activated, right? Like learning how to get space from the emotional brain. So many clients, especially clients with trauma, years frustrations, learning coping skills in safe offices with therapists. And they're done beautifully and repetitively within that environment, but it's really hard to recreate that back at home, right? Or at work, you know, when triggered, right? My coping skills live in a part of the brain that gets hijacked when the emotional brain takes over, okay? And this doesn't always have to be about trauma. I can't you believe I'm saying that, but the example I give, because I'm a professional, right? One mother's 87 years old with dementia. She's living in a nursing home, okay? Now, so all the things to go along with that, the irrationality that's involved with that. And so Jeff goes to these visits and he starts noticing that all these visits are starting with my mother talking about how somebody is stealing her blue ink pens and what I call her O lady blue jeans, right? And so I'm sitting there saying, are you kidding me? Like, are you who would want your blue ink pens? All right, think about this, Rashley mom, who wants these old blue jeans? And how many of my visits? That's how that visits started. And it just went downhill from there and to literally be sitting in the truck outside before a visit, praying. Give me the what needs to happen here. And so many times in as clinicians, we ask clinicians take your, you take your hat off, take your therapist's hat off, right? But sometimes you need to put it on, because Jeff, the clinician is not sitting there in front of his mother. There's a son sitting there in front of his mother who is facing the reality that it's not his mother anymore. And that's very sad, right? And so the anger is a much more comfortable place to be or frustration. So I'm going to argue with mom about how irrational this thought is, right? But it's breaking because I don't want my mom to think that people are stealing her blue ink pens. I want her to change. I want to this to be corrected, right? But I'm forgetting like one of the golden rooms rules, excuse me, of change when it comes to therapy and rolling with resistance. Okay? The more that I fight for change, the more this other person is going to fight for the status quo. It happens 99% of the time. Okay? But when you sell crazy back to somebody, tenfold, they start to suggest rationale. Rationality, here's what I mean by that. One day in that truck, I realized I have got to do something different. Right? So I'm going to go in there and when I went in there, I went in there with my executive functioning. I went in there from the prefrontal cortex, right? And so when mom started talking about her blue jeans and her blue ink pens, my response was, you know what? You're right. And I think I know exactly the lady that's doing it. I'm going to give her a piece of my mind. And what did my mom say? Jeff sit down. Be sensible. I didn't have access to something that I do all the time. Clients. All right? So I'm crazy back to him. Right? You just, yeah, you go home. You'll get your cigarettes back. If you're talking about the bridge, you'll, you'll get your cigarettes back. You'll get your phone back. You'll go back home. You'll go back to your perfect girlfriend and life will be okay. And I didn't say life's okay. All right. Well, then we got something to talk about. Right? You got to stay here. You're going to die if you don't change. That is fine. They just fight fight for the status quo. Right? So, but that's that, that Jeff that I was talking about. I didn't have access to those skills because that was, I wasn't being driven. But now there's all the baggage. There's to be in the sun. There's a trauma-related demand. There's all of that that played into that. But to be able to get access to the, what some folks call the bill pay and bring. What year were you a client at the bridge? 2000 and 16. Okay. So only a year before me. So you'd been a therapist. Obviously for many years before. How did you find the bridge? So it was, it was an email that I probably wouldn't have read and there was an opening and a mentor of mine. Simply an email and said, I know you, I know your story, I know your background. I think you, I think you ought to check this place out. And you know, then to grow up somewhere like that, Bowling Green Kentucky and to not know this place that's existed now for 50 years. It says something. And again, I had, I had a certain mindset about what residential therapy would look like in residential treatment and yeah. So I was just blown away. And privilege to be able to do the work. I mean, it's a gift. I talk about folks not wanting to do it and sometimes that being the reason that they won't join the team there. That's a very true thing. And you know, I wasn't crazy about doing it either. Right? I got new. There was stuff that I was still working on and will still be working on. And it was going to be very vulnerable because I'm almost, in one way I was like, I'm almost interviewing, you know, like this is an audition. Do you want to know all my crazy? They're like, yes, we do. What is it that attracted you to this field? You know, I've done a lot of different things, sales, marketing. I used to build based fencing. People would say, oh, really, I think they think jousting. I'm like, no, like, wouldn't chain link fances. Yeah. It's not take the glamour. Go too far with that. But, you know, I did undergraduate in psychology. And then there was that gap in between me determining and realizing that, you know, this is what I need. This is what I need to do. And, you know, it's just that the self discovery part for me, it was like starting to do my own work and then realizing that, you know, to see someone get a taste to hope. Right? To see somebody get a taste to hope. And to be part of that, you know, I think when I tell clients, you know, it's like, you've got it in you. You know, maybe I can create a space where it can come out. You know, and it's, it's a privilege. You know, it's said, no, I don't take it lightly. What I do. And what, and what clients trust me with, you know? Yeah, I think you have a really special talent for it, Jeff. And I just wonder, is that something that only comes because you've experienced the pain as well? Does someone have to have necessarily been through this journey to be able to guide someone through it? Do you think that's necessary? I don't think it's necessary, but it sure is. It helps. I'll say that the depth of the connection with the heart and the work. Because it's one thing to say, you know, my profession, the profession, I've got purpose. Right? Like I, I could say, I do something that matters, right? But does that thing matter to me? Right? And it does. And, and, and just me personally, I think the weight of that purpose is from the pain, in addition to the hope. Having that type of impact to where I feel a little bit each time I help somebody integrate their trauma. And I've had some amazing things happen in the group room. I'm human, you know? Like certain things that I've done in the group room where I'm not, I don't need to be doing my therapy while I'm a leading a group. But certain things that I would do on a like an art therapy or something, I use the same scene on the board that I used time after time because again, that's something that I've tried to unpack and process. And I don't need to be doing anything new while I'm and then to be sitting there because of something that happened in the group room or maybe it's where I hadn't realized that I look at that scene that I just drew in the board, but differently. And it's also, it's also, it's personal. We've trauma and we talk about how it's shame, like it's something that's touched my family. Unfortunately, there's not much of that family left. And so yeah, my sister passed away in 2014 and she grew up in the same house that I did. And so yeah, piece of my piece of my heart's connected because it doesn't have to go that way. You alluded earlier to sort of the generational nature of trauma. Terry Real has written about this in some of the most eloquent ways I've seen. And I think that for some people that can be the motivation to change once they realize that there's a pattern and that it's not linear, right? Because if you if you if you have a belief that it's linear, then it's really easy to say, well, I've already stopped it. So for example, if your parents were alcoholic and you're not, well, I mean, the story's over, I don't need any help regardless of whatever other behaviors I'm manifesting. Yeah. And but if a person can accept that no, that's not how it works, right? There could be, you know, this type of trauma in generation G minus two that manifested as a different trauma in G minus one. Right. And now here in G zero where you are, you have this blind spot to what's going on. I know that for me that was among the most powerful motivations to stop the cycle is this Terry described it, right? And how much do you think that that factors into peoples willingness to kind of endure the challenges and discomfort of the journey? I think it oftentimes becomes pivotal in willingness and in that surrender game that I mentioned. Because I think as a parent, you know, one of my jobs or the most important job is in my opinion, then my children go to bed and wake up safe, right? And if they don't, they don't grow up in fear, right? And I have a lot to do with that, right? But like the analogy, you know, like they tell you on the airplanes about your oxygen mask, right? Like you got to have yours on first, right? And that, you know, as the end of the day, being a parent has made, you mentioned about why do what I do and what I get out of and what not, and to know my clients on a different level because doing the work is hard and like, you know, sometimes at the end of the day, when you need to have that hard discussion with somebody, when a boundary needs to be set, you know, when conflict resolution and a relationship needs to happen some days, you know, when people finally go to bed and the house is quiet, you just don't, you just want to watch Netflix, right? And you just, you know, and so to understand like, you just, and what happens, what can happen is that you put off these things and things start to build and they build and the build and then when you know, the little heavy breaks on the worst version of Jeff, right? If I let that happen, right, then what about that generation, you know, what about that next generation? And it's, it's responsibility on a whole different level, but, but, Jeff, too, you mentioned like, yeah, I miss conception you were describing of well, at least I don't drink, at least I'm not an alcoholic, so that means that I'm not as bad as my parents and there's no work to be done, right? Because there's so many other ways that I can have an unhealthy impact on that next generation, right? But to just to be in that place of, okay, like, this is it, this is it, and, and, and I have the opportunity, like, to change this thing, in my case, reverse the cycle. Yeah, and I think that you must encounter a lot of people who have these socially acceptable, maladaptive behaviors, and in many ways it makes it even more difficult to reconcile because society is externally sort of patting you on the back for your workaholism, your perfectionism, you know, your achievements and all those things. And, and I don't know, I don't know, it is one pattern in your view harder to address than the other, or is it all about the individual? In other words, if you think about the individual characteristics, the manifestation of the trauma and the nature of the injuries, those are three kind of things that are all blended. Do you, do you try to disentangle those when you're working with people and, and, and look, and pattern recognize or do you just say, nope, I literally, every person's a, a clean slate and we're, we're just trying to figure out how those three things fit together. That's a place I try to operate from out of, I think, my humanity, our humanity as clinicians, we create their client files. I've seen this, we've seen this one before, right? And sometimes it needs to be set out loud. Some people need to hear, you know, you're not, you know, I've seen you before, right? Yeah. Not always appreciated, but sometimes it's lands, right? But, um, it's, yeah, it's funny. I, for me, that's a very calming message actually. Okay. The, you know, what Peter, you're not unique here. Like, there's all, there are lots of people like you out here. It's really easy to think you're the only one. Yeah, an amazing to wrap your brain, maybe you're around the fact that that's actually coming. It's, it's nice to know. Yeah. Um, so that's just, you know, there's certain interventions that tend to go along with certain, you know, personalities or certain, uh, maladaptive behaviors, if you will. Um, but, yeah, God, to the best of the immobility, client slate. You know, like, what is, what is this person telling me? What, how they're telling me, you know? Jeff, when you think about examples, um, I've, you know, I've seen examples where this, it seems like everything we're talking about has been taken too far. Okay. Right. So you, you know, there's a story I read about a teacher who started every day with her school children, basically trying to get them each to talk about what was making them sad. And, you know, the story digress so much in that, you know, one kid would say, well, I'm sad about the fact that something happened. And it was a legitimate, you know, it sounded actually quite, quite traumatic in that kid's life. You know, they were getting yelled at all the time at home or, you know, locked in a room. But it's sort of derailed the ability to do anything, right? This is a, you know, a group of kindergarten kids that ought to be, like, learning how to write and, you know, color and stuff like that. And it was, you know, everything was being pathologized for them. Yeah. So, so, what do you say to the person listening to us that says, we've gone too far? And I get it. I'm sure that some of the people that Jeff works with who have genuinely been abused deserve to be there. But aren't we just coddling people too much and don't people just need to sort of just buck her up? I mean, isn't this what makes us who we are? Yes, and no. Yeah. So, and I'm certain that those things are happening. I would not be comfortable, you know, painting a broad brush and saying, yes, we are too far. You know, again, I'm back to depolarizing things, right? So, most of my folks that I meet through the therapeutic work, again, grew up in much more of the get over it, right? Buck up, right? And so, and then the other end of this continuum, if you will, is everything is trauma, right? And so, let's not box ourselves in. You know, I worry about the example that you just give there because I'm just thinking about kids in general, especially younger kids and some kids can be me, right? And so, like, do I want, you know, like, is that the space for that? You know, emotions, like, yes, it can be so powerful, I believe, for children to learn about their emotions, right? But, you know, to be guided by them, that's a tricky statement, like, so I would hope the spirit of guiding is learning what the behaviors are, learning the time in place for emotional attention is in the time in place that it's not for, right? So, again, my experience comes from individuals typically who are from the far other end of that. What would you say to a person who's listening to us who's trying to even understand if they've experienced trauma, which sounds like a dumb thing to say, but let me give an example, right? So you have a person who's listening, who's either introspective enough to realize that there's some, some of those things we describe is the four branches of the trauma tree, whether it be co-dependency attachment disorders, some sort of maladaptive behavior, etc. Addiction, maybe. They're like, okay, I mean, if I'm being brutally honest, I'm not flying on, you know, a perfect level, right? Like, yeah, and my, you know, my spouse has complained about XY and Z, and there does seem to be a little bit of, you know, interpersonal discontent in this nature, in this relationship, etc. Okay, fine. And then they, if they're, again, in a particularly charitable mood, they look at the kind of five roots of the tree, and they're like, well, okay, yeah, I mean, these sort of things happened, but they can't make the leap to say, but does any of that stuff actually rise to the level of, of quote unquote trauma, even little T trauma? Like, is the answer just that I need to get my act together and drink a little less, you know, just try to be more present with my kids or, you know, whatever it doesn't matter what the, what the fix is, but, but they're just not sure that going back and stirring the pot of what happened to them during the first 10 years of their life is going to be an exercise worth engaging in. How would you help that person decide that, you know, you're right, it's probably not worth stirring that up. Let's just work on some behavioral tools right now to, you know, address the behavior versus actually, I don't think you're ever going to truly fix these things until you go back to the root. I think that's a perfect way to approach it. So let's try that. You just, in your example, like, maybe I should just do this less and do this more, all these behaviors. Let's try that. Let's put together a plant goal setting. Okay. This is, you know, I'm coaching you. We're not doing an intervention here in the therapeutic intervention and then we, and if it happens, it happens, right? But folks who realize or already know that they have trauma or have been wounded significantly. Sometimes I think the word just trips folks up and they just can't get over the word, right? Wounded, right? Survivors. Whatever we want to call these folks, they have a really hard time putting knowing into action. Right? Like, I spent many years as a very well-informed prisoner. Right? Like, I know all this stuff about why it is. I do the things that I do, but it's the putting it into action. The thing that you did said about the not doing, that's where we get to realize hopefully it meant to sell. If that's the fact when I come back to C.J. for whoever, well, the goal is still failing. For some reason, I just can't do that. Right? Okay. Well, perhaps there's something significant connected to this. Maybe something needs to be integrated. The part of you that is unwilling to do this thing that you say is the goal and the plan when you sit in front of me, that's who we need to work with. So how do you begin to do that integration? Right? So, you know, let's go back to the example you gave because it's so profound and and and probably tragic where that four-year-old boy that learned how to manipulate and deceive to protect his mom has now carried that behavior into his marriage. So step one is is obviously getting to the point where we uncover that story and make the connection, which was an inner child is wounded, that inner child adapted when the strategy that was very positive. Everything about that strategy made sense. But guess what your dad isn't kind of hurting your mom anymore because luckily she got a divorce and he's gone and you're now applying that same behavior pattern in relationships that have nothing to do with the relationship in which that was developed to be protective. And he says, okay, I get it Jeff. How do I change? Like what are the next steps? How do I go from the understanding of that to creating a new pattern of behavior? Because this is this is really wired. Yeah. These these pads are heavily heavily dilinated at this point. So in general, what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to expand your window of tolerance if you will to vulnerability, right? Because typically that protective behavior, again, the enemy is vulnerability. And so to create some muscle memory doing something different when vulnerable, not doing that same thing. Okay? And like when you talked about your experience at the bridge and you talked about what it would have been like if we had a taken away exercise. Okay? Like simply sitting still for some folks is a very vulnerable experience. Right? And so to create an environment where that person can experience the discomfort. And that's why I think that within my work and a lot of professionals looking at individuals from a part's perspective. Right? There's different systems, different theories, internal family systems, structural dissociation, but this language that I'm using. It's not necessarily new because it's like you're talking about. So this is original self, this wounded self, this adapted self. Right? The adapted self tends to have some really hard-line beliefs. Right? Safety equals control. Safety equals distance. Safety equals self abandonment. Safety equals somebody else. Right? And as long as that part of self, right? Has that core belief? I believe it's going to be damn near impossible to do those things that I know I should do. So to know that there are interventions that will fit that process within the first question is, do you get issue with this? Right? Because I'm back to if you like it, I love it. Right? Like when a client is talking about, you know, they're at the bridge. And they're there because they're spouse. You know, their spouse is going to leave them, their spouse is finally fed up with it. And, you know, they've got all these opinions about it. So here I am because they said I needed to go to a place like this. And you know, you're like, you know, it doesn't sound like you got a problem at all. What do you mean? I was like, it just sounds like you can keep being you. You just got somebody telling you now that they're not going to deal with it. Right? So it may maybe it's the biggest controlling jerk in the world. Right? So all you need to do is go find another dormant. You know, I'm just hearing you say your spouse is not. So you decide whether there's a problem there or not. Right? And so this behavior again that's become the problematic behavior. How difficult it is to unravel and stop doing that behavior again, tie it into the trauma, tie it into it being an ingenious, damaged control strategy at a time in life, perhaps. And perhaps done multiple times successfully. Right? So, you know, there's a part of self that says, why not do this? We've been doing pretty well like this for a long time. There tend to be these moments along this journey where I assume I'm not unique in this, where people have really significant breakthroughs in beliefs. And it's mostly that a belief gets shattered. Yeah. I, again, this is, I think one of the real joys of having a journal is you can kind of go back and read what that was like and read. You know, on this day like through this exercise, this really profound thing happened. I'm I wrote about two of them in that last chapter of my book. I wrote about one at the bridge and one about PCS that were undoubtedly the two biggest breakthroughs and beliefs I've ever had in my life. They've had a far greater impact on anything in my world. And they both happened in an instant. Right? Like they both, they were huge step function changes in a radical belief system. And what I find interesting about it is how much easier it became to make any change after the fact. I never want to represent that I'm better. We're all in recovery here. But when I think about the December 2017, April of 2020, or maybe it was by this point May of 2020, those particular days when those things happened. I mean, literally within an instant, I don't understand, I don't understand the neurobiology of how it happens. But something really switches. And I never look at the world the same way I did before. There's an immediate acceptance of something typically. That's the shattering of the belief system is the acceptance of something that is more honest and more genuine to the more close to the innate child that we all were. Mm-hmm. Is that common? First of all, that people have these major, major sort of life-changing appreciation of something. And then secondly, is that by itself sufficient sometimes to drive change? I'd be careful with the common word, but it happens a lot. And I typically hear about it kind of the way you described it. Months, even sometimes years later, right? Like, it hit me one day. Or this thing was happening. And I was incredibly compelled to do it the old way. And I heard something so and so said in my ear, you know, or something against that belief system. And that's what's so tricky about that process at the bridge. Or if you want to talk about experiential journey, six years in experiential therapies, I mean, just going to a process, a group therapy process, residential isn't experiential intervention, right? And so to be able to put my finger on what was it? You know, what exactly was it? You know, and cannot prove that that was the thing. Like, it's so hard. It's interesting. For me, in both cases, it came down to a therapist pushing very hard, but very kindly against a set of assumptions. It was me saying something, offering it up the same answer. And the person saying, what about this? What about this? What about this? What about this? You know, and just maybe describe it as a loving confrontation? Yeah. That when fully backed into a corner in an unthreatening way, collapse the scaffolding of a mental model. Yeah. And I think God, I mean, that's you when you tell that about putting your finger on that. Like, I've got so much gratitude sitting here. You know, I mean, obviously, I know the moments, you know, several of the moments. And, you know, it is common. I think the spirit of you in this example is putting yourself in a position for it to happen. And there being a process to get this guarded version of self out of the way enough to allow something like that to happen. And there's a lot going on to create that or to cultivate that possibility. Yeah. I think that's absolutely the, maybe the lesson I would want somebody to learn from this is in science. There's an expression that I think it was Louis Pasteur that said that, you know, chance favors the prepared mind. And the idea is that great scientific breakthroughs don't just happen. They happen to people who are toiling in the lab, failing, failing, failing, trying again, trying again, constantly thinking about the problem. And yes, usually something lucky happens that trips them in the direction of a discovery. It's, it's often very, very much an accident. But that accident can't happen if you're not on the field. Yeah. So it doesn't happen if you're in the stance. Absolutely. And maybe that's the, the takeaway I would want somebody to have here, which is you're very unlikely to have that eureka moment if you're not mired in the trenches of going through the painful work of figuring out your story, understanding, trying to create the map of what's happening. It's unlikely to happen when you're, when you're continuing the distractions or the numbing behaviors. Right. Absolutely. And to speak to just, you know, sometimes I guess the frustration with, in the individual one-on-one therapeutic dynamic would be, or, you know, I've heard a lot of therapists who many of the therapists who would ask the question, why would somebody go to a residential program that wasn't an addict or alcoholic? Like, to talk about the frustrations of like the goals not being able to put the knowing and acting. Like, you see this person we have four steps for, we have this great 55 minute session, right? And then six days later, they come back and I'm like, who the hell is this? What happened to them, right? Well, what happened to them is more than likely, they went back and lived underneath the same roof with their biggest problems. Right. And so, you know, in your experience and many others having the ability to get that, you know, that separation, if you will, you know, it's season of separation to make that possible. Not the only way to make that possible, because again, we paint ourselves in a whole little where, you mean if I can't go to a residential program, I can't heal. Right. We certainly don't want to paint that, because then we've got a lot of folks without hope. Right. But one of the ways, absolutely. And do you do, do you view your work today? The work you do just with individual clients is something that you prefer to only do with people once they're coming out of a residential program, or do you take clients that are saying, hey, I think I need help. I'm not ready to fully commit to doing something as intensive and committed as residential care. Either one. Yeah. Absolutely. Because you mentioned that, like, it's a journey, right? Like, I'm not a healed past tense, typically isn't a reality. Right. We're all on a healing journey. I hope. And so yeah, we can have these lightning bulb moments and make this, I get this moment of make this progress. You describe your experience of it. And also know that the work continues. Because back to the language of these maladaptive behaviors and all the muscle memory, like, to have a eureka moment, just completely wipe that out. Right. And when you talk about that scenario, that, you know, yeah, if I know somebody has been to a residential program. And I know kind of have an idea of what they did because I have familiarity with where they were at. Then I can do a certain thing with that. But at the same time, like, just, I guess the fire that it lights for that person that you've been talking about so much that is finally getting to the cusp or to that place of, I think I need to look at something. Like, I got a lot of good, you know, you talked about that person, but something's just not right. You know, and to be at that point of that journey that we talked about not being linear and having a system, if you will, or the background, I believe, with that group experiential process has a different way of making that one-on-one relationship, and back to the word efficient, you know, and trauma efficiency, you know, like, and being, hopefully being able to help recognize, here's the what and the wind, and let's make sure we're using our time wisely. Jeff, what advice do you have for somebody who's out there trying to find a therapist, they've listened to us today, and they've been like, okay, you know, these two guys have got me at least thinking, I ought to maybe scratch this a little bit, see if this scabbleeds. What are the attributes they should be looking for? First, how do they even begin to, like, what do you go on Google and search trauma-based therapy? How do you find somebody, and more importantly, when you find somebody, how do you say, like, I'm going to give this three or four sessions to determine if this is a good use of my time? What are you looking for? Is it, hey, if I'm not uncomfortable in three or four sessions, this probably, this person probably isn't doing a good job, what are the metrics? I certainly want some input from a professional, a seasoned professional. I personal referral, I mean, if you will, you mentioned that I just did a Google trauma-informed, it's kind of like the buzz thing, and what does this mean? Did you, did you go to a 45-minute seminar on trauma-desafec folks, and now you're trauma-informed, right? Yeah. Is there a certification that people should be aware of that says you're a true trauma-based therapist? There are several, but I would be more interested in, I might, what I do when I look at bios, sometimes I get more concerned about the more specialty, so I see. A niche is so when I see these lists that cover every class that someone takes during a graduate program for counseling, that troubles me, because it looks great. I cover all of these different things. But no depth. Yeah, but like how much muscle memory do you have as a clinician, working with a certain population the way that you do it, you know, and where did that muscle memory come from? So, and that's a big part of what I do, you know, is helping folks make sure, that they are with the right person or they can go, that's where I go with the efficiency of it. Like, no-in the story, learning the story, getting that eye-opening moment, and then that hint that someone wants something different, right? And then to be a part of that process, or to put them in the direction, point them in the right direction. What else should they be looking for? So, so they find somebody, they think, you know, they even get a personal referral that says this person is good, how should they evaluate what is going on, and if they're on the right path, within a month, for example, what's a sign that things are going well, what's a sign that things are not going well? I personally think that sometimes I would say that challenge, like, how challenged do you feel, right? How do you feel going into a session? How do you feel after the session? Okay. What's a good sign to that to the going is going in apprehensive and coming out exhaust at a good sign? I think, yeah, absolutely. I don't think it's a good story when it's like, I can't wait to talk to Jeff because I'm going to get to Grite for 55 minutes, and he's going to let me pay him for that, right? Now, it's happened before, and I would just say, we need to call this what it is. Okay. You know, if this is where you want to put your anger at for an hour, we can do that, but let's call it what it is, because we're not working on change here, right? So, what's happening? What's being illuminated, right? Because they wouldn't call it a blind spot if I could see it. Right? So, what's happening within that back and forth that's what I would say, I'm not know, what made me think, what made me pause, but the main thing is what's different? And, you know, not all therapeutic relationships are a good match. And so, to just know that that's a, that's a reality. And to give yourself permission to, you know, after an adequate amount of time, this isn't working. Let's not keep doing this. You know, let's not keep doing something's not working. You know, watch short. I'm looking at my last entry before I left the bridge. I see a couple of great lines here. So, one of my, one of my favorite other co-residents there, she said this, she said, I asked God why he beat me down this year. He said, he broke me open. I thought that was very powerful. You said, on the way out, the more you cry here, the more you win here. Also, I thought that was, that was pretty interesting. There's just no escaping. It is there. Like it's very, very difficult. If the name of the game is, I have to become vulnerable to become connected. Right. That's, that's the central thesis here. I am disconnected. And I am using something to stay disconnected. Sometimes those things are obviously bad, like drugs and alcohol. Sometimes, and many times, they are not that obviously bad. Like work and perfectionism. Exactly. Um, or cleanliness, or you pick it right, depending on the extent of it. Um, but I have to get vulnerable to be connected and being vulnerable feels like getting broken down and you're going to shed some tears. Right. Exactly. And the sheer fact, or thought of shedding the tears, my amplified the vulnerability through the roof. Right. So, it's written all over the walls literally. I mean, if you remember group rooms with emotion words on the walls, right? And to have clinicians sit in that room as guests, of hours, and, you know, refer to them as negative emotions. You know, and I'm just, I squirre or I'm in my seat, right? Because maybe they're not as comfortable. But like there's a utility to all of these emotions, right? And I like and stuff and emotions to like tightening the string on a guitar. And you think of how many times, how many times that you've stuffed that emotion and then, you know, what what happens? And that thing right there, I think a lot of folks have been misinformed or it was an old way of doing things. But I think a lot of folks go into it thinking that they've got to have this explosion, right, with their emotions, like for the thing to happen. And, you know, if being lost in my emotion is if it's drowning in a pool of tears, is this what trauma integration is, then let me have no part of it, right? Because if dysregulated emotions is what comes out of the work, then I keep referring to them as guards. My guards, my protective parts, they've got more reason than ever to do their job, right? You just introduced me to vulnerability and it was overwhelming, right? So when working with the client regardless of the setting, it's befriending vulnerability. And to introduce vulnerability as overwhelming, right? That is counterproductive, right? And these these protective selves you mentioned back to the connection and human connection is vulnerable, right? It's not something that's meant to be controlled. There's unknowns, right? There's another person we don't know, we really don't know what they're going to do, what they're going to say, how we're going to be received, right? That's that's vulnerable. And if you look at it within, look through the lens of these protective parts, my guards, like they say the irony is the way the means about which they do their job typically brings me the thing that they most fear, all right? So another example, okay? Let's say that a client, this is one that works sometimes. Let's say it's a client, like one of their things is they've got some trauma, they've got some insecurities around betrayals, right? And they're in a relationship, and one day their partner comes home and tells them that their ex is back working at the hospital where they work okay? Now who wants to hear that? Nobody wants to hear that, right? But it's going to be especially bad news for somebody with a betrayal file, right? It's going to be very vulnerable, right? So here introduce introduce vulnerability into the equation. This is where the disconnected self shows up. I have to do something to take care of that vulnerability, right? So I have this avoidant part. I used to call him the two cool for school part, right? And he was born out of hearing a lot of what kind of man's he going to be, what kind of man's he going to be? So in other words, a man, this part of me doesn't believe that a man says something like, you know, I'm scared. I'm vulnerable. So this part of me says, what do you, you know, like you want to hear about all the skeletons in my closet? I don't care that your ex is back at works five years ago, right? But when that partner's on their seven to seven shifts, it's hard for me to be connected Jeff. When all that stuff, it got starts going on through insecurities and betrayals and things of that nature. So I need something, right? Something to step in and take me away. And that's where that disconnection comes in. For some folks, it would be drinking or whatnot. Within the spirit of the the example that I'm given and trying to give the irony is again, the problem is not having the parts. It's how they do their job and the relationship between those parts, right? Because eventually what happens is that as I do the thing with, let's say they let's say the behavior is drinking, right? So I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking and eventually like I get to a point to where not thinking that much about what might be going on at that hospital. And then I get to a point to where my buddy leaves, we were watching the ball game. I was able to be connected Jeff from front of him. But now I'm really starting to get up in my head about what might be going on at the hospital where my partner's at. Yeah. So when the phone finally rings, okay? At 1130 or 12 or whatever, it's not connected Jeff and answers the phone. Right? I'm using myself and this made up example, right? But it's going to be a disconnected version of Jeff. Right? You have him fun? Well, the night's so young. Maybe you guys will have time to go out again, right? All this wound didn't start coming out. And so eventually what happens is in this example, if this partner's got any healthy going on, I'm going to come down stairs one day and there's going to be a note that says, I wasn't created to save you. I can't do this. You need some help. And now have I ever been any Saturn, you know? Then I am because that it's a triangle of vulnerability, sad, shame, and fear. Right? And that's what all these guarded parts of self. They're there to protect us against that. But you see the means by which the protected disconnected self did its work actually don't play it out. Brought me the thing that I feared the most. Right? So now here I am sitting at this table alone realizing what's happened. Right? And that's that's how that happened. So back to disconnection, connection, what is connected? Jeff says, I know this is my stuff. And I've got work to do. It's a reminder that I've got work to do. But I got it to you. You got to be honest with me. It bothers me. What you just told me about this person being back working with you bothers me. That's a very vulnerable thing to say. Of course, you can only really say that if your partner is equally vulnerable, right? Because if your partner is not vulnerable, that that message isn't going to land. And that's going to be triggering to that person. And I guess all of this is a long-winded way of saying, you have to have two healthy people to make a relationship work. You can't just have one. Absolutely. That might not be welcomed. Right? That emotional vulnerable self might not be welcomed. And that's information. It's necessary. Right? Nessus, or information about my partner. Because when the example, I'm not asking you to do anything about asking you to quit your job or anything like that. But I just need you to know my truth. And I've got work to do around this. But it does bother me. Schairs me to death. See? And scares me to death. Probably the bravest words I've ever said to another human being in my life. It scares me to spend so many years trying to act like it didn't. If you're in that relationship where one of you is feeling like, hey, I can be vulnerable here. But it's not being reciprocated. How do you, what are the tips for maybe helping your spouse, if this is thinking about it as a sort of, you know, a marriage or something like that? What can the vulnerable member of that relationship do to help the other one? Because it's not going to be tenable indefinitely. So it's how do you lovingly get that person to come to a place where they want to get help? Well, you're certainly a lot of folks have wasted years trying to pull and push people into help. Right? You just have to be the agent of change in the relationship. Right? You have to break the dance. So in this particular dance is it's I'm wanting to be vulnerable and you're not having anything of it, something's got to change. Right? So you got to sharpen your skills with the boundaries. Foundries, boundaries, boundaries. And you know, sometimes it's a worn-out word, but it's a health of skill to be able to utilize. Right? Like, and to be able to set a healthy boundary. You know, top to your boundary setting oftentimes doesn't include the word you. Close folks away when you just talk about me. I realize when this behavior happens, whatever, fill in the blank, when this behavior that it's affecting me. You know, I'm building resentment. This isn't good for me. So when this behavior happens again, I'm going to choose to do blank. Right? And whatever blank is is whatever change looks like. Right? It might be in this example. Like, you know, I'm not taking, I want to be able to share my heart with you, but evidently, I can't. Right? So I'll be taking it to my best friend or, you know, and so to be able to to to set the boundary and set a boundary word where there's a consequence, it's something that I can hold. It's something that I can do. Right? Because a boundary without a consequence is useless. Jeff, I want to thank you very much for, for not just coming today, but for obviously being a really important part of my life. I owe you a great debt of gratitude as I do, a number of therapists who have been really lucky to work with. But I will forever reflect on what can only be described as just an unbelievably difficult experience that I'm so glad I had no idea how bad it was going to be when I reluctantly agreed to go, because I just don't think I ever would have done it. And I've had the privilege of encouraging many people to go since then, not just to the bridge, but to other places as well. And I think almost without exception, it's, it's helped them. In fact, I know it has. I can't think of an exception where it hasn't. So, you know, if someone's listening to us and they're sort of contemplating either dipping their toe in, you know, by working with a therapist and trying to probe some of these things, or if they're thinking about jumping in the lake and then going to a residential place like the bridge, what would you say to them? If there's a voice saying it, listen, if there's a voice, even if it's a whisper, it's there for a reason. And I think more important than anything else. You're either going to deal with it or it's going to deal with you. And my hope for that you and humanity and what we do as far as helping people, in this case, we're talking about emotional health, but longevity. Yeah, it's like, right, to deal with this, grab the bull by the horns. Thank you Jeff. Thank you so much for having me. It's honored to be part of your journey and congratulations on everything. Keep up the good work, brother.

Low end, one in 20, high end, one in 10 people, adults. adults, adults, adults. But I guess most people at some point in their lives are going to have an issue with insomnia, whether people have difficulty following a sleep in the beginning of the night, waking up in the middle of the night, waking up too early in the morning. The people who can't fall asleep at the beginning of the night, their mind's just racing earlier than yours. Yours is just waking you up. Okay, this is really important to you. This is something you're doing all the time all day. Guess what? What do we do with things that are really important to us? Make time for it. We schedule them, exactly. I always tell patients if you don't deal with what's causing you stress or anxiety during the day, it's going to demand to be dealt with in the middle of the night. Let's talk about sleep supplements. Oh, right. Melatonin's like the guy at the start of the race, right? He's the guy with the gun. He fires the gun. He doesn't have a car on the race. He's not like helping you stay. He's like he's telling you when to start the thing. So for a lot of adults, taking Melatonin is really messing him up. I think the time and bed restrictions pretty interesting. I don't even do time and bed restriction that first week, because for some people setting away time solves the issue. Hmm, let's go back to sleep hygiene for a second. Kaffee and withdrawal is not something I want to deal with in my clinic and I don't think it's necessary. So I tell people do not change how much coffee you're drinking, put it all before 11. When does the treatment fail? The treatment fails when people don't do it. Hey everyone. I'm your host, Peter Atiya. Ashley, thank you so much for coming to Austin to talk about a lot of interesting things. Let's start with with the one that I think everybody listening can probably relate to at least once, which is insomnia. So where did you're interested in insomnia arise? Well, I've been interested in sleep for a long time. I was fortunate to go to the University of Arizona for my doctoral work. And when I was there, the late Dick Bootson was also there. And he's one of the co-inventures of cognitive behavioral therapy from insomnia. And I think I found it particularly interesting because it works so well. We have so many different psychological treatments, and they all have varying degrees of efficacy and effectiveness. The thing about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is that it's kind of like a recipe. If you do it, it works. And this was always just so interesting to me because it was so different than so many other psychotherapies out there that had just so much more unpredictable outcomes. And I would say that I became much more interested in it after my post-doctoral work when I'd gotten to UCSF. And I was a post-doc at UCSF, but I started my assistant professorship at UCSF. And there was this gaping hole in treatment availability for people with insomnia. You know, like this might be a good way for me to get back into some clinical work I was doing just research at the time. And I fell back in love with it because there's almost nothing as rewarding is being able to see a patient seven times. And that seventh time have them say something to you along the lines of, I have my life back. I'm going to go get my driver's license back. I'm not afraid to drive with my kids in the car anymore. I'm going to go back to work. I have my life back. I mean, not much better than that. And so I grew the clinic that I do CBTI in. And now I just, I love it so much that I do it on top of my job. Like I do it in night with patients after hours because it's the most rewarding thing. And you can have such a big impact and people need it. So before we dive into what CBTI is and how it works and how profound it can be, let's maybe help folks understand a little bit about insomnia and maybe go through some of the definitions around the different types of insomnia. And maybe some of the different causes for it and maybe even what some of the other treatments are a pharmacologic and otherwise. Yeah, so. I mean, probably speaking. Most people at some point in their lives are going to have an issue with insomnia. I think some 90% of adults at some point are going to struggle with insomnia and point estimates. I think at any given moment might be between 5 and 10%. The interesting thing about insomnia is that it's a very clinical diagnosis. Great. There's no blood test for insomnia. There's no. We can't put you in a sleep lab overnight and do a test to see if you have insomnia. And we don't diagnose insomnia based on one night of bad sleep. If someone says, I didn't sleep at all last night or I haven't slept even for just the last week. That's not going to get you a diagnosis of insomnia. So. And there's a whole whole suite of. Different. So many of us that we could talk about, but I think the point that is the most salient is just that when you have a problem sleeping. And when it's been going on for a long time, at least like threeish months. And when you really feel it's a problem. That's when it's time to get help. Because there's plenty of people who don't sleep a whole lot. But it's not distressing to them. It's not causing any problems in their life. They're not going to meet, you know, a definition of insomnia per se. It's the folks who will tell you that I can't sleep. I haven't been sleeping for months. It's interfering with my life. It's really upsetting. And they've started. They've probably already started trying a whole bunch of things to try and help themselves to fix it. And this is where things get interesting. Just to be clear, Ashley, when you say that a point estimate of five to 10% of the population would have insomnia at any point in time, you mean according to that definition where it's been going on for months, it's causing distress in its impacting life. Yeah, probably speaking. Well, that's so it's one in low end, one in 20 high end, one in 10 people adults adults. I guess, yes, by the way, I do not do pediatric. So please assume everything we're talking about today is adults. Insomnia and children is a totally different thing. So that's a higher estimate than I would have guessed. Yeah. I mean, given your definition, if the definition was three nights a bad sleep, I would say, yeah, that makes sense. So that's pretty far away. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. Yeah. And insomnia is from most people probably quite episodic. Mm-hmm. It's not necessarily a permanent state. People go in and out of it. And the question is how quickly do people go out of it when they go in it? And that's what CBTI is so beautiful for. It's helping people get out of it quickly. There's going to be things in your life that are going to just happen. And they're going to put you over the threshold for insomnia. So maybe we can talk from in and about how insomnia begins and then how it's perpetuated. Because these things are actually quite different. Yeah. So you and I and everybody have a certain level of predisposing factors that are going to put us at risk for having sleeping problems, particular insomnia, right? Yeah, right? And then we may experience what's called a precipitating factor. That could be a major life event like losing your job, getting a divorce, getting in a car accident. Some major unexpected unhappy life event that might throw you into about an insomnia. Right? And that event will end though. That event ends. The car accident ends. It resolves the job loss ends. You get a new job or you don't. A lot of times only the elections might end here, however it may take time when it's important but not when it needs to be opened, but only when we talk about the trying to purchase contracts love debt at a time of year,love of lots of times making mommy love money. No. So you can just start being killed automatically. Yes. But go ahead. First off is just a day off the day. So then just go up and it gives you time and pressure. So, if you're going to have to take the liver off the tolerate for you. You'll see me in some of the pain-wellástico events of what the2018 has to do as an answer major for you. short term, make a lot of sense, right? You're trying to help yourself in the acute moment. But in the long term, these kinds of behaviors aren't actually doing you any favors. And over time, that precipitating factor is going to go away. What all of these behaviors that you've started doing to respond to the precipitating event, they're what stick around. And those are what are going to perpetuate insomnia symptoms and problems. And you say more about the predisposing factors, are those genetic? Well, yeah. So there's, of course, genetic predisposing factors. I've had patients come and say, I'm a really light sleeper. Can you fix that? That's going to be pretty tough to fix. We're going to recommend something like ear plugs and I'm asked, a white noise machine, what have you. But yes, there are going to be predisposing factors. So if you are higher on general psychological reactivity, you're going to probably get pushed over the threshold more easily than someone else. Right? Some people might get in a car accident, a fender vendor, and they're over it by the next day, the cars in the shop, whatever. Other people might feel antsy about driving for a while after that. They might feel more anxious as a real result of that event. And that's going to differ from person to person. You can argue that that's genetic. You can argue that that's based on early childhood or other experiences. But nature and nurture probably both contribute to that predisposition. And there's not a whole lot that we can do about that. But this is the beauty of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. When people come in for treatment, they're often pretty focused on what caused their insomnia. And I actually don't ask people what caused their insomnia until the end of my first session with them. I'm asking them all these other kinds of questions about their behaviors now. And at the end, I ask, okay, so when did this start? What do you think might it cause this? And get their attribution for what's going on? Because at the end of the day, the interventions the same. And that's what's beautiful about this. And might differ a lot from the practice of medicine. I'm not an MD, I'm a PhD. And so in, I think in a lot of disease states, we often look at what caused what's going on. I'm not really concerned. I'm more concerned about what you're doing now that's perpetuating the problem. That's where I intervene. And that's why this particular treatment is so effective for so many different presentations of insomnia and causes of insomnia, whether people have difficulty following a sleep in the beginning of the night, waking up in the middle of the night, waking up too early in the morning. Right, you might think on their face, these people all need wildly different treatment, but that's not actually the case. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So the focus is much more on the coping strategy and the behavior that came out of the predisposing factor, or the precipitating event, actually, is really... That you used to respond to the precipitating fact exactly. Exactly. Okay. Yes. Can we talk a little bit about, you know, is there a difference, for example, between the individual who can't fall asleep, you know, this initiation of sleep in insomnia, versus the person that I hear much more about and frankly, I experience more, which is, that's not that hard for me to fall asleep. But boy, I will jolt up at one in the morning with some thought or anxiety, yes, I can't get out of my mind. And my mind starts running and I can't go back to sleep. Or I get up because I got a P, but when I come back, I erroneously just do something with my mind where I get thinking about the day's problem or whatever. So do you think of those as difference or the same side of a different coin? Different side, same coin, I guess I'm... Great question, great question. So, those people need the same stuff. And the people who can't fall asleep at the beginning of the night, their mind just racing earlier than yours, yours is just waking you up. And there's a whole suite of interventions that are part of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. And there are a lot of ways that I could approach and answer to this question. So I think starting by addressing the racing mind issue, I always tell patients, if you don't deal with what's causing you stress or anxiety during the day, it's going to demand to be dealt with in the middle of the night. It's going to say, oh, Peter, I noticed you're laying there peacefully, not doing any work or tasks. And you don't have anything you need to do right now. So you're going to pay attention to me. And it's going to demand your attention at that time. Other people, that happens right when their head hits the pill at the beginning of the night. Oh, you're relaxing. Okay, here's your 10 things to worry about. Right? So one of my favorite interventions that's actually born of anxiety treatment, but that I've co-opted and I've moved into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia because it's fits with the theoretical framework. It's something called scheduled worry time. This sounds a little bit panicked and silly, but hear me out. If a patient came to me and said, Ashley, like, I worry all day. I'm worried about all of these things. My life is just a constant ball of worry and I said, okay, I've got a solution for you on it. It's two words. Ready? Stop it. Yeah. That wouldn't work, right? Doesn't work. So I take the opposite approach. Okay, this is really important to you. This is something you're doing all the time all day. Guess what? What do we do with things that are really important to us? Make time for it. We schedule them, exactly. So I have my patient literally get it. We sit back in the day of paper calendars. This felt like a different exercise. Now people get out their phones, but I have them get out their phone or whatever. I say, all right, we're going to schedule a worry time and it's going to be an hour a day for the next seven days. It is non-negotiable. I may or may not schedule an email to go out to you at that at the end of that time and you have to go and provide to it and tell me what you did, right? And what we find is that when people work with this during the day, it does two things. The first is, let's say it's 9 a.m. And you are trying to do something in your life and instead a worry pops up. You can actually think, oh, okay, I don't have to deal with this now. I'm going to write this down because at four o'clock, I've got scheduled time to deal with this, right? So that way you're uncluttering the rest of your day by moving all of the worry into that schedule time. So this could be a valuable technique, even absent in Somnia. Totally. I would tell you that probably between a third and half of my patients who come in with in Somnia, they've got some bad sleep stuff for sure. But for some of those people, it's a primary anxiety disorder and sleep is suffering also. Whereas other folks, it's primary in Somnia, that's driving them anxious, right? But to rewind back to your earlier question about the middle of the night versus the in the night. So the other thing that scheduling worry time does decides, uncluttering your whole day is it helps you get it done during the day so that when your head hits the pillow, it's not there. Oh, I already worked on this. And also the knowledge, oh, I have time set aside tomorrow to work on this or to think about this. So I don't have to do that now. And cognitively, this all makes sense and you would maybe think you can think your way out of this, but you can't. You actually have to try it. And I've done this with a lot of people. I've done this with doctors, police people, all people from all walks of life can really find this valuable. The other thing when it comes to falling asleep at the beginning of the night versus the middle of the night is that there's sometimes low hanging fruit that we can think about. You mentioned getting up to go to the bathroom. I found that for a lot of men who are 45 and up who still have a prostate, just not drinking very much fluid with dinner and after dinner is huge and also throwing an electrolyte tab in there can really help. Granted, it's got to be the right Osmalarity and everything else, but there are ways to find this. Don't slam gatorate at night. That's not what I'm suggesting, but just throw a noon tab or whatever element eat, whatever electrolyte replacement. And I've had some male patients go from waking up three times in the night to be to one time. And a few times you wake up in the night, the fewer times you risk not falling back sleep. So little things like that can actually make a difference for waking up in the middle of the night. The other one I have about the middle of the night is a little more out there, but hear me out. If I had five cents for every time, I took away a downcomperter from someone and their sleep got better. I'd have like eight dollars. I mean, this is huge and this is because everybody's heard of circadian rhythm, right? But it's missing a word. It's circadian temperature rhythm. Right? Body is supposed to be its coolest at night and it's warmest during the day. And my favorite people to talk with about this are actually anesthesiologists. They know more about body temperature than anyone. It's remarkable. But what I've had the great good fortune of learning is that your body temperature, it's most be the warmest during the day in the coolest during the night. And when we do things like trap heat with downcomperters, quilted nonsense, even cotton replacement dovet, if it were dovet isn't it? Comperter is in it. Woe, like I like that's a no for me. And I give people a handout. I'm like, here's the definition of a cotton blanket. Here are links to examples of what cotton blankets are. If you are cold, buy two, buy three. Use these. I'm telling you, it's made a huge difference for a lot of women, in particular with night sweats. And people wake up less sometimes because they're not giving their body this message that it's time to wake up because they're not as warm. People complain about their feet in their hands and I say, that's fine. You can put your downcomperter over the foot of your bed. You can wear some socks, right? But I take body temperature regulation very seriously and sometimes it's a quick fix and we don't need a whole lot of muscle fuss. Now, you've probably tried to, this is a very long way to answer your question. But I'll finish after this. The people at the start of the night, it's worth asking people to start at the night if they're cold, if they're hands in their feet are cold. If you've ever tried to fall asleep when your hands in your feet are cold? Yeah, I mean, I, uh, I try to be, try to be uncomfortably cold when I get into bed. Right, but your hands in your feet. No, generally not. I mean, it's just my body. Right. But again, I'm using a device to cool me as well. It's slightly different. Yeah. Yeah. But spoiler alert, it's pretty hard to fall asleep when you have cold hands in feet. And what we have data on from some interesting research in a totally different realm is that people with extremity circulation disorders, like, who have really grown hands or something like that. Right. Yeah. They will have more early in, what we call early in Somnia, which is difficulty falling sleep at the beginning of the night. Yeah. And when they get successful treatment or when you warm their hands in their feet, much easier to fall asleep. The whole warm foot bath before bed thing. That's an actual thing. So warming your extremity is help you dump heat. Right. So when you actually warm your hands in your feet, you can actually help dump heat from your core because your vasodilating. And when you fall asleep, you want to be dumping heat from your core. Hard to do that when your vasodilating is restricted in your hands in your feet. So for folks who have trouble falling asleep at the start of the night, we want to make sure their hands and feet are warm enough, right. And that they've dealt with the thoughts and the worries during the day. And that they're not trying to go to sleep at 9 o'clock when their body doesn't want to go to sleep until 11. A lot of people just think I need to have this much time and bed each night. And they get into bed and they struggle for two hours before their body actually wants to go to sleep. So a major part of CBTI is aligning when your body can produce sleep with when you're in your bed. I want to kind of go into many more of these because I know this is this is the exciting stuff that people are interested to hear about. But I do want to take one step back and just make sure we kind of understand how what constitutes cognitive behavioral therapy before we even get into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. So we've had a podcast where we talked about dialectical behavioral therapy, DBT, but we haven't covered CBTI. Okay. Can you give us a little bit of the tapestry of what defines it and why it if we're of course then has this additional subset of treatment for insomnia? Yeah, I should have done that first. That's a great question. So cognitive behavioral therapy, my favorite way to think about this is in a triangle. We have thoughts, we have feelings and we have behaviors. And you can think about this triangle as having these three pieces that are all connected. Cognitive and behavioral therapies are cognitive behavioral therapies. Generally we'll focus on one intervening on this process between thoughts, feelings and behavior, thoughts, feelings and behavior on one of these the sides of the triangle. Right? So let me just spell out a quick example process. Right. So let's say we have a patient with type 2 diabetes who has the thought I'm never going to be able to get my blood sugar under control. I'm never going to be able to manage this and not be able to do this. When a person has those thoughts, how do they feel? Crumming. Feel bad about themselves. When people feel bad about themselves, what do they do? Eat some chocolate cake. Eat some chocolate cake. What does that do? That reinforces the thought. I'm never going to be able to do this. So we've got this pattern of thoughts, feelings, behavior on repeat. And cognitive behavioral therapies will choose where to intervene on a process in that triangle. So we might intervene. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, for example, is really focused on the area between thoughts and feelings in many ways. Because people will have a lot of thoughts. I can't sleep. I'm never going to be a good sleeper. If I don't sleep eight hours tonight, I'm going to lose my job, whatever. And then the big emotions that follow from that. We work on questioning a lot of those thoughts to then recalibrate the feelings that follow. Like, oh, if I don't sleep eight hours tonight, I won't feel great. But I'll probably be okay at work. The feeling is much smaller than if I don't sleep eight hours tonight, I'm going to lose my job tomorrow. Right? There's noticeably different. In terms of depression, an example that I might be someone saying, oh, you know, I'm really depressed now. But when I feel better, I'm going to take my grandkids to the movies. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take my grandkids to the movies. I'm going to take them to the zoo. I'm going to do all these things. As a therapist, what I might do is I have the patient right all of this huge, long list of stuff they're going to do when they feel better. And then you know what I'm going to do. I'm going to get out their calendar with them. And I'm going to say, all right, I don't care how you feel. We're scheduling all of these things. So we're intervening on that behavior to thoughts line, right? So we're going to make them take the kids to the zoo. We're going to make them take the kids to the movies. And then the kids are going to have a great time. And the patient's going to come back and say, oh, you know, pretty kick ass grandma kids at a great time. This was pretty great. So we're intervening on the behavior to change the thoughts about the self, right? Like, oh, I'm going to do these things when I'm better. Right? So a major feature of cognitive behavioral therapies is intervening on behavior to change thoughts, but also intervening on thoughts to change feelings. And there's just many, many applications for this. Coagulated behavioral therapies been adapted for a whole host of disorders for eating disorders for insomnia, specifically for anxiety. That's going to be more in the thoughts and feelings realm too. And it's a lot of fun. So it is that kind of running the triangle in the other direction. So you change behavior to change thought, change thought to change feeling. Yeah. So you can you can change thought to change feeling. You can change behavior to change thought. You can operate on any any way of those with different techniques that have been just repackaged into different therapies. And tell me a little bit about the history of CBTI specifically, when did the, when did the idea come to, you know, existence in a way that's, that it's been packaged more or less the way it is today? Yeah. So cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is actually old news. I mean, we can go back to the 1970s. I remember when I was learning cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, one of the most fun studies to read about was the study of, I believe it was college aged men who were not doing well academically. And the intervention that they did with them was one of the two pillars of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is called stimulus control. What they did with these young men is they told them, all right, you're going to be assigned a carol in the library. And in this carol is the only place you can study. You can't study in your dorm, you can't study outside, can't study anywhere else, just this carol. Right. And only this amount of time can you study each day. Even if you're on a roll, we don't care. You have to stop. If you're miserable, we don't care. You just have to keep on doing whatever portion of the studying over and over again that you're stuck on. Right. So they trained peep these young men to just study in that one place. And it succeeded in helping these men. And these men were struggling with anxiety or actual insomnia. Yeah, they were, there's just, this is just stimulus control. Yeah. Where we learn to associate a place with a behavior. Right. Fast forward, a little bit. One of, it was actually, it was called the Bootsin Method at one point for Dick Bootsin. But one of the hallmarks of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is your bed is only for sleep. There are two things you're allowed to do in bed. I always tell my patients, your two things that you can do in bed are sex and sleep. If you're not sure of something counts, message me and I'll clarify it for you real quick, whether it counts in one of those two buckets. But we really want to just associate the bed with sleep. And the state's even further back. And to be clear, just going back to this study was, was there a belief or were some of these guys studying in bed? They were studying in their dorms in their beds and everywhere else. And everywhere. So this wasn't specifically a study focused on sleep per se. It was just studied, it was just focused on this associate of pattern that became the bed rock of this treatment. And we can go back even further and we can look at Pavlovian conditioning, right? The dog and the bell and the food. And we don't need to go over that whole thing again right now. But the point just is that the dog came to associate the bell with getting food, right? And a lot of times when people are struggling with sleep, you know what they're doing in their bed? They're reading. They're scrolling. They're watching TV. They're listening to podcasts. They're doing it like everything. A lot of people by the time they get to me, they're camping out in their bed just in case. They're able to sleep. Oh, I'm going to go over snacking bed because if I'm sleepy enough all over and take a nap and I'll get some extra z's, right? So people have moved so much of their lives into their beds that it's completely dissociated from sleep. So that's a major. That's one of the bed rocks, right? And then another bed rock is what we now call time in bed restriction. This used to be called sleep restriction. But I think I don't know where along the way in the last number of years it went from being called sleep restriction to time and bed restriction. But whoever made the change, I'm still not sure who made that change. I am thankful to them for it because the other key component of CBTI is that we restrict the amount of time that a patient is in bed to match how much time their body can actually produce of sleeping. But how many people have been told me? I said, okay, I need to be in bed for at least 12 hours. If I want to get seven hours of sleep, right? I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. And we just obliterate that notion. And this is another core and very old part of CBTI that dates back what? 7, 1970s, 80s. But when you take those two parts, then you start to add in some of the cognitive components that have been around also for decades. The cognitive therapies part, the air and back stuff with cognitive restructuring, which is where we take a thought. To be fair, that phrase don't believe everything you think. So you take a thought. And on the classic thought record tool, you'll have patients write down the thought, right, down how they feel, write their feelings for say, 0 to 90%. And then we have them write down, what's the evidence for this thought? If you had to go to court right now, and there was a judge at a jury and what have you, and you had to present evidence for your thought, what would you be able to present? Evidence for a thought is not another thought. It's not a belief. It's evidence. Last time I slept six hours, I got a worse grade on the test or something, right? That would be evidence. You got worse grade in death. But then we, we look at all the evidence for our thought. We look at all the evidence against a thought. Like, oh, last time you didn't sleep so well, you didn't get fired. You still did find in school, whatever the thing. And then we create a balanced thought, which is, okay, even though I'm not going to be as well rested, I'll still get through this day, right? Then we have people rewrite their emotions, rewrite how much they believe this new thought, this whole song and dance, right? This is the cognitive component. And that's kind of the bedrock of so much of cognitive therapy. And so, of course, people have so many negative thoughts about sleep and dysfunctional thoughts about sleep that aren't true or that are catathed to advising and whatnot. That is also blended into the treatment. And then we have relaxation techniques, which are things like progressive muscle relaxation that came along as well. And those are part of the treatment. And that progressive muscle relaxation will be like, where you squeeze your hands and let go and squeeze your hands and let go and then squeeze your arms and let them go and kind of move through your whole body to get out of your head and into your body. And I don't know what order those actually were packaged into CBTI. But I can tell you the first two, the stimulus control and the time and bed restriction. Those were among the earliest, earliest parts of CBTI. And what we know from dismantling studies is when you take either of those out of the treatment, it is. Yeah, I want to talk about both those a little bit more. So I want to bracket sleep hygiene and come back to it because I think again the temperature and all that light stuff. We shouldn't gloss over that even though it's easy to take for granted. And I know that many people listening to this podcast will have heard other content where we talk about it. But I'd love to have it all in one place. I think the time and bed restrictions pretty interesting and in talking with sleep physicians who also implement this, it seems quite draconian at the outset. It can be remarkably difficult. Like, you know, they're giving people five hours in bed, max. And they're really trying to force sleep pressure, right? So how do you navigate that and how do you decide how hard to squeeze the tuba toothpaste? Let me draw a line in the sand between what CBTI says, broadly as a treatment. And then how I've actually implemented it in my clinic. So what CBTI will have you do is they will have you as a, and I say you as the Royal U, your patient, they will have you felt something called a sleep diary. And this is a paper diary that covers seven days. We have it, right? Because if I asked you how well you slept four nights ago, you mean like, you have so that food frequency questionnaire and epidemiology. Totally. Totally. So you have to every morning. Yeah. Of course, I'm not obsessed with it being exact because I'm much more interested in the picture pattern of it, right? If you asked someone to fill it out for just one day and then worked with that, you'd have a totally distorted picture. You wouldn't know what you're working with. But what classic CBTI does is they'll take that seven day sleep diary. And then they will actually use the time you got in bed, time you fell asleep, how and times you woke up, how long you were awake, what time you woke up. It does a bunch of, it has all of these different questions in it. And you can use that to calculate how much time a person was sleeping on average over the course of the week. And what CBTI does is it says you patient, why don't you pick what time you want to get up every day? And then you would ostensibly pick a time. And then the CBTI clinician would say you're sleep log said you were naturally sleeping six hours and eight, right? The clinician would add 30 minutes to that and make it six and a half hours and then work backwards from your chosen wake time. So let's say you chose a wake time of 7 a.m. I would work back six and a half hours to get to a bedtime for you of 12 30 a.m. And of course, that's the bedtime of your childhood dreams, right? Imagine going to sleep over and your friend's mom saying, all right, kids, you can't go to bed until after 12 30 a.m. Right, kids love it adults think this is torture, right? Because it is. So that's what classic CBTI would do. But six hours being the number six and a half. Yeah, right. You get that half hour of this. Right. And as far as I know in CBTI, almost nobody's restricting less than five and a half hours. Five and a half seems to be the floor. Okay. So I've not seen people restricting to five. There are a subset of people and I don't know the data on this because I don't even know if the data exist on this, who are what we call genetically short sleepers. Yep. And these people know who they are. They have always been like this. They've, they've, it's not, and it's not upsetting and distressing and causing them grief, right? Those are, we're not talking about those people. Yeah. Okay. So that's what CBTI will do. And just to be clear, let's say five and a half is the floor six is typically what you would do. So six and a half in bed. So we'll know if your body is producing six hours of sleep, I add 30 and I get six and a half. If your body is producing only five and a half, I add 30 and you get six. So I do this computationally for each person. I see. So when I bring my sleep log to you and you've seen that for the past week, I've been spending 12 hours in bed, but by my recollection, because I'm looking at the clock when I'm not sleeping, I'm only getting six and a half. A half hours of sleep in the 10 or 12 hours I'm laying there, you're going to say, oh, okay, that's your sleep time. Take that, add 30, that's your time in bed, working back, I got it. Yes. And here's where what I do slightly different, but also keeps the, the whole theoretical underpinning is not disturbed at all by the way that I do this. So how many times have you had a patient come to you and say, oh, you know, I really want to be that person who wakes up at five am gets a go on my day, I want to get my exercise in, I want to get my meal prep in, do all this stuff. And you're like, oh, okay, cool, cool. So you want to be a five and person, what time you get up now? All like 11. And I'm like, oh, okay, all right. Okay. So this whole part in CBTI where people choose their wake time, that's not a thing for me. In my clinic, we play a game called Democracy within a dictatorship. What that just means is that instead of just letting patients cart launch choose their wake time, I actually look at their sleep diary and I let them think they're choosing their wake time. And if I agree with it, they will have chosen. If I don't, the dictator comes in. And I look at their diary and if they are getting up at 7 am, 6 am, 7 am, 7 am, 6 am, 6 am, 6 am, and they say, oh, I want to wake up at 830. I will say, well, we have no evidence that you can sleep until 830. That's not realistic. But we have evidence that you can sleep until 6 because for the last seven days, you made it until 6. So 6 o'clock is your wake time. And this is not anywhere in CBTI. I've spoken with a lot of my colleagues who do CBTI and asked them how do you choose a wake time. And there is no standardized method. But by using this method, I'm definitely making sure that I'm at least gating the patient's sleep at a reasonable time. Because if I let that patient just choose 830 am as their wake time, and they were only producing 6.5 hours of sleep, they're going to bed at 1 in the morning. They're going to bed at 2 in the morning. And they're getting up at 830 because they chose their wake time as 830. But really, they're going to wake up at like 6 or 7. And they're not even going to cash in on the full 6.5 hours that they should be getting bed. So I've added in this component of my own of setting their wake time to be a much more reasonable time. And then what I do before giving them a bedtime, I give them a week at that wake time. And I see how much sleep is your body producing with this new wake time. Now, let's say you're doing this sleep log. And they're spending 8 hours in bed getting 4 hours of sleep. Let's say they're getting 5 hours of sleep, 8 hours in bed, and then they're taking an hour and nap a day. So they're removing all their sleep pressure during the day by taking that nap. But they need to take the nap because they're not getting enough sleep. So they're in this vicious cycle. So do you add the hour of nap time back to sleep and say, actually you're getting 6 hours of sleep. Let's do the exercise based on 5 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 6.5. No, no, no, no, no. We want to extinguish that sleeping during the day thing. So there's a difference between a person without insomnia, healthily using naps. And there's a person with insomnia who's tapping, tapping to compensate for what's not happening at night. So I think that to best explain this, I should just finish this example of the wake time thing. So if people, because this directly ties in, if I'm setting their wake time and then I'm seeing how much time they're actually producing sleep at first week when I give them the wake time, I don't give them a bedtime. I don't even do time in bed restriction that first week because for some people setting a wake time solves the issue, which is kind of nuts, but one or two of every eight patients who I see because I see patients and groups of eight will have a huge improvement from just having a consistent wake time because their body actually recalibrates and they start getting sleepy at a more consistent time each night because they're not doing that. And I do say in that first week, I take away the naps as I don't care how you slept last night. You need to just stay awake until you're ready to go to sleep. No naps for now. Now when I have patients, probably older patients like 80 and up, I'll be okay with a nap, but I'll often at this stage, I'll say look, nap, you have a nap opportunity of 25 minutes and a 25 minute nap opportunity means you set the alarm for 25 minutes, you get in bed and it's going to go off 25 minutes later and that's when you get up. I don't care how long you actually slept during that time because I don't want you going into phase three or phase four slow wave deep sleep during the day because that's what's going to really mess you up at night. Right. A stage two sleep nap is not really an issue during the day as much. That's not going to be so bad. But at this stage of the person with insomnia that we're talking about, I don't want them taking one hour and a nap in the day. And they come back that second week having done the week time that I said and I then recompute how much time and bed they're spending and then I still use that week time and I then calculate their bedtime. And then the true time of that restriction begins week two. Okay, but just to be clear, if you have someone who is using a nap to compensate for their insomnia, step one is, just kill the nap. Kill the nap. And then let the cards settle where they may for a week. Recalculate actual sleep time and then go through the exercise as described. I've just, I've made this point on a podcast before I think, but just want to get your blessing. When we're on bow hunting trips, you are going to bed insanely late and waking up insanely early. It's just a nature of when you get back to camp and eating and then you got to be up super early. So, you can't, it's not, I've never been on one of these trips where I could actually be in bed for more than five and a half or six hours in a night. So the strategy is to get that sleep, but then I always try to get a 90 minute nap at around one in the afternoon. And I reason I pick 90 is to get a full sleep cycle. Okay. And I tend to function incredibly well under those circumstances better than I would because when we were also very physically active. Like this is demanding time. So, would you argue that there's any, would I be better off not doing that nap midday? Oh, that's a bow hunting trip and you don't have insomnia. That's not a problem. Okay. All right. Got it. Yeah. Totally different monster. And I tell people to, when, because a lot of blast few years people have been had serious illnesses. They've had COVID, they've had whatever. You know, when, when your sick, all bets are off. And what I tell people is, if you need a nap when you're sick, you need a nap when you're sick, but we maintain stimulus control. We don't nap on the couch. We're only napping in bed. And if you're awake and feeling sick, then you can be on the couch, not in bed. Well, we're on that topic. What do you say to the legions of people watching who, um, fall asleep watching TV on the couch? Oh, the worst, right? So, a lot of people fall asleep on the couch because they're just so over tired that they've, they should pass out. Like, their body's ready to go to bed and they're just like, let knit and they're not getting up and doing the thing. I tell people, look, if you're want to prioritize your sleep, pay attention to your body. When you're watching TV, do you notice that you're starting to nod off? Do you notice your eyelids feeling heavier? Hands feeling warmer. You're starting to sag a little bit. Like, okay, these are indicators that it's probably time to get off the couch and go to bed. And for people who can't figure that out, I said, okay, you want to watch TV at night in the stool. You're going to figure that real fast. And what about just the social dynamic of it, which is when you have a couple and, uh, not that I'm saying this from experience at all. And one, one part of that couple, uh, they want to be together and watch TV, but one member of that team falls asleep immediately while the other does not. And the one that does not tries to tell the one that is to go to bed, but that couple says, but I, but that one wants to be with the other, like, I don't know if you can ever imagine a scenario like that. Yeah. I'm just making it up. Mm. Okay, good. I'm glad you're making that one up. No, I have a lot of these couple level issues that come up in sleep clinic. This is not uncommon. Because what's more intimate than being completely unconscious next to another person if you think about it, like evolutionarily, that's probably the riskiest thing you can do, right? So there is this desire for closeness in lots of couples. And it becomes a challenge when one of the members of a couple has a sleep problem. And the first step is remembering, like, that this is not necessarily permanent. We need to go about fixing this now. And then we can find a new winning solution. So in the interim, I'm assuming you've already tried, you know, maybe watching something different on TV that might be more exciting to the second partner, et cetera. And it's not about the boringness of the show per se. It doesn't have here to be. Mm. Okay, good. That's the issue. Then I would say, hey, like, this is a priority. What are we going to do? We're going to schedule it. We're going to schedule time to be on the couch together at a time when I can definitely be awake and be spending meaningful time with you. Problem is sometimes other members of the family who tend to be smaller, also tend to be occupying all of the bandwidth during those earlier hours when the member of the family in question is able to be awake. This is a hard problem to scale. But what I would just say is, if you're ready to go to, if you're actually ready to go to bed and your body is saying that you need to sleep, you should probably do that. It's more likely that then you'll be awake the next day and be a more pleasant, exciting partner to be around and be able to have more meaningful experiences with your partner that way. Otherwise, as hell people look, this is an issue. If it's really an issue, we're going to get a babysitter. Let's figure it out. There are ways to get around these things. People just often want it to work like they see in the movies. Like, oh, this should be easy. Now, if obviously I'm talking about my wife here, so I'll stop double speaking. But if my wife falls asleep every single time on the couch, but then when said Netflix is over and we go up to bed, she falls right back asleep and it doesn't seem to keep her awake. Is it pathologic? No. This isn't necessarily problem. What I would say is that we do tend to have, but we sleep more deeply at the beginning of the night. We experience more slow waves, sleep in the first half of the night and then more REM sleep in the second half of the night. I think other podcasts, guests you've had, can definitely go into the neurobiology of this much more deeply. But my way that I like explaining this has to do with evolution. If you think about it, one more deeply, deeply asleep. We're kind of tuned out, right? On the prairie, when we figured, okay, it's safe to go to sleep right now, our body's prioritized getting that really deep sleep when we knew it was safe. Then as the night goes on, we sleep more and more lightly, which makes sense because, hey, there could be lions and tigers around or whatever that are going to come in eat us. So evolutionarily speaking, it was adaptive to sleep more deeply in the first half of the night. Now, if your wife is falling asleep on the couch and getting some of that sleep at that stage of the night and maybe getting more interrupted aspects of that because there's noise from the TV or whatnot, it could be disturbing all the other stuff. That's the drawback, right? Makes sense. And just, and then to that effect on the prairie, right? It also makes sense that evolutionarily, that there's diversity in people who are night elves and early morning larks, right? We needed that diversity in order to keep the tribe safe from the threats on the prairie. Some people were staying up late, okay, no lines. Some people were up early, okay, no lines. And yeah, there's nothing pathologic about being a person who's going to be more likely to fall asleep earlier or be a person who's more of an idol. It's not, and it's very hard to change that. Yeah, a lot of patients want to change it. And there are broadly two to three different archetypes of that, right? There are the, I know there's a circadian rhythm test you can take online that kind of gives you a sense of it, but it's, I almost think it's so self-evident if you pay attention to it is your patterns. It is. And I'm, I'm really a clinician. So I deal with what's in front of me all the time. I'm not so concerned about these tests. I'm more concerned about what's the problem that's messing up your life right now and how can we work around that? Let's go back to sleep hygiene for a second. For a temperature. Yes. You know, nowadays we have these incredible devices that can cool our mattresses and things of that nature. Obviously we have air conditioning that can cool the room. Do you have a preference for one or the other? I mean, clearly not everybody needs to buy a mattress, cooling device if they can't afford it, that shouldn't be an impediment to sleep. So do you have a room temp set? We typically talk about the mid 60s as an ideal room temp do you adhere to that? Yes, mid 60s is terrific. And if people say, oh, if this is just too cold, I say, well, what's too cold that often they will say my feet? And we have wonderful solutions for that. They're called socks. And we can get really thick socks. And I'm also not opposed to, you know, those tiny little heating pads, you can get there like this big. I'm like a foot and a half by a foot or something. Putting one of those in the foot of your bed, it's got an auto shut off, shut off after like an hour or something to fall asleep with. I don't have a problem with that. There's no issue there. But yes, a cool room is definitely key. And you know, insert my refrain about down, comforters, duvets, etc. Get cotton blankets, get cotton sheets. And then let's talk about light. Do we need to have it so pitch black? You can't see your hand in front of your face. Do we need to block the moonlight? How dark do we need it to be? Yeah. So this is a common question. If you close your eyes right now, you'd be able to tell that it's light in this room. We can sense light through our closed eyelids. And many women would tell you that their eyelids seem to get thinner as they age. So I think an eye mask is a great addition. And this is for a lot of people early morning awakenings. Eye masks can be a game change because they don't realize that what's causing the early morning awakenings is a little bit of light getting the wrong part of their eye indicating it's time to be awake right now. And I don't know the details on what wavelength of light that is or what necessarily the light is coming from, whether it's a light in outside from the sun or the moon or whatever it might be. But the point is there's a lot of folks with early morning awakening can really benefit from having something covering their eyes, whether it's asleep mask or there's like hats that go down here now. I'm a big fan of making your room dark. I am one of those people who travels with a role of black electrical tape because you go to a hotel room and there's like 50,000 lights everywhere. And you wouldn't, you wouldn't just get relief from the eye mask and the system. I do, but I'm one of those people who rip my eye mask off in the middle of the night. And I've tried every single eye mask and it's come off. So I like to wear it. I start with it. I try and keep it on as much as I can. But I also, if there's a griegeous lights in the room, I cover the mudlock. Meaning like you're going to cover the alarm clock and over the bed. Oh, yeah. And no, there's none of that in my room. Yeah, I don't do that. But back to the cool thing for us. My trick is I unplug alarm clocks because I realize sometimes they're so complicated that they just go off in the middle of the night and I didn't realize it. Oh, totally. And the microwaves are the worst. Those are the blinking time. I'll clocks in there. But you mentioned the cooling mattress stuff, which I'm intrigued by, but I also am concerned about. It seems that a lot of these mattresses have settings where you can make it cooler, but also you could make it warmer. And I worry about two things. One is I worry about messing with our circadian temperature biology. Because you remember in the 1980s for a hot minute when electric blankets were really popular. And all of a sudden they're not. They were starting to see associations between electric blanket use and some cancers. And at the time, there was a lot of speculation that this was related to EMF. But the great thing that time does is it gives us more perspective. And there are some indications that actually that might have been messing with circadian temperature. And that might have been part of the issue. We know that night shift work is carcinogenic. So all of these things that need to be done. Yeah. Night shift works been declared a good question. Well, I mean, no disrespect to the WHO. I don't know what I believe that they say. I know that there's an association between night shift work and cancer. But do we really know that it's causal? I think if we go Bradford Hill on this. And we look at temporality. I think that there are our age-matched case control studies where they can look at people going through different to a control for history effects, right? To see our people getting more and less cancers. We know it's it is tricky because if for example, you look at firefighters, right? We're way more likely to get cancer. They're way more technical. It's a bit of way more other things in the mix. But I think that some of the more classic studies have also been done with hospital workers, right? Also confounding effects. But yeah, and how do we get around the confounding effects of the diet, the obvious dietary shifts that occur in people when they're working under those conditions? I mean, if I think back to how I ate in residency or how I ate after a night of poor sleep, I mean, it's yeah. I to me that's that would be more the cause. I'd put more of that on kind of the metabolic ill health that might result. But Macarion. Yeah, I think that there's it's it's often hard for people to sleep during the day, making that change from going to sleeping at night, to being a person who sleeps during the day. For some people, it's not even possible. You talk to some night shift workers. They shift, they sleep very little because they just can't sleep during the day. They're not able to flip. They're circadian biology. But there's a whole history, and I know we'll probably talk about thermal stuff in a bit, but of looking at disruptions in circadian temperature as one of the most common, like circadian disruptions in mental health disorders. Going back to the cancer thing, what would be the belief to mechanism of action? I would talk to an oncologist about that, and I would probably talk to a circadian biology person about that. But what I can just speak to is just my understanding that electric blankets are no longer here with us and very common because there were these observed ill health effects, whether they're due to EMF or whether they're due to messing with your body temperature at night. What concerns me about some of the exogenous interventions like mattresses that might heat up is that there's supposed to be a normal circadian temperature rhythm that we do during the day and during the night. And when we start imposing things on that, my understanding that some of these mattresses can actually be set to cycle different temperatures during the night and all of these things. Yeah, I think so the one that I use, and just by full disclosure, I'm an advisor to that company, the one that I use, you change how cold it is throughout the night. So I think I run it as, I think the settings go from zero to minus 10. Like, where my 10 is the absolute coldest. Zero is no temperature. Is that like a point skill or is that degrees? No, it's a point skill. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, I think I get in and I have it at like minus five and I run it down to minus 10. Okay. And then I bring it up to minus five in the morning. Something to that. So I'm taking it from cold to really cold to cold. Right. Okay. So where my concern is just that my understanding of some of these things. Your thinking people would heat themselves with these things. Yeah. But that gets to the point which we know we don't want to be warm. We don't want to debate. Right. But a lot of people get in bed and they don't like feeling cold. Because it is easier to fall asleep when your hands in your feet and your skin is warmer. Right. So people will maybe mistakenly do this for more of the nights than they should. And I'm just concerned that our circadian temperature rhythm is an exquisitely controlled system. And like a my a 10 point scale on a device. I think pales in comparison to the complexity of what our bodies need to do in terms of temperature. Well, I mean, I think that the good news is if you can keep your room at 65. Yes. None of this matters, right? And if you, um, and the biggest challenge, honestly, is hotels for most people. It's where you have the hardest time controlling temperature. Hotels are the worst. And there are some mattresses now that are just they're just hot. And there's a whole, well, there's a short list of mattresses. So I just tell people like, look, that's going to be a hot mattress. Don't get that one. And you want to be really careful to make sure that you can be cool in your bed. And I think the easiest way to do that if you don't have the money to splurge on you know, something that's going to be a mattress that's going to definitely be cool will be keeping your room cool. What about, um, blue light before bed? So so I've, I've looked at these data quite a bit. And I would say that six years ago, I sort of was in the camp of every light had to be red. So, you know, I had to have my phone shifted into a red light phase. My computer shifted into a red light phase. I had all of these apps that managed all of this stuff. So as soon as the sun went down, blue light was being removed from my electronics. And I have to say, I sleep subjectively and objectively better today. I say objectively if you can believe what a sleep tracker tells you. But, but we can bracket that and come back to it. We should. Um, paying never taking blue light out of my devices, but instead paying attention to what I'm consuming. In other words, my new hypothesis has become it's not the blue light that is the problem. It's the stimulus that often comes with the blue light. In other words, not looking at social media, with regardless of light color is a far greater positive impact on my sleep than looking at those things, but just making sure that there's no blue light coming through. Yeah. So, so let's talk about that. What is the, what is the role of minimizing blue light when it comes to preparing for sleep? That's an excellent question. Well, first, I want to completely agree with you. We didn't evolve for the neural experience of Instagram. That's not, we're not ready for that. Right. And I think regardless of what color light you're getting your Instagram on, that's probably not helpful before you go to bed. So, I think that you're entirely right. I think the larger problem is not necessarily the blue light, but is the thing that we're interacting with. Whether it's an iPad or a phone or a computer, because typically those things are going to involve social media, work, email, all of these other things that I think are much more potent disruptors of sleep than the blue light itself. I must caveat this though. I have had a few patients who have found, they were not using Instagram before bed. They were not doing email before bed none of this. Not there anything stress forced in you. No. But, and I just finished with a patient recently like this, who found that using orange colored glasses. And I'm talking orange colored glasses, not those beautiful blue light blocking glasses that are clear lenses that I'm not sure what they're really doing sometimes. Like I'm talking ugly, motor cycle, looking orange lenses. And I found that handful of patients wearing these two hours before bed, it completely ameliorates their sleep on set and so on. Yeah, such that they were able to almost immediately banbean. The beauty of these interventions is if you can isolate them to one change at a time, you can be empirical about it and something like wearing glasses is benign. I mean, you're only out the money you spend on them and if it works, great. And if you really want to test it, take them off and see if your symptoms return. Exactly. And if they don't, maybe it fixed you, maybe it wasn't that who cares if they return and you can fix it. Yeah, like again, I don't, I try not to be terribly dogmatic about this stuff. But I also sort of think that when people go to great lengths to remove blue light without removing stimulus, they're missing the boat a little bit. And for me, social media is not much of a stimulus. I actually don't pay that much attention to it, but work is. Yeah. So for me, the single worst thing I can do right before bed is look at email. Oh yeah. If I've like, you know, we're as watching TV, totally like it's a total beautiful way for me to be distracted by watching something mindless on Netflix for an hour. And as long as I don't go and check my email and see what got sent to me in the last hour. Right. It'll be great. It doesn't matter that I just finished watching a big bright screen of Netflix. Right. Doesn't seem to impact me. Totally. Because, well, one is much more interactive and stressful and one is very passive. And you're just watching a movie that has nothing to do with you, no bearing in your life. Right. And what I would say back to you, what I'm going to call AB testing, right? Whenever you want to test one of these individual, what I call low hanging fruit interventions, you want to collect your own data on a paper sleep diary for two weeks. Make the change. You must do it for two weeks. And there's a few more low hanging fruit pieces of sleep hygiene. By the way, do you have a nice template that people can like we have one that we give our patients. Again, it's super low tech. It's a piece of paper. Do you have one on your UCSF website? I can make it public. Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a link to it in the show notes just so folks. He's easy to do. And where we get the link ours as well. But yours is probably better. Arze is like boxes you color in. Oh, yeah. And it's like you put C when you had caffeine. You know, A when you had alcohol, E when you exercise. So we're documenting when did you exercise? When did you have food, alcohol, caffeine? And when were you in bed and when were you sleeping? By the shading. Yours might be even more high tech than mine. But what I will tell you is mine is just enough to get the information that I will definitely act on. That's okay. Nothing else. But I will tell you, can I go over a couple more pieces of low hanging on sleep hygiene? Yeah. So okay. So back to the glasses. If you are a person who has trouble with what we call early in so many as a difficulty falling sleep at the beginning of the night. And you're already not looking at your email, not doing Instagram. You're just annoyed that you cannot fall asleep at the beginning of the night. It's worth it to try these glasses for two hours and night for two weeks and see what happens. It's it's it's it's it's so easy to do, right? And to be clear what is our particular brand? I mean, I have no affiliations with any of these things. I can tell you there's some really nice ugly ones from low blue lights.com. I think. I still am business. But they look like motorcycle goggles. I do think that the wrap around features is important. It's going for it. Let's go for it. Right? So it's a worthy thing to do. Another important thing to do is to talk to your physician. I'm not a physician, but I work with a ton of them. And I learned this from an anesthesiologist. All medications have circadian effects. All of them. Somehow it's probably not known for all of them how they do. But they do. Make sure you are taking your medications at the same time every day. And at the right time of day. For example, I want to had a patient coming in saying they were taking 450 milligrams of bupropion for depression before bed. No. Right. That's going to be a pretty stimulating dose of some of the day for bed. So make sure that you go over your medications with your doctor and that you're taking them at the optimal times of day and be really consistent with your medications. And another one that is a particularly low hanging piece of fruit is something called decaffinated coffee. Turns out there are speculations that decaff coffee can have as much as 15 to 30 percent of the caffeine that regular coffee has. I haven't found that reference. I've dug. I've tried to find one that will show that. I haven't found exactly that. But there are some data from 2006 that were published saying that you know 15-ish percent. But then again, more recent data have shown that Starbucks, I think, says that their 12 ounce has 155 milligrams of caffeine. But outside laboratory testing found like 310 something like that. So when you're decaffinating coffee that's much more caffeinated than you started with, this can make it an absolutely huge difference. I tell people were done with caffeine by 11. That's my 11-am. That's my standard. Unless we've got an extreme face delay or phase advance, I should define those terms. A phase delay is when you go to bed really late and you wake up really late. A phase advance is when you wake up really early and you go to bed really early. So someone who's waking up at like 330 in the morning and going to bed at like 8 p.m. That would be like a phase advance. Phase delay would be like I'm going to bed at 3 a.m. and I'm waking up at 10 a.m. Right. So in those cases, I might do something differential with the caffeine. But for most people who are neither of those, I'll cut it off at 11 and it's that includes your, your caffeinated coffee and your decaffinated coffee and I never take people's caffeine away. Caffeine withdrawal is not something I want to deal with in my clinic and I don't think it's necessary. You can cause a lot of damage taking me by someone's coffee. People really don't like that. Really put some in a bad mood and it's not necessary. So I tell people do not change how much coffee you're drinking, put it all before 11. Right. Just move it all. What fraction of people are such rapid caffeine metabolizers that they seem immune to caffeine and sleep? I think that that person doesn't actually exist. I'm not, I need to be convinced that there are people, I mean, what the normal caffeine half life is four to six hours. Right. So even if we take someone who's four hours, that means after four hours you still have half of a cup of coffee and after eight hours you still have a quarter of a cup of coffee and if you have that coffee at two PM and that coffee actually had three hundred and ten milligrams of caffeine in it and it was only a tall coffee from Starbucks and there's a lot of contingencies to build in here. But I, I could tell you people, someone just know, actually stops using the coffee after dinner and it's like a world of difference for their sleep quality. People will say, oh, no, I fall asleep. Just fine. It doesn't affect me. Well, it is affecting you. It's affecting the electrical quality of your sleep throughout the whole night and I would refer you to talking to like a sleep neurologist to interpret some of those sleep studies and talk with you more about that. For my purposes, all I need to know is the person who's trying to fix the insomnia is, oh, you're having two D.K.F. coffees after dinner every night. That could add up and that could be doing something and that could make your sleep less restful. Okay. So low hanging fruit. Just stop at at 11. Like do the experiment at a minimum. Okay. So those are three. But don't forget is the key thing. Anything, any other really obvious things to AB test for two weeks? So do you want to talk about getting off medications or do you want to leave that and put that in the next? Let's wrap up all of this and then I want to do I do want to talk about the weaning off. Especially the ambience and the lunastas and the all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that that's the major part. I will tell people also people like to fall asleep with podcasts on don't do that. Including this one, right? Right. Yeah. Well, this is an easy one to fall asleep too. But I don't know. I hope that people aren't falling asleep listening to this. Although if this helps them sleep, one of the things we want to talk about is on the realist re-reoxation techniques. Where does or does mindfulness based practice come into it? So anyone who's done mindfulness based meditation probably appreciates how difficult it is. It's not like, you know, transcendental meditation where you're focusing on a mantra. You're instead focusing on a sensation typically breathing. But body awareness is a thing that you want to focus on. Is that counterproductive or is it productive as you're laying there awake? So my unsatisfying answer to so many questions is always going to be at the pens because there's moderator variables, right? And when it comes to CBTI, what we know is that what's been tested is progressive muscle relaxation, which you could argue is a form of a body scan, which is part of many mindfulness practices, right? Where you scan your whole body, you think about your hands. You notice how they're feeling, are they warm, are they soft, whatnot? And you move through your whole body with progressive muscle relaxation, you squeeze your hands and you let them go, you squeeze them and you let them go. It's more of an active process that you're paying attention to throughout your body. Doing this in bed right before you fall asleep for a few minutes is fine. That's kind of the one exception to the sleep and sex rule. I tell people that it's also fine to practice this in other parts of your house. You don't have to just be in bed. But the body scan and mindfulness in general has been studied in combination with CBTI. And what the data have shown is somewhat fascinating. There's no actual differential improvement on sleep duration or metrics of sleep. But people like the mindfulness stuff. They report they're just more they're more happy with it. They like they like doing that. Right? But in terms of actual improvement on sleep outcomes, I don't think it really adds too too much to CBTI. The effects with CBTI are pretty whopping. When it's done well, you know, 50 to 60% of people can get remission and 70% can get clinically meaningful improvement to their sleep. So that's, I mean, in the world of psychological treatments, that's really good. But to circle back to your question, mindfulness is great. I think there's a lot of practical uses for it for helping yourself when you're in psychological states. You don't want to be in. It's a great way to be in life. But when it comes to sleep, do I need you to start a mindfulness practice to improve your sleep? No. So you mentioned 50 to 60% of people are going to have a remission closer to 50, but yeah, 70% will have a clinical meaningful clinical improvement of the 30% that do not. Why when does the treatment fail? The treatment fails when people don't do it. So in other words, we're really saying it 30% of people are not able to adhere to the treatment. I wouldn't go that far. There are some people who are genetically short sleepers. And at some point this may become distressing for them. I had a great, I had a story of a patient who was in her 70s and came to me saying, I have a huge problem. My sleep is not good. And I asked her, okay, so tell me all about this. She was like, upper 70s had a volunteer job in Sanford. Like really active, full workout plan. I'm like, you're crushing it, lady. What's the problem, exactly? She says, well, I joined the study and I had to wear this wearable device. And I woke up in the morning and it says that things are not going well every morning, morning after morning. And it says I'm at risk for different things. I'm not going to say which wearable company was, but and I said, okay, okay, so there's rips. There's an amazing treatment for that. Can I see the wearable device? Can I please just have that wearable device? Here's my vise grips. Exactly. So, and this was a while ago, but I took it away from her because I think, you know, and the wearable devices now are not doing doing this. This was, oh gosh, seven, eight years ago. This is actually, I actually wanted to ask, this is a, I made a note to ask you this question, which is when do you tell people? Because we do this with our patients, which is take the tracker off. We're doing a six month tracker holiday. Yeah. Done with the tracker. Done. So, is that kind of mainstay part of your treatment is like, let's get all that anxiety out of there for people with insomnia. I tell them, yes. And I do like with, we're coming to me in my clinic. The people who have bothered to wait a year and a half to get into the clinic, those people, yes, I am telling them that. And so, to go back to your 30% of people, the genetically short sleepers who become distressed about their sleep are not going to be helped by CBTI. They're not. Maybe they shouldn't be helped. Maybe there's nothing to fix. Correct. Yeah. Correct. But they're presenting. So, I'm putting them in the group. I got it. And then, yes, we know that there are so, there's such a huge body of data on CBTI at this point. It's just wonderfully studied. And we know that when people don't do the treatment, it doesn't work. adherence is a major, major component. Duration of treatment also matters. It seems that if you do four or more sessions with a therapist doing the CBTI, your outcomes are going to be way better than if you try and cut it way short with one or two. My treatment is five sessions. I do an intake. You get five treatment sessions. And then I do a follow-up where we just tidy things up. And the space between them is a week. Always one week. I am militant about this. If you're going to miss a week, you can't be in it. You have to wait for the next cycle. Given that people are waiting a year and a half to see you, tells me that there's a mismatch on the supply demand curve. Yeah. Why is that the case? Yeah. This is a great question. So, first of all, there is a great directory that I can give you for the show notes where people can, so there's actually a way you can look up all over the world. We use it ourselves. But this is a slightly regional sleep medicine thing. Yeah. So, that is how you would find a provider who definitely knows how to do CBTI. One of the major problems comes down to psychologists and providers taking insurance. A lot of the best folks there in private practice, they don't take insurance. And you could be paying hundreds of dollars a session to see them. Right? And they're pretty backed up as it is. And they don't take insurance. Yeah. I am fortunate. I get to work at UCSF at the OSHA Center for Integrative Health. And we take Medicare and all kinds of insurance. So, people can pay minimal or non-existent copays to see me. And there are other CBTI providers at UCSF. They're waitlists are long, long, long too. In fact, in order to see patients now with any volume, I don't see individual patients. I see eight patients at a time in group medical visits. And I do it 90 minutes every week, all eight patients in that 90 minutes to get it done. So, what will it take for AI to replicate what you're doing to scale this much more? Because a lot of this, I'm a lot of the work I do can be done by an AI. How much of the art and science of this is teachable to LLMs. And and at least as another offering. Like, I'm not saying it should ever displace what you're doing or what a therapist is doing. But if we have a backlog of people for years, shouldn't we have an alternative, which might say, look, there's an online course that you can do that will give you 70% of the value of what you might get sitting in the group with Ashley. Oh, hey, if you can find a way to replace me, I'm here for it. If we could actually just come up with an alternative to scale. Here's the issue. There are some CBTI apps, smart phone apps, and it's out there. And I've had patients who've tried these and they're while they're waiting. Yes, exactly. And they'll come in and they'll say, oh, you know, it might help a little bit. But, and I think the major issue is that many, many people with sleep problems think that their sleep problem is unique. It's special. This can't be treated by just a generic app. My problem is different. Right? And the joy of me having a group is that people can hear that everybody's problems are different. And I'm going to treat you all the same way. You're all going to do the same things. You might do it at different times. But you're all going to do the same things. And I think that there is a world where AI can help with the personalization aspect. And I'm actually I'm actually helping a company that's making an app. It's called the rest. And they are integrating AI to use, for example, the way that I calculate someone's wake time, which is not something that's in standard CBTI. They're incorporating that. And they're able to actually do more tailoring. And I'm excited to see where it goes. But I think that the biggest fly in the climate with this is going to be getting patients to look at the fact that they have been assigned to wake up at the same time every day for the next seven days. And think, oh gosh, I only wake up at 5am two days a week. Normally now I have to do it every day. Getting them to really do it is going to be hard. Before my patients enroll in my clinic, they watch a 10 minute video. And it's a really scary video. In that video, I'm basically saying, look, this is going to be hard. You're going to hate me. You're going to want to make a dark board with my face on it and play darks on it. You are going to suffer in the beginning of this treatment. But guess what? You have been suffering for months or years. Now you're going to suffer for five weeks. You're going to do my way. And if you don't like it, you can go back to your way. This is five weeks of your life. How bad can it be? How much worse can it get? So I do one of these kind of pep talk videos. There's just something about knowing that someone else is actually really paying attention to one of the biggest problem. If not the biggest problem in your life at that moment, sleep is a 24 hour day problem. This is not just a problem at night. It is affecting you all day. It is intensely personal. So it's a lot to trust and algorithm or an app to know, oh, okay, I really should do these things. I think it's a big ask and it's hard. By the way, when you're giving them that bootcamp speech, is the time and bed restriction typically the thing that causes the most distress. I think the thing that causes the most, well, that's a great question. They don't know about that at that stage. I intentionally am not people are in the dark at that stage. I just say, look, we're going to do this thing. It's going to be really hard. You're going to get worse before you get better because everybody sleeps less the first couple of weeks, right? Well, we're getting all these things lined up. And for some people, what ends up being the hardest is the wake time because they're used to just sleeping in whenever they can or catching up on those catching up on those hours when they when they can. For other people, those the super late bed time that I give them, that's what crushes them. Oh, my gosh, I have to stay up until then. But the great news is that we dial it back over time. And I don't think we talked about this part with time and bed restriction, which is just that there's a benchmark for efficiency, for efficiency. And we define sleep efficiency as the amount of time that you're in bed sleeping, divided by the entire time that you're spending in bed. And the benchmark is 85%. So each week, I'm actually calculating sleep efficiency from people's paper sleep diaries. And once we do time in bed restriction, if they are above 85%, I move their bed time back 15 minutes. And then if that's the same for another week, you move back another 15 minutes. And people say 15 minutes, two cares. I'm like, oh, you'll care after after four weeks, that's an extra hour every night. That's huge. And our people able to with a high enough fidelity report awake time in bed. Like for example, like if I were doing this, let's assume I've got a clock next to my bed that I can look at because you have to do that for this purpose. You have to have some device to keep track of time. So I get in bed because my time in bed tonight is 11 and my wake up time tomorrow is 530. Okay. So I get in bed. It's 11. Check. Okay. How do I know what time I fell asleep? Let's just say I didn't have an issue falling asleep. How do I know if it's 1115 versus 1130? I'm looking for the difference between five minutes and 50 minutes. One of those for that time to fall asleep thing, right? And in the middle of the night, when you're waking up, guess what? If you're not getting laid, you're getting out of bed. So you can look at the clock. You're like, all right, I'm out of bed. And then you have to go do what I call a very fun and potentially embarrassing activity. Embarrassing, meaning if you're boss caught you doing this activity during the work day, you should feel embarrassed. So for example, reading people magazine or reading some trashy magazine, right? You wouldn't want to be caught at your dust doing that at work. That's exactly what you should be doing. I see you're sitting on the night. So person wakes up at two in the morning, the idea, and they can't go back to sleep. Get up. Yeah. Go and do something that is not productive, not rewarding in the way that, hey, this is I'm building a pattern around getting up and doing something I like. Right. So I wouldn't be able to get up and play chess. Do I wouldn't be able to do the online chess thing that I love? Maybe maybe not. I mean, I tell people they can play solitaire. Okay. Adult coloring books are all the rage. People that I couldn't check email. No. Work related work is a definite no. What about scrolling social media? No, no. We don't like that. Again, like although that meets the criteria of your you would be embarrassed catching you doing it, right? We don't do social media or interactive nearly, like neural experience we didn't evolve. That's fine. Okay. But we don't read about global warming, current events, politics, pandemics, like those things are off the menu. Stock trading? I have it stressful. I wouldn't do that. Okay. So there's a narrow subset of activities that you are going to get out of bed to do. Yeah. Yeah. Stuff that's kind of boring, but entertaining enough because we don't want you to get a habit of looking forward to doing something in the middle of the night. This happens with parents. So I'll have parent, like a parent, for example, who might be busy all the darn day with their kids and their families needs and everything else. And then in the middle of the night they wake up and it's like, oh, this is me time. This is when I'm going to do all these really fun things that I don't get to do during the day. We don't want to make a habit of you time being between three and four a.m. That's really when you want you to be sleeping. Right. So sometimes you have to schedule that stuff during the day. But we want the stuff in the middle of the night to be mildly boring into that and back to your blue light thing. I don't mind if people watch, for example, an episode of mash or Gilligan's Island or sex in the city or some other sitcom. I like 20 minute episodes because then you can generally turn it off, check in with your body. I think am I ready to go back to sleep and then you can go back to sleep. Do you remember in the 90s, um, if you played video games ever, how we had those like cartridges and we go put them in and sometimes we have to take out and blow them out to put them back in and reset them because they would freeze. That's what you're doing when you get out of bed in the middle of the night, you do it for an activity. You're resetting and then you're going back to sleep instead of just having stewed and bed that whole time. Yeah. Right. And it's much easier to fall back to sleep when you have that reset. So we don't want the activity to be too stimulating, but just like mildly boring and entertaining enough. Got it. That's right. Yep. Uh, one obvious thing we haven't talked about and maybe it's so obvious we don't need to, but just to close the loop on it as food and alcohol and how they pertain to this. Um, so what's your, what's the checklist you run through with the, with the clients? So since we're dealing with so much life, I actually don't mess with their food. All I do is say, hey, really, let's try to not eat within three hours of going bed. Okay. Right. Um, sometimes it's rare that I'll have nighttime binge eating disorder to deal with at the same time or a blood glucose issue that, you know, diabetes that's poorly controlled at the same time, but I'm going to put those cases aside for just a moment. Okay. So I generally will go with don't eat for three hours before bed. And when it comes to alcohol, I tell my patients look. This is five weeks of your life. I'm not going to drink and you're not going to drink. So when I'm running a clinic, nobody's drinking. And the reason for this is that in order for me to actually see what's going on with your sleep, I need to see this with the least perturbation possible. And alcohol and marijuana are those things. Now, if people are using a lot of marijuana or a lot of alcohol, I'm not here to put people into withdrawal. So they just don't enroll until they're, no, no, no, I don't. So what I'll do is before people come to their first group, I have them do a sleep diary so I can see what's going on. And before that, I will have done their intake and I'll have them have told me their alcohol and taken all of the side at all. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to, you're going to not or you're going, like, let's say someone I just finished with some people, one of them was drinking between 16 and 20 ounces of wine and I, his huge, okay. And I said, okay. So you're going to drink two ounces of wine and I out of that same glass. And then you know, you're going to keep using that glass and you're going to drink something else. Some other fruit-food drink, I don't care what it is, right. But I want it to be something that is, you don't drink during the day, so I want it to be, you know, overpriced juice or overpriced bubbly water or something like something special. Some special, right. And you're going to keep drinking it out of that wine glass. And I have them do that, right. And I make sure they can do it before they start treatment. And they generally can, because again, the other part that I have going for me is that people have been waiting so long that by the time they get to me, they'll do what I say, which is just this lovely, lovely gift that I have. But I'll make people be very consistent with that, they'll be like, oh, I have to drink two ounces of wine and I'll say, yes, you do, you must. I want this consistent, right. That's the thing, consistency. And so if someone's saying, oh, no, I drink three nights a week and I'll say, all right, cut it out. You're going to stop. I'm going to stop. Are there any specific cognitive techniques that people are instructed to be working on when they first wake up? No. Nothing. There's nothing. No mind game to play. It's all behavior behavior. I'm all business. Yep, it's CPTI. I'm a purest. And I don't involve the cognitive techniques until week three of five. Okay. And that's when we get into things like scheduled worry time, working with the thought records. And then also one of my favorite things to do with patients who seem to wake up in the middle of the night, maybe at one AM, they jolt themselves awake, worrying about something in particular. And if I have a patient like that who every morning, every night in the middle of the night wakes up at one AM and says, I'm very worried about thing A. Also, okay, thing A. Here's what I'd like you to do with thing A. I would like you to track how worried you are about thing A all day, every couple of hours. It's called tracking degree of belief in the thought. And what you might find is that I'll I'll build on this with an example of a patient that I had actually this might be an easier way to explain it. I once had a patient with multiple sclerosis early 30s, pretty debilitating disease to have when you're that young, working a full-time job who used to jolt awake in the morning every morning at 7 AM thinking I'm never going to make it through this day. My whole body hurts. This is a mess. I'm never going to be able to do this. And she would lay in bed for two hours until like nine o'clock, thinking these thoughts. Just, oh, I can't do this. Right now, the clock should get out of bed. She'll shower. She'll get to work by 10 o'clock because in the Bay Area, all these tarps don't start till like 10. And then she'd actually get her coffee, work with her assistant, do her meetings. And if I asked her, how much do you believe that thought I'm never going to make it through this day at noon? She'd probably say, oh, like 50, 60% like this afternoon is going to be rough. I don't know if I'm going to make it through. But if you ask her at 530 when she's done working or whatnot, oh, how much do you believe that thought I'm never going to make it through this day? She'll like, oh, I made it. Zero percent. And day after day, she started really, I was like, oh, I don't believe this thought at 7 a.m. because it's true that I'm never going to make it through this day. I believe this thought because it's 7 a.m. Right? And once she was able to make that connection, we were able to recapture her mornings. And at 7 a.m. she went and said, on her couch, and she started doing something she loved doing 7 in 9, which for her was learning Italian with an app. She loved it. And 7 to 9 used to be her most hated part of the day. But by the end of treatment, it was her most beloved part of the day. Because no one was bothering her and she could learn Italian and whatnot. And so one of the tricks and not tricks but cognitive tools that I've built into CBTI in that cognitive package is tracking how much you believe a thought over a given day. And if you believe a thought in different levels throughout the day, how true can it really be? And it's really a lightning. And I would invite you to notice what you're thinking about at 1 a.m. And then just see how worried are you or how much do you believe this the next day at 3 p.m. Oh, not at all. How come this gets airtime? How come this deserves airtime at 1 a.m. but not 3 p.m. Let's talk about sleep supplements. So do you do a purge of supplements when people come to you when they say, hey, I'm I'm taking a pound of melatonin every night. I'm on an ashwaganda drip. You know, just rattle them off. Let's we could go through this. Can I give you two links for the show notes to studies of melatonin supplements that found that these melatonin supplements either had none of what they said they had in the park? Yes, I think we wrote a newsletter on one of them. Oh, great. Well, there's been two. And so when people come in and they say they're taking melatonin. I'm like, okay, the alleged melatonin. How much of this is it? Are you taking? Let's assume that they're, you know, because obviously you're the guillist. Well, let's assume that they're taking, they are actually taking melatonin because they're getting it from one of the companies that submit to third party testing. Okay. And so now they know they're doing it. And again, let's further, um, posit that they're not taking a dose that is deemed too high. So if you look at some of the sleep literature, you know, there seems to be a kind of like most people would agree anything north of a melagram is probably just too much, um, whereas kind of in the three to 600 microgram, you know, there might be some some benefit. And more importantly, not just benefit, but actually safety, like it might be, you know, you're not sort of downregulating melatonin receptors, you're offsetting the natural decline in melatonin levels over time. I can tell from your face, you don't agree with any of this. So no, I mean, it's puzzling. So it's, it's, it's, my face is also because it's hard to know where to go with this question because so some countries you need a prescription for melatonin, right? This is something prescribed by an doctor. It is regulated. Yeah. Um, I don't remember all the countries off the top of my head, like Australia and New Zealand, but not you want that. You're not going to find it at their Walgreens. Um, but, you know, in the US, taking too much for Kent Killier. So here we go, right? Um, there are, by the time someone gets me if they've got a huge list of supplements and they still have a sleep problem, I say, okay. So clearly, these aren't doing what you want. They might be undermining what we want to do. I don't know what's actually in all of those things because none of that's regulated. The data for things like Ashwaganda are weak if you want to go Bradford Hill, we could. Um, the data are also pretty weak for melatonin except in certain cases, which we can get, we can unpack a few of those with the explicit acknowledgement that I'm, I'm not a physician. I've not been trained in this in the biological substrates whatnot, but your question is, do I take people off of this stuff? Yes, get off that stuff. It's not worth it. If you want to take it after training me with me again, great. But let's get off of it for now. Let's see what your body's actually doing because chances are you've been taking, you've been adding a supplementer to or whatnot over time for years and we didn't even know what your body wants to do now and you actually could be shooting yourself in the foot with some of these things. Right. Now, on the contrary, sometimes a patient will come in and we'll say, oh, I'm taking the beta blocker for blood pressure. Now, you and I both know that's like a fourth or fifth line treatment for blood pressure at this point. Nevertheless, beta blockers inhibit melatonin secretion. And yet, most prescribing doctors who are giving out beta blockers don't realize that there's a significant risk of insomnia when you prescribe these to patients. And I've had some patients who don't need treatment with me at all. They need a 0.5 milligram melatonin pill every night and that's it. And those are some of the most angry and satisfied patients ever. They have one visit with me. It's done their furious that they've been suffering for five, ten. I had one patient who suffered for 30 years taking, oh gosh, Metoprolol. And he wouldn't you couldn't change his supplement because something having to do with the vocal cords, he was a singer. And some of the other blood pressure medications affect that. I didn't fully understand, but he would not change blood pressure. So that was all that he needed. But do I think that the average healthy adult should be taking melatonin? No. No. Now, there's probably some excellent data that you are much more aware of than I am about how our melatonin secretion inhibition processes what not change as we age. And there may be some patients who benefit from taking melatonin, which is a hormone to induce sleep. But remember melatonin's like the guy at the start of the race, right? He's the guy with the gun. He fires the gun. He doesn't have a car on the race. He's not like helping you stay asleep. He's telling you when to start the thing. So for a lot of adults taking melatonin is really messing him up because they're trying to go to sleep when their body isn't ready to go to sleep. They're forcing it to go to sleep. Then they wake up in the middle of the night and they wonder why. And it's because, oh, you want to sleep at the wrong time and your body's all kinds of confusion. Yeah, interesting. So I really try and take people off of these things so I can see what's really going on. And then if there's something going on that looks like it might necessitate melatonin, I tag in one of my physician friends and talk about it. So what about sleep medications? And let's talk about as many as you want. Like, like, I get talk about benzos. We can talk about trasodone. We can talk about ambian. We can talk about the erects and base drugs. How many of the patients who come to see you are on a regularly taking one of these prescription based drugs, firstly. A lot of people take over the counterdrugs and prescription drugs for sleep. And there was a huge shift that I noticed when COVID started and there was a ban on flying to different countries, Mexico and Europe. And it turns out there are a lot of people who will fly to Mexico to get their ambian or and fly to Europe to get very sleep drugs that you can't necessarily get here. So all of a sudden, I saw a wave of patients dealing with withdrawal in the early months of the pandemic because they couldn't go get more of their drugs. Oh my gosh, I'm screwed. What am I doing now? How do I cope with this? So there was a mate? And why couldn't they get them here in that situation? Oh, ambians prescription only. And if you're saying they were buying it out, prescription, I got it. And they just they couldn't get a prescription while they were here. Yes, because they were taking so much that they were well beyond what they could convince someone to prescribe them. And a lot of physicians are, and a lot of my patients are physicians. And a lot of physicians are pretty redicent to go above FDA recommended doses when it comes to ambian. A lot of people don't realize that I believe I believe this is the case. The ambian is still the only drug that is differentially prescribed to men and women according to the FDA that's starting dose for women should be five millions of grams. Sorry, no, it's five to ten for instant release. And then for extended release, I believe for women at six point two five and then for men, it's six point two five all the way to 12.5 because women metabolize it less efficiently. So I mean, the people who I've seen, I've seen people taking 30 milligrams, big big doses, right? And gosh, this is a very loaded question. But there's a lot of patients who come to me who will say, I've read something in the news. It turns out this medication I'm taking for my sleep is bad for my brain. It would be like, oh, I can't see saw that. And I want to quit immediately. I need to quit my next week. Oh, okay. And you've been taking it for how long? Oh, 20 years. Okay, right. That's, oh, mm-hmm. So that never works. That never works. And I don't have, I wouldn't say that I have any sort of extreme expertise in the different classes of sleep meds. But what I can tell you is the ones that people most often are coming to me saying, I want to quit this. I hate being dependent on this. What do I, what do these are going to be the benzos? Yeah. Which doctors are becoming less and less hip to prescribing for sleep? Ambien, the synodal illness to stuff. And then over the counter stuff, like Benadrill, maybe your occasional doxipin. And then people are often prescribed remeron for sleep. And they run into metabolic issues. And they need to get off of it. So I think that covers, probably the most, the broadest swath that I see of things people wanted to quit. Now, the cubic of it, is that some of these newer ones, I don't see them as much yet. I'm sure it's coming. Yeah. And what about trasodone? Trasodone is the one that I'm the least concerned about for a couple of reasons. I've not seen compelling data that it negatively impacts the electrical quality of your sleep. No, in fact, I've seen data that it does the opposite, that it's slightly positive. Great. I mean, I just, I'm looking for what's negative. Yeah. I think I don't know if that the study that you're speaking of was statistically powered to, if the primary outcome was improvements in sleep or decromance. I think the, I think if I'm now I'm trying to remember something that I wrote many, probably three years ago, I believe the study looked at sleep duration as the primary outcome in a secondary outcome may have been staging. Yeah. So I don't think it was powered for that, but I think that incidentally did find an improvement. I think you've talked about extensively. Like it's important to think about what was a study power to look at. And all that, but I'm not the most worried about that also because it's an anti-depressant drug. And if someone's taking it and it is helping with their depression and I take them off of it in the name of trying to help with their sleep, I have created it a different problem. Although the dose people take it, it tends to not have that effect. I mean, most people are typically taking it at kind of 25, 15, typically no more than 100. Maybe at a hundred depending on the size of an individual, they're getting some of that benefit. I often see a hundred for sleep. Yeah. And so for me, I'm thinking, ooh, I don't know if that's just for sleep. Right? And then I'm also, if I see 50 even, and then I see another anti-depressant, I think, ooh, these could be working together. You actually also have a diagnosis of depression. We need to think about this carefully. So if folks are showing up on 20 milligrams of volume or, you know, Sanxer, Picker, Favorite Benzo, do you have them go and do a tapered detox with their physician before they come into the CBTI program? No, I have them do it with me. Most of the times. So you will manage the medical withdrawal on that? Let me explain exactly what I do because a scope of practice, right? So first of all, I always work with the prescribing physician. I never start without making sure the prescribing physician is explicitly aware of what I want to do. I talk with them. And this has to be one of your colleagues at UCSF or whoever they're prescribing physician. Who ever is prescribing the medication to this person? We now share a patient and have an obligation to. I, every single time I have done this, the physician has been in support of getting their patient off of benzos, except for one time, which isn't even worth really getting into, but the point is, it's an overwhelming amount of time. Yeah, I can imagine. Most of the time, these patients, these physicians have already tried to get their patients to quit and to reduce. But in my opinion, they've tried to do it way, way, way too quickly. And that's because there are physiological dependencies on these drugs and psychological dependencies on these drugs. And we have to attend to both of them while we're doing this taper process, or it's going to be a box, and the patient's going to relapse, and we're going to be back at square one or square negative one, unfortunately. So, here's what I do is, I'll, let's take, can we take a boring example? Pick your favorite benzose. They produce. I don't particularly like them myself. Yeah, no, they like it. Let's take volume. Well, okay. 10, 10 milligrams. Yeah, sure. So, let's say we've got a patient on volume. They've tried to quit. They've occasionally abused. They've gone up. They've split in next, and half. They've gone to 15 sometimes. What not? The first thing that I do with the patient is I say, all right, we are going to get you stable. Actually, for sake of better example, for sleep, let's just put you to ambient because it's a little fun. And we can make more coffee. And a fan of ambient, a very nice. To take, let's say 10 of ambient every night at the beginning of the night. And then let's say sometimes they're actually taking a fiber in the middle of the night when they wake up because they want to get back to sleep. Right, like I like the party dose. Right, right. So, let's say there, you know, some nights, it's 15, some nights, it's 10. What do we do? So, the first thing I do is I take out the middle of the night dosing and I say, we're done with the night. You limited to 10 a night and you got to take it before bed. Well, yes, you have to take it before bed. You've taken the same time every night, but if you're taken, if you're going 15, five nights a week and 10, two nights a week, I'm going to make it a 12.5 before bed. Let's put generous. Start higher, right? So, we'll, we'll agree on a dose that the patient will take and integrate upon time. So, the prescribed or an I agree on that, it's like, okay, same page, this with patients going to do and they start doing that. Generally, the patient's like, no, no, no, I'm trying to quit. I don't want to take more and I see no, not before you quit, it must be stable. You cannot quit from a point of instability. It will not work. I've seen people try and people say, oh, I want to quit. I want to go from 10 to five. No, that's not how we roll. So, let's say this patient's taking 12 and a half and they're like, okay, I want to I want to cut down. I'm like, all right, okay, so how does it go in from 12 and a half to five sound and they say, oh my gosh, that's going to be really scary. I don't think I can handle that. And what I actually have them do is I rate it on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most anxiety-provoking upsetting thing and 1 being not upsetting at all. This is called a subjective units of distress skills. So, it's okay, I have them suds it. So, I say, okay, so, going from 12.5 to five, that sounds really terrifying now because they've just done a week, right, with our consistent with 12.5 at the beginning of the night, they've had no middle of the night crutch and they're not feeling great about that, right? So, then I say, okay, so how about going from 12 to 10 and they say, oh, not as bad, but that's still like a six on my scale and I do this process all the way until I get them to a one and I'll say, all right, so next week we're going from 12.5 to 12. How are you even making that increment? Yes, I can tell you exactly how we're doing that. We're going on the internet and we are buying something called a gem scale. Now, you and I both know that people who are wealthy enough to have gems worth measuring aren't measuring their own. So, the people who are buying those scales are using them for other things. And so, what my patients end doing is they buy these scales and they get a full blown like breaking bad set up in their bathroom. We're going to, okay, we're cutting pills, we're weighing pills, we're doing math because the pill actually weighs more than 12 and a half because it's got binders and fillers and what percent doing it, and we kind of make it fun and they end up having to put the crumbly pill into a shot glass of water. We shoot it in the whole thing. We make a whole production out of it, right? But the point just is, they're going from 12.5 to 12 and we do that for like three weeks. They've been on it for years, we're going to three weeks. And the first couple nights are a little rough. So, they're only doing a seven week program with you, you're no. Oh, no. Yeah, no, this, this table program we make and it will last a year, it'll make a long to the last one. So, when they enter the program, this is a separate issue. This is a separate issue and we do this after they finish CBTI treatment. During CBTI treatment, I stabilize them on their meds and we just get it. So, they're not erratically taking five different cocktails of things. When people come in to see me for treatment, they'll say, oh yeah. So, Monday's I do ambient. Two days I do transit on Wednesday's has been a drill because they have it in their head because they think they don't want to get dependent on one. So, they think they're by doing a rotating merry-ground of these things that is actually smart. I wouldn't have even thought of that. Oh, yeah. Well, working great. Yeah. So, I generally work with the doctor and we decide, okay, here's the one you're going to do. Here's the dose you're going to do and you're going to be consistent with that. It's a vodka on Monday and then Tequila on Tuesday, red line on Wednesday and then Shard and A Thursday and this way I'll never be coming alcohol. Oh, you figured it out, Peter. So, in short, I have people really stabilized during CBTI and sometimes during week four, week three, four, they're ready to start this and we start them on this program and once I have them in this way, they're able to do this on their own. So, they'll go from 12 to 12.5 for like three weeks and they'll be keeping sleep diaries so they'll see like, oh, okay and look at some confidence. And then they'll email me, you know, the message me and let's say, okay, so now what and I'll say, all right, well, how are you feeling? Like, how, what if we go down to 11.5? How do that sound? Like, sometimes that'll be too scary. For some reason crossing the five threshold is really scary, so we go from five to four, point seven, five sometimes. And just to be clear, this is psychological. They're can't possibly be a physiologic difference between four and four, point seven, five and five, million grandfamble. That's what the medicine isn't even homogenously enough compounded within the capsule to, like, yeah, okay. So as long as everybody understands that. Probably not. But, you know, it's a test. I'm thinking some of retablets and I don't know about the homogenes. I don't know about the requirement. Yeah, because the binder and the active ingredient are, in no, like, yeah, and generic S.B. 85% similar to the, to be able to, there's all kinds of messups here. This is, remember how I said there's the psychological part, the physiological part. This is a psychological part that I think it's left out of a lot of the, oh, just cut it in half to start decreasing your dose aspect, which is dealing with, okay, what can we physiologically do? I'm talking about what can we psychologically do? And do you think that this methodology of the incredibly slow taper with incredibly high precision? Do you think it works for opioids? So I don't think I've ever seen that in my clinic. It's just not something I've had to do it. I don't know if I'm asleep. I just mean in general, like if we're dealing with people that are, or is the problem so grave that you have to be a little more aggressive and switch them to a completely different class of drugs like that's so far outside of your area. I can't speak to it, but what I can tell you is just that doing this method with the sleep drugs slowly over time, people get more confidence and they can make larger reductions at a time. And then importantly, Peter, when someone gets is tapering and something crazy in their life happens, like a child gets diagnosed with cancer or something terrible happens, we stop the taper and we stay so your taper might look like this. Right? But there's not a huge rush to get off this thing. You've been on it for 20 years. Better to stable you get off it. I always joke with people like, yeah, if you think if you can lose 10 pounds in two days, how quickly do you think you can gain two pounds? Right? So when it comes to quitting these meds, slow and steady wins the race, having people gain the confidence that they can do it is such a big part of it. And I know that one of the critiques I've gotten from folks is like, wait a minute, some of these pills have coatings and deadoted it. But it's a lot of it is psychological. So this works really well for a medication taper and people can do it themselves. There's no, there's no like magic. I mean, I think we've kind of covered a lot on CBTI and let's now revisit the idea of the types of things that people should be on the lookout for that need to be addressed first. Right? So we haven't talked about sleep apnea. We haven't talked about restless legs syndrome. No. We haven't talked about, I don't know, what are the other things where you just want to have some sort of sign off that says, hey, we've also confirmed that these things aren't present or what what gets your suspicion rows that says, hey, we got to look at something else because you're presumably not doing polysumnography on everybody on the way in. How do you navigate that? Yeah. So I have the wonderful luxury of being able to look in people's charts and see who referred them to me and why they are referred. They can't be self referred. Everybody needs a referral of some kind from any can be from anybody, but any any referral. A lot of my referrals come from sleep disorder centers because they've already done all that work up and they say, all right, it's none of these things. So here you go. If a patient tells me, I always ask a patient like, oh, it has your partner anybody you've slept with ever told you that you snore or that you sound like you're gasping for air in the middle of the night. So I do have a bunch of those types of screening questions and I aggressively refer to colleagues with expertise in those areas. But for treatment with me, a lot of times people have a CPAP and they say, oh, I don't really use it. I'm not sure about that. I say, well, I'm here to tell you that you should be sure about it and that you should use it every single night. It doesn't fit. Cool. I'm going to make a call because we're going to get it to fit. There's a different mask. You can probably get there's a you know, there are all these different issues that we can tackle. It just sometimes takes making a phone call and unfortunately a lot of patients don't have great follow through for their CPAP in terms of just help using it and figuring it out. So sometimes I have to just make that extra connection. The one thing I think I want to make sure that we put a bow on also is a obsession with bedtime. I can make you wake up at any time. By setting a very loud alarm, I can anchor you into your day with a wake up time and that can be consistent every single day. I cannot wave a magic wand and make you fall asleep at the same time every day. So when people think, all right, I'm going to get a handle on my sleep. I'm going to go to bed at the same time every night. No, no, no, wake up at the same time every day. That's a much more important first step. And if you're waking up at different times throughout the week, that is the first thing to fix. Yeah. What degree of social jet lag do you tolerate? Again, just for folks listening social jet lag, meaning the experience of changing your sleep time during weekends, which could be akin to jet lag if it differs by, you know, hours. In an ideal world, there would be zero. Right? In an ideal world, I wake up at seven o'clock in the morning every single day of the week for an individual who says, oh, but God, on the weekends, it's just so nice to not have to get up at seven. Do you say, look, give yourself a 30 minute grace and that would still be considered perfectly healthy? Great question. So during treatment, I tell people you need to wake up at the same time every day that ends in D.A. Why. So that means Monday, Saturday, Sunday. Yeah. Right. So that's all of the day. That's yeah. That's during treatment. I did check. Yeah. Good. There is no room for negotiation during treatment. We're in the dictatorship, right? But what I do teach people at the end of treatment is how to cope with the fact that life is going to happen when treatment ends. It happens during treatment, but there's a lot that pauses during treatment to be honest. But let's say that you've got a major event on a Friday night. You're going to go to a concert. Yes. And you're going to be out away later than usual. And what I tell people is, look, you need to pick which day of that weekend, do you want to suffer? And which day do you want to feel good? Because we can sleep in one day. You cannot sleep in two days in a row. That's going to take you off the wagon. We're not doing it. So let's say Friday night you go to a concert. And you want to feel good on Saturday. Cool. Sleep in on Saturday. Sleep in by an hour on Saturday. Okay. Fine. Go to bed on Saturday night when you get tired. Spoiler alert. You're probably going to get tired. Paths are usual bedtime because you slept in. But then Sunday you have to wake up at your wake time and Sunday you're going to suffer. But let's say you want to feel good Sunday. That means on Saturday you're going to wake up at your usual time. Saturday is going to be a struggle for us. But you'll make it to your bedtime. You'll go to bed at your bedtime. Then you'll feel better Sunday. So you just have to choose. One do I want to do this stuff for you? Okay. So basically force the suffering into the narrowest place possible. You can choose because sometimes people don't want the suffering to be the next day. They want to be the day after. So you get to choose that. But I tell people, look, don't sleep in more than one day in a row. It's going to mess you up. And generally sleeping in past your bedtime. You're not really getting quality sleep when you sleep in past your bedtime. I'm sorry, wait a minute. That's when it's been a pattern for a long time. When you sleep in past your wake time, you're probably getting some extra stage to sleep. You're not getting more deep sleep. That's for sure. That's not happening. We're recording us on a Tuesday. Sunday, two days ago, I was flying back to Austin from LA. And the flight got delayed over and over and over and over and over again for reasons that are so assomined. They're not even worth describing. And then we finally got on the taxi and then the water was leaking out of the coffee machine. So we had to go back to get another plane. I'm not making this up. But I can only tell you how ridiculous this is. The punchline of the story is we didn't get home till 2 in the morning, which is long past my bedtime. So what would your strategy have been getting home at 2 in the morning prior to Monday or workday? Where you do have some leeway. You know, I don't have to get up at 6, which would be my normal wake up time. Would you have said, just get up at 6, stick with it and make it up by going to bed a lot earlier Monday night, or would you say sleep until 8? You'll probably feel better than if you woke up at 6. How would you handle that situation? I'll say which day is more important for you to feel good on Monday or Tuesday. Let's say I said Tuesday because I'm sitting down with you. Well, then I would say probably try not to sleep in too much so that you can go to bed at your regular wake time on Monday and not have to. If you sleep in horribly on Monday morning, you're going to stay up later Monday night. And then you'll get up at your wake time today and your do will have had shorter sleep for today. It will have rolled all the way over. So I thought actually what I did. So I have not thought about this. I just slept until I think my wife tried to get me out of bed at 7 and I said, can you let me sleep till 8? So I didn't get up till 8. But last night you're right. I had a very hard time going to bed and I was like 11 o'clock and I was still up meandering around. So you just have to very carefully decide which day do you want to prioritize and that's how you make that decision? Yeah. So yeah. So you have more control than you think is what's what's beautiful about that. And I just remind people like you can never really make up for last sleep that easily because sleep architecture really matters. And when you're sleeping in, you're not getting more deep sleep, you're getting some more maybe light sleep. And at worst, that's robbing you of maybe some of the deep sleep you would have gotten the following night because you're on a circadian plan here. Right. And we didn't really talk about process S and process C. But maybe I can just briefly tell you what those two things would be. Absolutely. Okay. So process S is sleep homeyestasis and that's this sleep pressure idea that we are working on. Right. And every day we build up sleep pressure until it's bedtime and then we capitulate, we fall asleep and then we are our sleep pressure drains throughout the night while we sleep. And then in the morning we were full of, you know, then we build it up again the next day. And this is just a dead-assine building up. Yeah, I think about that. Yeah, I think about that way. And that's also why caffeine is problematic. Right. So caffeine blocks the denocene receptors. So that's the, you know, the caffeine crash, when it wears off and then all the denocene floods the receptors that we experience that, oh, sleepiness, right? So, and that's why taking a nap is so difficult because what napping does is it basically kind of deflates your balloon a little bit of your sleep pressure. It robs you of some of that sleep pressure. So by the time you get around your normal bed time, if you've taken a long nap, you've reduced how much sleep pressure you would ordinarily have at that time. That's why napping could be dangerous. And then we have process C, which is the circadian process. And that just marks you on. It doesn't really care about your sleep pressure or how much you've slept. If you ever, I'm sure you've pulled an all nighter, but when people pull all nighters, what they often will notice how many all nighters you think I've pulled in my life. Oh, hundreds. I mean, I would need scientific notation to count them. It's a pathetic. Yeah, a lot. So thing to note about that is that you're you're sleepy during the night when you're pulling the all nighter, but in the morning you kind of have a burst of energy. And that's the circadian part speaking up, right? And when we look at the the sign curve of it, right, that that's because your temperature is coming back up. Your adrenal glands still make cortisol. Everything still is functioned, right? So your circadian process doesn't really care much about the sleep pressure. So it's okay. If you lie in these two things up on a graph, they look like they talk to each other. They don't. But these two processes really determine a whole lot about your sleep. And there are things that we can do to support each of them. But CBTI really focuses on the sleep pressure aspect by regularizing people's schedules. And then it supports the circadian aspect. By some of these little things that I talked about that I don't even know if you can't really call them standard CBTI like standardizing what time people are taking their medications. For example, doing things that we know supports circadian biology, not eating right before bed. In my perfect world, all of these different zacoburs, which are timekeepers during the day, would be consistent from day to day. You lunch every day at the same time. Breakfast every day is anytime. All of these things would support your circadian biology and probably improve your sleep. Any rules about exercising? Do you have people that are showing up and you're going through your intake and you realize, you know, based on their schedule, based on work, based on kids or other obligations. The only time they're going to get their workout in is in the evening. And is that in counterproductive or part of the way? If it is an issue, how do you adjust? This is a really nuanced issue. I once had a patient who a long time ago who said, oh yeah, I take the 10 o'clock, spin class and the Castro. I was like, okay, moving on. I assumed it was 10 a.m. I was wrong and I learned that the next week and we were talking about other things. But for some people exercise at night is fine. For other people, it's super stimulating and it also really depends on what kind of exercise we're talking about. And I think that one moderating variable here is also going to be level of fitness. If you take a person who's extraordinarily cardiovascular unfit and you put them in a spin class in the evening, do you know it could take their heart rate quite a while to recover? You could probably provide me a lot more information about that than I know, right? And what we know in order to fall sleep is that your heart rate should be lowering, right? So if you're heart rate is still elevated from a whole bunch of exercise you just did, that's not going to help you. But if you're super fit and your heart rate recovers really quickly, it might affect you less. So this matters. I think there was for a long time kind of this general suggestion to not exercise close to bedtime. I still think for the most part it applies. But I think that it's important to think about what kind of exercise you're doing. If someone tells me, oh, I'm going to a yoga class. I find this really relaxing and calming. It's a form of stretching for me. Did it to fine? Okay. And this is the only time of day you can do it. You got to job you got kids, whatever, right? I'm not going to tell you to not go just because of the time of day that it is or weightlifting or whatnot. But if there's an option, if you want to go to a hit class, I'm going to say, well, can we not do it at a time of clock night? Like, I think it would really be great if we could move it earlier. We try try to do that. I do tell people, you know, I have some patience to come in and say, oh, you know, like, I wake up my body wants to wake up every day at 7 o'clock. But I really want to go to this 5A. I'm spin class every day. I'm like, okay, well, I understand exercise is very important. I'm a believer, right? Also, your circadian biology has you going to bed at 11 and getting up at 7. And even if you're getting up at 445 to get on your home, spin bike to do this thing with this group, your body doesn't want to go to bed until 11. And we're not going to be able to change that. So you're going to have to make that, you know, cost benefit analysis with, do you want to lose that much sleep to do that thing? Yeah. It's, um, I was on my mind because I was my brother and lot plays in a men's hockey league. And, you know, you only get ice time late at night. So I think they literally play Sundays at 11 p.m. or something. And he's always fried Monday because, you know, pretty hard to play a game of ice hockey and then, and then fall asleep right after that. So um, I'm not understand more, um, kind of how what the, what the spectrum of CBTI looks like. I mean, your process sounds super dialed in, but also it's quite bespoke. You know, you've brought a lot of your own expertise, um, to it. And you've created a system where you've got, we're going to do the intake. We're going to do these five sessions, which I think are group sessions. So you described them. Then we do kind of the exit. Um, you, you bring so much rigor to it. Is that, oh, is that the way it is always done or are there CBTI therapists out there who function like psychotherapists? And they say, yeah, we're just going to engage with each other for until your problem is fixed. And we'll see each other once a week or maybe once every other week. Like everything you're doing is sounds formulaic. And I say that not in a bad way. I think that's probably a big part of its efficacy. Um, is that something people should expect when they are going to a CBTI therapist? It's something people should ask for. I, before people start treatment, they fill out the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. And they fill out the insomnia severity index. And I tell them, look, we're going to fill this out when you're done with treatment. Two. And we're going to see how this worked for you. We're going to actually take measurements. What type of scores are you getting on the PSQI? I mean, ranges from zero to 21. I get all the way to 21. Yeah. And below five is considered, uh, no clinically significant sleep problems. I relax that to six or seven because if you have a prostate or if you're going through menopause and hip hop flashes, you're going to be, um, elevated on that scale by no fault of your own or your sleep's fault. And the insomnia severity index, I mean, yeah, we see, I see all the way up to what was it like 22, 23, something like that. So I see all the way up to the most severe levels in both of these scales commonly. And the average point drops are a huge, huge, in clinic. So I don't know if it was like 10 points in the insomnia severity index. Like it's, it's, it's, it's very high, very responsive to this treatment. But back to your original question is, I think I wish everybody did it this, this by the book. I think there's a lot of practitioners out there who want to do it this by the book. I have a luxury to do it this by the book because I'm able to enlist help from my team to help me process sleep diaries every week and do probably two hours of work outside of my clinic of prep for me. So they feed me my stuff. It's been built into the systems that I have. And I get to, and I, I'm prepping half an hour before, uh, clinic, I see everybody for now and half. And then I've got my, my notes, my templates and things. But I think that it is very difficult to do CBTI when you're not seeing patients weekly because I look at weekly sleep diaries and I make changes based on that. So when you find a CBTI therapist, I would say, ask if you can set up a time in the future without therapist and see them weekly for a set of whatever five to eight weeks and put it on the calendar that way with them. If they say, oh, they don't have bandwidth to do that for another month. So okay, call all weight and then get on every week. And a lot of practitioners also aren't going to necessarily score your sleep diaries for you. You can score them yourself if you want to. I mean, it's not that difficult. If you just Google online, you can find a sleep diary calculator and it's very easy to do the math yourself. There's a book that I really like called quiet your mind to get to sleep, which written by Rachel Manber and Colleen Carney and Dick Bootson wrote the forward. And it's, it's kind of a guided way through the treatment and you can use that workbook yourself to do it. And you could also use that workbook when you're working with a provider. But I think there are a lot of CBTI providers out there who can see you weekly and can do this. You'll probably just have to do your back end work with your calculations because they don't have the billable time for that. That'll be busy during the sessions trying to teach you things. I would also note that between my sessions with my patients, I make them much very annoying videos that I've made of myself giving a lecture about all of the science because I've found that if you explain the science to patients, you'll get the adherence. Here's why we're going to do this. People think, wait, I have problems sleeping now. You're going to make me not go to bed. This is not what I'm going for, right? And I have to explain to them, okay, here's why we do this because it's what ultimately get you where you want to go. But the principles of what I'm doing are not at all bespoke. I'm doing the time and better restriction stimulus control, the cognitive text techniques, the relaxation techniques and the sleep hygiene. Those are the five major components. What is bespoke is the way that I set the wake time because that's not been standardized in the literature, the way I deal with standardizing medications, the way I deal with medication. Tapers, some of the anxiety tools that I bring in like scheduled worry time, tracking degree of belief during the thought or tracking degree of belief during the day. I think that is actually pretty well incorporated into CBTI. But some of those are a little bit more tilted toward my audience, which tends to be higher in anxiety. So I build those in. But otherwise, find someone on the the website that will put in your note, shown notes, who know how to do CBTI. And I have a feeling you'll go far. The treatment works when you do it and it doesn't work when you don't do it. It's what I tell all of my patients. The book, um, quiet your mind and go to sleep. Get to sleep. You mentioned that that's something that people could do in therapy. But you also mentioned that it's something people could just do on their own. So if somebody's listening to this and they're thinking, I can't afford CBTI or be every practitioner I've called said the soon as I can get in his nine months from now, if my choice is continue to suffer or do something proactively you would recommend that as a great strategy to start. They can get that. They can try some of the apps. They're out there. I think they have less traction currently. They're still in early stages, but you know, I'm trying to help the rest of app, but the quiet your mind, you get to sleep. Book, people can do it by themselves. And I actually had a patient at the summer who was on the wait list. He got to, got his intake and he was like, look, I'm fixed. I did the book. It was awesome. But I still want to be in this group because I want to see what it's all about. I'm not giving up my spots. And it was great having them in the group, because they just cheerlead everybody else and said this works when you do it. Uh, any concerns with, um, extreme temperature changes before bed. So people use in son of people using cold plunge, taking hot showers, hot baths, and subjectively from my experience, uh, a sauna before bed really seems to help. Um, maybe it creates a great, a bigger gradient in temperature drop as I go from high body temp to low when I get into that super cold bed. But what, what, what is your experience with that and how do you manage it through the process? Well, it's first to cold plunge before bed off the table. Um, that's not a good idea because we know that when you get in the cold plunge, it's immediately cold on your skin. But then once you get out, your body is busy warming itself back up. And that's not what we want to be doing right before bed. Right? And then I'm going to go into the sauna part by saying that it's another it depends. Some, the, the, the, the, the outline that you just gave of the temperature gradient is beautiful. It makes a lot of sense. For people who are naive to sauna who get in a sauna and it increases their heart rate, increasing your heart. It might be the same problem as the exercise. Yeah, if they don't have the rapid recovery, they don't have the rapid recovery. So that's something to learn about yourself. And in fairness, I don't actually go straight from sauna to bed. It's usually sauna to 30 minutes in that flicks to bed. So yeah. So that's going to be person to person. Another thing to keep in mind is that some people who will go in the sauna at night, then drink a whole bunch of water afterwards. Yes. And then that ends up causing them to wake up more in the middle of the night. So it defeats the purpose. So that's a consideration. Also, if that's an issue for you. But I would say just don't make it too strenuous. Some people find that it's really helpful. I do best with it a few hours before bed, as opposed to right before bed. I think it's going to be a do what works situation because we don't have enough data. But we are, I just started an NIH funded trial where we are looking at people who have difficulty with falling asleep. And we are giving them whole body heating at home before bed and we're giving them cognitive behavioral therapy, for insomnia, through an app. And we're going to have them do this whole home-based treatment that's going to combine a body-based heat treatment for before bed with the CBTI treatment. And the idea here is what you explain, which is that by heating you up right before bed, if we're heating up your hands in your feet, we're helping you actually open the vascular and dump some heat. It's going to create that gradient. And we think that gradient might be important for people with the early kind of insomnia with falling asleep at the start of the night. So we're going to see if that helps people in a very using a sauna blanket type thing. Yeah. Actually, someone listening to us for the last two and a half hours might assume that the only thing you know about a CBTI, but it turns out that we've sort of only scratched the surface of your area of expertise and there are other clinical areas that you have a lot of interest in that I think our listeners would have interest in as well. So the good news is we think when I say we, I mean you, you've delivered kind of a master class on a topic that I've wanted to know much more about. You know, it's interesting. It's a bit of a black box because we send a number of our patients to CBTI therapy around the country. And I would concur with what you said, which is based on their ability to comply. The efficacy has been unparalleled. Simply stated, right? So, you know, as far as regular old doctors, I think we're pretty good at helping people with sleep, given the nature of our practice and how much attention we can pay. And therefore, I think just by ourselves, we do pretty pretty well. But when we can't, and we refer to CBTI, I'm not, I would have to think if there's been a patient who hasn't been helped. So that's, that's great. And but, but truthfully, you've filled in all the gaps for me, and I think more importantly, I think you've really helped listeners understand this and I hope given people a lot of confidence. Because what I also take away from this is there's really nobody who should be suffering from insomnia. It's, it's really not a necessary thing to suffer. There's things we might have to suffer within life, but this isn't one. I think from very, a very large percentage of the population, that's the case. I always, I almost, I'm afraid to say never because you just never know. But, but there are so many, so many people, countless suffering from this who definitely don't need to be. The drawback is we have kind of run out of time to talk about a few other things that are really interesting, which is not uncommon on this podcast, which means we're going to have to do a part two at some point to talk about eating behaviors, thermal regulation, the impact that that has on depression or other things like that. So apologies that maybe we spent more time on CBTI than we intended to, but as, as I kind of warned you before we started, we, we love to just me and or where the discussion goes. So is there anything else you want to talk about on this CBTI front? Those were that, that I have a lot of notes on, on kind of where I wanted to go, but I also realized there's probably something I've forgotten or if there's an area you want to double click on? Now, I think that it's really important for people just to remember with this one that even if you don't know what caused your insomnia, you can do this treatment. You don't have to have figured out, oh, this is where it started. This was the, the root of it all. You can start this treatment without that knowledge because this treatment is going to address what you're doing now that's actually perpetuating the problem. And don't wait, there's never going to feel like a good time to do it. Now is the best time. Your life is always going to be crazy. You're always going to have 50 more things on the schedule than you wish you did. It's always going to be too busy. You're always going to have events. Just do it now because it's so difficult to live with the live with insomnia and all the problems that it causes. I had this patient who was 87, who I finished treatment with last year and she just said, my, I wish I'd done this 40 years ago. So don't wait, just do it. You won't regret it. Are you under the impression that obviously people are waiting a long time to see you? That probably speaks to how good you are and the resources that UCSF provides maybe in combination. But if a person's listening to this and they're like, yeah, I wish I could work with Ashley, but I'm, I just want to work with somebody. Do you have a sense of how large the CBI community is and how long a person should expect to wait? Do these therapist ever work via telemedicine so that you have more opportunity to work with folks? I think that it is easier now to get than ever largely because of telemedicine. So I see patients all of our California. I'm licensed in California. So your eight people per bracket don't all physically come to San Francisco. Nobody does. Great. I'm only, I only see patients on Zoom now. Okay. We just actually a whole lot safer because patients used to drive in for example from Fresno that stay overnight in a hotel. Yeah, we just screw up the whole thing. It's no bad for everything, right? Patients would have to fly in in some cases. It's just, it was nuts. But now I can, I just see people on Zoom, which is great and there's a lot of versions of me who do that. And by going to that website, you'll be able to find a CBTI provider and chances are they do telemedicine. There are just so many benefits. And one of the great pieces of news about that is that if you live somewhere more rural now, it is instantly more accessible to you. Although we have to hope that the providers take have a, you know, if you live in Iowa, we want to make sure they have licensed in Iowa because you wouldn't be able to say somebody. Right. There'll be licensed in Iowa. Yeah. And there's also actually a growing and great thing called SciPact where I think 40 different states now are members of SciPact where if you're licensed in one state, you can be licensed in all of these states. Of course, California. It does not participate because we're California. But there are, it's getting easier and easier. And I do think that there's, there's ways you can start to do this on your own. If you get that book, if you try it app, you can actually do this. You just have to remember that as, as special as each human is, you need to try and not feel like a delicate flower with your insomnia. Just assume that you need to do this as it says you need to do it. Well, actually, this was awesome. I learned a lot and I'm pretty sure everybody listening did. So thanks for sharing and look forward to to round two at some point next year. Okay. Thanks.

the idea that lifting weights is a young person's thing or a male thing. I think both of those are just incorrect. Lifting weights is something every person on this planet should be doing. Is there a diet that you think is best or does it depend on the individual? In an aging population, the most important thing I want to emphasize is getting enough protein. If you weigh 150 pounds, are you getting 150 grams of protein a day? For people in this audience, how can they start to safely exercise while also managing physical limitations? Sitting is to lower back pain what verbin is to alcoholism. When I think of longevity, what I'm really thinking about is maximizing both the length of life and the quality of life. So you can do everything right. You can eat the right diet, you can sleep right, you can exercise, but if your emotional health is lacking, then it's like you won't live as long. It's possible, but I would say even more than that, regardless of how long you live, if it's unhappy, why bother? Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Welcome everyone. My name is Olivia Atia and I'm here with my dad, Peter Atia and we are here to talk to you today about longevity. So over the summer, I volunteered at a senior living center called Quarencia, which is where I met Sally who unfortunately couldn't be with us today because she's sick, but we got to talking and I discovered that she's very interested in my dad's work and as I'm sure all of you are. So we decided that we'll be here today and we'll be doing 45 minutes of conversing between us two to keep it interesting and then a little bit of time at the end for you guys to ask and things that you're interested about. So with all that being said, are you ready? As all ever be. Okay. So I think it'll be helpful to start talking about the actual word longevity because it can mean different things to different people. So when you talk about longevity, are you talking about living forever or how are you defining it? Definitely not living forever, although understandably that's probably what some people think of when they think of longevity. I'm talking about it in terms of two things. One of them is called Life span and the other is called Health span and Life span is the part that I think most people think of. It's the how long you live part. But then there's Health span which is the how well you live part. And both of these things are important. I would argue that they're of equal importance and an extreme of one without the other is not ideal. In other words, I don't think there's anybody sitting here who says I'd love to live to a hundred but I want to spend the last 20 of those years unable to move. I mean, that wouldn't be ideal. And similarly, I think the idea of living an amazing healthy life but that life being cut short prematurely at 50, nobody would think that that's ideal. So when I think of longevity, what I'm really thinking about is maximizing both the length of life and the quality of life. And again, quality could be further broken down into sort of a physical piece. So, you know, am I free of pain most of the time? Am I able to physically do the things I enjoy doing? And that could range from just the activities of daily living and self care to recreational activities. If you like to garden, how long do you want to be able to do that? If you play golf, if you like to go for walks and hikes or swim. And then there's a cognitive piece. So I don't think anybody would fully expect even at my age that my brain is kind of as sharp as hers is. But I still want to believe that my mind is pretty sharp. And I think we all sort of want that for as long as possible. And then the final piece is sort of an emotional piece that deals with happiness, sense of purpose, connection to others. And again, you can imagine a scenario where somebody has perfect physical health span, any may can do anything they want to do physically. Their brain is sharp, but they have no friends and no relationships. And I think we would all agree that that's also, that's not really an ideal life. And I don't think anybody would aspire to that. So that's a lot there. But when you put all those things together to me, that's what longevity is. And if some people here are wondering, is it too late to start caring about longevity and living longer? What would you say to them? I would say that that's not the case. I would say that on the one hand, sure, the earlier a person begins to take steps to increase their longevity, the more opportunity they have. It's sort of like investing, right? When is the best time to start saving for retirement? Probably the minute you start earning your first paycheck and your teens or 20s. But does that mean you shouldn't save money when you're older? No, it doesn't. There's also a lot of data that we have from clinical trials that are done with seniors that demonstrate that, for example, people who have never lifted weights in their life before who start lifting weights for the first time when they're in their 60s and 70s have a remarkable benefit. This is not just true of weight training. It's true of any sort of exercise. So the short answer, I guess, is that no, it's never too late to really start thinking about this. But obviously, the best time to plant the tree is yesterday, if not today. Why do they have a benefit if they haven't done it before? Well, you know, there's an effective training, right? So specifically thinking of exercise, the body is really a user-illusate organ or collection of organs and the muscles are a great example of that. So it's actually true of young people and old people. The greatest effective exercise is generally seen in the person who goes from being completely sedentary to even a mild amount of training. So if you look at somebody like me who exercises all the time or someone like you who exercises all the time, if we added three hours a week to your training or to my training, it actually wouldn't have an enormous impact. If you took an individual who did zero exercise and you took them to three hours a week, which let's be honest, guys, 30 minutes a day, six days a week is not a huge ask. The impact is enormous. That's strange. That's not what you'd think. Can you talk about the importance of adding life to years rather than just years to life and what that means to you? Yeah, it means a lot to me and I think it will mean a lot to people here because, again, the metric that most people think of is life expectancy. How many times have you heard it? Life expectancy is increasing. Life expectancy is decreasing. And I think the reason for that is frankly, it's just the easiest thing to measure because it's objective. It's quantitative and it's a single number. It's a number that shows up and it can be measured from a death certificate. We know exactly how many years to the day that a person lived. And if we keep track of that, we certainly know something about them. But my argument would be that it is not the most important thing. And again, I would challenge us to find an individual who would, if given the choice, and I don't think one ever has to make this choice, but for the purpose of the thought experiment, if you said, look, you could live to 80 in remarkable and perfect health. And then when your life is over, it ends very quickly and suddenly versus you could live to 100. But you spend that last 20 years in a painful state of decline. I think very few people would choose the latter, even though they're living longer. And I think what most people want is quality of life over quantity outside of these extreme examples, which are common and tragic where people die in their young. But I think when you really start to think about pushing those things, most people in my experience are more interested in quality of life. So when it comes to someone's risk of dying, you characterize the biggest risks as the four horsemen. So could you explain what those are? Yeah, I mean, you can't have a discussion on this topic without talking about the four horsemen, which you know, might seem a bit grim, but there's no reason to avoid talking about the inevitable, which is every one of us in this room is not going to be alive at some point. And I think to confront the how is important, right? So statistically speaking, all of us in this room are going to succumb to one of four processes or disease processes. So in rank order, the first of those would be cardiovascular and cerebral vascular disease. That's the leading cause of death in the United States. That's the leading cause of death globally. This leading cause of death for men and it's leading cause of death for women full stop. So that's a heart attack, a stroke. The number two and it's not that far behind in the United States is cancer. And of course cancer isn't just one disease. We lump it all together. But of course prostate cancer and breast cancer are, you know, frankly as as different as, you know, a pickup truck and a carola. They both have four wheels, but that's about where the similarity ends. Number three would be the diseases of dementia and the neurodegenerative diseases. And there's a lot of things in here, right? So you have Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia. But you also have lots of other types of dementia that are that are not neurodegeneratives, such as vascular dementia. And then you have the fourth horsemen is kind of a spectrum of diseases that we call metabolic diseases. The most extreme version of this would be type two diabetes. But of course all along the way, you have conditions like fatty liver disease and insulin resistance. And all of these conditions form a continuum. And the most important thing to know about them is, well, not that many people will die directly from those diseases. If you have anything along that continuum, it's increasing your risk of about, by about 50% of the other three horsemen. So we really want to think about a strategy at mitigating all four of these conditions and delaying them as long as possible. What would you say to someone that may already be navigating these chronic diseases that come with aging? And what advice would you give them on how to manage a high quality of life and keep hope during these times? You know, it would matter very specifically on which one we're talking about, right? So I certainly won't ask for a show of hands, but just based on the age of everyone in this room, it's impossible for me to imagine that nobody in this room hasn't already faced some of these diseases, right? So if you're sitting in this room and you already had a stent placed in your coronary arteries, that says, look, you've already had a brush with coronary artery disease. Maybe someone in this audience has already had a heart attack and you're fortunate enough to have survived it. All the short answer is, look, the fact that you've survived it is great and that means you get a second chance. Many people don't, right? So many people's first brush with heart disease is death. In fact, on average, about 50% of people, one in two people that have a heart attack, it's immediately fatal. So if you're in that group where you've had that heart attack or you know somebody who has and they've lived to tell about it, they're in the lucky camp and what they should be doing is everything in their power to not only prevent it from happening again, but to strengthen their body. And so, you know, the first thing I do is I ask myself, what were the conditions that I had that led to this heart attack in the first place? Now some of these conditions, you don't have a lot of control over. Genetics play a strong role here, but there are many things that can be controlled such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking. Those would be the big three. We have ways to manage all of those things. Also, we know that exercise plays a very important role as does metabolic health. So, you know, I've met many people who have had that near brush with death from that standpoint of a first heart attack they survive it. And what do they do? They turn it around and they say, look, I'm going to lose 30 pounds. I'm going to stop smoking or I'm going to manage my blood pressure cholesterol better. I'm going to take up exercise. And I know people that have gone on to live 30 years after that event that might have happened when they were 60 and they live until they're in their 90s. So I guess I would always frame it through the lens of, hey, am I fortunate enough to have survived this thing? And if so, what am I going to do going forward? So someone here asked what happens to our balance as we age. Fall seemed to be so prevalent here in our senior community. Can we help these problems from increasing as we age? Yes, if there's a fifth horseman out there, it's accidental death. Now what constitutes accidental death varies a lot by age? So when we're talking about people that are Olivia's age, the most common cause of accidental death is going to be car accidents and overdoses, drug overdose. When you talk about people my age, the most common cause of accidental death is overdose by far. When you talk about people your age, it's a total flip and the prevalence of accidental death goes up by five or six fold and it is virtually all related to falling. So what is, so I guess there's two questions. Why are falls so lethal and maybe more importantly why do people above the age of 65 fall so much more? And by the way, why do women fall disproportionately more than men? And why are women more injured by falls than men? These are the questions that I think we should spend a moment on. So let's start with the why do falls happen? You touched on it a moment ago. As we age, we don't just lose our balance, but we're losing something else that people my age and certainly her age take for granted, which is called reactivity. So the other day I was in the woods because one of my kids accidentally kicked the soccer ball down into the woods so I had to go and get it. And as you can imagine, the ground is very uneven, right? It's like this. And it's covered in leaves and twigs and branches. So you can't even see what you're stepping on. I'm sure you can all picture exactly what this is like. Every step is a spray and ankle waiting to happen. Sure enough, at one point, I stepped into something that wasn't as it appeared and I got jolted. And I had to react very quickly with my leg to put it in the right place so I wouldn't fall. And I did, and I'm here sitting here talking about it and I don't even remember which leg it was. That's how insignificant this was. But the type of muscle fiber that was necessary to do that, which if we want to get technical is called a 2A muscle fiber is the type of muscle fiber that is responsible for explosive movement. It's the type of muscle fiber that is the most powerful muscle fiber. Well, those muscle fibers start getting weaker and weaker and shrinking at about the age of 25. So I'm long past my peak in my early 50s, but I still have enough to hold me on. But at some point, they really, really start to diminish. And by the time someone's your age, you've got threads of those things left. So you're losing those things. Now, the good news is you can train these muscle fibers, but the only way to train them is to move very heavy weights. Sounds crazy. It's counts counterintuitive, but that's what we have to do. We have to move really heavy weights and we have to train in movement patterns like that, which means, for example, bouncing, moving side to side. Being rope, things like that are necessary for our feet to have the reactivity that you had when you were young. A second obvious issue as we age is a reduction in bone density and a reduction in muscle mass. And this is the reason why women are more susceptible than men to these injuries, because for obvious reasons, women have less muscle mass on average and have lower bone density on average. In part, due to the fact that many women didn't receive hormones after menopause and as their estrogen levels went down after menopause, their bones got disproportionately weaker relative to men, because estrogen turns out to be the most important hormone in preserving bone density. And so all of these things taken together are what mean that, you know, falling is something we have to be very mindful of. At any age, but boy, does it play a bigger role above the age of 65? And as I, again, I won't ask for a show of hands, but I would be shocked if no one in this audience knew somebody, if not personally, who hadn't experienced a significant fall that resulted in a broken hip or a broken femur and the tragedy of that type of accident is that in many cases, it's not fully recoverable. So you have the proportion of people that will die as a result of that, but even the people who live often about 50% of them never regain the same level of mobility they had before. So all of this to me points back to the idea that we want to be exercising as much as possible. I'm going to sound like a broken record saying this, but you're going to want to have your body as prepared as possible, because that physical piece is so important in preventing these types of injuries. Is there anything that people of this age can do now to preserve that muscle or strength in it, or did it have to be done while it was still like in their 20s? Sure. Obviously, if you could go back in time and I put you all in a time machine to win your 20, knowing what you know today, maybe you would exercise more, but that sort of interrelative point. I would say the point is what we do today is what matters. And again, I, you know, there was a woman named Belinda Beck that I interviewed on my podcast a few months ago. She's a researcher in Australia, and she did a study there that I really was fond of called the Lift Morse study. So this is a study that was done with a group of women, all of whom were over 65 years old, and all of whom had a disease condition of very, very low bone density. So as a group of 65 and plus year old women who had very brittle bones who didn't exercise beyond sort of like yoga and, you know, walking. So it's not like they were inactive, but they'd never lifted weights. And these women were randomized into two groups, one that continued with that type of exercise, and then one that engaged in really, really heavy strength training. And I love that there's a video of this on YouTube that is easily one of my 10 favorite videos of all time because these women who look so frail by the end of the study are able to, in some cases, pick up their own body weight off the ground, do a deadlift with their own body weight. And they're, you know, coached on how to do this safely and they're, they gain strength. And they really do hardcore powerlifting exercises like they're not, you know, holding the little two pound dumbbells, doing curls, they're doing squats, they're doing deadlifts, they're doing, you know, getting to pull up, bench press all sorts of things. By the end of this study, they defied something that we thought was possible, which is we never thought it was possible to increase bone density. We thought the best you could do was maintain bone density or maybe slightly prevent the rate of decline. But amazingly in these women based on the CT scans of their bones, they actually increased bone density. I find this to be one of the most uplifting and important findings with respect to aging. And I think it speaks to how the, you know, the idea that, you know, lifting weights is a young person's thing or a male thing. I think both of those are just incorrect. Lifting weights is something every person on this planet should be doing. Moving from risks into action. Do you want to quickly walk through the tactics in your longevity toolkit and then from there we can go into detail on each of them? Yeah, I mean, I think broadly speaking, there are five buckets of things that we have control over to impact all of these things we're talking about. So one we just talked about exercise and you can probably tell my bias is that that's the single most important one for the most part. So the second and no particular order would be nutrition. So what you eat matters and we will talk about that. I'm sure in more detail. The third one would be sleep. So, you know, the difference between sleeping well and not sleeping well has an enormous impact on your brain, but also on your metabolic health, which then indirectly plays a great role in in other diseases. The fourth would be all of the sort of medications and supplements, drugs, anything that your doctor prescribes or that you can buy over the counter. And these are of varying degrees of efficacy. Some of them are incredibly dubious. Some of them can be lifesaving. But again, all of those things we'd want to think about. And then the final bucket would be kind of all the tools that we would have at our disposal to improve our emotional health and well-being. So we've already touched a little about why exercise is important. But for people in this audience, how can they start to safely exercise while also managing physical limitations? It's hard to provide kind of a blanket statement on that because everybody's going to be different. But I think it's safe to say that people are less fragile than they believe. And you know, it's, I meet many people, for example, who have back injuries and say, look, I have a back injury, I can't really do anything. And the reality of it is when you sort of probe a little bit further, what you realize is nothing tends to make their back hurt more than inactivity. You know, I don't remember who made the statement, but I loved it. And I've paraphrased it or plagiarized it many times. Sitting is to lower back pain, what bourbon is to alcoholism. So you know, and I think any of you who's back has hurt will probably think about that and go, you know, he's kind of right. My back hurts, sitting is the one thing I don't like to do or after a long drive it hurts worse. And, and, you know, for most people actually being active makes them feel better. Now, let's be clear. There are certain activities. Like if you have no cartilage left in your knee, more walking won't make you feel better. And so you've got, you know, you're going to have to see an orthopedic surgeon. They might need to do a knee replacement. But boy, I will tell you, in this day and age, in 2025, what can be done with a knee replacement, a hip replacement, even a shoulder replacement? I mean, these operations have come along so far and they have restored so much quality of life to individuals. So, every one of these cases has to be managed individually. But if you have a really good PT or rehab professional who knows what's fixable with more training or more conditioning versus, hey, this actually does need some medical attention. I think the aspiration should be what can I do to get as active as possible. Moving from exercise into nutrition, we saw questions come through that different diets are being talked about and they aren't sure which one they should follow. So, is there a diet that you think is best or does it depend on the individual? I don't think there's a diet that is best. I think there are principles that matter and everyone should find the diet that best allows them to adhere to the principles. So, what are the principles? The principles are not to eat too much and not to eat too little. That sounds dumb, but it's just the reality of it. And I think everyone struggles with a different end of that spectrum, right? There are some people who just don't like to eat that much. They're like little birds. And as they get older, that becomes a huge problem. They are too frail. But the other end of the spectrum, you have people like me who like to eat too much. And we will spend most of our life fighting against the urge to eat too much. And that also becomes a problem as you get older because the heavier you are, the more weight you're putting on each and every one of those joints. And again, we're thinking about all these things that are working against us as we age, not to mention other complications that come from eating too much. But I would say that in an aging population, the most important thing I want to emphasize is getting enough protein. First of all, I just think for many people, it's kind of hard to get enough protein in. Even I have to pay attention to it and I don't have a problem eating. But I need to be mindful of, hey, that I get enough protein. It's really easy for me to get all the carbs in the world. I don't have to go out of my way to eat more fat. But I do have to be cognizant of getting enough protein. And enough protein is a pretty big number. It's about one gram per pound of body weight. So I would challenge each of you to pay attention to, hey, if you weigh 150 pounds, are you getting 150 grams of protein a day? And I would bet that especially for the women here, that's even harder. Now, if you follow a little bit short of that, it's okay. But if you're at half of that, you're really not getting the optimal amount of protein. And as we age, we develop something called anabolic resistance, which means that it is harder and harder for our muscles to synthesize and grow new muscle cells with the given amount of amino acids, which are the building blocks in protein that we get by eating protein. And therefore, we actually need more and more protein to overcome that. So we talk a lot about obesity. We talk a lot about osteoporosis in osteopemia. But there's another condition of aging called sarcopenia, which is the condition of muscle loss. And that's a huge problem. And there's really two ways to, in concert, two ways to address that. One is consuming enough protein, and the other is doing enough resistance training. So again, doesn't matter if you're a vegetarian, doesn't matter if you like a Mediterranean diet, doesn't matter if you like steak and potatoes. If you can adhere to those principles, that's going to make your life easier. Is it harder to adhere to those principles if you're a vegan? Yeah, it's a lot harder. But it's not impossible. I know lots of people who have done it. But looking at a food tracking app in your phone is a great way to spend a week evaluating how many grams of protein you're getting. I think you'll be surprised that for many of us, it's we're probably underdoing it. Now I'm moving on to sleep. Sleep is something that you've written a lot about. You said that you didn't use to take it very seriously. But now you do take it very seriously. That's true. He goes to bed at eight every night. So why do you think it's so important? I've hammed up till nine these days. Yes, sleep is important. In your right, I used to probably until 12 years ago. I think my mantra was I'll sleep when I'm dead. And I, you know, just would try to sleep as little as possible. But the evidence are pretty overwhelming, especially for both near-term and long-term function of the brain that sleep is very important. Now I think at your age, a couple of unique challenges emerge. Again, I think most people, once they're over 65 or 70, they're not fighting the will to sleep because they want to be out partying all night. It's more that other things are getting in the way. So we know that as a person ages, they tend to sleep a little bit lighter and their sleep architecture tends to change a little bit. We also know that other things get in the way, especially for men, which is it gets harder and harder to make it through a night without having to get up to pee. And I mean, you know, I'm already at that stage where at least two out of the seven nights a week, if I am not mindful about when I had my last glass of water, I'm going to be up at two or three in the morning to pee. And sometimes that's harder to go back to bed after. So what are the things that we have under our control? Well, one of them is absolutely timing of water. Now again, water is super important. The older a person gets, the more susceptible they are to dehydration. The older a person gets, the less reliable thirst is as an indicator for fluid status. So at a livias age, you don't really believe they're not need to pay attention to how much you're drinking. First will be the guide. But that becomes less and less true as you age. So you're juggling a narrow problem, which is on the one hand, you have to be mindful about drinking enough. But at the other hand, you can't drink too much too close to bed, and that's going to keep you awake. Another thing that makes a huge difference in sleep quality is timing of food. So the longer you can have between when you have dinner and when you go to bed, the better. So we eat dinner really early because we have young kids in our house. And that's why I can get away with going to bed at nine because it's still been three and a half hours or three hours since I ate. Another thing is alcohol. So some of you probably drink alcohol and the less alcohol you have in your system when you sleep, the better you're going to sleep. Having a super dark room, having a super cold room is going to make a big difference. And perhaps the biggest thing to sort of make a point about here is consistency of timing, especially on the wake up. So if you could tether yourself to one time, it's what time do I wake up? And if you force yourself to wake up at the same time every day and don't allow yourself to take a nap during the day, and this is a big ask because I know naps can be tempting, it's going to regulate when you end up going to bed by building up enough sleep pressure. So if a person tells me I'm struggling to sleep at night and I find out they're napping during the day, the first thing I want to do is get rid of the nap. I want them to, and then I want to fix the wake up time, eliminate the nap, and then actually let them get into a better sleep cycle that way. Are there any good sleep supplements that you recommend taking and that are not damaging to you? Yeah, there are. I mean, and I think one has to be very careful with this stuff. You know, there's certainly evidence to suggest that as we age, melatonin levels go down, and therefore melatonin can aid, at least with sleep initiation, but it's important to know that melatonin really is only the signal to initiate sleep. It's not going to necessarily keep you asleep all night. So if you're not doing all of the other things correctly, melatonin is going to be limited in its efficacy. So before I go down the route of supplements, I want to get everything we just talked about. It's not going to be the high gene completely dialed in. And then, yeah, if there's still an issue falling asleep, I think melatonin can be viable tool. Although I really want to make sure it's the lowest dose you can buy. They tend to sell this stuff in high enough doses to kill horses. It's not necessary. You know, the lowest dose, which is maybe 300 micrograms is probably all you need at most twice that dose, but you don't need anything north of a milligram. I think one has to experiment a little bit with other things. I find Ashwaganda a little bit helpful for others, maybe not so much. Okay, and then we'll quickly touch on the last one, which is emotional health. And a lot of people think that this is not really something that kind of matters in longevity, but you talked about this in the last chapter of Outlive and how it's really important to you and that you've recently discovered it. So do you want to talk a little bit about that and how it's important as people are aging? Well, I think it's actually important at any age. And I think that, you know, what I imagine is so appealing about living at a place like this is you have a built-in system of friendship. And I would imagine that that's probably a great source of well-being that many of your peers would be missing out on if they were living alone. You know, I think about how little I see my parents because we live in a different country. And so I can imagine that things that we take for granted when we're young, like being close to our children or our grandchildren, aren't guaranteed when we grow older. Now, of course, she's signed a contract that says she can't leave Austin. So this won't be a problem for me, but, you know, I think social support network. And some sense of purpose might be the single most important part of the emotional health tool kit as it pertains to living longer. Every one of us knows the story of the couple that have been married for 70 years. One of them passes away and then the other one has, you know, dies within a year. I don't think these are, I don't think these are just anecdotal. I really think there's an understanding of why that happens. So you can do everything right. You can eat the right diet. You can sleep right. You can exercise, but if your emotional health is lacking, then it's like you won't live as long. It's possible, but I would say even more than that, regardless of how long you live. It's, if it's unhappy, why bother? You know what I mean? Like I, so let's say you do live a long time, but you're alone or you're miserable. And in some ways, that would be the ultimate purgatory. Okay. So is there anything else you want to add before we hop into the Q&A? No, let's turn it over to you guys. Yes. So why did you decide to start like focusing in longevity? Yeah, that's a great question. I guess there are sort of two things, right? The first was when Olivia was born, she's my oldest. And I bet all of you can appreciate this. Those of you that have kids, which I'm guessing is most of you, something about your mortality kind of kicks in. There are many stages to mortality, but I think having a kid is one. I think losing a parent is one. I think losing a friend. Like we, you know, as we gain and lose things throughout life, we become aware of its finitude. And her birth was a moment where I was like, this is amazing. I, but you know, I'm not going to be around forever to be a part of her life. So that kind of got me thinking about it. And that coincided with me also coming to coming to the realization that there are lots of things in my family history that might otherwise suggest a short life for me. And I wanted to get very serious about it. So my own journey into this space was actually very selfish and was strictly geared towards me figuring out things for myself. Awesome. Okay. I'm going to repeat that question. So there were two questions there. The first was an update on Clotho. And I'll explain what that is for everybody else. And then the second was on the gram of protein per pound of body weight. Is it ideal body weight if a person is overweight? I'll start with the second question. The short answer is it depends on how overweight. So if a person came to me and said, look, I weigh 260 pounds. I probably should weigh 200 pounds. I would tell them, you know, if I agreed with that assessment, I'd say being closer to the 200 is probably fine. You don't need to be at the 260. Okay. This gentleman was asking about a podcast I did. So, I don't know how many months ago it was six, nine months ago. I had an amazing scientist on my podcast. Her name was Dina Duball. She's a neurologist at University California San Francisco. And she studies a protein called Clotho. This is a protein that is made by the body. It is made in response to exercise. But it also is just made, you know, endogenously and declines with age for reasons we don't understand. So children make six times more of this than adults. But of course, any one of us can transiently increase it by exercising. What's special about this protein is it seems to be one of the most important proteins that protects the brain. And so in both mice and monkeys, when you inject this protein, if these are animals that have signs of dementia or cognitive decline, it reverses. If these are normal animals, they seem to get superpowers, like super cognitive powers. That protein is going to be tested over the next three years in humans. And if the results of that look promising, then a larger clinical trial will take place. So I would say the best case scenario here would be that in, you know, seven to 10 years, this could be an actual drug that humans take either to prevent cognitive decline or to treat it. So what is the best type of protein supplement you recommend to get to your grams these so I always ask people if possible and it's not always possible. Whatever you can get from food is great. But I understand that for many people, and again, especially for women, it's really hard to just mash through that much protein. So we turn to supplements. Now, when it comes to foods, the three that stand out the most are dairy products, beef, and eggs. And there's a, because there's a quantitative way that you measure both the type of amino acid and what's called bioavailability of the amino acid. So how complete are the sources of amino acids and how readily can the bodily access them? Can the body access them? So again, if you're thinking about eating, beef, eggs, and dairy are the big ones. Again, you can get lots of amino acids and also other proteins. I'm not saying don't eat chicken or fish or vegetable proteins, but those are big ones. Therefore, when you're supplementing, way protein, which comes from dairy, tends to be the winner. Now, KCN is also great because it's also from dairy. So way or KCN probably stand out a little bit above, but so does egg protein supplement. So what I tell people to do is figure out what works best for you, because there's some people that just can't do dairy proteins. Remember, if you just because you can't tolerate dairy, doesn't mean you can't tolerate a dairy protein. Most people who can't tolerate dairy can't tolerate the carbohydrate in the dairy, but they're totally fine with the protein. So give it a try. So you're saying, a few years ago, he did a genetic test and it did not show a genetic, okay. So let's assume that the test was correct. What it was screening for was very likely a gene called the apoe for gene. And this is a gene, the apoe gene that exists in three types. There's the number two, the number three and the number four. Now, every one of us has two copies of every gene, because you got one from your mom and one from your dad. So if there's three types of a gene and there are two copies, there's six combinations. You can go through them all. You could be a two, two. You could be a two, three. You could be a two, four. You could be a three, three, a three, four, or a four, four. Okay. Why is that relevant? One of those types is higher risk than the other two and that's the four. So people who have two copies of the four are at significantly higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, about 10 times higher risk. Now, doesn't mean that they're guaranteed to get it, but their risk is significantly higher. People who have one copy typically a three and a four are at about a two times risk. And so what that study told you was you, what I'm assuming it said was you did not have a copy of the four gene. So you might be a three, three, which by the way, most of you probably are 60% of the population is at three, three. That's the good news. The bad news is it doesn't mean you're free of risk. Because the only people who can't get Alzheimer's disease are people who don't have brains. I mean, a big limb. Everybody with a brain is at risk and unfortunately, women are at almost twice the risk of men. Now, we don't have a great understanding of why there are lots of theories. I won't expand on them now for the sake of time, but this is one of the areas where women are disproportionately affected to men. The other one, by the way, being osteoporosis and falls. So we've touched on both of the areas where women are at higher risk, of course, men have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. So yeah, the takeaway for me is I'm at three, three as well, but I don't rest on it. I act as though I'm high risk, meaning I take all the steps possible, exercising, being the single most important thing we can do to preserve brain health, managing nutrition, sleep, all of the things that I can do. Sure. Okay. So the first question was talking about how your mom had a fall. She broke her hip, had a long protracted recovery, managed to survive, but was never the same again and basically slipped into a state of cognitive decline. And your question was, is there a relationship there? Very good question. My intuition is that there is a relationship there. In other words, we don't know the parallel universe experiment where we could see how she would have been, had she never had that fall. So what we're trying to understand is is there any causality between the fall and her cognitive decline? And my intuition is that there is. And it's exactly what you said. It's that with the period of profound inactivity and probably with it, not just the physical inactivity, but also I would suspect some cognitive inactivity. If nothing else, it may have sped up by a period of years, something that may have ultimately happened. But I think probably was happening sooner than it should have. But again, I don't, it would be a very difficult thing to prove that, but that's what my intuition says. And I think that's just yet another reason to kind of think about all these things we've talked about as far as like what are the steps we can take to minimize our risk of a fall. Awesome. Well, I think that's all you have time for, but do you have anything else to add? No, but I, I like that I was on the hot seat from you today. So it's pretty fun. Yeah. Well, thank you guys all so much for coming.

Again, hearing you say this, Andre, the listeners are going to be thinking, what? Yes, because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible. I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is. Essentially, the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is non-ionizing cannot damage tissue. Falsies about your cell phone giving a brain cancer, and all are just that, their their first off, which patients are typically being radiated. It comes on the two things. You want, you want to be cured, curate is key, but quality of life is equally important if not more important for most people. And so now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allow to get such a high dose into the prostate, we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery. Let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue. You usually see depending on the joint summer between a 60 and 80 percent success rate where the pain isn't if not zero, at least markedly decreased. I don't think patients will have any patients for turf wars. Yes. Right, true. And so if I'm a patient, every doctor needs to be a fiduciary. They need to put my interest, have their interest. It's highly underutilized at this point, and your pain is of shown as the way it clearly works and America just has to catch up. Yeah, this is definitely an area where we are way far behind. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Sanjay, welcome back to Austin. Thank you, Peter. Pleasure to be here. I think this is the first time we're together, not driving, right? I think so. Yeah. That is true. So I don't know. Somehow we're going to resist the urge for most of this discussion to not talk about cars. If you don't want to bore your audience. I know. It is called the drive. This is true. So I feel like we have, we will reserve the right to have some automotive discussions at the end. For listeners, Sanjay might be one of the most knowledgeable human beings on cars. He's also a very dangerous friend to have. Because he's always the bad one on the shoulder when you're contemplating a new set of wheels or a new something for your cars. But in his other life, in addition to being the founder of MD Motorheads, right? That's right. Yeah, which is a Facebook group of doctors who are gear heads. We're going to crack 3,000 members. It's exploded. Yeah. That's awesome. So shout out to MD Motorheads. You're also a radiation oncologist, which we also spend some time talking about, right? And I guess we thought it would be a really fun idea to do a podcast for a couple of reasons. One is just the bread and butter of what you do as a radiation oncologist is a bit of a black box to many people. Myself included, if I'm going to be completely truthful. Even training and surgical oncology, I feel like I had much more familiarity with the medical side of oncology than I did with the radiation side of oncology. So for myself, for the audience, I think it'll be wonderful to understand more as it's a field that has evolved a lot, right? I'm guessing last 25 years, yes. You know, a lot of change. It's one of the youngest fields, too. So I think in that respect, it's not steeped in some of the traditions that surgery and medicine are. So yet, it's a new field, highly evolving very rapidly and the technology has changed so much just in really in the last decade or two. It's pretty incredible. And just about a curiosity, when did it become its own discipline, its own set of boards and everything like that? Yeah, so you know, as a kid and growing up in Houston, some of my family friends were radiologists. And I remember it just like it probably an elementary school kid that some of them were talking about radio therapy. And they were these were diagnostic radiologists who at the time were, you know, CT scanning was pretty new in the 80s. And so it was around that time that prior to that in the 70s and then prior to that, it was kind of just a fellowship where people basically would radiologists would have a cobalt 60 machine that they would train on for a few weeks and you'd do a few easy calculations and do some crude treatments. But it really started, it came into its own starting in the 70s and really more into the 80s. And that's when it became its own discipline. The ACR had a separate carve out. And so our residency training is completely independent of diagnostics now. So we just do it's an intern year followed by four years of radiation oncology with a little bit of overlap, but not a lot of diagnostic training at all, just because there's so much to do and, you know, just on the therapeutic side. God, see, I had no idea that it was that new then in terms of medicine. That's obviously like, right. That's very new. The second thing that I want to talk about on the radiation front is this idea of using very low dose radiation to heal injuries. Right. And I actually, I think that while people will be incredibly interested to understand the ins and outs of radiation oncology, again, given the ubiquity of it in treating people, I think a lot of people are going to be very interested in this idea that why aren't we using low dose radiation more to heal some of these nagging orthopedic injuries that people have. And of course, we'll go far down the rabbit hole on that. I don't think we can have this discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is. And I would like us to do it in a way that's both rigorous enough that we can really get into some of the science of this, but also get into it gently enough. Right. People that maybe don't remember high school physics well enough, sure, I can come along for the ride and not get lost. But once we get into gray and milly seaverts and all that stuff, I want everyone to be fluent when we start talking about doses. Right. Right. Right. So, radiation itself, the term itself has kind of got a bit of a negative connotation, but basically it's part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So, you know, we have everything on the one in the range of increasing energy of a photons, which are just particles of light. On the one end you have radio waves and micro waves and the other end you've got infrared and I'm excuse me, you've got ultraviolet and then you get into x-rays and radio waves. And in the middle of all that is the visible spectrum. So when you see, I'm sure everyone's seeing the graphs where you've got the rainbow red green blue that we can see, the human eye can only perceive a tiny little narrow spectrum. And then on the low end, the radio waves are wave lengths. These are wave lengths and energies which are the very low end energies you have things like radio waves. And in that situation, both radio waves and micro waves are what they call non-ionizing. And you've talked about this on some of your previous podcast. And you had a really good one with Atari Walla from Pranubo. Wait, he went to really, it was really nice in depth discussion. But essentially the bottom line is that the low energy stuff that is non-ionizing cannot damage tissue. And that goes all the way up to visible light. Then when you start going to the higher energy x-rays, that's when you get both x-rays as well as ultraviolet light and then the high and then the higher particles stuff. But basically the higher you go in the energy and the energetics of the particles, the more likely the exposure to these packets of energy are going to cause damage to your DNA. And why is it that the shorter the wave length? Because that's what's changing as you go from radio waves to micro waves to visible waves to ultraviolet. Why is it that is the wave length gets shorter the energy gets bigger? Yeah, I'm not sure what the reason is that they are inversely proportional to each other. I don't know that I guess I'm probably not enough of a physicist to answer their question precisely. But having said that, that is the characteristic of this. And in doing so that's one of the big reasons why all the fallacies about your cell phone giving you brain cancer and all are just that their their fallacies because even having a cell phone on your on your ear for hours a day, it's it's non-ionizing radiation and standing too close to micro wave oven again non-ionizing radiation. So that cannot damage your cells the way that the other radio wave is too long. That's right. The micro wave is too long. It doesn't have the energy. You can stand on it all you want. It can heat but it can't damage. Correct. It can excite the molecules but it won't actually eject an electron which is what what causes an ion to form which is why it's called ionizing. And that's where we deal with on the I'm on the therapeutic end. So diagnostic radiologists deal with lower energy x-rays than we do the very high energy x is what we use in our linear accelerators to treat cancer. So that's the big difference there is kilo voltage versus mega voltage but all of these are ionizing. Okay. So let's talk about how these are measured. How do we quantify them? Because people on the podcast have heard me talk about this I suspect. We talk a lot about calcium scores and CT angiograms and PET CT and so the I think the the frequent listener will have been somewhat familiar with how we talk about how to dose those things. Right. So radiation dosage there's a couple of different terms that we've talked about. The main one we talk about when we're talking about patient treatment is the unit called the gray and that's an SI unit that essentially is jewels of energy per kilogram of tissue. So that's what they call it absorb to dose. So that's in tissue whereas when you're talking about exposure and the general like in the air and in general exposure it's in the air and that's we usually use the term seaverate for that. And actually both those terms for the most part are equivalent. It's just that the seaverate itself will take into account if you have different types of x-rays, different qualities of x-rays that have different degrees of potential to be ionizing that they have a quality factor you'll multiply it by. But for the most part we use the term gray when we're talking about for example when I treat a prostate patient they're going to get somewhere between 70 and 80 gray but it's fractionated into small daily doses as to be tolerable for the body. And then when we talk about like millisevers like we're going to that's really just measure of exposure not absorbed dose in tissue per say. And what's the relationship between a gray and a milliseaverate is at a one to one. Yes, a gray and a seavered technically. A lot of it's also the gray also if anyone's kind of old school you read you listen to older stuff you hear the term rads a lot of people have heard a rads. So one rad is equal to one centigrey. 100 rads is a gray it's just an SI unit versus the old the older terminology and a seaver is the equivalent only it's in air not in tissue. But a seaver is a gray. Correct. Correct. So when you give 70 gray you're giving 70 severs or 70,000 millisevers over the course of the treatment. That's correct. And just so people can kind of anchor this to things that are familiar living at sea level exposes us to one to two millisevers of ionizing radiation a year. That's exactly what I'm on it. And then of course at the altitude it could be double that. That's really. If you live in Denver it's easily double that or triple that. Correct. Just another thing for comparison a pilot who spends a lot of time traversing the north pole right which is typically how they're going to fly they're not going to go all the way around the center of the earth. Might get another three or four millisevers quite a bit. That's right per trip actually. So that's that can add up. And I was actually talking to a pilot friend about this and they don't really have any sort of a limitation in terms of total exposure that requires them to be out of the to be taken out of the air. A lot of them they're forced to retire at 65 I think is there's the commercial requirement but there's really they don't really monitor the actual exposure to that level to where they it's then I think the reason they don't really use that as a limiting factor for the amount of work is really just that even though they get a higher dose there's been no proven increase in cancer and those types of populations even in you know flight attendants or anything like that the same way that the people in Denver the people here in Texas don't have any higher incidence of cancer. Now the NRC recommends that a person not be exposed to more than 50 I believe 50 millisevers of radiation in a year. Now someone like me that that's easy right unless I'm out there getting a lot of diagnostic radiology or of course undergoing therapeutic radiation treatment but for someone like you who has to set patients up or one of your texts is that a are you guys approaching that level of exposure not at all and so it depends on what type of radiation we do now typically for our external beam machines we're doing it all remotely from behind a shielded wall so the vault in which the machine is placed is custom built just a shield based on the angles that the machine can move through if there's like a direct angle where the machine is hitting a wall that wall has to be built ten times thicker than the walls where the beam can't reach so essentially our dose went treating remotely as close to zero so we keep film badges and we've been it's almost become kind of a joke that when we're not doing breaky therapy which is dealing with actual live radioactive sources our exposure is super low almost negligible really but back when I was in residency doing a lot of GYN implants and things like that where you're you're putting CZM or a radium actually into the body cavities and you're actually up there putting it in up close we had a ring badge on and we would certainly we as a resonance we'd rotate every month but if we didn't it didn't rotate some of the faculty actually got pretty high doses and any idea what the sequelaia that was I know a couple of folks the ones who did a lot of GYN therapy especially in the older days were talking about in the 80s and the 70s where you could actually see dermatitis on their hands from doing that just from the hand exposure one of my faculty members actually had a giant cell tumor of the bone in her finger and again this is after decades and decades of doing it it was you know it was a benign growth but that that was a real thing there's a lot of data out there on especially people who were dealing in x-ray for dentistry and stuff like that back in the day when they didn't have shielding or anything like that that they would get dermatitis the most common thing you'd see is skin irritation in that sort of situation dermatitis and even some kind of chronic flaking and things like that so let's talk about some types of x-rays that people are familiar with and give a sense of radiation dose and I'm also curious as to how much this depends on the size of the individual in other words does a person that is larger receive more radiation for the same test layer at chest x-ray sure and then they certainly do because you have to use more energy to get into a larger person having said that there's two different things because in what we normally deal with when I'm talking about dose to a tumor is the dose actually at that spot versus a whole body dose which is a very different metric and so for someone who I'm treating with say eight weeks of radiation for prostate cancer their prostate may get 80 gray in 2 1.82 gray fractions per day but that's literally only to a small volume roughly the size of the prostate gland itself and when you even get just a few millimeters away from that that dose gets cut in half and then it's exponentially lower because the intensity of the radiation varies with the square of the distance so as you get even a couple of feet away that goes down significantly but typically a patient who is getting 80 gray is a 80 gray was a whole body dose that would obviously be lethal but the whole body dose is more like a few milligray in that sort of situation so we typically don't see like full body sequelor anything from doing even the heavy-duty diagnostic treatment now for the CT scan we almost consider that negligible in our area because again I'm dealing with mega voltage high dose cancer killing radiation and so when they get a CT scan which is going to be just a few millisever it's a milligray that's almost considered rounding air versus what they're getting to the to the tumor let's take something like a chest X ratio so chest X ray again I people should anchor to this idea for what it's worth and we can come back to this and our C says hey limit your annual radiation right 250 millisevers you've got 2% of that just being alive because you've happened to go outside and it be exposed to the sun right so the other you know 98% might come through flying diagnostic let's say you fly a lot that might get you up another 10% right so let's talk about a chest X ray you've got a cough you go to your doctor they do a chest X ray that's how many millisevers for a normal size person normal size person it's a fraction it's probably less than one millisever it actually so it's significantly it's it's something that where you know people who are concerned about things like diagnostic mammograms and all every year you're still talking about maybe one millisever or even a little bit less than that was some of the newer machines and so you're in a zone where it is you know there's a principle we talk about it's called alara a a a a a which is as low as reasonably achievable and that's been the sort of the mantra for our radiation safety people the nuclear regulatory commission and whatnot that you want to keep things as low as possible but having said that when you're talking about numbers of less than 50 millisevers that's kind of an arbitrary number so it's not like getting you know people who've got I should have maybe gotten a chest X ray when I had my cough last time but I just I just don't want to do it that I don't want the exposure but it's so minimal in terms of biological effect that we really don't even really worry about those even if it's getting one of a month or so and a big reason for that is a lot of these numbers especially the 50 millisever number is extrapolated from higher exposure rates and so it's so there's something called a linear no threshold model or ln t and that's been written about extensively and that's what we're all taught in radiobiology and residency one fourth of my radiation training and in residency was actually radiation biology in addition to clinical oncology and radiation physics but so the linear no threshold model is what states that even you know we we know based on all the the data from you know from a nuclear fallout from Chernobyl from three mile island of course from Hiroshima Nagasaki from the bombs that at a certain dose exposure there's a certain risk of developing a cancer or any other endpoint whether it be dermatitis or bone marrow suppression there's all that all these numbers are well sorted but when you try to extrapolate lower so you take maybe say a dose of say one full severt you know the thousand millisever and you start extrapolating that lower and lower to where you're looking at like a hundred or fifty millisever it's the linear model assumes that there's some level of damage even if those lower levels but in reality there's actually a threshold there is the ln t which is linear no threshold is actually been proven to be actually erroneous and so at very low doses it's actually been shown that there's almost no incidence of any sort of biological damage and there's also it's controversial but there's animals that each winter maybe a hornese is affected low low doses like that so let me tell people what that means because that's sure that's obviously going to come back later in our discussion so you know regular listeners of your podcast know all about hornies and you talk about it and in the exercise realm and a cool plunges and so on as and whatnot but the whole idea is doing some degree a small amount of cellular damage when the body repairs that it actually comes back stronger than it was without the exposure in the first place and in animal studies they've actually shown it very low doses we're talking about single digit milliseverage here that they've seen in mouse bones for example increased osteoclast activity or excuse me decreased osteoclast and increased osteoblastic activity so the bones actually heal quicker and some of the soft tissue as well has been has been shown to actually recuperate and in much in the way you see and the hornies is from other causes and that's not something that we're claiming is you know widely accepted but there is a lot of data showing that that is certainly a possibility which goes against this classic LNT model and the LNT model itself the guy that won the Nobel Prize for it in the 1940s did this all on fruit flies and his work was disproven over the years after that and so a lot of this low dose radiation safety stuff we have is certainly a noble goal to keep the dose as low as possible and when we get down into these milliseverage I think that they're probably a little bit overblown in terms of the actual negative effects on the human body. When I think about where for example something like a CT NGO gram used to be right so that that would easily have exposed a person to 25 millisevers to do a CT scan of the heart. You're doing it you know slowing the heart down getting the contrast in there et cetera. Today they're really fast scanners the best of the best scanners are somewhere between one and three millisevers for that same procedure. I certainly favor having patients get it you know getting a scan with that acknowledging though that I don't have amazing data to point two to say that the 25 millisever at one versus just to make the math easy the 2.5 millisever at one. Right. Tenfold difference poses any difference in risk. Exactly. What yeah how how do you think about that? Would you say what would be your confidence in saying that 2.5 is not actually better than 25 from a cancer risk standpoint. So again going back to that alarm principle there's not a whole lot of data at these levels. I certainly would strive to keep it as low as possible which is what that mantra says but I would go with the machine that has the best resolution and if 25 is if the radiologist tells me that that image is significantly better than a 2.5 millisevered exposure and some of the older machines are just less efficient you may get at better image with the with the lower dose. I think that dose is pretty negligible it really would be good. So the risk you're saying I don't really care if it's 25 or 2.5 is well and the good news is these brand new scanners are faster which is why they're giving you less radio exactly. They seem to have the same thing implies that's on the diagnostic side. On the therapeutic side where I am our machines are called linear accelerators and there's a similar progression as you know we as we've been able to focus the beams more and more precisely that actually caught it's a modulation of the beam and you have a lot of photons being showered in the general vicinity of a patient but you're blocking out everything except for a small area to treat and the same way the newer machines do definitely have a lower exposure to the you know Eastern the room in general. So what should people be thinking about in terms of extraneous radiation when should people be saying to their doctors hey do I really need this you know for example when you go to the dentist every year right typically want to do a set of x-rays is that anything people should be worried about not at all not in the least I would certainly not skimp on on dental x-rays mammograms if it's someone that needs cardiac workups and things like that the potential the risk benefit ratio is so heavily in favor of doing these studies that I don't even think twice about them and when and I think part of this comes from you I've been doing this 25 years now I have so many patients who've been through and when the by time they come to me as a cancer patient they've been through so many CT scans and nowadays we do pet scans we follow up with annual pet scans after the function of which are not only the CT but you've got a radioactive isotope that's being injected into them and we just really don't see now there are certain situations where you are giving a like for example an intravenous therapeutic dose of radiation say for thyroid cancer or things like that there's certain new uh their anostics that are out there in those situations you have to be concerned because they can get into the multiple you know again to a seaver range but when you're in these millisiever ranges it's such it's so important to do these studies the benefits of mammograms are so proven dental x-rays I don't really think twice about them okay um by the way just on the pet scan the rate what is so if you do a pet CT for example which again these are not routinely done these are typically done in oncology patients only um but just for my own understanding of returking 50 to 100 millisiever it's if you're doing a whole body pet CT I think you can be in that range yes okay that's exactly right and uh so pet CT's a relatively new but uh up until maybe a decade ago the pet scan was independent of the CT they would do them separately but the data is so much better when you have the anatomical CT data overlay with the pet that whatever that extra dosage is I think it's well worth it in terms of the resolution of what we're able to see and what we're able to gain from that information okay so now let's pivot from the diagnostic to the therapeutic um is it safe to say that the majority or the most prevalent or common type of radiation oncology treatment would be for breast cancer? A breast and prostate how the number one number two depending on what patient population talking about and prostate may even be a little bit higher and this goes back to the 80s when the trend from doing a whole steady in type of a radical mastectomy was falling out of favor and the randomized data was was obtained in the 80s showing that a lumpic to me breast conservation which is lumpic to me followed by radiation as the same uh outcomes in terms of overall survival as a full mastectomy that's when breast really took off in the 80s and around the same time is when prostate radiation started becoming a thing but at the time rat radical prostatectomy was obviously still king but now in the 2020s I think prostate is taken off and it's probably close to matching breast cancer now. Those are number one number two but we also do depending on where you are in the country and what you're affiliation with the hospital is tons of CNS, lung, lymphoma, GI not colon but more rectal and anal distal GI cancers even in the pediatric world we try to avoid radiating children but it's a very big part of that as well so we use it for almost almost all types of cancer now actually I'll solid timbers anyway. Well let's let's talk a little bit about breast cancer given how common it is and I'll tell you something funny despite training at Hopkins I never once did a radical mastectomy and it was already long gone right from clinical practice 25 years ago and again just for listeners to make sure they're in the difference between a radical mastectomy and a mastectomy or what's called a modified radical mastectomy the current version of a mastectomy removes all the breast tissue along with the lymphatic tissue in the exila and though certainly I did more than my fair share of those but the radical mastectomy the Hall steady and prestigier removed also the entire musculature of the pack, pack major, pack mine or the whole thing it basically was a disfiguring operation the dilating, disilluminating with nothing but ribs here and can imagine what it's like to not even have pack muscles you sort of take for granted right what you need to do to move your your humorous and yeah to think that it's only been 40 or 50 years that someone had the courage I think it was probably Fisher right Fisher's big study in the 80s which now we have 40 year data from that and it's interesting how now even the modified radicals are relatively rare we still have some advanced cases that they have to go that route but we see tons and tons of patients now who are so much happier their quality of life is much better by just having a simple lumpic to me, a central node biopsy and if it's all negative especially if they've had their mammograms you get a small t1 or t2 tumor we give radiation to the whole breast following that and the radiation is again fractionating to small daily bits they'll get somewhere in the neighborhood of these days it's actually only about three weeks of treatment maybe about say 40 gray and roughly 15 fractions we used to give even when I was in just just really a couple decades we were giving 50 to 60 gray was quite a bit higher dose but to 40 gray and 15 fractions to the full breast and with the modern technology we can cover the breast tissue without a significant harder lung those so we can even use 10 gencial beams even if it's a left-sided tumor to stay away from the heart which is things that we couldn't do very well in the past and then the overall and disease free survival is pretty much comparable to someone who had a modified radical yeah for folks who want to know more about that Sid Mukherjee and I think it was in the Emperor of all maladies has a chapter on the statistic book and one of your best podcasts love like he's he's a legend so let's talk about that okay so so a woman has a stage one or a stage two breast cancer typically these days I think they're moving mostly to Neo-Adjuven chemo before resection yes in a more advanced case but if it's a typical T1 or even a small T2 that we see they may not need any Neo-Adjuven therapy they just will have their lung if it's like I say one and a half centimeter mass that's that's easily respectable they'll remove that just without any Neo-Adjuven treatment okay and we'll do adjuvent radiation and then potentially depending on the receptor status adjuvent hormone therapy as which is the domain of the medical oncologists but we still work with them so just surgery followed by the three to week three to four weeks of all after surgery can you begin the radiation wound healing given a little bit of time we generally do our CT based simulation in three to mention planning maybe three to three weeks after their surgery and then by the time it takes about a week to do all of our computer programming and then we'll start the treatment within three to four weeks post-op so tell me a little bit about that I was completely unaware of that so I'm a woman I've had a lump back to me satin on note was negative so I've got an incision about this long the listener you know five centimeters six centimeter incision they've probably closed it with beautiful internal sutures I've got some stereo strips they're often a week and I've got a nice little scar a week later when I come and see you how many weeks after that I usually will see patients for consultation a lot of times the breast surgeon will send them prior to anything being done so I'll see them for their initial consultation ahead of time but then we plan on doing what's called a planning procedure or a simulation where we're going to put the patient on the table and essentially do a dry run for their treatment usually a couple of weeks after treatment and that involves essentially positioning the patients typically for a breast patient they'll be prone with their arm behind their head we call the the movie star pose to get the arm out of the way of the exiless essentially okay and so by putting them in this position and then putting them on a wingboard that'll slightly elevate their torso we can and there's a lot of different geometry here that we can use back in the old days they had all kinds of ways of doing plaster casts and things like that but we essentially do now is we will we'll use a we'll call a vaclocc essentially a bean bag with a vacuum port and they see the patient sinks into the bag we suck all the air out of in lock it becomes a rigid cast of their body and that way they fit into the groove that we've made for them will actually will kind of form it mold it around their elbow so they're comfortable many times with patients who've had an exiless section they may have a little bit of scarring a little decreased range of motion to be able to get their elbow back there so we'll work with them the best we can whatever position we get them in we do a CT in that position and that's the position we have to reproduce for the daily treatment and the key there is that when they have their arm out of the way we have to have room so that the machine can move around from different angles the actual radiation machine has a gantry that can move really 360 degrees can treat for many angle you want but we have to be able to model tangential beams we don't want direct anterior feel that's going to radiate the breast but the photons are going to go right into the chest by using an angle we can kind of cut across the surface and actually shape the beam to match the curvature of the chest wall so we cover the entire thickness of the breast tissue or even in many cases in the case of advanced more maybe a T4 patient something like that we may even do this post mastectomy so you're treating the full chest wall and we go a little deeper below into the ribs and to make the first inch of lung tissue below that but by using these tangential beams that really minimizes the treatment the the photons damaging the lung tissue so all of that is planned ahead of time we do a CT scan sorry just to be sure planned pre-resection because you're seeing the tumor itself actually no I what I meant was pre-treatment got it so post-resection you'll see a tumor bed the lumpectomy cavities obviously clearly visible is a fluid pocket on CT so I'll scan the I'll scan the whole chest it takes about a week I have a whole team have a wonderful staff a radiation dosimitrius that helps do the computer planning and then a radiation physicist that actually calibrates the machine prior to actually starting the patient so we do the scan of course the CT scan is two-dimensional slices but we have three-dimensional modeling software so I have a full 3D model of the patient I can look at the slices or how thin it varies usually we don't need this is not a diagnostic scanner I think so usually something like two millimeters three millimeters we don't have to go super high resolution and so that way once it's once it's reconstructed then I can have a nice idea of what angles to bring the beam in because beams in at because every person has a slightly different curvature to the chest wall you're going to have to customize the anatomy different breast sizes we have all kinds of different techniques so I won't go too much into the details but if someone is very large breast did we could even treat them prone to get the have a special pillow to allow the breast to hang down and it's also I'm guessing where the tumor was in the breast so if you have large breast and a superficial tumor yes definitely prone would be amazing because now you're the the tumor bed is so far from the patient right that's true but our technically what we call the clinical target volume the area that we're trying to radiate would actually include the entirety of the breast tissue even even all the way down to the chest wall so there's two different ways there's fault there's full breast radiation which is what most people get but what you're describing actually is partial breast we would just target the lumpectomy cavity and that can also be done we save that for usually for older women who have a very small tumor and when I say older women it's more because of the fact that the remainder of the breast remains untreated so a local recurrence is a little bit more likely in some of it has not had full breast radiation but in a selected subpopulation of small breast cancers in some of the very large breast you can do partial breast where you're only targeting the lumpectomy cavity but for most of our patients we actually do treat the whole breast as stand standard of care plus or minus the exil if that's where the pathology comes in because if they did have a positive lymph node then we have to go after the exil and sometimes a superclavicular and even in for a mammary in a intramarinoid in some cases okay yeah so this is infinitely more involved than I thought which means I'm not the only one that probably was ignorant of what is involved right how long does each session take when they're actually on treatment it's about 15 minutes sometimes even a little bit less than that some of the newer machines can deliver the beam even faster but when I say 15 minutes I'm talking about I have four patients an hour typically so in and out of the room in 15s that includes getting them on the table the key thing for accuracy and reproducibility is positioning so the reason we made that mold and we've not only did we get them in position but I've also got a couple of dots on their skin to use as reference marks to make sure that the patient is in the correct position that whole process probably takes five minutes every day when the patient gets in the room and then maybe another five to 10 minutes for the actual beam to be on and my favorite thing is to come in the room after the patient's first treatment and then the most common question I get is hey doc when do we start and I'm like no maim that was they're like really that was it because the patient feels nothing so the machine will go through its various angles it's pre-programmed the entire process is about 15 minutes a day and they can leave feeling the same as when they got there just like getting any x-ray they jump in their car and go right back to work or to to the gym or the golf course. When did this become so automated with the robotic arm and stuff I mean when was the did you do this in your residency or were you do the one's manually doing that in residency? So I was in residency in the late 90s early 2000s so it was a very interesting time as we were at the cusp like my first year of residency and I was at UTMB in Galveston and we did a lot of it was a combined rotation with MD Anderson so we were at it time this is 1998 we're talking about where we run at the end of the old era we didn't even use CT planning we just had a couple of orthogonal films and we were literally drawing our tumor volumes out with a grease pencil on a physical x-ray and cutting and using that cut out to go trace a styrofoam negative and make a metal or a lid alloy block which you would slide this basically this aperture in the past the path of the beam that's the way it was done for decades and so we were still doing that when I started residency but by the end of residency we had full on CT planning we're now we're doing a full CT scan doing everything virtually and of course it's far more precise and you can model basically you can model multiple different iterations okay do I want to be in coming in from this angle do I want to bring in an orthogonal beam from here do I want to block out a little bit more of the chest wall to get the heart dose down I can see all that stuff now so by the time I finished residency we were basically doing what we do now I'll be with much slower computers and you know just being in the infancy of that it was probably more like 20 to 30 minutes per patient but the last 15 years roughly to answer your question things have been much more automated and instead of having lead blocks that you're sliding into the path of the beam now everything is shaped in the head of the beam by our computer so you hit a button and when I've already programmed the the the treatment planning values the machine knows how to shape the beam to match the aperture of whatever you're trying to do so that's all fully automatic now so the therapist job we have a radiation therapy so it actually positions the patient in the room they get them in position they take a picture x-ray first either a cone beam CT which is a low-dose CT or just a PA in a lateral film and we actually overlay that with our planning imaging to make sure that the original reference from the planning day matches today's image and the beams the the machines will actually superimpose the daily image with the reference image so everything is automatic I can see okay we directly on if everything lines up correctly then we literally have two images that look identical I just see one image which would but slightly off if there's even a few millimeters this way or that way we account for that by moving the table the table is motorized so the patient will be laying there and they'll feel it moved just a few millimeters this way that way until we have perfect concordance between the daily setup and the original and that way that's really really improved our accuracy and the original miss the geographic miss which was a problem in the old days when we didn't have digital imaging and all this stuff is essentially gone now the actual radiation beam is generated by what the ion is generated by what right so that's another thing that has changed now essentially when I say now the last basically 30 years most machines in the US are linear accelerators so these are artificially generated x-rays it's essentially accelerating electrons through a long vacuum tube you know potential electron gun and at the very end of the tube you've got a tungsten target and so the photon the electrons hammer that target and then they shower photons out so you're generating the x-rays that way and this has been done actually I think you're all the modern Stanford had the very first one in the US the medical linear accelerator but prior to that they were using these for atom smasher and you know they have the the gigantic machines they're used for physics but they started in London I think in 53 and then I think in the late 50s Henry Kaplan it's Stanford had the first one but so we're essentially still doing that even today on what 70 years later but the key difference is how we're able to shape those photons once they come out of the machine now and so when the actual photons are coming out they're completely unfiltered it comes out in a cone shape and it diverges as just as any light source wood you know how when you you hold the flashlight to a wall you get a nice precise circle as you pull the flashlight away it diverges so we have filters and we have what's called the multi-leaf columnator that can actually shape the beam as I mentioned earlier that can actually match the anatomy of the patient but now that's all done automatically we program it ahead of time as opposed to the old days we had to use lead blocks that were actually physically blocking the beam but basically the linac has been the standard prior to that we were using a cobalt 60 machine which is essentially it's not even a machine it's basically just exposing a patient to a radio active isotope and then shutting the jaws again so that's how they actually those are still in use in most of the world there's a few left in the US but they've mostly been decommissioned now because the linac have taken over when you say that typical treatment might be 15 gray over the course of the three weeks fractionated over 15 treatments so it's actually about 14 grams or so roughly you know 2.5 2.6 gray per day and you write and times 15 treatments are you getting roughly 40 gray to the breast and then we usually actually do a boost so we'll give what we call a tumor bed boost we give a little extra dose to just the lump itself or their lumpectomy cavity itself and there's a couple of French trials that showed that adding an extra 10 gray over an extra five days or two gray times five just to the lumpectomy cavity itself improves local control over just whole breast. Okay I actually what I was going to ask you was asking I was going to ask if the 40 gray is distributed completely uniformly across the breast the answer is no it is but it is you have that extra boost which is a customization based on the patient's pathology I occasionally have a patient that the breast surgeon will call me and say hey you know sunjay we did our best but we had a persistent positive margin I went back to the re-resection and there's still a positive margin maybe the positive margin is at the chest wall where there's only if they can only go so far in that case I instead of giving a 10 gray boost I might give a 16 gray boost or something to account for instead of just treating microscopic disease potentially macroscopic residual in that sort of situation so every patient's a little different and then the axillary nodes themselves are normally not treated in an early stage patient but depending on the risk factors if it's a very large tumor or if there was a positive central note maybe an incomplete axillary dissection then in many cases we end up treating the full axilla and in in some cases when it's advanced disease we end treating level two and level three so you end up getting the super clav as well if we go back in time to 25 years ago 30 years ago versus today what are the typical side effects that a woman experiences from this trick treatment and by the way was she typically getting 40 gray 25 years ago or was that a little more I think you said and now they've come down a bit it was sort of 50 60 gray back and so a little that this brings up a point I need to kind of emphasize it's not so much the total dose it's the dose per fraction so how quickly are you getting it so the standard of care was actually 50 gray rather than today's 40 ish gray but it was used to be given in two gray per fraction daily dose is rather than the 2.6 2.7 that we're using now so the effective dose when you take into account there's a whole radiobiology lecture that we're not going to bore people with but taking into account the dose per fraction and the total dose the biologically equivalent dose with the BED is roughly the same now at 39.9 gray given in in 15 treatments versus the old 50.4 gray that was given in say 25 to 28 treatments so it was a longer process your career right and we still do that in some cases and this comes back to another question you asked about about the homogeneity of the dose and so our goal of course is to have 100% coverage of the whole breast but the reality is one of the way that photons are going to be interacting from different beam angles and whatnot you're always left with hotspots and cold spots and so the biggest difference between what we're doing now versus the old days wasn't so much the total dose it was the actual homogeneity that you touched on so the heterogeneous heterogeneous old way of doing things with a cobalt machine or with a low energy x-ray unfortunately meant that there were hotspots and cold spots in the breast and that of course could either be manifested as scar tissue if it's a hotspot or heaven forbid a geographic recurrence if there was an area that was underdosed so with the modern computer planning we were much more homogenous so even though you may say I got 50 gray back in 1995 and now I'm getting 40 gray you're now getting 40 gray and two and a half gray fractions which is equivalent to the old 50 plus we don't have a 150% hotspot and a 60% cold spot we have a nice 100% match all the way across and that's all it's like a CAD cam type of thing I'm about as close to an engineer as an MD can be and so we do actually simulate the dose of the dose distribution of the radiation in the tissue and so with a nice tip of modern days we get a nice homogenous dose and therefore that goes to your next question which was what is the patient experience maybe not so much 20 years ago but more like 30 40 years ago with the older cobalt machines they would get a terrible dermatitis like many times it was moist descohamation confluently over the whole course of the whole chest wall axillary descohamation is always bad because of the friction of the arm but with the modern treatment now with the first first one not using cobalt using linear accelerators the energy of the photons is higher which means the skin dose is slightly lower so you're getting maybe 100% on the skin rather than 150% like you once did so we don't see anywhere near the skin reaction that we used to it's more of a you know maybe a grade one or a grade two air theme so mild redness or maybe sometimes a little bit of you know like it's a sunburn but nothing is severe as we used to so these days patients do still get a sunburn we give them a little some free samples of aquifer or they can use an aloe vera plant if they have it just you know your normal type of skin care stuff as opposed to the old days when we were actually treating essentially burn victims with silver self-adysine and heavy duty narcotics and things like that the modern air it is so much better than a lot of the patients especially if it's someone that doesn't have a very large breast there's less energy being put into a smaller size person they don't get anywhere near the skin reaction and that's why if you did have a very large patient we actually still use the old 50 gray in 25 because you're giving less dose per day and you do have a very large breast where you're going to have areas that are going to have hot and cold spots sometimes that's still needed so we have to tailor it to the individuals as I guess my bottom line there. Did anybody ever look at the when you had the very disparate hot and cold spots and follow women for recurrence and yes was there any association between the cold spots and recurrence so there certainly is and so the problem was is that the cold in the old days you didn't have computer modeling so and actually the old school physicists got to give your hats off to those guys and had slide rules and probably abacuses or whatever the heck they had back then you couldn't really you couldn't really tell exactly where the hot and cold spots were my might actually having a computer show you you had to go based on the fact that you use what energy you choose a photon energy and you know what the dose distribution had various depths is and so you would try to minimize that by again having beams coming in from different angles and then by using multiple angles and multiple fields you could paint in the dose as best as you could but yes certainly there were issues where as you get deeper in the tissue the dose would be lower and then yeah this is again before my time but there certainly were were studies showing that there were geographic misses and there was that was obviously not good which would sometimes lead to like a salvage mastectomy or something like that but in the modern era not so much what is the impact of breast implants in this type of treatment either saline implants or the older actually they're not older now they're back in the back in the world yeah of course so it's going to either way what we can tell the photons that the x-rays we use they are not at all affected by that that's essentially tissue equivalent and I'm pardoned by ignorance I completely forget are those implants typically under the pack or between the pack and the breast so we see both you know it's interesting how there's I guess some what's the current standard I'm not sure but the car I think most of them we see are actually under the muscle that's I don't know I've actually seen so we can easily suddenly pack but I've seen them both even I've even even now the plastic surgeons have different criteria for that but regardless of what it is our whole if it's under the pack then of course it's really a little farther away it's not a huge issue but we still the radiation will still affect that area but typically these these implants are pretty pretty tolerant of that the only issue down the road is they may have a capsule or contracture or something from fibrosis the bigger challenge we run into is for our post mastectomy patients who are going to be reconstructed and they have expanders put in and that's where the relationship between the radiation oncologist the surgeon and the plastic surgeon is key you explain to folks what expanders are that works surgically so essentially what's happening is when you have a full mastectomy if a patient wants to have their breast reconstructed later on the the surgeon the breast surgeon will remove the breast but then the plastic surgeon will come in and place some sort of a placeholder to allow the the soft tissue of the connective tissue and the and the skin to stretch to allow for future implant placement and so those tissue expander typically they can actually inject saline into them with a port and gradually stretch them with time and so that's normally what they would do if there was no radiation involved but if it's a patient and again most mastectomy patients really don't need radiation because this gets away from what we mentioned earlier were breast conservation is lump back to me only but there are some patients with a full mastectomy who are going to get reconstructed so they come to me when I do their CT scan they have this expander in place from the breast surgeon so we have to again modulate the beams and we treat the entire chest while we make sure we're covering everything but simultaneously we have to make sure that we don't have those hot spots in the area of the expander where potential you could cause scarring and fibrosis and cause the the expander to have to be removed have the plastic surgeon have to revise it that becomes a whole other it will be in there that we don't like to mess with but we have techniques not to be able to keep the dose off of them and again as you mentioned earlier whether it's silicone or or saline it's roughly the same density but some of these tissue expanders have bits of metal in them they may have other artifacts and so when I'm treating with photons with x-rays depending on what you're hitting the effect is based on the density the atomic number of that tissue so metal behaves very differently from bone behaves differently from air but when you're in the spectrum of saline tissue water it's all basically the same we can model all that very much like I'm getting ahead of myself but very much like when we have a prostate patient with a prosthetic hip a piece of metal right next door we're able to compensate for that with the modern computer treatment planning systems do women experience any systemic symptoms from radiation like nausea vomiting or is that the only time we see radiation patients who have nausea vomiting it's typically a lot of times for other sites they may get concurrent chemo radiation with a chemo could be responsible but for for breasts we don't do concurrent usually sequential the only time I really see radiation induced nausea if I'm treating an esophagus or a pancreas or something that's in the it's treating in the abdomen or somewhere along the GI tract where nausea is more of an issue typically not for breast okay let's talk about prostate which is obviously also the sort of the bread and butter of the field so first off which patients are typically being radiated and so that the answer to that has been evolving there was a time as recently as probably 20 years ago where we only treated patients who were probably medically and operable that the herologist would say hey you know this is a high risk anesthesia patient let's send them to Dr. Mata for radiation and that's a big reason why a lot of the older data was not as good for radiation because of the patient selection criteria but in the modern era as we've gotten more and more precise and our side effects have gone down and our cure rates have gone up now it's pretty much wide open we're pretty much anybody who's eligible for surgery would also be eligible for radiation so there's not that big of a divergence as their once was so I know see you've gotten to know Ted Shafer who's not only going to get a cast but is equally let's just say interested in cars so you me and Ted have a lovely little text thread about cars he and I may have another text so in case our team's meet in the playoffs as well he's a big Ravens fan so I'm from Houston so yeah I'm hoping we get there so let's talk about kind of a patient that comes in to see Ted for a biopsy they've got a Gleason 3 plus 4 and then another patient who's a Gleason 4 plus 4 or 4 plus 5 or something like that right how does that patient navigate their way through the system as to whether or not they need radiation or should then they go surgery and does androgen deprivation therapy necessarily come with radiation or is there a scenario where you undergo radiation but you don't require endrogen deprivation sure so to answer your last question first androgen deprivation for high risk disease is certainly standard of care Gleason 8 or higher for sure the Gleason 7s are always a sort of a gray zone and so a 4 plus 3 with high volume disease typically also do get concurrent and adjuvant androgen suppression along with radiation but one of the things that's really changing now is I know Ted talked a lot about it's with a decipher score where they can look at the chromosomes of the actual cancer cells and have a much more granular view of exactly are they truly high risk or can you die can you maybe say that this one 3 plus 4 is more like a 3 plus 3 so we can set for a lot of the 3 plus 4 is now with the decipher test and there's also an AI test I knew you had a really interesting discussion with your AI expert and that wasn't too long ago called Artera and we're using that that's actually in the NCCN guidelines now so that Artera test can help us differentiate between a unfavorable and a favorable intermediate risk patient and essentially actually I treated my own father not too long ago he was the first person I did this on the Artera test is essentially they just use the actual images of the H&E slides that were already done for the pathologist and it's interpreted by a machine machine learning computer that has been trained on hundreds of thousands of prostate images from the old RTOG studies the 94's all the all the stuff that was done back in the 90's and it cannot come back and say okay very much like decipher it can say that this is a 3 plus 4 but it's a favorable or an unfavorable person and that's in that subgroup and so because of that we can stratify better and actually tailor it to where maybe a 3 plus 4 doesn't need energy and ablation at all and maybe even some 4 plus 3 so they come back low enough on the scale where you could maybe you also have to talk about the side effects and whatnot but the standard of care was always to give concurrent energy and ablation for intermediate risk but now we're able to really take some of those people out of the equation with these new studies and is the main selling point because most patients just want things taken out right I have cancer taken out so is the reason that a person might select radiation therapy especially if it comes with the endogen deprivation therapy because of the sexual function and you're in every like what's the main advantage those are number one and number two yeah lack of incontinence and lack of impotence but of course when you have an origin ablation that sort of clouds things a little bit but typically the number one thing we see is patients who don't want to deal with diapers and for the most part although incontinence is still described to some degree in the literature and my personal experience I don't think I've seen a single patient who came in continent who left with anything less than that there's no pads there's no nothing and then of course also being you know with our as I talked about with breast cancer we can also focus very precisely on the prostate itself so the dose to the pinile bulb the dose to the rectum the dose to the the the bladder are so low now that the side effect profile is essentially zero from a radiation standpoint and they may be having hot flashes from the antigen deprivation and decreased libido and fatigue as you know but on the radiation side because we have all these tricks now very much like with breast a way we can avoid the heart and the lungs in the case of the prostate we can almost completely avoid the bladder and the rectum and even the the pinile bulb now so the quality of life those are the reasons why people tend to choose radiation and I know we've talked about this before you're just not seeing the proctatitis yes almost none in fact now I know I think a Ted and mentioned in his last talk there's a there's a jail spaceer that that is often inserted it's an injection that's done transparently and it separates the the rectum from the from the bladder but in my years of doing this when you're very diligent about how you do this very much like a you know like a surgeon pays attention to the detail so do we I can actually trim the dose off of the posterior prostate and just makes make sure the dose fall off between the posterior prostate and the anterior recto wall is so rapid that the anterior recto wall is always going to get some dose but usually it's not clinically significant and and what we do to to manifest to make sure that that is is a daily thing because we're talking about treating patients from multiple weeks we actually coach the patient to come in with a full bladder and an empty bowel and by being diligent about that an imaging daily to double check that in fact the bowel is emptying the bladder is full that it that allows those two organs to separate from the prostate and even a few millimeters of separation is all we need to take advantage of our modern focused radiation beams and does the patient need to be coached to time their breath or anything as the beam is at that most delicate edge of the rectum great question so not not so much for pelvic patients but we do that for breast cancer especially left-sided breasts so just to go back to that you actually have a deep breath hold which will get the chest wall away from the heart so we do that in the case of thoracic tumors but in the pelvis that the diaphragmatic position doesn't really make any difference it's more about bladder and rectal filling and emptying respectively that's much more important everybody have talked to who's at lacych isurgery always says they're so worried that they're going to do something in a flinch and and and and the patients feel the same way when they're undergoing radiation like what if I just flinch my pelvis or you do something right now that's going to get too close and get that question all the time and from a lacych standpoint I would be worried about that's probably why I'm still wearing these coat bottles unfortunately but in the case of prostate cancer first of all the dose is given over the course of several minutes and then each of those fractions is again for you were talking about one fraction out of multiple weeks so even if someone absolutely had a coughing fit or something like that first of all we're watching them we can stop the being you can stop it at any given moment but slight variations day to day the biggest variations are going to be based on bladder and rectal filling we take that into account when we're doing the treatment planning so there should really be no adverse outcome because what I actually do is I'll map out where the volume of the prostate is and we will actually purposely expand that volume and treat the full dose of radiation even a few millimeters outside of the prostate to make sure that there is any internal organ motion or anything like that that we take that into account but typically if someone's coughing or something that would just we can just hit the pause button and get them reset and ultimately it's not an issue. What about patients that are inoperable? First of all what leads to a patient being inoperable and how do they show up? So you know typically the urologists have already screened the patient because that everyone's first first exposure is going to be to what the urologist tells them and luckily in this day and age I'm lucky we have people much like Ted who are very open and who are very open to not just doing surgery but who actually look at the other options and present everything to the patient but typically a patient who maybe was medically anoperable will certainly come to me but even somebody who maybe is on the borderline who wants to watch the both sides of the token a general urologist will send them to a surgical specialist and to me and we'll go through all the pros and cons of everything and really what it comes down to to not to not to you know and belabor the point it comes out of two things you want you want to be cured curate is key but quality of life is equally important if not more important for most people and so now that cure rates with our modern focused radiation allowed to get such a high dose into the prostate we can say that they're essentially equivalent to surgery so we don't have that deficit like we did 20 years ago when our fields weren't as precise it was sort of the shotgun approach versus our you know sniper approach now because the cure rates are better and it really comes down to the quality of life changes and that's where there's a spectrum of things now is this an apples to apples comparison because the patient who undergoes the robotic prostate to me today does not go on hydrogen deprivation therapy right they get to walk around in fact you've probably heard Ted on the podcast he says we'll give those patients TRT if they're hypogonatol right um why does the patient after radiation therapy still need to be endraging deprived if in theory the radiation is as effective as the surgery and that's that that comes to a key point where you have less surgical side effects you don't have it's it's trading one thing for another you don't have the incontinence you don't have the at least the short term risk of impotence like there is from surgery you don't have the you know the pinile shortening or whatever other sort of things that they have to deal with but you have to deal with hot flashes and the decrease libido and whatnot but again most of the patients who are intermediate or high intermediate risk are going to if they if they end up not having a negative margin or seminal vascular invasion after prostatech me they're still going to come to me for radiation anyway and they're still going to need to be on antigen ablation so there's a significant number now these days we'd certainly treat a lot less gleece and six and we used to we observe most of them yep but there's a lot of gleece and six folks that even in this day and age will choose to have radiation just because it's maybe a little bit more aggressive form of watchful waiting and in that case there is no antigen ablation and they just you know they just they live through the process of gleece and three plus three watchful waiting versus XRT no ablation now unfortunately there's no actual trial there's this observational studies that's that's kind of what we're dealing with oh gosh but obviously you can't figure out what the biases are but what do those observational studies show they show you know essentially because people don't die from gleece and sixties as we all know they really do because quality of life they do so with the radiation there is just less of a chance of it for instance to with three plus four and and when they come to me to be seen I'll I get a like it's it's interesting the different patient populations I also get people this is not mainstream but I get a lot of transplant candidates who need a renal transplant and they cannot get their transplant unless they're they're cancer free even if it's like even if it's one core of a gleece and six they're ineligible for their transplant so those guys I will certainly treat but I've been following them now for 20 plus years that we've been doing it they quality of life they do so well and this way they don't have to worry about antigen ablation when they do become a gleece and seven yeah so it's really interesting there would be a very interesting and elegant study taking let's call it medium to high risk three plus threes so people based on family history or some other phenomenon genetic or otherwise you randomize them to watchful waiting versus radiate them without antigen deprivation and you're really looking I mean you have to do this is a very long term study so the question is outcome number one could be conversion to three plus seven requiring surgery or antigen deprivation therapy and then of course outcome two the very long term outcome would be overall survive that's right and that's the key that's why these haven't been done he would need decades to do a trial yeah so yeah definitely but it's certainly what certainly would be interesting to see what it would show but the real world observational study show that all the gleece and six guys like I would say until maybe maybe a decade ago we did a lot of gleece and six patients they mostly were sent for radiation and they just because of the why were they sent well you know I guess the combination of different things people have different levels of tolerance for watchful waiting in the pre MRI days everyone had to have an annual biopsy and that alone is more anxiety invoking than really the radiation is not to mention we'd see fair number folks zero sepsis and you know complications from that so now in the MRI era we don't really see that any more but that was done very routinely and because the patients had so little proctitis and and cystitis especially in a gleece and six where not only am I not worried about pelvic lymph nodes I'm not even really worried about the seminal vesicles so my field is very small which really minimizes the side effects because the bladder a full bladder when it's when it's actually full it'll move superiorly and anteriorly where the doses is close to zero so most of these patients they just kind of laugh and say I'm coming from my daily my daily treatment and I'm you know right back to my normal life again so what in the absence of antigen deprivation radiation has become very simple for prostate patients now and again what fraction of gleece and sevens can do radiation without requiring antigen deprivation therapy that answer would have been zero probably five years ago you know it's recently but now with our terror and decipher it's probably I'd say a quarter of them don't need it if it's a three four with a load decipher lower terrorist score and again this is still in a evolving area where I don't think anyone has the exact answer but that's what most people are doing nowadays and even some four plus three is that have load decipherers are potentially candidates to avoid that and the biggest thing the biggest change in this has now been our ability to do PSMA PET scans to follow up because otherwise I think that the extra antigen therapy antigen deprivation was more of a sort of a band aid for not being able to see what's going on afterwards now if someone has a recurrence and we do a PSMA PET I got a guy that had treatment 20 years ago with radiation now he's rising PSA otherwise he'd just be stuck with ADT for years now I see we see a positive parloric lymph node on a PSMA PET I can just treat that area and you're doing that and very successfully there's no long-term data yet but it seems to be working really well similarly to how we would use a FDG pet to target a long-term in the past what about these patients that show up with two spine mats how effective is radiation there given that that's a favorite spot for prostate to you're talking about like an initial presentation with all the go metastatic disease okay we could talk about that or we could talk about post treatment three years later so post treatment three years later palliative radiation does work very very well it would be probably five treatments you can even do what they call SBRT which is stereotyactic body radiation may be in a single fraction and it definitely is very good it's we kind of joke about it just kind of spot well that spot and then of course it's not going to prevent something else from popping up elsewhere but that's extremely well tolerated and usually it'll stop the progression at that site so there are people who had high risk disease and to get back to what I mentioned earlier if they had a couple of spots like that at the time of initial diagnosis now it's been shown that you can treat the oligomedastatic disease if it's in the bone only at the same time as the primary lesion and the outcomes are actually not significantly worse if it's just limited disease and what is a more favorable presentation oligomedastatic to bone or oligomedastatic to parahortic bone for sure yeah you can have actually I had a guy walking to my office with a PSA of 1900 he looked just as good as you were me and I actually took him on a TV show I did many years ago is kind of an interesting story 1938 65 year old guy Mr. Macho had never been to a doctor in his life widow who decided that he was dating a younger woman now and she's like if you want to be with me you gotta go get checked out colonoscopy clear blood work all clear oh by the way your PSA's 1900 which means the lab made a mistake if you're I mean that's what I said so you would think except for his bone scan look like a Christmas tree this was in the pre-pet era but I mean he had disease and every bone is body with zero symptoms so this is an obvious and outlier situation but in that such situation you need lifelong androgen deprivation and chemotherapy you know usually at back then it was mostly tax all-based therapy we didn't have all the second generation androgen ablation drugs that we do now like in the ludumide but at that time when when we saw that you know he went and got chemo and got engine ablation when he came back to see me again fully functional guy perfect shape his PSA was down to 1.5 with just the systemic therapy and at that time the tumor board we presented him the decision was made to go ahead and treat his prostate as though he was a you know a denobo presentation because all the bone disease had had a result and he did great so he treated his prostate and how long did he live he still alive this has been I got an email from just about a year ago so I think he at least has about a year ago he was 12 years out still doing great with the zero side effects aside for me how he did have to be he's on androgen ablation for life so he's certainly going to have issues from that but overall still very functional how is this possible what what is what's the biology of that tumor that allows him to still be alive I don't think it's even necessarily just prostate I've even seen it in in breast cancer patients in that small subset where it's bone only disease with no visceral metastasis some folks can live for a very long time with bone only disease and I'm not sure what the answer to that is he's not an any debilitating fractures you would expect that at this point but no not not even one this guy's in his late 70s now he's in his yeah late 70s and has not fractured a thing and is still active the guy plays golf and hope he still has the young girlfriend I'm not sure about that but but other than that other than the hormonal aspects of it yeah it's amazing how I've seen many many people with four digit PSA's that we get him down at least any D for some window of time even if it's not that long four digit PSA yeah I think the highest I've seen is 7500 and that was not that was a person that ended up passing away but the the guy he was 1900 he I think a lot of it is a function of just like any other type of tumor he had all the other risk factors that were lined up he was young healthy no other comorbidities active you know you name it yeah well it's interesting I Ted has told me about some of the most terrifying cases are the exact opposite these guys that show up will be a low PSA with a very low PSA of 1.9 those are worse and for sure rampant metastatic design right right and that's the thing to get some of these really poorly differentiated cancer that no longer resemble their prostate presented or sells and they just they're very hard to monitor and a lot of them even don't even show up on a PSMA pet scan anything else you want to talk about on the oncology side of this as far as what what should people know as they're engaging with a radiation oncologist what questions should they be asking what you know it sounds like it's no different than surgery where there's clearly a difference between good surgeons and not so great surgeons there is presumably are people that take the kind of care you take and agonize over the details how can somebody find out if their radiation oncologist is kind of practicing in your philosophy you know it's it's difficult in terms of actual metrics very much like even for the surgeons like you know Ted has excellent outcomes but it's not like it's a published series you just have to commonly that the best surgeons often are treating the hardest cases so it's a handicap right handicap right so you know it really comes down to finding someone who's got got the experience and in my case because we do so much prostate I think I've done something close to in the modern era 7000 cases probably 10000 when you include the pre image guided radiation days someone who specializes in the area that the cancer is located so someone like me I may be extremely experience in breast and prostate but maybe for a pediatric maligncy you're not going to come to me you're going to go somewhere or a CNS or something that's unusual you have to find the right tool for the job but you have to just interview your doctor I think there's anything specific to radiation that's really asking about talking with patients right I think being very open with them saying yeah exactly and so ideally maybe you come to someone who knows something like I get a lot of patients who aren't familiar with the field they'll have a patient they'll have a family member that's a nurse or a dentist or a veterinarian or whatever it is some of it has some medical background they can say okay let me ask the more specific questions and these days with with the internet you can do all kinds of research in terms of like when I'm when I'm talking about matching my my volume of the dose distribution to exactly conform to the tumor volume that's something that's very easy to talk about but I mean for an educated patient they can ask to see the actual computer simulation so what am I engineering patients for the engineer is probably having easier time they do my love for my engineering patients are really the only ones who do this and I'll be I usually pull out all the graphs I show them dose volume histograms with area under the curve for each organ and you can see okay the prostate dose I air into the curve is huge the dose of the blood and the rectum is super low you can actually quantify that but for a lay patient it's it's hard you know it's not that easy to do that you really got to go with I think a lot of you have to go with your gut too in terms of this guy's had a lot of experience and the initial consultation is where it all comes down I'll spend an hour with a patient and go through every little nuance of what couldn't happen and my main I think my main MO is to sort of overprepare them and have them be pleasantly surprised maybe when the side effects aren't as bad rather than the other way around and you just it's hard to find the right person but there's a lot of good doctors out there so let's spend a minute just on the the brain and because I guess I guess that's sort of a unique case I know it's not where you are but but I'm sure you still do a lot of it you do okay not as much as prostate and breast but yeah okay both primary and metastatic yeah so again because the brain is such a sink for meds you know hey it's a source of a lot of primaries but it's also where a lot of cancer spreads it's often a place where you can't operate either because the the tumor the met were the primary is too close to say the brain stem or something too vital so it's a radiation is a pretty common tool there so talk about the history of radiation in the brain and in the spectrum of everything from whole brain radiation to gamini and stereotactic and sorts of things in between sure thing so really the main differentiating factor for brain patients is whether it's primary or metastatic disease and although primary brain tumors are relatively common they are dwarfed by metastatic disease so the vast majority of what most radiation oncologists see when you're treating CNS is going to be usually lung especially small cell base brain metastatic disease and so in those situations the the trend used to be where everyone we get whole brain radiation but now with the advent of stereotactic radio surgery which is more focused precise radiation the newer data shows that you can actually just treat the area of metastatic disease as as a as a delineated R&MRI scan and not necessarily radiate the whole brain like we used to but for decades everyone got whole brain radiation and for the most part they did all right but the problem was you're looking at a patient population that maybe doesn't have that much of a life expectancy now that systemic therapy immunotherapy everything has gotten better especially in the case of lung patients they're living longer we we have evolved where we've been finding people that were previously radiated the brain we're having cognitive issues years down the road not for the short term they would tolerate it well but maybe they'd start to have more forgetfulness and inability to remember numbers and names and whatnot and so the modern this was from whole brain radiation and give me some doses so we're talking about 30 gray to the whole brain given in 10 fractions of three gray weeks that was a typical sort of a three gray times 10 was a sort of a standard thing and again this is a staggering amount of radians and that's what and when we consider that again it's to the brain so it's a different story just to be clear do you need to use way more radiation because that's what you're delivering to the brain so the this is this an example of where the seaver it's in the gray are very different because this skull is you have to get through the skull so no so the the only difference between seaver it's in gray and any patient is going to be whether we're talking about dose in tissue or coming out of the machine basically the dose in air versus dose in the patient the biggest thing with the brain tumors yes the bone certainly is going to attenuate more dose but what I'm talking about it's actually 30 gray into the brain itself the actual brain tissue and so the but does not mean you need much more than 30 gray coming out of the machine a little bit more the bone doesn't do that it's not like there were in a football helmet or something yeah the first on's can still pretty much go through everything it's not that's not middle so it'll still go through but the dose is a little higher and it gets to be like for example in a lung patient it's more of an issue when you have multiple different areas you got bone soft tissue and air in that situation you have to modulate the dose more but in the case of a whole brain it's been found of course that the hippocampal dose is very much related to their cognitive deficits down the road so now that we have iMRT which is a term I hadn't mentioned before but that's basically intensity modulated radiation therapy which is also the magic behind allowing us to treat a prostate without burning the blood on the rectum and the newest form of iMRT is called image guided radiation therapy so here you'll hear iGRT basically those two terms go together but by using iMRT it's kind of like an HD TV versus a 1960s black and white blurry set where we can treat with multiple small pixels and high definition so to speak so now when we do a whole brain if I have to do a whole brain from multiple metastases by using iMRT I can literally carve the dose out I can map out the hippocampus and carve the dose out of there so you see these two cold spots on the hippocampal and not and really have a very low dose or while still treating the remainder of the brain perankema or there are other parts of the brain that you carve out and protect that's the main one of course we are going to not necessarily completely carve out because when when you have multiple metastases really the whole intercranial spaces of risk you have to cover everything so believe it or not 30 gray sounds hidey which it is but for a glioblastoma we is 60 gray but granted that's not to the whole brain that'll be to the either fits it on resectable patient it'll be the primary mass and then we will give maybe 46 gray to the to the peri to a moral edema but then the rest of the brain is getting much less hopefully zero in many cases do we know what the survival difference is for an unreceptable glioblastoma within without radiation it's it's certainly worse but typically the one there's again multiple confounding factors there because someone who's unreceptable probably has other other negative issues as well if they they have you know a poor overall performance status they have neurologic deficits whatever the reason the surgeon can operate that makes it worse but yes even then in that situation you get probably you're again you're measuring survival in weeks to months but it's probably double with radiation then without but a lot of our GBMs though are resected hopefully fully resected in terms of a radi-elisradio graphic of post-op MRI not showing any enhancement if you have someone that's got a fully resected primary who's a younger patient with not a lot of neurological deficit they can live a couple of years actually why is this cancer unservivable yeah you know that's that's the that's the key question I know you and I are both rush fans Neil Peart was lost to the GBM as well and you know it's it's so many people that's taken away but I think it just has to do with the the invasiveness of the fingers of the tissue in terms of even when you think you've gotten the whole thing there's microscopic fingers that are always on the periphery and you can't just radiate it indiscriminate like you can't other parts of the body because you've got the brain there so you get there's there's always a a fine line you're walking between causing you know say for example the process of the brain versus letting the tumor recur and so that's really the number one issue we do have a new tool now and as far as radiation oncologists in terms of treating CNS2 which is called proton therapy that you've probably heard about there's several centers in the country now M.B. Anderson where I'm in Houston has a huge one but with protons you potentially can have the dose go into the brain to a certain depth and not exit out the other way like an x-ray what x-rays are like light goes right through you you may have a decreasing dose what's kind of like a bullet you got an exit wound going up with proton therapy this is one of the areas where proton shine because you can actually modulate what's called the brag peak of the physics of the protons to where it'll go with certain depth and not go out the other way so down the road hopefully we'll start to see improves survival it so far it really hasn't shown to be a huge improvement but there's less integral dose to the rest of the brain and especially important pediatric patients where you've got you know children with growing skull bones if you can avoid radiating the growing bone to cause a you know a deformity later on that's huge so proton therapy is one tool we have but I wish I had an answer for GBMs you know that'd be that's going to be a game changer whenever that does happen yeah I I find GBMs to be just such a frightening type of cancer and I do wonder if it's going to require some sort of injectable immunotherapy or something like that I just yeah it's you have to basically figure out a way to treat the brain systemically and that's right and but you you have to mechanically overcome the blood brain barrier and come up with some sort of systemic treatment right um okay so today how many patients are undergoing whole brain radiation? Whole brain radiation is probably to give you a number it's I don't know what the absolute number is but it's probably 10% of what it was 20 30 years ago the original studies out of Kentucky that patch will have done in neurosurgery everyone used to get whole brain radiation following either following a resection limit has this or even if it was unreceptable and there was some good data back then supporting that but nowadays rather than whole brain you're usually going to do a focus treatment just to a smaller area and this is kind of a you know a universal trend to less radiation dose to a smaller volume same thing in lymphoma you want to treat just the enlarged lymph node and not the entire lymphatic access so it's the same idea where you're trying to minimize side effects so whole brain we still use it as in specific cases like for example small cell lung cancer part of their Regiment is going to be once the primary has been treated if they have a complete response in the thorax prophylactic cranial radiation only really small cell PCI 20 gray five fractions been done forever shows an advantage they have lower lower lower how much is reduction in CNS it's a lot I think it's probably 70 80 percent reduction in interest in CNS failures because they all fail their otherwise that's small cell they just all do that and at 20 gray they really don't have too many side effects but again of course the caveat is always small cell you know extensive stage small cell lung patient isn't going to have a long term survival but at least they won't fail on the brain it's a quality of life issue and I'm sorry this is done with every small cell patient no matter how early it's caught if they have a complete response to primary treatment yes basically I remember maybe there's some nuances but for the most part yeah okay so what's a gammonife so gammonife is is instead of using a linear accelerator it's actually using cobalt 60 like I described earlier but you have multiple small sources that can actually be used very high resolution cobalt essentially so you're doing the same thing but instead of using a linear accelerator based treatment it's it's using cobalt so is that used anymore or is it still our centers that use it it still works very well for what it is but the focus is very narrow there's a lot of children's hospitals and all that I think we're still using it but the linear accelerator which I is a abbreviated linac the linac based stereotyactic radio surgery for the most part has sort of taken over from that because it can do all the same things and also have more flexibility to do more than just CNS same juice hospital has a fantastic PDC and S program and they still have well it's been a while now but they did have a gammonife last time so we've talked a lot about radiation we've touched a little bit on the idea of radio phobia but but maybe let's let's use that as a bridge to talking about using radiation to enhance tissue as opposed to eradicate a subset of tissue sure what does it does it stem from you know nuclear accidents is that largely where radio phobia comes from I've done a deep dive into this this year which goes along with all these benign cases that I'm treating now they're essentially arthritis tendonize which we'll talk about and what's really interesting is that this radio phobia is largely a U.S. based phenomena because the first cases first of our x-rays were discovered in 1895 by RENkin in 1898 there was the first case described of actually radiating both arthritis type things are anglicing spondilitis or other arthritis and also tumors even back then we had no idea how to work but the case is pre-1900 they were already being used for that and then in the subsequent now 120 plus years we have this divergence where germany and the UK are using and all of Europe really are using radiation routinely for arthritis in tendonitis but in the U.S it seems to be a basic there was a lot a lot of a nuclear phobia the cold war like you mentioned but another thing that's been talked about there's a guy named Jason Becht that has a really good podcast on the subject he's out of Vermont standard oil the Rockefeller's and I'll actually had a massive lobby group that were actually actively promoting oil over nuclear power plants and the the amount of spread went from just the energy interesting to the just the general zeitgeist of our entire country and so at that time the radio phobia just caught on and it was of course bolstered by World War II and seeing what happened in Hiroshima Nagasaki and then on top of that you had the you probably heard about the radium dial workers there was a movie in its section to call the radium girls these are essentially women in the 1920s that were using radio luminescent phosphorous paint to paint the watch the watch dials yeah being a watch guy you probably appreciate that but they litter that was the only source of elimination they had so in order to keep the brushes very fine they were literally dipping it in the radium paint and then after each brush they were licking the brush to keep the the tip real fine and so they were ingesting bits of of radium and so there were a number of cases where they ended up getting the the radium is metabolized like calcium so it was actually incorporating into the mandible and they were getting osteo-radio and a process of the jaw and things like that so all of these different phenomena kind of added together became a became a big deal because prior to that people were using the radiation for all kinds of crazy things it was in sun tan lotions and waters and there was something called the gorydeen that they were using for e-d that you could not topical saves that had radiation and there was literally no end to it and then when all this sequela started to come out that hey maybe this isn't such a good idea that's when things took off but now that we look back the reality of it is is that a lot of that was really overblown even so much so that those radium dial painters which we hear about this from day one in our residency training there was only a small percentage I think 50 out of 1500 roughly that actually had toxic sequela so most of them didn't is there a way to quantify how much exposure they had to write that thing you know they'd named licked different ways but there there had been some basic ideas it was again we're talking about it was probably at that era probably a couple of milliseverts to that particular area but it was daily for decades and so part of the reason why they if you actually look at the numbers it was probably a super high exposure when you spread that out of such a long period of time that's sort of the general trend like I mentioned earlier it's not just the dose it's the dose over time it's you know the denominator matters a lot and so that's why most of them actually did very well they even used to use radium internal and the internal nasal applications in the 19 I guess 1920s to 1940s essentially a radiation equivalent of a ton select mad noidectomy and it was done in something like a half million to two million children in the US and even in the armed forces it was done routinely back then and there's been very few adverse sequela that were reported I don't even know what the dose was but it was high so there's a lot of cases where the exposure based on our 50 milliseverts we talked about would just make people follow their chair but the actual reality of it is is that many times the actual end results aren't as bad as we had expected again hearing you say this on jade the listeners are going to be thinking what yes because we're all so brainwashed into believing that radiation is horrible right right I can tell you so many stories I got patients who have had to treat I had actually had a guy who was involved in nuclear testing at the lowest alamos in the 1940s he's passed away now but I saw him in his 80s so this was in the early 2000s this was 60 years after that they had very little monitoring back then but he was close enough to feel the heat from a thermonuclear bomb and by the time I saw him he had had thyroid cancer as you would expect he'd had a one or two lymphomas I think I ended up treating his prostate so he'd had at least four or five different malignancies but the guy was as functional as most 80 year olds are the guy was still walking and talking and doing just fine and it's actually seems that the when you look at the population studies that were done outside the blast at Hiroshima Nagasaki when you've got the initial concentration everyone dies from the thermonuclear energy but as you get several miles out not only are the cancer rates actually roughly the same as the background you actually see again evidence of her mesis where you have some patients in whom or maybe not her mesis but some sort of radio protection where you actually have lower rates of leukemia and thyroid cancer when you get a few miles farther out than you did in the general population so it's all very much dose dependent time dependent but I think the human body we were evolved really to handle this to a larger degree than we realized because again mammalian DNA we came from you know the background of all the animal kingdom where there was tons of exposure from natural cosmic rays and whatnot and then you know our our predecessors had to be able to survive our DNA had to be somewhat resilient in order to get to this point and I think it's more resilient than a lot of people give a credit for so this first came up maybe a year or two ago when when I was lamenting must have been two years ago I guess because I was kind of lamenting my Achilles tendon which wasn't I wouldn't say it was injured I just had a little bit of tendonitis it was just bugging me a little bit you and me both brother and I'm exactly what you mean and and so it was through that discussion that we got into what we're talking about now which seemed crazy you know I just decided I didn't feel like driving to Houston all the time to undergo therapy and my Achilles is fine now I just been sort of standard therapy but right I've sent a few patients to you who have had similar injuries both you know high hamstring tendonopathy's Achilles tendonopathy's so so talk a little bit about this idea sure how prevalent is this type of treatment in Europe who you know how prevalent is it here right so prior to probably 1970 maybe 1980 it was very prevalent even in the U.S. it was very widely done so this is kind of everyone that talked about it now it sounds like I'm doing something experimental and radical but if you go over to Germany again going back to Ankelosing Spondylitis papers in 1988 they've done they do something like I hair between 20 and 50,000 patients a year in Germany and there's tons of it's mostly observational studies it's very very few randomized trials but low dose radiation for tendonitis osteoarthritis plantar fasciitis all the itadies you can think of birthitis a low dose of radiation has a similar anti inflammatory effect to what you would get from a colonel to find the dose so now we're talking about very low dose meaning 50 centigrey or 50 rads given six times over two weeks so three gray 0.5 times six it's three gray to the affected joint and using a very low energy machine so this is especially in the case of someone who's got a hand you're talking about electron beam right so let me just make sure I got that straight you were giving 40 gray total to a breast a breast and now for the achilles you're giving how much six got three gray six fractions of half a gray each okay got it so all six fractions combined is about the dose of one fraction for a typical cancer got it that'll kind of give you the idea and giving it in a superficial fashion where especially if it's a hand you only have a couple of send it maybe a couple centimeters of thickness so we use what's called electron beam therapy the same linear accelerator when the electrons go and hit the tungsten target and make photons if you remove the tungsten target you just get direct electrons and electron energy can be modulated to where you can treat a superficial skin cancer you can treat a knuckle I can treat a temple squamous cell and not going to the brain so these superficial things and in the old days before they had linear accelerates I told you this goes back to the turn of the previous century they had ortho voltage machines and these basically created kilo voltage x rays not the mega voltage x rays we use now and all they could do was superficial stuff back then and that's where it works very well the dosage has changed tremendously but these days with the modern the biggest data comes out of Germany half a gray three times a week Monday once they fried it for two weeks just to the affected joint and it has an anti inflammatory effect very similar to either either a cortisol shot or an insect or how many weeks is the course two weeks that's a month and a week this Friday six treatments and the protocol is what we typically follow the German protocol is to wait 12 weeks and you usually see depending on the joint summer between a 60 and 80 percent success rate where the pain is if not zero at least markedly decreased and then after 12 weeks the German protocol allows for a retreatment and at that point you get up to 90 plus percent success in terms of reducing pain and this is for joint arthritis arthritis 10 to 90s bursitis plant our fascia this is a really big one now that we're doing a bunch of I've done probably clicked a 70 cases across the board which is a positive markup because anybody who's had it you know I had it once back in med school so about 25 years ago did you get it treated it was it just a not just all went to PT and rolled on golf balls and did the usual thing but it you know it took months to get better it's such a big deal so you're saying so of the patients that are coming to see you with plantar fasciaitis how many of these patients how long have they been hurting first of all many times for years and in fact my biggest cohort recently which is still relatively new haven't done thousands of patients like I can speak from decades of experience with cancer we're talking about you know dozens to hundreds a couple of surgeons that were having trouble standing and operating they literally couldn't you know couldn't perform their normal duties six treatments to the to the fascia and they're walking like nothing ever happened how long after the last treatment did it take for them to experience in the case of plantar fasciaitis was almost immediate like within within a week I have other cases especially when we do like knee arthritis if there's a lot more pathology going on in a knee I treated my own Achilles which I can tell you about took two months or so so it was almost almost almost wanting if you was going to work and not I was my own first patient before I offered anybody I treated my own treat. True doctor physician healed myself right and so I literally jumped on the table because of colleague of mine had posted about it that he did his he's a radiation I call just in Florida he tried it out and so I was like you know I have the machine I know this should work in theory we just never taught about it in residency and I look at all the German data there's tons of it's like why do we not do more of this and it's sure enough like I I'm actually my own personal case controls study because I did steroids and PRP and my left Achilles and then later on this past year did the right side with only radiation and no steroids and now I'm walking without a limp and you obviously did the other side mm-hmm no I actually didn't I didn't repeat because the PRP actually finally did because I had two cortisol shots and PRP in the left and then a year later radiated the right and so both of them are holding up pretty well so far got it the other area that is a huge interest for me at least is the very very high hamstring tendonopathy so that that is chill tuberosity pain very very common for runners she seems to be anecdotally much more common in women than men that's on pelvic and I've only treated women for some reason that and they've all had tremendous results yeah again so you're it's still the same protocol it's the three over six treatments over two weeks exactly for any type of an arthritis uh you're essentially lacing all the macrophages and all and you're saliminated that side of kind storm that would have normally resulted it's very similar to what cortisol does but the difference is it seems to be based on the study we've seen this much longer lasting than a cortisol shot not to mention the fact that you're not necessarily violating the capsule and causing other you know again the case of an Achilles tendon you run the risk of rupturing it with multiple injections so totally non-invasive you just get up on the table most of my patients go right back to whatever they were doing and many of them are actually quite athletic and they don't take any breaks during treatment they just do what they do they're still working out is there any literature looking at this for spine injuries uh not by injuries let me be clear what I mean right so when you think of all the times that people are getting spinal epidurals for irritation of spinal nerves herniated discs things of that nature is there any reason to believe this could have any efficacy there if indeed there's some efficacy which there clearly is due to spinal injections or epidural injections there there is some data for spinal osteoarthritis specifically it's less robust than all the extremities uh I've actually done a few cases and it's actually worked quite well we've even got you know essentially Medicare actually does reimbursed for these things the issue with the spine is it's such a multifactorial area where if you've got a nerve root compression or a disc issue I can't fix that part of it but there is limited data that I've seen out of Europe that did show some degree of relief but it's not the 80 to 90 percent that we quote for the extremities. It's interesting and do you think that's because of patient selection like if you if you knew you were dealing with a facet arthropathy that should in theory respond well it should and it does I've done a few of those SI joints seem to respond quite well and that's in the literature that's included so hips SI joint, lumbar spine those sorts of things they are described they're just not as routinely treated there's not as the level of experience that we do have what your ability to center the beam is remark you're using the same high fidelity equipment you're using the rat on so you can hit a p inside if you want to. You could but that's exactly what you don't want to do because you're basically trying to eliminate all the macrophages in the region so you're actually better off treating larger features. It's the exact opposite of what we do with cancer therapy and because the dose is so low you're not really gaining anything by being too cute with the small fields you actually want to treat the region it's like almost like an abscopal effect for the whole area. So when if you're treating somebody that comes to you and they've got an achilles tendonopathy usually there's a point of maximum tenderness but it usually hurts up and down the whole like lillies how do you position the beam and are you literally hitting from mid-caf down to heel from the insertion in the gap even treat up to the in my case part of the gap the inferior gastroch was painful too. Okay so I treat that entire region the field is probably about that long all the way down to the calcaneal insertion and even onto the a little bit of the plantar surface of the heel because again when you're talking about these super low doses of radiation there's like if it was a sarcomo that area I'd be treating a tiny lill area but over here we won't we want to treat the whole region and in the most of the most radiation oncologists we talk to their experience treating an extremity it's usually for a sarcomo so that's a whole different ballgame where you're giving 60 grade to someone who's had a sarcomo and they're in their leg or something and you have to worry about things like a deema you know essentially if you you can have lymphedema of the distal extremity if you radiate the whole the holes circumference of a leg or something like that but with these low doses it doesn't affect any of that so you do treat large fields so it'll be from the entire and it's from the insertion of the Achilles all the way down if it's a plantar fascia the entire plantar surface of the foot another thing that we see a lot which is not arthritis is the putrons contracture and also the foot equivalent which is leader hose disease I had to look that one out that was like a trivia question but it's essentially palmar plantar fibrosis and so radiation works well there as well very well document and that requires a higher dose though you're talking about three gray perfect fraction five fraction and then you do it again after a few weeks so 1515 1515 almost a cancer yeah almost um palliative cancer not not a high dose but again that's for fibrosis keyloids it works very well get teenagers with the big old golf balls hanging off their ear after getting their ear pierced and things like that and so again you're treating the fibroblast in that case you use four gray times three treatments of 12 gray relatively large dose per fraction you can totally protect the brain totally 100% yeah and just tell I've seen obviously patients with debilitating kiloids what does it look like after the treatment so the treatment has to be adjuvant after a surgical resection if you just radiate an intact kiloid it's not going anywhere okay because you don't have the DNA mechanisms of you know a week cancer so that can be wiped out so kind of like doing a good on pregnancy but obviously if the surgeon just did the resection the kiloids coming right that fibroblast go crazy and they roar right back so in order to do it right a lot of people do and they have multiple recurrent to rate treatment I've killed as even after treatment you have to do the first treatment the same day of surgery so you just not letting those fibroblast get a chance to have any sort of a foothold so I literally arrange it with the dermatologist to do the resection send them straight to me so we get the first dose in that day and ultimately the cosmetic outcome is as good as if they didn't have radiation that you'll see the scar wherever it is we get sometimes kids that have had acne scars all over their chest that have these bumps everywhere and they're all reseected flat and you're radiating them they just stay flat you don't see any sort of dermatitis from radiation I think what's amazing to me is I I just think there's so many people that don't know this right I think there's too many people that are walking around sort of suffering right from something that's cosmetically upsetting like a huge kilo aid especially on a visible part of their body right obviously the people everybody listening can relate to some nagging injury 10 SLB golfers elbow a killies 10 to an opathy hamstring 10 to an opathy these things nag for years at times yeah I think they the data was showing some like one in seven people in the country are afflicted and the the socio economic costs are massive and there's also you know going to your whole quality of life and longevity bias I mean we're talking about something that can really affect someone's ability to exercise at all and it can lead to exacerbation of other medical problems so it's a huge problem you know I'm very encouraged to hear you say a second ago that medicare is covering some of these things and private insurance too yes for the most part now a lot of times because it's relatively new I'll have to get on there and do appear to peer with the company but I've had no rejections at all even for the spinal ones which are little bit there's less robust data but I've gotten everybody covered so I think the question is do we need more radiation oncologists right because how are you making room in your practice to treat these patients when your cancer patients are probably ringing you off the hook as well and that's a big reason why it hasn't caught on I think there's a component of just you know when you've got eight hours or 12 hours a day that the linear accelerator can run we're busy with that but one of the things is that because not unless it's a deep hip or something for most of the superficial for all the other joints you can use one of those old style ortho voltage machines that I mentioned earlier like what they use in Europe they still sell those here there's a company called extra all that still makes them and they're perfectly acceptable for all the joint stuff except for the very deep ones like maybe an SI or hip joint but you could have a you know a small center set up and those types of machines don't even require the shielding because the energy of the photons is very very low so yeah this is something that could be it's highly underutilized at this point in the and the Europeans have shown us the way it clearly works and America just has to catch up yeah this is definitely an area where we are way far behind but it's truly exciting I mean I love treating cancer patients it's really personally very rewarding to tell someone that they're any de- there's no evidence of cancer and they're body anymore they're PSA's low or where their mammograms look good it's it's that's what's kept me going this long but the amount of immediate relief we're seeing from from all these inflammatory conditions right away it's like it's a night and day patients come in one day they can't grip a dornab or lift a gallon of milk out of their fridge and after six treatments they can't and they're just they think you hung the moon it's an amazing thing yeah I really I'm hopeful that people listening to this so if there's a million people listening to us have this discussion and you know one in seven of them let's just say one in ten of them at some point in the next couple of years they're going to experience the type of injury that would benefit from this how can they go about finding you they can't all come to Houston to see you I'm trying to get you to move to Austin but regardless of where you end up yes they can't all come and see you so where oh that's you already said the answer I'm just going to move to Austin we're just going to do this full time and drive cars in the on the weekends no but seriously it's there's a uphill battle because as I've been going out and trying to get the medical community in Houston aware but you have a lot of pushback because number one you've got orthopedic surgeons podiatrist hand surgeons who are looking at this like number one what are you doing what are you talking are you they look at me like I'm crazy and number two is like even if this actually works the concern is with someone's got maybe a knee arthritis has been nagging them and maybe they're going to need a total knee at some point their concern is wait a minute is is this taking surgery off the table they have all the which it's not by the way it's such a low dose there's been plenty of cases of surgery after the radiation it's not an issue or you're taking away from like when you had your plantar fashion as I'm sure the podiatrist build something from when they do those extra corporeal shock treatments and steroids and whatever it's it's a different paradigm that would potentially be taking away that these a lot of paid a lot of doctors are very negative about it most of them that this one are very negative but I think that tight is going to turn just like anything else it's just going to take a lot of education a lot of time a lot of well I think the end of the day look I don't think patience will have any patience for turf wars yes right so if I'm a patient every doctor needs to be a fiduciary they need to put my interest have their interest and what's interesting is that I think you can have your cake and eat it too and the reason I say that is many times this is an adjuvant for other things so if you've got a podiatrist that's doing all these PRP's and other things I'm actually looking at starting a protocol I just treated a nurse in Houston who's who's a NP who does stem cells off label but she does them routinely has a quite a big practice we're going to look at maybe you can do radiation with adjuvant stem cell treatment there's I think a lot of reasons because it's such a low dose this may be the sort of combined modality thing down the road that we haven't really approach where there may be options to do other things still but again the fact that medicare to improve something is a huge bar right so how are you getting medicare to improve this are they are basically acknowledging that well hey if everywhere else if Europe's been doing this for a hundred years and it's working like what's that sort of looks like when you you know I've got the c61 which is the icd code for prostate cancer which is in most of my patients we got the australarthritis codes now they just go right through typically without any sort of problem some of the private insurance is you have to get an appear to appear call but when I all I literally will do is quote them a couple of the German studies unfortunately we got a little bit of a setback because historic is only two randomized clinical trisers both heavily underpowered poorly run studies just not well done so that's been a little bit of a setback but and the randomized data may never come just because of the nature of this sort of thing but having said that that's not the obstacle anymore we got as if it's really just public awareness and like you said once you get it just like a guy that doesn't want a radical prostitute to me and wants radiation therapy for his prostate he's got to be his own advocate and the data is out there the information is out there I've actually held there's a couple of big Facebook groups and one is only the putrons patients and they literally will post up that got this big nodule what do I do my surgeon wants to cut on me and so there's actually a whole whole network now so there's a lot more of that education going on they've got big PDF files of doctors all over the US that will do deputions radiation so deputions is a little bit more commonly accepted but as I'm slowly talking these folks they're going to sort of you know migrating to their arthritis space as well so I think it'll come and the patient the general public has nothing but great positive outcomes from this I mean and do we we have a sense of the durability of this so for example I have a little bit of osteoarthritis at my AC joint right right it's it barely bothers me but everyone's in a while if I'm doing something really violent overhead you know reaching for something or I play a ton of football with my son it'll bug me for like three weeks I'll take a little bit of ad bill it's fine right if I did a treatment there would it be done or am I doing this treatment annually how it works and that's there's a lot of variability that depending on what the actual anatomy that's causing it if there's you know if it's literally just a straight up osteoarthritis case with no physical structural issue I've seen cases I've now again I've only been doing this about a year so I don't have the 25 years of experience I do with cancer but I've talked to there's there's a couple of doctors who do this routinely they've been doing it for 20 years in LA one of them treated his own neck shoulder and spine he's 15 I think he's at 15 years out anecdotal obviously but never had to retreat himself typically the German studies allow for to treat me to retreatments because the dose is so low radiobiologically I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it I don't know about annually but you know maybe every few years something like that but there seems to be a fair bit of data that a lot of patients who don't have other struck like a like a knee that's bone on bone it might only last a month or a man I even work but for the other ones like the hands and all it seems like it's certainly longer lasting than any sort of cortisol shot but I think months are very reasonable and probably years for most people now what about non osteoarthritis like a room a room a room a tight arthritis is like that is there any reason to believe that this could help with sort of the debilitating injuries that those patients so I've done three cases of room a tight arthritis and one guy that had a gaudy arthritis as well because again it's a systemic disease I'm not going to pretend to be able to cure that with a local treatment but to a single knuckle that's driving them nuts it's still in an inflammatory process and yes it works great for that so I've done that so if a patient has room a tight arthritis where they're really experiencing a lot of deformation in the hands yes you you think you can help that that patient with with the local part of it yes it won't reduce the deformation necessarily a lot of that is you know long standing and if they've got we're treated early enough in the course of disease I think it that there's no strong data to support them but I don't see why it wouldn't work personally and it definitely from a purely palliative standpoint just to reduce pain it does work you just have to you've to manage their expectations what are some other examples of where this could be used in your at least in your experience so far in terms of reducing reliance on and said or opioids or other things like that uh tennis elbows become a big one doing several of those and how much do you how far down the arm do you aerate it I would I'd base it on where the patient might out if they palpate if they're getting pained down into the break your radials and if it's if it's sort of radiating further down I'll treat a larger field because again there's no reason not to bigger fields are better no need to be again it's just six great just three great three great so and again that's three great locally and it's in it's two an area where there's no vital organs nearby the total body dose is negligible it's like it's like getting a cat scan initially for the rest of the body so I would treat definitely the joint capsule a little bit of the distal humorous and the and the proximal radius and whatever else but if it's hurting larger I'll just treat a larger field and in that case we use a posed lateral beam so the patient will just lay there the beam will come in from one side and rotate around from the other side and we treat them well because that way we get the same type of homogenous dose we do with our cancer patients but if it was if it was more disillivism or it's like we've actually done several piano players that have dequire veins tend to survive this in their wrist and because when you're stretching to play those notes all my music I'm a musician as well all my my musician friends are coming to me and the the wrist pain is going away and that actually again very quickly my biggest patient cohort so far are our former patients because they don't have radiophobia they're like I've been through 80 grade my prostate this is a joke and I'm bringing my wife with me and half the times the wives sit there for their daily treatment anyway they start chatting in the lobby so we do the wives hand the same time we do in the husband's prostate and for the most part the hands the wrist the elbows it's very rapid in the case of the tendonitis like my killies it was a couple of months but that's not outside of the window of what we've been conditioned to expect from all the German studies so it can be not as immediate of a ever-releaf as a steroid shot but it does seem to be more durable yeah we failed to mention at the outset that you're also a remarkable musician about that how much do you still play the drums I try to play with I got a couple of actually a couple of doctor buddies we get together in jam every every week or two and one of them is actually a guy who's actually got his own YouTube channel and Spotify and he was actually professional musician before becoming a cardiologist so we may actually start touring again but back in the day we had a full full doctor band a full 70s rock cover band called ultrasound so there's a good old days we used to play you know journey in rush and and led Zeppelin all day long so yeah was commenting recently on a podcast how much I regret not seeing rush during their last tour yeah yeah again because of a GBM tied back into what we're doing here needle needle was it was a it was a genius so greatest drummer of all time are you going with bottom neither because after coming I went to what to college here at UT and that opened my world open my entire eyes up to the world of jazz and so the jazz drummers can all drum circles around those guys in terms of pure technical ability but yeah feel rhythm not necessarily being able to to wow people the way the jazz guys can but yeah probably kneel in bottom are both right up there on the rocks you put them at the top of the rock list I would put kneel first I'm just partial to rush and a lot of that has to do with their music not necessarily and then kneel was obviously an innovator but as a 16 year old I'm sitting there trying to imitate every single note on his drum solo so if everything like that so kneel number one but bottom and the and there's playing and then the new generation rock guys are incredible the guys that grew up with kneel as an inspiration now you've got you know 12 year olds who can do this stuff and they're sleep and then all these math metal bands you got you know dream theater and you've got things like animals as leaders some of these guys are doing things I pride myself as a drumroll me able to analyze the music really well it's getting to the point where it's almost more math than music like it's so intricate the modulation of the time signatures and things like that it's it's actually getting beyond or even I'm having trouble understanding it now but these guys you appreciate it from an auditory perspective or is it is it does it get too technical where it's hard to appreciate and distinguish that's a fine line because when you think about it math music is just math with emotion added in and it gets to a point where some of it is not appreciable anyway at least not to me some of these guys love it but that's where the jazz side comes in where it's all about feel but even the jazz guys will be extremely you know talented in terms of their ability to to feel the beat and have it be pleasurable to the ear but they're doing such intricate things and you can balance those two things out that's that's heaven as far as I'm concerned when you can when you can have the emotional side and also have be technically challenging and not just playing a straightforward you know the straightforward stuff is great to you but it gets a little bit tedious sometimes so we met actually driving amg drift academy I think yeah yeah which by the way not to crap all over it but it was like I ended up doing it because of the last second I got a phone call from my driving convention he was like hey I'm doing this amg driving school and they got an extra spot in the advanced drift school you want to come right but I'd already been to you know the drift academy with my friend Josh Robinson yeah sure I'll go yeah and I was like what is this the last time I ever do one of these school josh this school is 100 times better compare like in close if you want to come and you want to learn how to drift you go to the Texas drift academy I want to go to Minnesota with a manila ice class are you going I'm just I'm just run I don't know if I'll be able to make it or not I'm trying to yeah so anyway we met and but it was totally random right like it was just well I knew who you were because I'm gonna remember I've been a follower for years I was like got speed or tea over there so we got paired up in the same group and that's kind of where it started was totally random I was actually just it was a last minute thing it was actually a level two so I was like you hadn't done the level one right right so I was like man how did this guy get any without even doing the level one but and so having done that I agree especially those cars with the automatic transmissions in the turbo lag not the greatest for drifting you've been kind of a carnero your whole life and and what is it about cars that that has you as excited as you are you know I think whenever anybody asked me that I kind of think about it in terms of every three or four year old boys enamored by cars but normal people just grow out of it and some of us never do I and my dad certainly like cars he taught me how to change my oil and whatnot but he wasn't a fanatic like I am so it just kind of started there and then it got to point where like you know my parents will tell you the story about how I was like that was that four year old who could tell you at a car driving by if it was an old mobile that had Cadillac hub caps on it like how the hell does this kid know this thing but I don't know where just kind of clicked and over the years it was always just a nice nice release and I guess being a mechanical he oriented type person I think if I didn't do medicine I would have done engineering which is why I said what did you study in college I was actually biology I did a BA with arts I did a lot of jazz studies at U.T. so I music guy engineering just seemed fascinating to me but I you know I was always interested in medicine from day one but I think that it's really the mechanical side of things like knowing the every every car's five gear ratios and what their torque converter lock up is and what their horsepower and torque is it's just you know and what posters of cars did you have on your wall the same as everybody actually know because everyone had a kuntosh right I never had a kuntosh I mean they're cool I would have like a calo a corvette Miami-Vice testarossa of 928 which I'm almost done with my old 928 getting it back on the road you know more the domestic stuff and the stuff is more attainable fox body mustangs the five leader mustangs of that era really cool C4 corvettes back in that era when they were state of the art I mean I loved watching night rioters so I thought Pontiac firebirds were super cool you know it's funny I just bought my youngest his first Lamborghini poster he's mostly got sports posters on his walls which is great but I was like you gotta have like a Lamborghini poster so let's go pick one out so we scroll you know edc for hours right and because I wanted to figure out what his taste was right that he want to go retro that he want like a kuntosh but in the end I think we went with the I can't even remember now actually we just ordered it I think we went with an oracan oracan I have a lot of guy yeah I mean ultimately was it was gonna be an eventador oracan but got the color right and get the angle right have you driven a kuntosh yet I've never driven a kuntosh have you it's I have it's one of those don't meet your heroes kind of things you know it's it's cool but it's kind of a POS too you know it's it's it's there was just the bar has moved a long way since then but you might even if you don't expect I mean you clearly don't expect it to perform like a modern car but but even if you judge it for what it was in the 80s would it is it's still not enjoyable it's enjoyable because of the 80s camping is in retro spec but even compared to its contemporaries you look at an 80s 928 Porsche or even a testarossa those cars are beautifully driving you know long distance cruiser super comfortable compliance suspensions you got good ergonomics and the kuntosh is so awesome because it has none of that it's awesome we bad yeah yeah I've driven a testarossa yeah have you ever driven it I've at 40 I have not yeah I have I'd love to have ridden and one but I haven't driven when it's it's it's a race car so it's you know you're basically just sitting on the ground with a carbon tub or on you so if you good have three road cars but you can't sell them so you can't you know you're not making the decision based on economics right okay what what if a three you want three road cars not daily drivers or we tell me just three cars that's all you can have in your right no no no these are your these are three grail cars okay I would probably say man there's too many to choose from but probably you have to go with it's gonna sound like a cliche but McLaren F1 I mean how do you not pick that if I could only have one that's the one I want it's got a bunch of the picture of you sitting in that yeah I was jealous I was happy number one but then there's at least 10 that I could pick from be happy but I would probably say and one of them is one that I have a lot of experience was with the 4 GT I just think just one and then Jen one one of the all time greats and I would probably pick stuff that's manual and somewhat analogs I'd probably just say career GT Porsche career GT with an NAV10 and they're they're an obtaining now but they were reasonable of just a few years ago and they're just again you just don't get there's plenty of faster cars career GT today is going for about one seven one eight ten years ago was half that yep and what's an F 40 going for today it's got to be three I think at least yeah I mean six seven years ago it was half that it totally was do you think this is a bubble or do you think these things are not coming down and value there never make any more of those limited supply the man is never going to wait for those at least I think when you look at other collector cars like some of the pre-war stuff it's going down because the the target market is all fortunately dying off they're just those people aren't around they could appreciate that but and that may happen at some point I suppose we're going to be a point where nobody cares about this we'll probably be long gone but the McLaren F one is it's unattainable oh that's I mean and there's so few of them yeah that's in a completely different league than the other cars but even like something that for GT they made four thousand of them it's not that rare well to two of them are gone a lot of them are gone thanks to yeah lack of traction control but still I don't think they'll ever go down just because that era I think then the gen two the current Ford GT which is a twin turbo automatic car will ultimately be a clipsed in value by the old one even though right now there's still more yeah they're almost double or triple but I think it's going to so where where would you put the nine five nine on this list we talked about that little bit it's right up there the only downside to nine five nine is that it was so ahead of its time that essentially is what a modern Porsche is now so yeah it's super cool we've got the 80s camping is the looks but it's basically like driving a nine nine three turbo for the most part it doesn't have that NAV8 or V10 sound it's a it's a turbocharged flat six like everything was after at that time there was nothing like it did that four real steering as well I you know what I think they did yeah like it was so modern so modern it's sequential turbos and even water cooled heads even those were all air cooled portions back then they managed to water cool the heads and now canypid does a really cool version of resto modern version but those never came to the US you think you know about that right it was the bill gates ruled as you hear about that he who I did know about the same more so I don't know all the details I should have read up but essentially he was able to get the gray market to passage for these cars for some loophole I don't know the details of it now and only after that were they able to import them into the US and so of course now that they're older you can get anything under a 25 year old I like the odd ball stuff like that that's just unavailable but the nine five nine I would still put click below the courage to just because of that naturally aspirated F1 drive V10 that's just sings in the nine five nine's motor is not as than how that level of character I'll tell you what's interesting about the courage to be which by the way would be on my list of three as well most people listening to us now if they're not carners wouldn't spot a courage to if it ran over their toes yeah that that's like a bigger boxer right it's just like so they're like what is that a portion but it's like probably like that doesn't even look like it doesn't right stand out at all whereas if you saw McLean F1 yeah you don't need to know anything about a car to know you saw something special for sure for sure um but it's and and I think the same as to with a GT the GT is yeah absolute head turner right no matter what and the interesting thing there is it's really based on a 60's design it was a tribute but the Camillo parto who was the the designer for fort who basically reinterpreted for the 21st century kept that original character but made it arrow friendly and didn't you know was able to use all these hard points from the old car but make it modern and basically upside the car it's like 110% size of the original that you could actually fit two people and because the original GT40s were tiny and they apparently generated tremendous front and lift in limon so the bottom and the modern when I've actually run at the Texas mile and the on an air strip over 200 miles now it's it's dead straight it's I mean it's they did everything right without resorting to the modern cars with all the big wings and all the big downforce it's just well balanced it is it's just they just did everything right on the car um okay now of the modern cars okay anything that you really really fancy kind of 2000 okay let's go let's define that first wave of hypercars in the 2015 so when the La Ferrarie the P1 and the 918 came out right 2014 2050 10 years ago they call it the holy Trinity for some reason yeah yeah I mean yeah that was staggering right first yeah so from that era forward right what do you fancy the most the most you know those cars again at that time I like the more than I do now just because again the hybrid technology is leaving those kind of they're a little outdated now I think out of those three I was personally maybe I'm sounded like a Porsche fanboy but the 918 was just stunning that part was just a design for get about the performance and it had an again NAV8 high-reving bespoke to that car you're not in any other platform and the electric component was just sort of a that was the G-Wiz thing of the moment which of course made it ungodly fast but that NAV8 and the way they exhaust it's out of the back well that's why by the way if you I've I've got a friend who has all in silver 959 career GT 918 that's the Trinity right like that's a Trinity that's like having you know F40 F50 and so La Ferrarie same sort of thing I mean all of those cars were amazing but since then it's gotten and that was probably the the the interesting thing about that era decade ago was that was probably the inflection point after which performance doesn't matter anymore you're okay saturated performance yours you can buy a your traction limited at this point right and not only that you can buy a used EV you can buy a Tesla plaid that'll do 16 2 seconds flat that'll for 50 grand that'll smoke everything so it's all about the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the total of the time you took your Tesla plaid to Coda how how long did it take you to smoke the brakes on that so I when it was stock one stop in one make sure people understand this because they don't know so that means you came out of pit lane right so you're going up to turn one I didn't outlap so I didn't outlap so but the first coming down first hard break is going in turn one going to turn one of my buddy was in an SF 90 which is a 1000 horsepower Ferrari hybrid which is basically the fastest Ferrari you could ever buy and I was I found I was kind of catching up with him in turn in 20 and coming down the front straight I caught an SF 90 in my daily driver but I nearly rear-ended him because the car was able to stop just barely for turn one but the brake fluid boiled at that point the car was not designed to do that unfortunately and what's interesting is it's not you would say okay it's an electric car's heavy blah blah blah other electric cars don't do that the loose did the tie can they actually have really good brakes but at the time I didn't realize this because they had been advertised as being track ready or at least able to run a like the time of how it ran so good the nerve wriggling but the factory brake fluid is dot three I know after the fact which is low boiling point is boiled it the car is designed for efficiency low driving I didn't even use dot three in my simulator right I was running dot four in the same probably boilers similarly yeah so a 5,000 pound machine stopping from 100 and I probably did 160 on the front straight at that time yeah what's about I don't think it was limited actually that time I have a track that the amount of BTUs that you're trying to shed off of those brakes it was just forget about it so thankfully it had to be great so fine if you put better fluid in or they're better they're less terrible so if you want to track a plot you're going to need new brakes so I don't did I tell you what I did I ended up having a full will would set up put on the car so all new rotors custom duckting Mike do sold to sold designs actually he bought a platform himself he's built he's like I've built the Z06 I'm driving now but he ducked into the front brakes basically custom custom brake ducks that car is sealed the whole front is sealed up it's not meant for that it's meant to just be looking for anything any error on them nothing nothing at all so he actually made custom ducking and after that the car was unbelievable because you could actually late break and and so really what lap time can you do in a in a trip to Plaid now a trip Plaid will only do one of them here's the problem you can only get one solid lap before starts pulling power due to heat to the battery okay my best was a 224 and so that's at a 55,000 pound car that's no way taken I just stopped car didn't do any mods to other than just the brakes but you do one lap and and the so just to re-answer your previous question I don't know how much time we have but I'll just keep it brief that one stop turn one brakes gone thank god I have regent so I just literally nursed but I was already I couldn't turn off so I go through the s's and I'm just you know 30 miles an hour whatever I got down through the regen is enough to keep the car from completely just going off the track so 30 40 50 so coming through 9 10 coming into 11 again I'm not on the throttle at all I'm just maybe going 40 miles an hour but the regen has slowed come coming down the hill towards 11 the regen is kept me from gaining any more speed but my my my right foot is on the floor like it's the fluid is boiled so I had to go wide in 11 into the gravel completely around and then you know that that's when I found out about all that and the McLaren Senate both taught me where all those orange squares are spray painted on the arm coat where you can have the emergency off so I literally went through the gravel came with an inches of the arm coat 11 and then just hobbled in but then after that the next time out we put dot four a butt put castra will break fluid in it and change the pads then it was good for maybe a lap so then ultimately that still wasn't good enough so we did the big break now I see guys out there with testlers they're clearly not pushing as hard as you or they're mostly model three's the model three is 800 pounds lighter it's not as fast but it's a way better track car so I've done I've got dozens of laps in model three's they do fine because they're not making a thousand horsepower and they don't weigh 5,000 pounds they still will boil their breaks but if you just do pads and fluid that's actually a very desirable especially if it's a little bit damp outside not much can keep up with you in a model three and auto crosses they went national championships which is coil oversense in a 4000 pound sedan that's where EVs have gotten but just answer the previous question we did the breaks on the model S and then once that was done the only thing that that eliminate the brakes as this as the weak link but the battery the cooling is still not there so you got guys spending tons of money I actually was looking at doing a really heavily modified arrow testlamodel three like Randy Pope's drives it only do a lap at Cota because of again that's such a high high speed and high braking but it will literally just you can you can hot pit and go right back out and you can keep hot pitting but you'll never get a flat time but it'll do just fine if you do that but the next gen cars like Porsche Taycan the even the loose it's sapphire now those cars can they're just as heavy just as if you take in the Taycan turbo S out I did when it first came out in 2020 and what a lot lap out that was that the time was on stock tires and everything probably two thirty-ish yeah red red runs. Much I mean it had 750 I think I probably sent you that video at John Hennessy's track I had the Taycan the loose it and the plaid all lined up on the drag strip I'm in a 750 horsepower Porsche that can run tens in the quarter mile and the plaid and the loose it walked away from me like I was on foot. You just didn't have the traction control? No it didn't have the power 750 horsepower versus 1100. How much is the loose it up? The loose it has 11 this was the old loose it now the new sapphire loose has more has 1200 but this was 1100 and it's still in a 10-th or two behind the 1000 horsepower. Because they all have great traction. They all have and they're all will drive the traction is in the same size. It's literally just powered away at that point and you're just so I didn't realize that so the Taycan turbo S was only 750. When you stand on a turbo S if there's a plaid next to you he will leave you like you're not moving and that's like the outies a super fast car in the real world but that's why horse power doesn't matter anymore but that was more horse power limit the Taycan would happily do and actually I had a turbo before the turbo S which had steel brakes turbo S had ceramics and even the turbo would do it and on all season tires the very first Taycan that came out this was in the early days when Porsche was VW was having to respond to diesel gate you remember diesel gate and the whole deal. They had to build these electric cars and they had to go to states that were car basically the California Research Board admissions compliant because of all the diesel penalties they had so the first cars didn't come to Texas they only went to New York so I got a non-turbo S irregular Taycan when all season tires out of New York and on steel brakes Porsche Porsche it just I mean it was squealing in the corners of the all season tire but it lap 20 minutes no problem brakes were solid there's just something about the German engineering there but having said that the loose it is now equally good if not better despite being a brand new non-legacy company who is again not they're not trying to build a track car but the loose it sapphire is faster than a plaid now it runs eights in the quarter mile but it can actually track and even my old loose it which I would expect into the car on eights in the quarter mile these yeah it can crack and and sub nine now so it's several car lengths ahead of a plaid which is beyond bonkers I mean it's this you have to warn passengers these are these cars now you can't just accelerate and we have to say hang on just put your head against the headrest before I can cuss you by the way we failed you you very very briefly mentioned it but my favorite car post that the Holy Trinity of 2014 and Vivid is of course the McLaren Senate yeah yeah where does how does the Senate stack up for you and what was your fastest lap time in the Senate so my best again the biggest limitation of the tires of the non-GT or the Senate GTR can probably I've seen guys run like I think two flats in those things a couple I know a coach of mine had run a 208 just on just barely even trying but then street Senate on the trophy or just it understands it's really just not meant for that but it'll still and it got tons of downforce tons of braking but it just doesn't have the grip so I think the best that it was a 2015 and again when you driving car that value that's insane for a street car release you still you're insane but but at the same time I'm sure a pro could do better I was still thinking you know that arm code gets really close to a that car of this value they could be very good and return 12 I wasn't breaking actually 150 even on trophy bars really and then I find you know McLaren doesn't want you to put slicks on it and so I violated all the rules and I ended up putting a set of probably tires off the for our challenge cars on it when I first put it again slicks need camber you can't get much camber out of a street Senate which to me was the most disappointing thing where is the GTR you got four degrees but anyway even without camber when I first stopped on that back straight completely stock Senate would just slicks on it at the 150 mark I almost parked it in the corner it's was incredible even with the trophy R to stop at 150 in a car that in the tire that drove me to Houston in back the band with of today's tires that's a whole another topic it's incredible what even on all season Michelin has congenerated one G one G is nothing anymore all my old car and drivers I have a library of thousands of magazines point eight point nine was a huge deal 30 years ago now you got many vans to do that and even all season shot sports cars that are heavy we can do that on a on a regular tire the chemistry of these tires these days is unbelievable yeah and the promos that were two point three yeah yeah right I mean that's just and that's not even on a paralli that's like I'm a cheap guy so I run yeah well I run hard AMG GT3 I was running handcooks which would at least last me like two weekends and even then like that car was running two 11's on handcooks with just me driving it so the pros are running faster than that yeah I think I think Senate GTR not a streetcar of course just the the problem with the Senate street cars it's too track for the street and it's too street for the track it's just like a 720 S which is mechanically identical without all the downforce is a beautiful GT car drive across country you can store stuff in it super comfortable and on on Hoosiers not on select but on Hoosiers and and I change that to steel brakes that's a 2016 to 17 car it's not it's not that much slower faster than like the your old GT4 yes yeah the McLaren GT4 that's yeah that one I I'm sure I think Randy Pops could probably run close to that but when we drive for the drive drive it a driver three seconds probably and that's all in the streets because the GT4 car has half the not half the power but it has and actually my GT4 I actually cheated I tuned it okay so because those the the 570 S GT4 was already detuned from the street car but you can you can tune the street cars as well so when I was I pushed an extra 150 wheel just by tuning it because stock turbo's can handle that and so that would go 175 on the back straight whereas a regular GT4 can do 20 miles now or less than that but even then the 720 S and the actually 720 S and Senate are identical on the back straight the Senate can stop later though the Senate you can stop on the top 100 yeah probably 100 but in the in the 720 with the aftermarket steel brakes pads and a who's you're not even a real not in the which is still a DOT tire you can still break it a little bit after 200 it's not bad at all for a car that you can go shopping at the outlet malls and because it's got a massive fronken and the ride compliance that's the biggest thing about McLaren so the Senate is more tied down but they all have that active suspension that doesn't use sway bars or springs it's all hydraulic it's all fully active there's hydraulic lines that diagonally connect the front right to the left rear wheel so the pressure in those lines kind of combat body roll so you can have it be a plush highway ride or you can have it be a a stiff track car the bandwidth is almost unobtainable in any other any other car do you do you think in the in the in the sort of maybe in the public I mean do you think McLaren is somehow underperforming relative to what they should be doing given both their quality as an automotive brand and as a as a racing brand underperforming in terms of sales that what you're talking about primarily they are yeah they truly are and a big problem is I think is the perceived I'm actually and it's not just perceived the actual lack of reliability I love the cars but they're always there's it's all the jokes about British British electronics they all come to bear even the Senate would go into limp mode between nine and ten if you floored we even we had it wasn't just mine we had Senate Fest going on with 20 I think about 20 on track at one time almost every so some guys were just kind of tooling around so they were fine but if you were hauling ass between nine and ten when you get a little bit of suspension droop yep going to limp mode if you're if you're accelerating through that I would live even a GTR no no okay I'm sure the GTR is fine I haven't tracked one of those unfortunately but the and over a GTR is that a mode issue no like if you were in track mode that was in track mode I think it happened to me even one time I forgot to put it in track I think it still did it it it's a G4's related to suspension droop issue they just freaked out the computer and they had it they had McLean guys on site who were actually working on patches and they could patch it they did and I think it made it less frequent but I think it still happened after the patch I have to ask them a clarion guys about that I think it's safe to say nobody's listening to us anymore now anyway but case anybody still is yeah this has been an awesome discussion I really appreciate the the offer to come out this is a true privileged Peter what you have done in this community is unparalleled in terms of like I think I told you when I first mentioned it's like dude how do I get CME for this stuff your lectures are better than almost all not lectures but your podcasts are better than almost all the CMEs because you get the right quality people on here much better than me by far and you get people and then the way you phrase the questions and the way you kind of parse everything it's so understandable for a wide band with I got you know my non-medical friends and family all the way to the colleagues everybody gets something out of them and that's that's hard to do well hopefully today we delivered a lot of insight both to people who are obviously interested in radiation therapy for cancer which unfortunately is going to be a lot of people yeah and then of course this other application around the treatment of inflammatory conditions which again inflammation lies at the root of so many other things right and just in case anybody cares about a little drumming in cars that's right got us something to we got to we I think we have a whole indication for a whole separate series here that truly is the drive it's really just the drive we can do that all right well thank you Peter

is consciousness necessary for the internalization of this full gamut of pain. Yes. Now what people incorrectly thinking while they're not experiencing pain, everything's okay. What is the most responsible case for oral opioids? I am not pro-alpioid. I am not anti-alpioid. I am pro-patient. Prescription opioids were over prescribed. They were over marketed. There were bad actors doing bad but it's not that simple story. Did it have bad consequences? Yes. Did it have good consequences? Hell yes. I am sure everyone has heard of and yet if you asked most people to define it, they wouldn't be able to define it. I'm talking about none other than fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is frequently preceded by some event. Societal burden of chronic pain is terrifying. It's astounding. It's more than diabetes heart disease and cancer combined. What are the other areas where LDN is just captivating the world? It's one that I use more and more and more because of its safety profile and it's potential for getting me a home run. Is there a part of you that thinks this is a guy who's going to be in chronic pain in the rest of his life? Or do you look at a guy like that and say no no? We can fix this. I've never hit a point in my career with a patient where I've ever said what done? Like I got nothing. I got nothing. Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Sean, thank you so much for making the trip to Austin. Oh, it's my pleasure and it's uh, it's really good to see you again after a rather long time. Yeah, I was thinking about it. So this morning my wife said, oh, who's what's the topic of the podcast that I said? It's going to be pain and I said, she said, oh, who you have and I said, Sean, Mackie, she goes, you know, her face lit up and she doesn't know you. She's never met you, but she knows your name because she's heard me tell a story. Right? She's heard me tell a story about my own experience through this and I then realized something which is I haven't seen you since I was in medical school. Yeah. Yeah. Which is kind of weird. Yeah. Right? So I'm sure we will get to how you and I met 25 years ago, exactly 25 years ago. Wow. And how you played an unbelievable role in bringing me back from arguably the brink of what could have been the end of my life truthfully. But I want to start with kind of some broader topics around pain. Right? So there's nobody listening to us right now who doesn't know what pain is. There's nobody listening to us right now who hasn't experienced pain. Yet if you ask for a definition of pain, I think you'd get a lot of using the word to describe the thing which isn't truly a definition. Yeah. So if you were trying to explain to a Martian from another planet who doesn't experience pain, what it is, what would you say? Yeah. Yeah. There's the formal definition of pain which is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. It's a mouthful. If you think of it as it's an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience and it is usually tied to something physically happening but may not be. I think sometimes what's missing in that definition, one of the things I wish they had put in but never did, is that pain is the great motivator. Pain is one of the most primitive experiences going back to if you will single cell organisms. You know it's either pain or reward. You're either being driven toward oxygen, food, sex or you're trying to get away from danger. And so pain is this pain is so wonderful because it's so terrible. It keeps us alive without pain. You know, we have these as you know, genetic issues of congenital and sensitivity to pain, we would have never lived as a species. So pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. To understand pain, whether you're a Martian or you're a human now, I think you have to look back in history. And so I'm going to evoke Renee DeCart, 17th century French philosopher, thought to be the father of modern philosophy, incredible contributions brought Cartesian geometry to us, which led to calculus. And he had this dualistic model of pain that he put forward. Now, he had to his credit. It was the first mechanistic foundation for pain because beforehand pain was thought to be something mystical or religious. It was punishment of the gods. So he put this framework together that's often illustrated this famous picture of a little boy with his foot in the fire. And there's a little string from his foot going up into his brain. And it ends up in the pineal gland, which was thought to be uniquely a human area. And the idea is the fire pulls on the little string. Opens up pores in the pineal gland, rings a bell and the boy withdraws his foot. The idea is in this dualistic model, there is a complete separation between body and mind. The body is where pain is generated. The mind is where it's perceived, but the mind is simply a passive receptacle, receiving these signals. That model put forward in the 17th century, stuck with us for hundreds and hundreds of years, and I would argue, is with us today. And it has influenced medical care. It has influenced policy. It's influenced everything in our society about the way we think about pain, and it's utterly completely wrong. So yes, he got Cartesian geometry right, but he really, you know, complete Bollocks screwed it up when it came to pain. This biomedical model, this dualistic model, was with us for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, and it's only been in the last number of decades that we've appreciated the nuance of what pain really is. And instead of it being under this guise of this separate mind and body, we now appreciate it is this integrated biosycus social phenomenon, meaning that, and I think this is one of the most important things that I'd like to drive across. I'm an introduced to term, we're going to get to a term called no-sysception, which are the electrochemical injury signals that occur in the periphery that what goes on in the body and what goes on in the brain, the experience of pain, they may have nothing to do with each other, or very little linkages. And we're going to hopefully unpack that. So hundreds and hundreds of years, we've got, we're basing in on Renee DeCarts, dualistic model. We still see this in medical care. Right now, you're a surgeon, you know, for many, many, many, many, many years when I talked with the surgeons, they were firmly of the opinion that the amount of pain that a patient had after surgery was related to, you know, how much the scalpel cut and how much tissue damage was done. And I think it's only more in the last 20 or so years. I'm seeing surgeons really embracing this model that what people bring to the operating room table directly influences how much pain they have, like their early life experiences, all this stuff. And we'll talk about that. And Sean, just to interrupt for a second, thinking through the history of medicine a little bit, the latter part of the 19th century brought a couple of other tools to pain, right? So between local anesthetics, cocaine down to light a cane and general anesthetics in the form of ether, which finally allowed surgeons to cut people without having to hold them down while they screamed. It sounds like that didn't shed any new light. That was viewed in the one hand as just a blunting instrument. But it didn't change the model. Didn't change the model. Okay. Yeah, had no influence on that model, which just I think has had tragic consequences and the care of people particularly with chronic pain, particularly women with chronic pain, who have felt stigmatized and validated because absent something that's obviously wrong out in the body of the periphery, they were just labeled as being histrionic housewives or being told it's all in their head. Not just women, but also some men as well. And so it's only with that evolution of our perception, our model into a bioscicial model that that's gotten much better. Okay. So let's talk about is there a pain receptor? Yeah. So let's break it down into the foundational stuff. So we have these things called no sea sectors, complicated name. It's basically a transducer, which is another technical name. Now you're engineering background. So you all know that a transducer is simply a device that converts one form of energy into another form of energy. This this microphone is converting sound energy into electrical energy. The speakers convert electrical energy back into sound energy. We have these no seceptors that lie in our skin, our soft tissues, our deep tissues, our viscera, and they're specialized. And they convert well different forms of energy into electrochemical impulses. They take pressure. They take heat, cold. They take chemical changes in the form of pH that can occur during infection. They convert those into action potentials that are then transmitted up nerves. These are little electrical impulses transmitting up generally two different nerve fiber types. These two different from nerve fiber types. One is called a sea fiber, which is thin and slow. It's really pokey. And I don't know if I'm getting a head if you want to go more in that. But you got this pokey, slow sea fiber that transmits it about one meter a second. And the frame of reference, if it helps, is think about your thumb is about a meter from your brain. So an impulse on a sea fiber from your thumb to a brain takes about a second to two seconds to get there. The other nerve fiber type, it's called an A-delt of fiber. It's got some nice insulation around it. It transmits ten times faster. So it takes a little under a tenth of a second to get your thumb to your brain. And it gives a real world sense of the difference in sea fibers and A-delt of fibers. Think back to the last time you stepped on a tack in the carpet. You hit your thumb with a hammer. You twisted your ankle. I'll come off a curb. What happened? Think back to that experience. You get this sharp jolt to pain that goes right to your brain. Those you're eight-delt of fibers at ten meters a second. Rapidly getting up to your brain, rapidly putting into play systems to protect yourself from harm. You withdraw. You have a reflex that's occurring in your spinal cord. You're not even consciously aware of it. Your brain is setting into play, escape mechanisms. The pain, the experience, sharp, it's well localized. You know exactly where you stepped on that tack. Then about a second, two seconds later, you get this hot burning flooding sensation. Come over your thumb with your hit with a hammer and you think to yourself, oh damn, this is really gonna hurt. And it gets hot. It gets burning. Those are your sea fibers. Unmile and aided slow. Getting up to your brain. And what you also notice for the first time is you don't like this. This has an unpleasant quality to it. That you didn't get as much with that aedelt to sharp pain, but you're getting with those sea fibers. That's really clear. And Sean, the aedelt is doing two things. If I'm understanding this correctly, is it creating the spinal reflex where hit my thumb with the hammer, the signal goes into the spinal cord out through a motor neuron to pull back without me having to think about it. That's exactly it. And, you know, it is synapses and there are synapses in the ventral or anterior, the front portion of your spinal cord, which is as you know, your motor part of that spinal cord. They're making synapses and it's causing a classic withdrawal effect. But am I also feeling the pain and my perceiving the pain? And if you could do a thought experiment where you could eliminate the sea fiber in an individual. Yes, would they still feel pain? Yes. Yeah. They would still feel pain. So there's still a central component to what the a fiber is doing. Those aedelt to fibers are still still going up. Going up there. They're in the spinal cord. They cross over to the other side. They head up through. So there's an aferrant and an eferrant to the whole thing. Indeed. Okay. Indeed. We think of these pathways. The main one that we all learn in medical school and we think about it's a spinal, the laminate pathway. This goes from the spine up into your brain. We're going to get there. But yes, if you had no sea fibers, you would still feel pain. That's one of the other things. I think it's important to understand about pain is we've been trying to knock this out for untold years. And we've not been very successful with it. And part of the challenges pain is so highly conserved from an evolutionary standpoint. As I was alluding to back to single cell organisms, reward pain. You know, we evolved over the years to have this complex experience of pain, but also redundancies. You knock out one pathway related to pain. There's others there. And they find their way up into the brain just about no matter what. Just thinking about this through an evolutionary lens. Lots of debate about this in the animal kingdom, right? Like does a goldfish feel pain? Yeah. Right? Do we have a clear sense as to how far from humans and or mammals you go where you still clearly have sea fibers and a delta fibers? You could go pretty deep in there. And I get the debate. It's a great debate over wine or beer. And I understand actually taking it seriously and having that debate. A lot of different opinions on this. I actually don't engage in that debate, you know, because I think you have to first of all define the thing that you're debating. You have to very clearly define the thing. And in this case, our definition of pain is a rather human experience. Well, this is where I was actually going to go if I can just give you that window. So you know, what I was really going to ask is a question about consciousness. Yes. Is consciousness necessary for the internalization of this full gamut of pain? Yes. Yes, it is. I believe it is. I believe firmly it is. And, you know, I'm a recovering anesthesiologist. You know, I haven't done it now in, oh gosh, 20 years. But when I did it, and when you were, you know, operating on a patient, the patient is unconscious. They are not experiencing pain. You need a conscious brain for the experience of pain. Now, what people incorrectly made the leap of is thinking, well, they're not experiencing pain. So everything's okay. That would be a logical fallacy. Because all those signals are still coming from the body, still hitting the spinal cord and having their impact there, all those injury signals. Because let's face it. When you do surgery, it's really nothing more than a controlled injury. Yes. And I just want to point out, and this shows you how long I haven't been in surgery. But 20 years ago, my recollection is an anesthesiologist was giving not just one medication, but several. Yes. So they were giving something like halothane, which to my understanding, we didn't know how it worked. Then do we have any idea how it works today? Better. We still are trying to unlock the whole consciousness aspect of things, but we're inching our way there. But it wasn't enough to give that. When I say we, the anesthesiologist still had to give, typically, unarchotic. They were still typically giving something like fentanyl, even though the patient was unconscious. They were also often giving in a music, so that they wouldn't have any recollection of what was going on. But of course, we all hear the horror stories of the patient and a paralytic on how to evolve it. Exactly. So you hear these horrible stories of the patient who is paralyzed, but somehow conscious, you can miss on this state sort of thing. But just to make sure I understand, in theory, a paralytic and an inhaled anesthetic should be sufficient to eliminate the perception of pain in a patient who is being cut. Yeah. Part of the challenge was, and now here, I'm starting to step outside of my wheelhouse, even though I was a member of the anesthesia tribe for a long time, is the levels of volatile gas anesthetic that you need to necessarily obliterate reflexes and full no-susceptive impulses would be so high that it would depress one's blood pressure. Got it. And so you augment that with an opioid. I understood like fentanyl, like morphing, like whatever, and you combine those together. And that's why what the anesthesiologist do is quite magical. Got it. So in other words, you give the inhaled anesthetic just to get unconsciousness, but not to fully suppress the no-susceptic system. Instead, you bring on the opioid to do the remainder of that work. They're working synergistically on the working at different mechanisms. Got it. And during that process, the patient is not feeling pain if they're unconscious because you do need a conscious working aware brain to feel pain. But all of the electrical impulses coming in from the body that are slamming into the spinal cord and the brain are open full bore. They're impenging on all those brain systems responsible for stress responses. So does that mean we are seeing a cortisol surge? We're seeing whatever one would expect a conscious person to experience with epinephrine, nor epinephrine cortisol, all these things still surging out in response to pain. Yes. And in response to no-susception. Independent of perception of pain. Right. And you notice that I'm trying to be precise in my language because sensor unconscious there's no pain, but there's plenty of no-susception. There are, deeply more than you would ever experience. I mean, if you think about what surgery, think about what we do in surgery, my God. Take a down-down gallopal. Yes. And then take an electric pottery and start burning tissue. Right. This is, I mean, there's no level of no-susception. You could ever experience like that while being awake unless you're in a burning car. Absolutely. That's exactly it. And it's remarkable through modern medicine that we get people through all this is a reflection of the advancements in surgery, advancements in anesthesiology, advancements in post-operative care. But it is no different than a controlled injury. It's done in a nice sterile environment, but it is a massive injury that people are undergoing. Yeah. And they're just not awake. And it's nice and clean and sterile. But there is a stress response associated with that most people recover well. What one of the hot topics of research these days is why do most people recover but a certain percentage of people go on to have persistent pain after surgery? That's an area that I used to research years ago. Many others are doing some great work in that space. Turns out that a lot of the factors we're going to get to this is what people bring to your operating room table, meaning early life events, levels of emotional health, cognitive health and everything else. So to answer your question and getting back to it, no, I don't believe there is the perception of pain without a conscious brain. And there's all sorts of nuances to that. Yeah. So let's go back to something you said at the outset from an evolutionary perspective, which is pain and pleasure have been the driving factors that have been the engine of natural selection. Yes. And but clearly those things have had to work in pre-conscious models. Yeah. So that means that whatever we're defining as pain there did not include a perception of pain. Yes. So what does that mean? That's where it gets muddy. And there's some art of people than I that would probably be more articulate. But I think this is why I think on first principles, you have to define the thing that you're talking about. When we typically talk about pain, we're talking about it from a uniquely human standpoint. Does a dog experience pain? Easier to accept. Easier to accept. I'm a dog person. I believe they experience pain. You move on down the evolution or at what point? Does a goldfish experience? Does a goldfish clearly experiences no deception? They clearly have all the classic withdrawal protection survival aspects of it. But what level is there a conscious brain that is translating it? And also on top of it, remember in our human definition of pain, we bake in it's an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Does a goldfish experience emotions? I you leave that to the goldfish experts. I you see how muddy it gets and you go down rabbit holes pretty quickly. Which is why I tend to stay with humans. Which is just for enough. Right away. So how does everything you just said differ or overlap with neuropathic pain? Or that sort of burning pain that I'm sure some people are familiar with. Certainly I was familiar with it for several years. Is that simply a subset of this? Are there various different types of pain that don't have a clear cause effect relation to tissue damage? Yeah. So we have different ways of categorizing pain putting it into different buckets if you will. One is no susceptive pain. And you'll note that that word no susceptive sounds very similar to no susceptors and it's by design. It means that it is pain caused by activation of primary no susceptors. Whether it be in your skin or soft tissues or an or viscera. And it tends to have certain qualities. It's very easy to localize. You know exactly where it is. It has a certain intensity that no susceptive pain tends to be time limited response well to short term use of analgesic agents. A seat of menophen and said it's Cox-2 inhibitors opioids and it tends to go away. And this is the kind of pain that occurs after typically acute injuries. You then have visceral pain which as a former general surgeon you understood this. This is due to activation of those primary no susceptors in our viscera. Now the dishference and why we bring up the distinction with visceral pain that is either in our thoracic viscera or abdominal or pelvic viscera is that the receptive fields that means where those no susceptors serve and what we perceive are very diffuse and wide. When you get a stomach ache you can't put your finger exactly where it hurts. You tend to put your whole hand over and say I'm kind of hurts here it's diffuse. That's because the brain the spinal cord brain have these diffuse receptive fields which expand the area. The viscera don't typically respond to the same type of stimuli that no susceptive pain does. You'll remember when you were taking a bovee to the bowel the small intestine patients wouldn't normally move because the no susceptors don't respond to that but if you tug on it if you pull that or inflate it or inflate it. Boyle boy blood pressure goes up heart rate goes up. Interesting characteristics with visceral pain is there's something called visceral somatic convergence meaning that the afferrence the information coming in from the gut from the thorax converge with the same sensory systems from the rest of our different parts of our body. So you may remember the old school adage C345 keeps the diaphragm alive. We all we all had these in med school. Well that means that the third fourth and fifth cervical nerve roots subserve our diaphragm which help us breathe. When the general surgeons or others are operating and they get blood under the diaphragm it irritates the diaphragm and what patients will typically complain of shoulder pain because the shoulder is subserved by the fourth and fifth cervical areas. And so when they had shoulder pain the answer wasn't you know something's wrong with their shoulder it's they had some irritation of blood under there. It's why when people have a heart attack pain radiates out into the arm because you've got the upper thoracic nerve subserving the heart that overlap with the nerves that go down your arm and the nervous system gets confused and that's how it's expressed. And if you like the neuroscience is it's all pretty cool if you're experiencing it not so cool. Let's get to neuropathic pain. And by the way, on visceral pain what is the response to treatments with respect to the way we saw in no septic pain where hey great response to these NSAIDs or opioids or whatever. Yeah, typical analgesics can be helpful but identifying visceral specific antinosis septic drugs is still an area of hot research. These days it's more about trying to identify the causes of visceral pain and you know reducing substances that are winding those no seceptors up. Neropathic pain another bucket. Neropathic pain means injury to either the peripheral or the central nervous system. The nerves out in the body it's either injury or dysfunction too. Nerves out in the body or the nervous system in your spinal quarter in your brain. Classic you know you get nerve injury from a trauma from surgery, classic qualities people describe burning sharp, lancinating stab and shock like. This is the kind of pain that some people tragically get after a thlamic stroke in their brain. You know, half their bodies just like terrible burning pain and just there's nothing going on out here. It's all central. This is the kind of pain that you get and you experienced with ridiculous pain and radicular pain means in this case injury to a nerve root coming out of your spine. It's this sharp radiating pain if you've got it in your lower back that radiates down and down your leg. Typically below your knee into your foot. This can be very challenging to treat with common analgesics. We tend to draw upon different categories of medications for this. These are broadly speaking anti-neropathic pain drugs. And here in our field we steal from everybody. There's only a few FDA approved medications for pain like a handful. So what we've learned to do is to steal borrow drugs from the neurologists, their anti-convulsions, their anti-seasure medications, the gabapentin voids, the taggera-talls and their derivatives. There are other anti-seasure medications because they tend to have mechanisms of action that also work on nerve pain. Gabapentin, I think you've had perhaps some experience with, turns out it's a lousy anti-seasure drug. Terrible. But it's a pretty good, you know, anti-neropathic drug. Four grams a day. Four grams a day. I was awfully drowsy though. You know who gets credit by the way for making, I give credit to making Gapapentin the blockbuster drug. George Clooney. How? Have you ever watched ER? Oh yeah. Yeah. He was a pediatric ER doc. That's right. Kid comes into the ER with a skateboarding injury. George Clooney puts the kid on Gabapentin. Now, where that had all started was a case report from a couple of ED docs who had noted by putting people on Gabapentin that they're acute paying up better. So I felt like beforehand when I was practicing medicine around the time I saw you practicing pain medicine that I'd look like a genius if I put somebody on Gabapentin because nobody heard of it. And then after that came out, floodgates open, primary care doc started using it now everybody's tried it. And it's a very safe medication. I have it like I should also make a mention when I'm talking about these meds or any treatments. I have zero industry relations with anybody. Nobody. I don't take any industry money. You can go look me up on open payments CMS, which is a public database. Okay. Neuropathic pain. There's another one. There's a new kid on the block called no C plastic pain. I don't know if this one is made much traction yet. This is a newly introduced category of pain, which is thought to represent dysfunction in the central pain processing system. And I'm not precisely defining it, but that's the just of it. It means that in the absence of identifiable peripheral cause, there is dysfunction in the brain in the spinal cord that is causing pain perpetuating an amplifying pain, no C plastic pain. And it has been tied in with conditions like fibromyalgia, temperament, dibular disorders, some aspects of chronic low back pain. Irrval bowel syndrome interstitial societies and more. It slowly started to get traction. So when we talk about pain, both to study it, but also ideally to treat it, we put them in these categories that we just described. Yeah, it was about to say before you gave your examples, I was going to say no C plastic pain must be a huge bucket because it's everything for which we don't understand one of the three. It's sort of the all-el spucket, which is enormous, especially for chronic pain, right? You're absolutely right. And I think the verdict is still out in the end. Does no C plastic pain stick around? Or is the problem that in these conditions that we associate with no C plastic pain, medical science hasn't caught up to identify a specific peripheral driver? I'm of the opinion it's that latter. Like I think we're going to find peripheral drivers for fibromyalgia. There's some controversy right now as to whether fibromyalgia represents a small fiber neuropathy. And just because we may not be able to identify a lesion doesn't mean that there's not something there. But as in all things, the truth will weigh out and we'll see how the story plays. There's no objective way to measure pain, correct? Oh, the last 15 years of my career has been spent on doing that very thing. And where do you think we are in that regard? Much further along than I ever would have predicted. So a large chunk of my research early on, my early research was in neuroimaging a pain. It was opening up windows into the brain to see where people were thinking, processing, perceiving, magnifying pain. And I spent much of that publishing work to understand the mechanisms of that. And we haven't yet actually finished our story of pain going up to the brain and what's going on. We'll get there. Over the years, I migrated into the space of developing objective biomarkers of pain. And it's one of those things where this is why I love working with young, smart people. I bet against it. I had some young grad students and others who said that they knew they thought they could do this. I told them how you would do it. And I said it won't work. And I'm going to pay you. I'm going to give you money to go scan people and you're going to learn how it doesn't work because failure is a great lesson in life. And they came back and they showed they could do it. And it was all through developing patterns in the brain and using machine learning models to then take that pattern, that signature, and be able to predict in other people whether they were experiencing pain. I didn't think we could do that because of the hugely individual nature of pain. It's so different from person to person. But it turns out that there are core patterns in the brain that represent that experience of pain. And so now with others. And sorry, you're capturing these through what modality, if I'm a functional magnetic resonance imaging. It is a standard MRI that people go into. But we do some fancy pulse sequences. We play some physics tricks where we can see where nerves the brain's being activated. And we've taken this. We and others have taken this from being able to determine whether somebody is in a state of pain to predicting their long-term trajectory. And we're working right now. Big grant that I have is to actually create composite multimelial biomarkers to predict their future state. We're getting there. So let's just start with standard understanding. If you put me into an FMRI machine and I said do you, hey guys, I'm not feeling any pain right now. I feel great. Yeah. And then you scan me. And then someone came out and took a hammer to my thumb. Yeah. And I went through the classic response that you described earlier. What would my FMRI show? Yeah. You would see, you'd see rather dramatic increases in activity in brain regions such as the thalamus, the posterior and solar cortex, the anterior singular cortex, through the dorsal anterior singular cortex. And a number of other distributed, a number of other areas. And to be clear, this is distinct from the part of my cortex that is the humongulous for my thumb. You would also see it in S1. Yeah. You right. And indeed, what we've learned through this, that there's no one single pain region in the brain. That's another mistake that was made along the way. We all thought we were going to find a brain region. Yeah. Then we could knock it out. Right. Just go cut it out. And it turns out that didn't work. And it's not one brain region that generates the experience of pain. It is a distributed network. It's all of these regions coming together and working in harmony doing what? Generating the experience of pain and then generating a typically a response to that. And let me be very clear because there was a lot of controversy when we and others initially published our papers. We are not trying to take away the autonomy of the patient and the self-report. I don't need an FMI to see a patient and know if they are pain. I can just ask them. And I can use self-report measures to get it. And I do that's another part of the research. Where we're working to build these objective markers, the subjectifying pain, is not to see what they're in now. But can it give us useful information to predict treatment to a particular therapy? Can we use it to predict their future state? Can we use it to predict their vulnerability to an injury or surgery? Those are things that just asking a patient right now. Probably not going to get there. I don't know if you want to go back to the brain. Let's leave. I'd start talking about it. I get a little tangent. Let's go back to the story of these four branches of pain or at least the first three and then kind of how they're how they're how they're periphery and how the sensory component is impacting the perception. Roll with that. Give me a little bit more. I want to build off at that. Okay. So we go back to no septic pain. Right. So tissue injury occurs. I think where I derailed this was in classifying all the different types of pain. But you had okay. Signal comes up. Right. Two signals coming up. The C-Fiber, the Adelto Fiber. The immediate responses to get you out of pain. Right. So that makes there's an evolutionary logic to that. Right. The C-Fiber is not there to get you out of pain because the Adelto did that is the C-Fiber there to remind you not to go back and do that again. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. That is basically your longer term harm alarm. That is saying, Peter, don't go back and do that again. Back in the cave, people days. It would remind you maybe it's best to sit in the cave and let the healing occurrence that is going out and fighting the woolly mammoth through the C-Fiber, Tiber. Tiber because if you fought the C-Fiber to Tiber when you're injured, you got eaten, you didn't get to pass your genes along. By the way, do we have any evidence Sean that there was enough genetic heterogeneity around this that there were 200,000 years ago. There were members of our tribe who simply didn't feel pain and therefore did not pass on their genes because they made poor decisions. Wow. That's a great question. One, I don't know. Two, there was undoubtedly genetic variations that led to behaviors, led to actions, that did not promote survival of the species. Nature takes care of that. Those people died out. I find it amazing to just sit around and dream about how much, how little convergence must have existed, a quarter of a million years ago, in terms of things that just ended up not being good for our species. Like, people who didn't experience pain the same way or didn't have certain filters within themselves. Lots of talk about people who couldn't socialize and how where we could evolve alone. If you didn't have the right set of genes that allowed you to at least be part of some sort of social tribes. Of course, we still probably have people today that have escaped. We clearly have some anti-social folks among us, but they're the exception and not the rule. Anyway, I just wondered if today we're much more homogenous in terms of what a human's response to pain is versus what it might have been. Probably. When you go back through some of the lower animal species, what happens when one of those animals gets injured in the wild? And again, I'm not a animal pain expert, but typically they're set off. They're ostracized. Those animals just die out. What do we do? We come together as a community and we help those people. We developed empathy for pain. I did some studies on that. And that is gotten hardwired into our brains to be able to recognize when people are in distress and pain and to reach out and help them. That was clearly beneficial to our species and conserved. And I also think about certain things like childbirth prior to any anesthetic was obviously brutal. Both in terms of the pain and the mortality. And yet there's no evidence that like people were deciding, maybe we not ought to do this. In other words, the drive for procreation somehow overcame what must have been brutal. Absolutely. And I got to tell you, hats off to have the population that are women, and the women that do this, I can't imagine. I don't want even go there. There is interesting, protective aspects during childbirth that doesn't take away necessarily the pain. But I think some of the estrogen, the estrogens, the estrodyles has not only an analgesic effect, but I sometimes just swear they don't seem to remember sometimes just how painful it was. And yet we do it again. Yeah, yeah. Those are the two things that I joke about with my friends, which is I still don't really understand how our species is here for two reasons. One, women had to continually go back to the world because remember if your reproductive rate isn't in excess of two, the species collapse. So on average, every woman must be able to do this. And back then it had to be reproductive rate of north of three. Right. Every woman had to do this three times. How she did it the second two times after how bad the first was, blows my mind. The second thing is just looking at how stupid adolescent males are, I'm sure you can relate to this. I was one. Yes, as was I. And I look at my boys. I don't understand why males all didn't die from just doing stupid stupid things before the age of 20 because, you know, I mean, even for the age of like 15. So it's like those two things are a miracle to our species. But all the males didn't die and that all the females were willing to have at least three kids. I repeatedly tell Beth that I sometimes wonder why I was not a Darwin award winner. If you had been read by the person. I remember the Darwin or the family. Well, link to them in the show notes, some of my favorites. We have these signals. I'm going to take these signals from the spinal cord because where it gets really interesting is when you take those eight altasy fibers you, you're in the spinal cord and there's a lot of process going on there that will come back to. And they had up to the brain and then they synapse connect in a large number of brain regions. One of the main one is the thalamus, which acts like Grand Central Station in the brain. It's taking lots of sensory input from different sources and it's sending it out to other areas. Some of those areas that we alluded to, the anterior singular cortex. Now, the anterior singular cortex, each of these brain regions has some functions associated with it. The anterior singular cortex is associated with some of the emotional aspects of pain or the unpleasantness of it. For the neuroscientists out there, I'm grossly oversimplifying things. The anterior singular cortex is also a salience detector, meaning it is taking those incoming inputs and its determining is something wrong here, is there an error because in essence our brains are prediction machines. Everything that we're doing, we're forming an expected pattern of what we're going to sense and we're making adjustments when I reach out for my cup. I know where it isn't space, I pick it up. If instead of cold water in that it's boiling hot water and I touch it, my brain is getting different signals and it was expecting that singular cortex as a salience detector is triggering and it's putting into action for me to withdraw. Other areas of the brain include the insular cortex, which lies on this little bit of the outer edge, it can be subdivided into multiple components, the posterior, mid and anterior insula. Let's just say that the back part of it is taking direct information in from the body. But then as you get more and more towards the front of the insula, it's integrating emotional and cognitive nuance to it. It is integrating in your emotional state, in what you're thinking. Now, there's also connections with your, your amygdala, this deep, primitive region of the brain involved with both threat detection as well as reward. And it's connected into the circuit and then also has outlay's into other areas that maybe we'll get to like the hippocampus and the stress response and onward. All that to say is all these regions connected together generate that experience of pain. And at this point in time, I really haven't done more than Renee DeCard has and telling the story because first pass, the brain is still remaining a passive receptacle just taking these inputs, where it gets interesting is we developed descending control systems that come down from the brain that converge in the spinal cord. And what they serve to do is turn down the signals that are heading up. Now, in part, this was first described by Ron Melzak and Patrick Wall and I think it was 1965, the gate control theory of pain. Brilliant, guys. Never had the pleasure meeting them, but, you know, they, they just did some in a work. And this gate control theory of pain, you know, posits that yes, you have afferent information coming in to the spinal cord, but the spinal cord is acting like a gate of opening and closing, turning up turning down pain. And it is altered by other fibers and systems from your brain. So let me give you an example to this. We, let's introduce another nerve fiber type, A beta. A beta fibers are your touch fibers. When you touch or stroke your skin, those get activated. When you stand up, and you stand on one leg, they're also responsible for position sense. They have a heavy coat of insulation around them and they are wicked fast. C fibers, one meter a second, a delta fibers, ten, a beta fibers, 100 meters a second. Fast. That's why you can dance. That's why you can walk because you got those fast reacting a beta fibers. Now, let's go back to your thumb, Peter. You just hit your thumb with a hammer. Sharp jolt of pango's to your brain. Got a little delay. Oh, damn. This is really going to hurt. Hot burning flooding sensation comes over your thumb. What is the next thing that you do? Everybody does this a little differently. Before or after swearing. There you go. A lot of people swear. So it's after swearing. You swear and then shake shake. Okay. You, you're a shaker. Some people or squeeze. Squeeze. Rock some will change. Yeah. You squeeze. You shake it. Sometimes you run on underwater. What are you doing when you're squeezing it and shaking it? Sometimes trying to create a distraction. Okay. Sometimes, though, probably illogical trying to keep whatever humor is in there that's hurting. I salated like a turn at kit. Right. Right. Obviously, if I'm using cold, especially if it's one of my kids that hurt themselves will put cold on, hoping to anesthetize the area, presumably slow the circulation, take down the swelling. Yeah. That's beautiful. And you're talking about longer term things, which are all perfect. Because cold does those things and also cold, by the way, reduces action potential velocities and firing in those adult to the C fibers. But what you're doing most of all when you rub it, you're activating a beta fibers. You're actually not influencing much your A delta or C fibers. Those noces have to fibers. Not really impacting it there. That horse left the barn. That horse left the barn. And that horse is, you got horses still running out the barn. You're, you can squeeze all your wand for the time being and the horses are still head now. And hitting your spinal cord, but where things get interesting is the A beta fibers as touch fibers. They're coming into a slightly different area of your spinal cord and they're sending over projections into where those noceseptive fibers are in your spinal cord. And they have an inhibitory role. That's the take-home message. So the A beta fibers are inhibiting the signals coming in from where you're thumb with a hammer and preventing them from going to your brain. It's a beautiful example of neuromodulation. You're doing your own neuromodulation with that. And we're all hardwired to do that thing. And there's a medical device that takes advantage of that. You're familiar with the 10s unit. Yeah. 10s is T. E. N. S. Transcutaneous Electrical Neural Stimulation. Now, what 10s frequently, what it originally did, there's been modifications of it, is when you turn on the, what you do with the 10s, I know you know this is typically little black pads that you put over the area that hurts. You put an electrical stimulation through these pads. They're activating a beta fibers. And so you do them over here and it's having a neuromodulatory effect back in the and the spinal cord. Pretty cool when it works. And how do you predict patient comes to you and they're experiencing some pain? What are the, what are the clues that would tell you? I think 10s is going to be successful. In other words, I think that activating a beta fibers is going to be a tool that will reduce your perception of pain. Because that's what we're doing. Everything that you do is how do I reduce your perception of pain? I can't take, I can't necessarily take away. I mean, if they have an injury that needs to be resolved, they shouldn't be seeing you. They should be seeing the surgeon or whoever fixes the physical injury, right? In short, yes, I would just build on that that would say my job, our job as pain docs is to help reduce the pain and help them down a path of functional rehabilitation. So absent that second piece, I typically fail. You know, I'm leading them down a road of functional rehabilitation, which involves physical, psychological, social, emotional health. All things you talked about beautifully in your book. So who is the, I hate to use the word poster child, but who's the patient that when you see them, your intuition says, 10s is going to really work for this person? Somebody with, I think, more, it's no susceptible musculoskeletal pain. I tend to think of somebody for whom 10s is more likely to work. Something that has more of a classic no susceptible type of pain problem. Beyond that, it's Peter, it's a trial and error. And that's part of the frustration and pain management and in healthcare in general is the lack of a precision approach. And the very frustrating laborious trial and error process until we get something that works. So we talked about the gate control. We talked about tens. Can I put a bow on the gate control thing to make sure I understood it? Yeah. Because we, it seems like a very important idea, but I also think I might be missing the juice. Is the idea that 10 people could experience the exact same peripheral injury. If you could map the, um, the action potentials, they would look identical. You could even see identical perceptions, but they have, they could have 10 different gating channels within the spinal cord and therefore perceive pain differently. I just want to make sure I've captured with the gating theory states. You are right. You're right with that individual, um, variability in pain. We haven't talked about the brains role in the gate control, which we're going to get to, but just getting to your question. There's been some elegant studies. Guy name Kim years ago, um, did a beautiful study where he applied a 48 degree Celsius stimulus to 500 people. 48 degree Celsius. I think it's a 121 degree Fahrenheit. Somebody will look it up. And you apply it to the, um, the arm, the hand. And then ask what your pain score. And what he found was a perfect distribution of people who said, not the same people. Ain't nothing. And then they had that's like 0 1 out of 10. Someone like, that's a little playful 2 or 3. And others were like, uh, a little more modern, 4 or 5, 6. And you got all the way up to some people saying, oh my God, you're burning me. You're burning me. Take that off immediately. 10 out of 10. I do the same thing in a medical school demonstration. I can't call an experiment because I'm not getting IRB. But when I teach the neuroscience class around paying, um, I bring in an circulating ice water bath. It's um, and you want it to circulate because if you just stick your hand and leave it in still, you get a boundary. It's warmer. Yep. So it's circulating ice water bath. And I asked them to dip their arm in for 15 seconds. Pull it out, whisper and a research assistance here, what their pain score was. We tabulate that all up and at the end of the class, I show the medical students. And it looks just like that line I showed you, I mentioned to you before. You got some people in the class who say, I keep my hand in their all day. And there was others where like, oh my God, I couldn't even keep it in their all. 10 out of 10. The whole point of that is to drive home one of the key messages in our discussion. The amount of stimulus or no seception may have little to nothing to do with your experience of pain and why that is so important for healthcare professionals to understand is because for so long we have projected our own experiences onto everybody else. So here's another experiment that you won't be able to do unless you get to teach this class on multiple days. But it's to go one step further, which is to do the same thing every day and see how they compare their score from day to day. I'll tell you my experience with that. I do love to use a cold plunge. Okay. So my cold plunge is at 42 degrees with circulating water. So I don't know what that makes it feel like, but it feels like it's somewhere in the 30s. There are days when I can spend 10 minutes in there and feel like nothing is wrong. There are days when I'm not kidding. 30 seconds in my ankles hurt so bad. I want to scream. Yeah. And I think what's different? Like it can't be the circulation in my ankles is better one day to the next. There are relatively a vascular part of my body. Why is it that one day? I can spend 10 minutes and not know I'm in this water. I mean, I know that I'm cold, but it's more like my core temp. But my joints don't hurt. Yeah. And on another day, the throbbing in my joints feels like somebody's hitting them with a hammer. And I'm the same person. So in other words, I, your point is well taken, but I would say there's a second dimension to it, which is even as individuals we can experience things differently from day to day. You're absolutely right. And maybe that's a good opportunity to build on that and introduce more of the brain. So we've talked about the functions of the brain. The antirus, a single core text, being some of the more emotional as primary, somatosensory cortex, the humongulous being more sensory. The insular cortex has an introsceptive state. It's like our internal awareness of our bodily state. We talked about the amygdala. Now let's introduce also the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex, the big thinking part of our brain up here, both the ventramedial and the dorsal lateral, play a key role in our modulation, our cognitive control of pain. And these systems, the prefrontal cortex, the antirinsular cortex, the insular cortex, the single cortex, all have those descending projections back down to the spinal cord. So we talked about the gate control theory of pain in the context of rubbing your finger out here, a peripheral neuromodulation where it really comes into play is when you introduce brain systems, the brain and your emotions, your cognitions, your beliefs, your early history, and that influence on pain. That's where it gets really exciting. And that's sending descending pathways down. So I would argue in part that your experience of cold water in that moment may have been driven in large part by your mental state before you got in. And maybe we'll talk more about the intersection of sleep and pain, but huge research in that space. Your state of anxiety apprehension around this, your all sorts of cognitive emotional aspects way into your experience of pain. And yes, there's also circadian rhythm aspects related to this from hour to hour fluctuations, but those individual differences are fascinating. And that is also an area that our group and others are lab and others are going into is recognizing that one pain score averaged over a week may not give us a lot of information that we need to take into account the within subject, the within person daily variations over time and model that. Now, there seems to be kind of like, I guess I should ask this because I don't know not asserting this is the case. Is there kind of a moral judgment that comes to this at some level like don't we as a society just tend to look more favorably at people that have a very high pain tolerance? So when you go through that experiment you just did with the medical students. If everybody's being brutally honest aren't they kind of looking at the people who score 0, 1, 2, more favorably than those that score 8, 9, and 10? Absolutely. Why do you think that is? Because that's what I'm being truthful I do it. Yeah, that's what society values. That's that was my home life growing up. That's what my father expected. I can't even very working class, you know my father had 12 brothers and sisters fighting for whatever scraps of food and he brought that into my world, our world as kids and you just suck it up and deal with it. And my father had back pain later in life and he would never talk about it would never ask my opinion and when I offered my opinion he would never follow it. Had bad consequences in the end but we value that. That is just the way our society is. Is that a male thing exclusively? I think you need to get some women on the show and ask them. I think I think it crosses actually I do think there is a masculinity aspect so that and I think I could be wrong here. I think that thing is also attractive for women. I think there's a certain attractiveness because that person may be more likely to be a good provider than somebody who is weak and sensitive. But you know we're getting a little out of my wheelhouse on that but you're you're you're absolutely right. I just think it's like a compatibility thing like I know when I do that type of an exercise compared to others. I tend to just feel less pain. I also know my wife does as well. So I almost wonder if that's a compatibility like we both just have a high threshold for that when we're exercising when we're doing anything even recreationally that doesn't matter. My partner might be on say we're now engaged. Is a professor at Stanford, Beth Darnell and she's an ex-altramarathon runner. And I've always admired the fact that she can sit there in front of a computer or work on something untold hours and not move. And I'd ask her like and she's just like listen I was really good with running with a pebble in my shoe putting one foot after another and just work in my way through it. And I similarly grew up in an environment where you know you learn to be tough and you learn to power through life-set-versities. So what is the consequence of this? So we're acknowledging that it is an attractive trait. Yeah. You have a high tolerance of pain. Yeah. Society rewards it and yet by definition as a significant subset of the part of the population call it a third, call it a quarter if it's a normally distributed function. Yeah. Are going to be a standard deviation on the other side? Right. They're going to be in the they're going to be on the side where hey they're relative to people who have a high tolerance of pain. These are people who are going to really perceive pain. And if we just did this through the lens of the responsibility of the medical community, there's a pretty significant consequence to that. Right. Indeed. Now as with all things it gets a little bit more nuanced. We talked about cold for instance. It turns out that some of the sensitivities are modalities specific. So just because you have a high threshold for cold, you could completely flip it on hot or pressure or pin prick or whatever the other modality is. As somebody who runs a pain lab, I've had everything done to me imaginable. I take heat really well. My son Ian takes heat really well. I've had these thermal devices on me where I've been there and ended up with second degree burns to find my seven out of ten. I hate the cold. I hate the cold. I'm a worse one. It comes to the cold. So I live in California. That's why I lived in Arizona. I think there are genetic aspects of this. So we have to be mindful modality specific on top of it. These experimental protocols probably have little bearing on somebody's experience of chronic pain. I was going to say, is there any way to put together a set of experimental lab versions of this to basically generate predictive models of how people will respond to real world pain. And I think where you're going with chronic pain is even more relevant. So for example, why do some people have a discarnieation that leads to manageable pain whereas for others the exact same injury by every metric available to us produces a totally different set of consequences. And what do we do about that? And because this is now where we move out of that decartion model, we appreciate the role of the brain and its modular theory capacity. It's ability to turn the amplifier down. And so if you're thinking about a stereo amplifier, we talked about how some people to a certain stimulus might be a zero or one on the dial, some might be a ten. But what we didn't talk about are people's capacity to now manage their pain cope with their pain. Their level of self-efficacy around their pain athletes learn how to manage their pain and suffering. Where they run into problems is when the sports are over, they're retired. That's when I see them. So there are many factors that predict how well somebody is going to do with chronic pain. They align with a lot of the stuff in your book. So, you know, there's the level of person's self-appacacy plays a role. There is the presence or absence of whether they've got underlying depression, anger, anxiety, something called catastrophizing, terrible word, very important concept, probably one of the most predictive of amplified pain. What about other things you talked about sleep deprivation, any other physical things, exercising, not exercising, insulin resistance, not insulin resistance, type of like what are the other things that might factor in this? Yes, yes, one of the biggest predictors of diabetic neuropathic pain is glucose control. So, you know, one of the first things we do, if we have a person with diabetic neuropathy, which the diabetes, the high blood sugar, as you know much better than I, causes injury to those no susceptible fibers. And also causes injury to the abata inhibitory fibers. And so, we, that correlates with glucose control by way of example, diet plays a role because if you're eating things that are causing inflammation, we didn't talk about all of the stuff that amplifies or winds up those peripheral nociceptors. We treated those as a static thing when they're not. They're dynamic. So, in the face of inflammation, that causes something called peripheral sensitization. You've turned up the amplifier on that nociceptor in the periphery. Sleep, as alluded huge topic. How much sleep deprivation does one need for for there to be an increase in pain perception? Oh, well, let me listen. We're both out of residency long enough, but we both pulled our old nighters. How did you feel the next day? I felt awful, but there's, you know, there's interesting that you felt worst between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. and then you get this second wind, usually about the time you're operating. Right. And then you usually feel pretty good. Okay. But overall, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a haze. It's a haze and you're just powering your way through it. And if you think about it, you know, you kind of feel in a little achy all over. Now, it's not that because a lack of sleep, something is changed in your muscles. At least I don't, I don't think there's good evidence for that. What is changed is your set point and your brain and your spinal cord for the perception of pain. You feel like crap. Now, imagine if you're doing that day after day after day and not getting sleep, that really messes up your central nervous system and that modulation around pain. What happens is that changes your set point and it impairs that prefrontal cortex and its ability to modulate pain. When you went through a Peter, your bad episode of backpain did it impact your sleep? Yeah, for sure. You're human. That impact on sleep, ultimately further amplified your pain. On top of it, did you, how did you feel during that? I now decide the pain. How was that affecting, how was that affecting your overall life and your thoughts and your emotions? Total disaster. In what way? Well, I mean, look, there's so much going on. I mean, I'm happy to tell my story because it's a great introduction to kind of the work you've done. So for folks that haven't heard it and I've shared this before and we were talking before the podcast, I don't remember how much of this is in the book because at one point I wrote all of this out. I'm pretty sure much of it got cut out. But when I was in my third year of medical student, I was having just a great old day, wrote my bike to the gym. It was just about to go into the gym and I got off the bike and I feel a pain in my back like I've never felt before and it was enough that I decided not to work out which says something because I would have worked out through any amount of discomfort. I limped home, laid down and said, you know what, I'm just going to sleep this off and tomorrow we find tomorrow it wasn't fine. I was in so much pain I couldn't get out of bed. I had actually called my roommate. We had separate phones in the same house to come and get me up and out of bed. In the next two weeks proceeded to be a really unbearable episode where I was doing an ICU rotation and you know, this is back in the Wild West where I think the nurses and the residents were just shooting me up with Tordall every day, nonstop, getting me through the day. But the nights were brutal and what I now realized happened was I'd had a really significant herniation, a piece of that L5S1 disc broke off. I would later find out it was a five centimeter piece and it had extruded broken off. Was sitting on the S1 nerve route. Every night now I was going to pain, going to bed, feeling as though the skin on the bottom of my foot was being ripped off. So the the only way I could sleep was to put my bag my foot into a bag of ice and take some amount of benedrel that was enough to knock me out. This went on for about another week until the Dean of Students saw me limping along and said, hey Peter what's going on, I told him this was a Sunday afternoon I was studying. He took me directly to the ER. Got an MRI, showed all of this mess the next day I had surgery. As I've talked about in the past, everything went wrong in a series of surgeries and fast forward three months, three trips to the operating room, multiple disc Activis, Laminatimis, multiple levels in theory my bag should be fine. I'm anything but fine. I now have a new pain but this is unlike anything that was related to my back. This is where you come in. I now have a pain that is so significant and it sounds grotesque to explain it but this is all it was. It felt like someone was reaching in my body from my kidneys into my groin and tearing my testicles out from the inside of my body. So needless to say I was out of commission, I did not move. I laid on a floor 247 and to your point, how did I feel? Well, it wasn't just that I was in so much pain that I couldn't do anything. It was I watched my life disappear. So it went from you're not going to graduate from medical school on time to you're not going to get to do a sub-internship in surgery to you're not going to be a surgeon to you're never going to walk again. So by that point, the overlap was how were the opioids that I was being prescribed to control the pain tripping into. These are a tool to numb me to this entire experience. So at this point I've talked about this in the past. At this point I was taking over, I think I was up to maybe 320 milligrams of oxycon in a day which is kind of amazing because if you and I took that today, if you and I split that right now we would die. So that I'm you know that I'm mainlining 320 milligrams of oxycon in a day just to you know blunt the emotional pain of this. I think says what we need to know we can come back to the story of how I met you and what how my life turned around from that point and it's still a miracle for me to believe I actually graduated from medical school on time despite that all happening now into my fourth year because this was my third year bleeding into my fourth year of medical school when all this was going on. It's kind of amazing. A difficult time. Third year's tough. But anyway so we'll come back to the what happened but that's a long answer to a question which is at some point it wasn't even about the pain. The pain was unbearable but it wasn't the most unbearable part. It was the expectation of what that pain meant for the rest of my life that became much more unbearable. It's a terrible story and I have to imagine one that is probably shaped you moving forward and you know how to begin packed on your life and what you've been doing. I call it the best worst experience of my life. Yeah. More and more best today. The gratitude I have for that is I mean I wouldn't want to do it again but it has been such a positive impact on my life. Yeah well I hope we can come back to that and talk about it more in the influence of all this other stuff that was probably contributing to your experience of pain and the bad stuff going on is a consequence of it and plays a role in like everybody else's life out there and I think there's some key messages there. What would you like to segue to? Before we go into kind of like the ins and outs of what pain doctors can do. Yeah. Let's just talk about some of the bread and butter stuff on pharmacology. Yeah. Right. So how can we navigate our way through what NSAIDs do, what opioids do, what COX2 inhibitors do, what should people be aware of in using these things? Obviously opioids are a remarkably controversial topic but there's probably a nuance to it that's missing from the broader discussion. But why don't we start with a softball like NSAIDs? How do they work? Everybody's heard of Adville, you know, leave nepox and all of these things. Sure. So these medications are psychological oxygenase inhibitors they reduce prostate glandens they reduce what they do is a couple of things. They reduce some of the inflammation their anti-inflammatories. So I was alluding very briefly that there are substances that can be released out in the periphery during injury that wind up that that no seceptor and amplified. Prostiglandins histamine cytokines, interlucons, all of that. This inflammatory soup that occurs after every single surgery, every single injury that we experience. You get this inflammatory soup and it's classically meditated by swelling, redness, temperature increases. And aspirin and a cox to an hip or n-seds do a nice job in reducing that inflammation. Now this is where medical science, you're going to probably be much more informed of me informed than I am on this but medical science has been slowly shifting in its view with this. We have historically thought take these medications in an acute injury, it knocks down that inflammation and all is well and good. Well some of the data was coming out in the orthopedic literature decades ago that people who were taking NSAIDs during total joint replacements were getting non-fusion of that joint to the bone. They were getting failures and then more recently there's been some question as to whether knocking down the inflammation is a good thing after all that maybe that inflammation is part of the healing process and that by giving an NSAID aspirin were delaying the natural healing effect and causing more problems. So where's the truth? This is tough. One I don't think we have the whole story yet on the NSAIDs. Two I'm a gray guy meaning I don't live in black and white and I'm also appreciated the every medical field has their own lens that they look at in the world and I think we have to appreciate the complexity of the patient meaning if it's perhaps something minor and they can get by without the NSAID and it's not going to change significantly the level of function then maybe not taking it will improve healing. They can't get out of bed they can't go to work but an naperson helps them to do that thing so that they can engage with their family with their friends with work while then heck yes take the NSAID. You know if it's if it's helping with that level of functional improvement. Now are you talking about this through the lens of a acute pain or only through the lens of chronic pain at this point? A little both but I think through chronic pain we start to introduce all the broader the longer term negative consequences of this you know impact on blood pressure your heart impact on your kidneys with long term NSAIDs particularly if you're older. I remember I think it was in your book you took Viox. Yes. I loved Viox. I did too and I still remember the day in oh god it must have been December 2001 when the FDA came down and said no more Viox when I looked at my last bottle and I was like oh god no. I stockpiled it. I wish I did. I called up all the drug reps I knew because they couldn't like give it out and I'm like can you just hook me up and so I ran out of stockpile of that for a long time and you know this is another classic thing if you you could cut this if it's too tangential but you know every field looks at the problem through their own lens here you had a drug that was causing heart attacks. Well I mean in the world's most susceptible individuals at a relatively small absolute rate. I have a whole high-risk discussion with Eric Topel who's like mistake negative. That's right. Absolutely. Net negative. So yeah because I've always won works. It's faulted they should have been much more transparent about this. Yeah put a black box label on it and we should all still have access to it. That's used in the 50 milligrams use the 25s and you're right don't give it in susceptible people and I think it's a classic again. Yeah they've got thrown out with the bathroom. That's right. And it's a you know it's a lot we all do this we look at the world or our own particular field. It's like with the latest blood pressure guidelines the cardiologists want it really low but it screws up the kidneys and well the cardiologists say you know save the heart screw the kidney. So yeah a great drug wish it was still around. Why do you think there hasn't been any drug that's come close to that like celibrex is a joke like none of the none of the drugs that are in the extra had a valedacoxib I think it was a little bit close but I think if I remember it had a Steven's Johnson a bad rash with terrible consequence I think the drug companies get scared of the lawsuits. So NSA's new ones around taking the version you have a version on dose I mean do you say 800 milligrams of a C of ibuprofen TID three times a day 2400 milligrams would be you would tolerate that for how many days if a person needed it. Yeah you know week to two weeks on that make sure you read it's food in the stomach fluids if you're either older you've got kidney issues you've got GI issues talked to your doc first you know don't just go into this stuff blindly. Yeah it is interesting that we can buy acedimenofin and ibuprofen over the counter and yet they can cause a ton of damage if not taken correctly. I mean the ERs see people with a acedimenofin Tylenol overdoses and you know cause of well you know let's see it here. Now let's talk about acedimenofin for a while when I last tried to understand it there is no clue as to how it worked. Do we to this to this day do we understand how it works? minimally more information and I haven't in full disclosure haven't read up on it a lot I know it has some cyclo oxygenase one impact a lot of it is thought to be central. I haven't tracked it much beyond that. I saw some interesting the side studies where it seems to have some impact in the brain around emotional modulation and so there's a degree of emotional blunting on acedimenofin. Now whether it translates into a real world or if it's just an experimental manipulation I don't know but but there's a nice synergy with acedimenofin and ibuprofen because different mechanism of action different organ systems are impacted so you can take less of each when you combine them. What's your take on that? I think you just set it Peter. I mean you set it beautifully. I use those in combination to get the two for to get that synergy the one plus one is not two but three. So you can take Tylenol historically we would say up to four grams a day. More recently there's been some push to try to reduce that to two grams a day. Clearly if you've got liver dysfunction if you are drinking large amounts of alcohol less. Yeah my go to stack if I am actually in pain like if I'm having like a year ago I had I had to get a crown replaced or sorry I had to get a crown put on a tooth that had an old feeling that broke and it's the funniest thing because of how remarkable the teeth are at sensation but the crown was a little too high okay so what's the impact of that that meant every time I took a bite that one tooth was bearing the brunt of it it was the last tooth I had but right in front of my wisdom tooth and I'm talking to my dentist and he's like yeah Peter it's just too high just come in and let me shave a little bit of it off well I didn't have the time to go in so for two months I did not go in to get this thing shaved off the pain was this is how stupid I am like I couldn't spare the two hours to go to the dentist in a and he was willing to see me nights and weekends this is the most accommodating dentist in the world everybody should have that kind of dentist Tony Pachaco I can't say enough about him and and yet I couldn't make the time so for two months the pain got so bad that I eventually couldn't chew on that side at all so my point is I had to be taking something to get through the day and the stack that worked was 400 of Advil 500 of Tylenol three times a day okay so care me now let me ask you does I be a pro from work better for you than an a person I don't know but the reason I prefer it is that I can line up the dosing with the Obsita menifin because I believe an a person you only take once a day right twice a day okay you're right yeah I wanted something where I could do a T ID instead of BID sure it raised an I ask is I find huge individual variability in response is to NSAIDs okay napper sin works beautifully for me at 500 twice a day I'd be proven not so good at at what dose a 800 three times a day wow yeah with food and water are there types of pains people should be thinking of where these things work especially well and other areas where yeah that's just not going to have much efficacy I don't find it as effective in neuropathic pain it might take a little bit of the edge off no susceptible pain typically as you go to your kind of your no susceptible or your no susceptible inflammatory pain the kind of pain you'd see in a joint those are your typical go to forms of back pain particularly you know in acute situations but also somewhat in chronic and you know I get a lot of patients it's say yeah that didn't do it for me but if you inquire and ask questions you find maybe it knocked it off a little because in our game we're trying to knock off pieces and pieces and pieces of their pain experience the issues with the different responses are very individually based and I think in part it has to do with a little bit what we call pharmacokinetics or where the drug is getting and different NSAIDs confirming a different tissues at different rates so you're saying it maybe we should be empirical in other words try the neproxin try the ibuprofen figure out which one works obviously don't take them together obviously don't take them together the bit your take on messages spot on do you have a concern with people taking a seat of benefit and consuming alcohol do you tell people to refrain from alcohol when they're taking time on all I tell them no more that I I just set a conservabilis and don't do more than like a drink a day you know is that the right amount I don't know but if I tell them one drink a day they'll go do two and they're probably still okay with with that and then I am looking in their chart just to make sure they're not drinking for a or and there's liver issues what are you doing I typically when I'm taking a suit of benefit and I don't drink much anyway I'm probably going to have four drinks in a week so meaning four days a week I will have a drink for three days a week but if I am taking time on all I'm just going to refrain again I don't have any evidence to suggest that that's necessary but it's probably the same it's the precautionary principle it's finest okay I want to talk about muscle relaxants so the other thing that has been a real favorite tool of mine is backlifin now it's not a particularly potent muscle relaxant but it seems to for me and for the patience of mine and whom it works offer something that something really potent like volume doesn't bring all the baggage of of of a benzophe or even a flexural where you can kind of get the drowsiness and frankly a lot of people just I mean I used to even get nauseous on flexural okay but something about backlifin I don't even know it's in me the 20 milligrams twice a day but it actually takes the edge off and where I typically find this beneficial is if I slept wrong and I get a kink in my trap or I've been on a super long drive and my QL sort of flare a little bit and I know that if I had all the time in the world I could go and stretch my way out of that but sometimes I just don't have that time and I need to kind of get right back to doing something awful like sitting and just you know two or three days of 20 milligrams of backlifin BID with a little end said and like I'm as good as new and I save myself the you know the real flare up so what what are you experience with muscle relaxins beautiful case example by the way if you're self of how we would use those backlifin's one of the safest to use it is not habit forming like the somas and others that can be like a barberture a can act and people can get highly psychologically dependent on them the flexorals have a anti-have a try cyclic anti-depressant property about them that may sometimes be helpful for people in various mixed main states but also can cause sedation the backlifin seems to be pretty benign we don't typically use muscle relaxins for long term chronic conditions the data hasn't born out now with that said so how many days are you comfortable with a person I'm comfortable with a person being a backlifin all their life to be okay yeah it's just everything I'm doing I know I'm forgive me if I'm preaching to the choir here everything I'm doing is taken in the context of the person in front of me and the cost and benefit of the treatments I'm providing them meaning there are costs with backlifin I don't mean monetary cost it can cost sedation what doses typically or is it just individual like I think it's it's individual and obviously it is dose dependent the higher doses more sedation we can use backlifin intratheically we put in intratheical pumps for backlifin this is a beautiful life-saving minimal surgery that we do for people with spinal cord injury and tractable spasticity because to get the spasms under control with oral doses you just can't get there so we put thread a little catheter into the CSF and we deliver backlifin that way now it again is a clean relatively relatively safe medication but I'm always evaluating long term is this person getting benefit from this should we be talking about dialing it back and trying to win and if they're not getting benefit then why should they stay on the medication and I know you do the same types of things in your practice so we use it we can use it in cute subacute we'll use it in some chronic conditions as a trial what's a trial month two months okay and then we monitor data on every single person and what dose are you comfortable up to 20 milligrams three times a day yeah up to 80 milligrams I believe is kind of the upper end I don't usually get there okay you alluded to nirontan earlier yeah and you alluded to the fact that it played a role in my recovery because once we got the big stuff out of the way I still had a couple of years of peripheral nerve injury and the only way to put the fire out in my foot was nirontan and unfortunately it was initially it required four grams a day I was taking a gram four times a day or something like that and the good news is it worked the bad news is you're pretty much always tired so I was very happy over time to get that dose down and I think within 18 months I was completely off the nirontan and low and behold never experienced although interestingly maybe once every year I get like an enormous surge of fire into that same foot literally one shot of flame that lasts seconds and it's gone but if essentially never again right is nirontan still a very powerful tool in the use of niropathic pain you alluded to other drugs like antidepressants as well in addition to a rather impotent antisysium ed but yeah what else what else do you have at your disposal for this type of pain the beauty of nirontan or gabapentan and it's cousin pre-gablin which was introduced immediately after gabapentan's patent ran out so conveniently very convenient lately both have the same mechanism of action they work on the altitude delta subunit of a calcium channel in the spinal cord in the brain that's a little too jargoning and technical but think of them as agents that turn down the signals that are in the spinal cord being processed and in the brain so the really not impacting your nir about how here or in your leg um they can be very effective the beauty of these two drugs is uh there's no lethal dose like the only way they could kill the rats when they were studying it was to drown them in it yeah I used to say or hit them over the head with the tablets and I would tell a patient somewhat jokingly the only way you can be hurt taking the drugs if you're struck by a truck that's carrying it um it's a little bit more nuance than that because there are side effects yep you can fall asleep driving you can fall asleep driving I tell people don't operate having machinery don't go you know doom buggy riding don't blah blah blah there is an elderly patient in particular uh I warn them about falls because you can get a little unstable now pre-gablin can also lead to weight gain right doesn't it also increase the appetite both well it's more I see water retention I see a little peripheral edema in both and they also both enhance sleep especially pre-gablin and so there's there's a little bit of an added benefit to patients who are using these to also put the pain out at night when it can be most noticeable um there was actually a study I don't know if I'll ever be able to find it it was sent to me that actually suggested pre-gablin didn't just make you drowsy which was obvious but but also promoted appropriate sleep architecture I don't know the data on the sleep architecture and that would be something I'd be putting out to you or some of the sleep experts um I have uh I have taken it uh after surgery and uh I find that it makes me sedated I don't find the quality of the sleep I mean I can be totally wrong on that but no well we both can be a good experience that's it that's it it could just simply be my experience the truth is uh I do tend to when I dose it I'll dose lower in the day and then I'll wall up a little harder at night for the very reason so let's imagine gabapentin you know maybe in the day 300 300 600 at night and I'm trying to tie trade that so that one it helps some sleep because you brought up an incredibly important point which is during the day we've got all these modular toy things we can do around our pain distraction for instance other coping strategies at night you're just trying to get into this relaxed state and that is the worst time for somebody with chronic pain and so the gabapentin and sometimes other agents can help with that so yeah I do use it to help people sleep no lethal dose uh max is out and around 900 to 1000 milligrams that it does because it's it's taken up by an active transport system in the small intestine once you take more than about a thousand milligrams the rest of it just passed out your backside pre-gablin is different it has a what's called a linear kinetic profile simply meaning the more you take the more the gets in your system so the only times I will typically switch somebody from a gabapentin if they're getting benefit is when they've maxed out the dose they're getting benefit but there's no point in giving a moral switch to pre-gablin where I can drive more into their system and again you're using these for the most recalcitrant neuropathic pain typically I'm using these for the most recalcitrant pain in general so that's an important point while I can speak to parioperative pain acute pain subacute pain chronic pain Stanford we tend to see we're a tertiary referral center I tend to see we see people after they've seen everybody else and so by definition what's it we didn't even do this I'm sorry we didn't define chronic pain but how would you put a definition on that there's various definitions something like to put a time frame on it which I think many of us believe is a little artificial it's not three months or six months it is pain persists beyond the expected time of tissue healing so it is nuanced it's context specific meaning if you have an angle no herni repair or a prosthetectomy which you know should heal up pretty quickly and your pain should go away pretty quickly but if you've got pain after couple a few months that's starting to get to that point where I'm a little worried something's going on from a chronic pain but if you had a total knee replacement that is a massive massive surgery and you're gonna have pain for quite some time so I wouldn't call that I wouldn't call cronicity for a total knee right makes I'm okay okay okay context specific this gets into also some of the whole issue around opioid prescribing and these rigid time frames for surgery and and what have you but persistence beyond the time of expected tissue healing antidepressants in their role in pain management yeah these are cradably effective agents not necessarily for their antidepressive properties they frequently work through modulating a couple neurotransmitters serotonin and noroprenephrine and to varying extent we find that the classic what we refer to as SSRIs a serotonin the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors haven't been as effective for pain as the older dirty drugs of the tricyclic antidepressants we call them dirty which simply means they act at multiple receptors they hit multiple systems so these tricyclics hit the serotonin and noroprenephrine systems and then they also happen to be pretty potent sodium channel blockers why the sodium channel blocking property is important is when we talked earlier about the peripheral nerves one of the main drivers of an action potential is activity around the sodium channels you block the sodium channels the action potential stops remember how much you gave me of how much sodium that's very how much light it can back then I hope I hope it wasn't toxic uh we'll come back to the story it's pretty funny I'm looking forward to which which TCA's are the are the popular ones everybody dot you know there's I think there's about nine what are your top two or three yeah that's the thing we all get comfortable with our top two or three of any class and so minds it might go to his disciplinary nortriptoline and amitriptoline um they're broken up into different categories based on mainly side effect profiles so the a treanor triptoline what was it um amitriptoline or yep yep so elevals an older trice cyclic that has a lot of histamine release a lot of sedating properties I would never give that to an older guy with a big prostate because he couldn't pee and he'll be very angry with me I will never give that to a young woman who's looking to watch her wait because she's gonna get the munchies and she's gonna put on 10 or 20 pounds and she's gonna hate me have I had that happen yes and I still embarrassed to this day um but if I have some is it offset by GOP one agonists in the modern era oh you know this was 20 I learned my lessons I haven't I haven't run that experiment that's a great idea but I typically use the amitriptoline when I need some sedating help at night for sleep and pain because a dual the dual action I like the disciper mean because it has less of that histum that sedating property and I'll tend to go to that and the nor triptoline and you can titrate blood levels for instance like the nor triptoline and those drugs so where do they work they work in the brain they work in the brain stem one of the classic areas down deep in the brain stem is a raw structural ventral medulary region where descending pathways are coming down and some of the key neurotransmitters are serotonin nor upper nephrine so we're not necessarily using these drugs for their mood changing properties we're using them because they hit the same systems as they do in pain and that's the beauty of them and that's some of the messaging we have to give patients when we prescribe them an antidepressant is like okay and you know Mrs. Jones, Mr. Smith we're not doing this because we think we're you're depressed and you're spending yeah these are great great pain drugs but they were never FDA approved why were they not FDA approved because they're off patented there's no money to be made yeah if not not FDA approved drug approved for pain is which you may yeah thank you thank you for everything approved for something else you're absolutely right okay well this brings us to opioids which I sort of saved for last because of the well there's actually more drugs I want to talk about but in terms of like the off the shelf typical stuff that people think about so a lot of hay has been made over this there's no question that opioids have been overused and abused and there's no question that elicit use of these things has had a devastating impact on our society but it would be difficult to say that the field of medicine would be better off having never had an opioid to you know we just talked about surgery for example very challenging to deliver medical care in a hospital without opioids so the question becomes what is the most responsible case for oral opioids which by definition are meant to be used outside of a hospital not inside a hospital and as a pain specialist I would imagine few people are better equipped to navigate the nuance of that question yeah it is a very nuanced question I think a little preamble first I don't take money from either the opioid companies I don't take money from the litigation that's ongoing because there are tens and tens of billions of dollars at play right now yeah I don't take money and I am not pro-alpoid I am not anti-opiod I am pro-patient I view them as a tool I view them as a tool much like the other medications interventions mind body physical rehabilitative complementary tools that we use they have a particular place I have a personal deep appreciation for the destruction that these agents can cause I come from a family very deep in addiction very deep I've lost close family members to opioid overdose I've lost close family members to alcoholism I am personally petrified of these drugs and I have gone through surgeries that the surgeon said you can't get through this without an opioid and I'm like I'll be fine because my approach is avoidance with that said I have learned a long time ago not to project my personal experiences onto my patients that had to come through age wisdom whatever it is true prescription opioids were over prescribed they were over marketed they were you know there were bad actors doing bad things it came at a time but it's it's not that simple story I sometimes get frustrated because I feel like you can make really simple sound bites out of this complex societal issue when it was a perfect storm that hit yes you had a letter to the editor of New England Journal saying that nobody got addicted to on a like 38 patients or some nonsense Purdue and others ran with this and I get that and they did bad things you also have to put things in the context of what was going on in society there was growing awareness of pain as there should be there was growing pressures to do something about it people have brought up the pain as a fifth vital sign is an example and people have different opinions about that did it have bad consequences yes did it have good consequences hell yes run the counterfactual do you want to go back to a time when we're not asking patients after surgery they're paying do you want your mother your daughter back in that time I think the answer is clearly no but also there was other pressures and Peter you were you witnessed those first hand what was going on back in the 90s and the 2000s and after surgery there was this massive push to get people out of the hospital and put them in their home we were replacing care in a hospital with care in the home in the hospital we had time to see their trajectory we could titrate their opioids or whatever or get them tuned up dialed in and then send them home now surgery overnight your home let's give you a bucket of whatever and the reason for that was surgeons and docs don't like getting called at 3 a.m. for pain control so pressure to put people out in the in the home environment on top of it docs get lousy training for pain like what is the average seven hours I think in medical school that's by the way 40 hours of pain so great if you've got a dog not so great for a patient so you got this pressure and by the way not only on top of that but now you've got the introduction of patient satisfaction scores I have to imagine in your private practice you don't have to measure press gaining in patient satisfaction scores but in hospitals everybody does at least they did I think they're coming to their senses and so one way of addressing the satisfaction give more opioids so there's and there's more there's many many many pressures that came to bear that helped create this problem of which there were bad actors out there by the way the perfect analogy to this is the mortgage crisis in 2006 to 2008 or if you took a zero-th order view it would be really easy to blame one of the entities but it is actually a perfect storm right I have a slide yet on the opioid crisis I call it the perfect storm yeah I you're absolutely right and in the end and here I'm going to be a little bit reductive when it comes to the docs roles in this I'm going to borrow from my friend professor Keith Humphrey's there are three kinds of physicians in the out there there are the majority of the physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons there are the next group which is a much smaller group physicians doing the wrong thing for the right reasons and at the very top of that pyramid a little group you got physicians doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons bad those people at the top take away their license put them in jail but you had a group of people here in the middle that were doing the wrong thing for the right reasons that they either didn't have the right education they thought they were helping people they did they contribute to the problem yes have they gotten educated have we yes I didn't answer your question though and let me now circle back and and I hope you'll forgive that little bit of siloquie on my perspective of that 20 years I don't use opioids is a first line age I never almost never end of life cancer but usually by then they've tried other things before they're getting to us and I will use end of life cancer panel use opioids liberally has needed now just one thing but you are not taking care of somebody in the acute phase of expected pain typically is that correct in other words that guy that just had a knee replacement he's being managed by his surgeon correct you know frequently we have an acute pain service and the hospital that sees about 30 to 50 patients a day based on what when is a patient being when is the big gun of your team's expertise being brought in for a post surgical routine case versus not when most frequently when the outcome is not simple so when the surgeon needs some help when the internal medicine doc needs help and it's beyond their comfort you know when we brought pain in for every case when I was in residency was anytime we did a thoracotomy was a non-negotiable yeah pain was consulted before the case just for people listening a thoracotomy we didn't do these often because a lot of times by the time I was in residency we did minimally invasive surgery in the chest yeah but sometimes you had to actually make a huge incision under the ribs and that's very painful we just you know you just know this from experience that that's such a painful experience you cut this huge incision in the intercostal muscles you put ribs spreaders in you crank these things open so you can do this big operation we just know those patients are going to need an epidural catheter and we want that in before surgery not after yeah and it makes all the difference in the world so pain was a part of that response I don't remember us routinely bringing pain in otherwise but things have changed I'm sure in 20 years so today for a general abdominal case or a general orthopedic case are you brought in preoperatively yeah yeah these days there's a lot of movement towards these RS protocols and enhanced recovery after surgery and so fortunately the field of medicine is moving more and more towards a team-based healthcare model where you know surgeons pain docs anesthesiologist nursing rehab or all working in a collaborative manner they're putting together protocols to what is the best optimal approach to prehab a patient before surgery move them through the intraoperative and then pariooperative period and it's gotten better and better and better can we still improve it yes but the acute pain service does get involved particularly as you alluded when we put in peripheral nerve catheters or epidural catheters and this is where we're running that local anesthetic the numbing medication that stops the nerve impulses to provide pain relief after surgery and so yes we do get deeply deeply involved in that acute surgical pain space and then also with internal medicine docs and the hot wind patients are admitted into the hospital for whatever cause so if someone's listening to us and they're going to have elective surgery at some point like I want to plant to see in their head for someone who's going to have the knee replacement the hip replacement the colonis is to take to me the api whatever yeah should they be requesting this of their surgeon should they say hey I want to be diligent about my recovery I want to minimize my use of narcotics do you mind calling in a pain consult so that we can I can just have a team of docs who are exclusively thinking about my pain because let's be honest yeah the surgeon I got enough to worry about I got to make sure you didn't leak that that anastimosis is fine that you're not getting a wound infection your pain is literally like third or fourth on the list of my concerns for you to have the best outcome you are right and if patients listening to this a person's listening and they have the ability they have the word thought to go to their doc their surgeon and ask what will pain management be like is there an opportunity to interface with an acute pain service particularly if they're taking opioids now for a chronic pain problem or even if they're not taking opioids for a chronic pain problem so we will see them in our clinic before surgery we will put together a pre-surgical plan for them which will often include a regional anesthetic approach meaning those nerve blocks or the catheters we sometimes involve intravenous ketamine to augment we will put together the whole plan communicate with the anesthesiologist make sure there's a good handoff after surgery and then we will follow them afterwards and then we will typically follow them outside the hospital and help the surgeon out with the medication management and the pain management all of this is not just solely to reduce pain but to put that person in an optimal state for rehab for functional coverage how ubiquitous is the patient controlled anesthenous analgesic device the PCA that we use everywhere okay so it's still so people are still typically getting out fentanyl through a PCA you know immediate post-operative phase fentanyl the lot more keen okay dilotted yeah yeah no the PCA is a very common tool and one it puts pain control in the hands of the patient two studies have been shown that PCA delivered medication opioids they end up taking less than if it's nursing and the goal is we want to get you off an opioid even oral before you go home is that generally the state of objective of the medical system now is whatever opioids are going to need let's try to deliver that to you in the hospital I wouldn't say necessarily because I think there are some surgeries that are going to clearly require prescribing an opioid after surgery remember the name of the game is get people out of the hospital and have the care take place in their home and people are going to need some degree of pain management and analgesics and those analgesics can be Tylenol NSAIDs if it's more than you know mild moderate pain it may involve an opioid so how are you thinking about that how are you thinking about extracting the value of the opioid and minimizing the risk of long-term dependence what we have learned is that there are vulnerabilities that people bring to an injury or surgery and being placed on opioids that set them up for more likelihood of persistent opioid use and we've characterized we and others through research studies have characterized many of these factors so some of these factors include preoperative depression and anxiety higher levels of catastrophizing I early adverse child events so a history of PTSD history of physical sexual psychological trauma all of these sets someone up to have a higher likelihood of persistent pain and persistent opioid use now you will note all these things I said most of these things I said people would normally put under the psychological umbrella the key message that I want to give people and I think I think people I think everyone's getting this is when we talk about psychology and psychological factors we're talking about neurosciences we're talking about the brain and we're talking about specific brain systems regions networks so we did a study several years ago this was led by Jennifer Haw Ian Carroll was a key player leader on this and we found that higher depression scores preoperatively predicted much more likelihood of persistent opioid use after surgery and how are you screening for this what tests are you using back then we used something called the back depression inventory which standard instrument we don't use that anymore there's more modern tools I thought what was cool about this we did a factor analysis on the original paper and you can break the back down into different components of depression and hedonia cognitive level what we found is it was a particular factor that drove almost entirely that prediction of depression self-loathing it was feeling like really bad about years so if you had someone who just suffers from not that hedonia is anything but unpleasant but if they're only experiencing anodonia but no self-loathing you would say well the risk isn't as high yeah you know conceptually your argument holds but now I'm going to come back to a lot of the things that you write about which is the danger of drawing inferences from small population studies and generalizing that to the rest of the world yeah especially without randomization because what you really would like to be able to see is you take a whole bunch of people in you get their incoming metrics of anodonia disthymia self-loathing you categorize all the arms and tentacles of depression yeah and then you randomize within each of those to with and without opioid strategies and then you I mean this is a very complicated thing to do but if you want to know the answer that's kind of the way you want to do it that's exactly it unfortunately there's not much will to do that in society these days even in the world we live in today where we understand that for a non-zero potentially non-trivial segment of the population the introduction to opioids that ultimately destroys people's lives is delivered by the medical system I was on the Institute of Medicine panel now the National Academy panel called relief and we did a report called relieving pain in America and I remember sitting around back in 2010 and we were talking about the state of pain in the country and where we needed to go identify a perfect vision and also identify what are the biggest research questions to ask an answer and I remember really vigorous discussion here and the one that I put forward and others put forward is we need to better understand what is the long-term effectiveness and safety of prescribing opioids to people with chronic pain meaning we need to figure out for whom opioids work um today we still don't have an answer to that question and there's very little will to do it because the whole message in the scientific communities basically find non-opioid choices so there's not a lot of interest in funding the studies to figure out for whom it works there is a lot of active interest still mainly through data driven studies to find out who's at risk but that type of study that you're talking about and others that are of longer term and bigger consequences I just don't know when they're going to get done who's going to fund us this is a little unrelated but I remember this when I was in residency there was one of the attendings I don't even remember who who it was but he was one of the he had this belief he used to quote this study and I don't remember it but it said that if you injected bupivicane into the injection site so as sorry the incision site so I'm going to I'm going to make a midline incision draw my little line inject bupivicane so for the listener this is a long acting sodium channel blocker wait some long period of time like ten minutes yeah then make the incision go about do your surgery and then immediately give that patient a seat of benefit and I'd be profan immediately post operatively and keep them on it around the clock you could eliminate opioid use and he was convinced that the only reason surgeons didn't want to do this was because nobody wants to inject and stand there for ten minutes with your thumb up your ass waiting for the bupivicane to seep into the tissues and maybe it's anecdotal but it really seemed to work right like it really seemed to work that you would do this in good olhoney or repair or you know at the time some small laparotomy or whatever it was anything and if you were willing to put that bupivicane in and sit there and wait and I'm trying to think we might have used epi with light a cane as well so might have been a little epi with light a cane plus bupivicane or something like that and you had to be super do diligent about keeping the acetaminophen and ibuprofen level if you ever heard of anything like that all the time yeah I mean I think he was ahead of the ahead of the curve now whether it completely eliminates any likelihood of opioids after sorry that's a little bit too strong a state just reduces the requirement right I strongly believe that he was practicing good medicine and he was doing it ahead of his time now the idea of using a combination of light a cane and markane and epi as you well know is light a cane short acting yep so it's going to work pretty darn quick and so you can get going with your surgery while you're while the markane the bupivicane's kick and end the epi is going to not only provide him a state it's going to reduce bleeding at the site but it can teach the local contain which means you have to use less bovie which means less tissue damage like and I could be sort of miss maybe he was using epi with bupivicane I don't remember but I mean you throw something there there there and I think I have an asturgence these days and my sense is that's becoming more and more common practice that there's a greater appreciation of the role of this not concept of preemptive preventative analgesie anesthesia I think it it provides some benefit there was a big hoopla on this like 20 years ago when everybody thought we were going to find a way just to basically eliminate post operative pain through these methods that's presumably didn't pan out it just didn't pan out yeah but look a 50% reduction in opioid requirement post operatively would be enormous huge absolutely and where are we getting back to your your question I think we're at an interesting crux in research and clinical care where we're gathering more and more high quality data to better understand these vulnerabilities and I think we're we're going to be moving to the point of putting these into clinical decision support tools that can inform the docs and help them to assess a risk of the patient you know so that you can have an informed conversation with someone like you are at likelihood of having persistent you know opioid use because of what you bring yeah I shared with you do patients receive that well um that's a hard discussion to have with a patient I would imagine I guess a little bit is about their expectations you know the challenges when the ones who've had multiple surgeries that have been on opioids they're expecting opioids it's all about expectations a lot of his expectations I think the more naive person those go a little smoother um if you are professional explain to them but also allow them to make their own choices you know don't say we're not going to give this to you yeah that makes sense but here you are in an increased risk and that's always the discussion I have with patients whether in the acute space or particularly in the chronic space so let's talk about a couple other things that are kind of related to this but did distinct um let's talk about um acupuncture what do you know about it well let's talk about through the lens of chronic pain yeah yeah yeah all right clinically some people get better some people don't get better I cannot yet predict who is going to respond and who's not going to respond is it a part of the work that your department does yeah we actually have Dr. John T. Kong does the acupuncture she's a pain doc she does acupuncture and my view of acupuncture is a mode as a treatment as a modalities if you can afford the wallet biopsy and it doesn't cause you problems then give it a try and you say wallet biopsy because the insurance doesn't typically cover it they do more so now on Medicare and I think that the rules that went into place recently helped with that for older patients I don't honestly know if it's translated down to the commercial carriers so Medicare is covering something commercial payers are not well it's possible okay yeah I is historically been hard to get that uh covered so not with standing I like the I see a wallet biopsied and heard that before um in your experience where do you see it being most successful what type of pain what type of clinical presentation yeah I've had some successes and back pain musculoskeletal pain migraines that is oddly um and it's highly variable I studied this I had a really large program project grant to look at cortical mechanisms of this and uh predictors and you know we're putting in a paper now which is a prediction model of real acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture sham how do you do placebo sleep acupuncture because you you don't sure but not in the appropriate spot well that's one option and it turns out that many of these acupuncture points over life peripheral nerves and so when you you know twittle the needle or apply acupuncture are you doing a peripheral nerve stimulation I don't know but this is a striding or needle that looks for all intensive purposes like an acupuncture needle it causes a little pin prick but it doesn't actually do acupuncture and it's been shown to be a good placebo what do I know about the mechanisms again uh don't fully understand I know that there is increases and peripheral adenosine that is released with acupuncture that has an analgesic effect at the primary no seceptor I know that cortically in the brain there are brain systems that are modulated with acupuncture but heck if I know exactly how it works there's and we still don't have good ways of predicting who's going to respond and who's not going to respond but that's rather common amongst all of our pain treatments but uh you know again pretty safe you know absent some risk of infection you know make sure that the facility you're getting at practices good hygienic approaches preset how do we think about acupuncture differing from dry needleing yeah I think you need to well I think you'll want to get a true acupuncture specialist on to because I know that to dry that so like in California I think technically you're it's not legal to dry needle but you can't acupuncture I don't even understand the difference you're using the term dry needleing from an interim muscular standpoint I don't know if that's where you're going maybe so I see acupuncture refers to just going after a nerves specifically well it's an acupuncture point okay it is a Chinese medicine list of acupuncture points I'm way out of my wheelhouse here folks when I think of dry needleing I tend to think of that in the context of trigger point injections which we do physicians do and that we're taking typically like a 30 or 27 gauge needle we're putting it in trimuscularly into a trigger point muscle it's where you get those naughty muscles and you can do dry needleing and what that does is it causes relaxation of the muscle acupuncture is really quite different from that next question on chronic pain what is the role of cannabis in your experience here is it is it friend or foe and again I'm sure there's a nuanced there are nuances this is another one where uh liable to get some hate mail on either side of this here's what I'll tell you one the verdict is way is still way the heck out there you look at well controlled randomized trials most there's very few of them by the way but some a neuropathic pain that show analgesic benefit over short period of time with cannabis you look at population level studies Australia did one they did not show benefit with cannabis we collect data one of my other areas of both research but also clinical care is I built a learning health system that captures high quality data on every patient that comes in and so we deeply characterize or phenotype them and we looked at people coming in on cannabis not on cannabis bottom line people coming in on cannabis and to Stanford or Warsaw and they stay Warsaw now there's all these limitations to observational studies no matter how well you conduct them I let me let me distill it down to some talking points there's a huge number of cannabinoid receptors in the human brain that are playing a role in analgesia so I'm absolutely convinced the cannabinoids are playing a role in pain relief one two the forms of cannabis that we take are dirty meaning we don't know the dose we don't know the ratios they've not been well studied and they've not been studied in different groups a major part of that is because it's a schedule one drug which means that the DEA says that basically high abuse potential and no medical benefit and it takes basically an active congress to study cannabis I don't prescribe it at Stanford I don't screen people for it at Stanford if I did and if we kicked them all out I wouldn't have anybody in the clinic I mean we're in northern California that's interesting so you can't study it I would assume you couldn't study it with federal dollars because of the federal DEA restriction I would have assumed because it's legal in California if you were using non-federal dollars you could study it in a state like California you can't study it with federal dollars night I will support okay funding of cannabis the regulatory controls you have to go through hard crazy I see because it's scheduled one the laboratory it's it's actually more demanding it's than how you would study cocaine we used to make jokes UCS after some nice cannabis research and the the word on the street was is that they would deliver the cannabis dobe's in a brink's armored truck with guys carrying M16's now I think it's got it's gotten better but it's just been challenging to study this and I I'm firmly of the opinion we need to here's where I'm going to upset people I firmly believe we should make it a schedule to a schedule three drug if for no other reason to study it with yeah less friction what you said yeah perfect okay there's a condition you've already alluded to today that I am sure everyone has heard of and yet if you asked most people to define it they wouldn't be able to define it and so we're going to start with what it is why someone might have it what is the prevalence are their false positives I'm talking about none other than fiber my algebra yeah yeah what was historically a garbage bag definition fiber my algebra is a condition of widespread bodily pain that impacts people above and below the waste the diaphragm it's associated with early morning stiffness fatigue mental fog often you know some GI problems it is was historically based on American College of Metology definitions based on tender points and a lot of an out of 18 places but that's been replaced by now criteria which involves multiple body sites affected and a symptom severity score the key thing when the audience hears well first of all it's fiber myologist syndrome and whenever the audience hears syndrome what they should translate that to the definition of a syndrome is a constellation of signs and symptoms that define a disease but we don't understand the mechanism so fiber myologist is a syndrome we do not understand its mechanisms we know that historically it tended to affect women more than men about 80% ish or so women with a newer definition we're picking up a lot more men the cognitive aspects of it are really a problem it's also associated as I alluded to with sleep disturbances they get this weird what we call alpha wave intrusion into their EEG which means alpha waves are typically in light awakefulness so when you're supposed to be in deep sleep or REM sleep your brain is in kind of a light alert state instead and so they're not getting a rustful sleep this is a syndrome that's caused untold problems particularly for women what's the prevalence according to the current definition i can't tell i I should know how many millions there peat that's an that's a i should know how many millions and i don't what i i can tell you just to give a frame of reference um chronic pain we think there's 50 to 100 million americans with chronic pain that's a huge range and it depends on the way you ask the question um if you ask it more stringently it's 50 million if you ask it more liberally it's a we know that there are about 8% of the population or a little over 20 some odd million with something called high impact chronic pain this is a big one and this is where i spend a lot of my research and policy work on these are the people that has substantial restrictions to their pain in activities a daily living these are the really challenging people of that 50 to 100 million the most common chronic pain is low back pain at about 28 percent neck pain 16 percent headaches around 16 percent societal burden of chronic pain is terrifying it's astounding we spend over half a trillion dollars a year in chronic pain and the reason why in part it's not more appreciated is because we have parceled it out we've broken it into different categories you know with heart disease we lump it into heart disease cardiovascular disease even though it's all these different sub components with pain instead we categorize it as it's either you know it's back pain it's musculoskelet pain it's migraines it's abdominal pain and it gets disdeluded out but when you put it all together you're dealing with a half a trillion dollars more than diabetes heart disease and cancer combined fiber myology again i'm escaping the prevalence many millions of people huge societal burden it is historically a disease of history on a housewives is how they were mislabeled tragically and we're having now a greater appreciation for what it is what's affected what we have learned is that there are brain systems that are clearly abnormal in the processing of pain and people with fiber myology we find that for the same pressure stimulus if you apply something like four kilograms per square centimeter healthy people will give a range of reporting in certain range people with fiber myology much much higher here's another interest i think this is an interesting pain concept to introduce and talk about it there's something called conditioned pain modulation in the animal world we called it diffuse noxious inhibitory controller denic cpm okay think back to when you were a kid your arm hurt you walk up to your buddy you say hey man you know and he's like how you doing it's like well my arms kind of hurt in a lot and what would he do hit you he would hit you of course hit it you're other arm he'd stomp on your foot and like while they held it back there this is a boy only thing like i can't imagine girls did this but yes it's of course this is what little boys do this is what little boys do i was guilty of a lot of that but then you'd say to your buddy i don't you feel better and the truth is you did because pain in another area reduces the primary pain site it's called condition pain modulation we're all wired it is a network predominantly we think in the brain stem involving some of this paracoductal gray rostral ventral medulary regions labars first described this in the mid eight mid seventies in animals so we all do it we all have it it's just endogenous tonic inhibitory tone that you can activate when you get caused pain in another site unless you have fibromyalgia if you have fibromyalgia particularly if you're a woman with fibromyalgia you you have impaired cpm you don't inhibit now is there a high overlap with depression anxiety and fibromyalgia and if so which is the peracoductality yeah the good sugar and we used to think that there was a high preponderance of anxiety and depression with fibromyalgia and i think the current data doesn't support that there's any higher prevalence than particularly any other pain conditions i think you tend to see more the anxiety depression broadly speaking and things like low back pain i think what you see more of in fibromyalgia is fatigue, unrelenting, fibro fog is what they call it and what is the lead disturbances and so what is the management for these patients is this a curable syndrome or is it a syndrome that is meant to be managed like HIV? yes and no what do i mean well one we don't know exactly the mechanisms there's different prevailing thoughts one thought again is it's a disruption in your central brain processing a pain through reasons unknown there are some that believe it is a disease a condition of small fibroenoropathy because you can do punch biopsies little little skin biopsies here and what they find in some subsets of people with fibromyalgia is those cfibres that there is alterations abnormalities of the cfibres in the skin and that is synonymous with a small fibroenoropathy that neurologist typically see now that's caused by what yeah that's the thing is this infectious what people think is going on so fibromyalgia is frequently preceded by some event something traumatic that traumatic can be physical motor vehicle accident but it could also be some emotional or sexual abuse it can be an infection we frequently you know also hear that story so there is some insult that people will frequently identify getting back to your question on managing this we frequently use the same medications that we've described before but we rely on more of those brain module at the TCA's are the big another one like the locksetine which is in the class of antidepressants but it's a little cleaner fewer side effects it's a serotonin or a peniferin re-uptaken hibiter this is actually a drug that got FDA approval for pain and so we go to this a lot uh one of the drugs that I have studied with Jared younger who's now at UAB is a drug called Lodosanal Trek Zone this is a fascinating drug and it's got like this underground reputation out there that's all over the forums and the reason for it is because it's been around for decades and off patent there is zero money for any pharmaceutical company for what is now trucks on now truck zone when given at 50 milligrams is used to block opioid receptors it's an opioid blocker and so we use this in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction because it blocks the rewarding experiences of alcohol or opioids and so it's used as a treatment for addiction 50 milligrams at four and a half milligrams one tenth of the dose it has been shown to activate to block toll like four receptor on the microglia now I just introduced like this really technical concept so allow me to briefly explain the microglia are these cells that hang around nerves but are not neurons and when I was in medical school few years several years before you what I was taught was these microglia were like the warm fuzzy blanket that propped up the nerves I don't know what you were taught but they provided structural support to the nerves what I learned is that was only part of the story that their key neural immune modulators and so what I mean by that is in times of stress injury fever these microglia get activated they release all sorts of inflammatory mediators chemicals that sensitize the central nerves responsible for pain pain transmission pain perception so you give low to us and I'll truck sound it blocks that it blocks that neuroinflammatory soup and in some patients Peter this drug's been magical like magical I give it in four and a half milligrams I'm silly question why not five like four point five has a lot of specificity to it was there some reason why it came in at such a dose all right here's my story Linda walk and and Mark Hutchinson did some of the early work in the animal studies on this and showed this microglia effect and they did it at a certain dose and so what we did is we did a milligram per kilogram just a stabler 70 milligram 70 kilo person 70 kilo person thank you and we get four and a half and so when people ask me that I'm like wow it does make a sound pretty smart doesn't it there's no difference between four and a half and five yeah so what are the other areas where LDN is just captivating the world complex regional pain syndrome it has had a that's a very tragic pain condition that is a neuropathic pain condition we see a fair amount of I've got a clinical trial I'm just wrapping up on that using Lodos and I'll track on funded by the RSDSA association and another is actually multiple sclerosis they've used it in and they found some reduction in reoccurrences of MS I think they did that you you CSF or UCLA but it's in these weird neurodegenerative type conditions where there's things about now I've had some wacky really wacky patient responses if I mean I can share one if he is disartheir through a key can't speak he's got weakness he has hemibody pain burning pain this is that central pain okay the lamic pain so he comes to me several years later can barely speak at all he's tried everything let's try Lodos and I'll try why does he come to a pain doc because he's got terrible pain okay so he wasn't coming to you for the speech issue no no he has a speech therapist it's not getting any better he's a couple of years out stroke of stabilized so it's this burning pain on half his body half his body I trial him on four and a half milligrams of LDN he goes away comes back a couple months later pain is improved but not only that he's now speaking and throwing a few words together for the first time in like census stroke unlike what the hell I bump up his dose you cannot hurt yourself on this drug you know I know you know this it's also I go to nine one out ten well because it's easy to take two capsules yeah he comes back a few months later he's now like talking in sentences and I'm like I said are you sure this isn't due to your speech therapist and they swear up and down absolutely not he I go on up to like 13 and I go up to 13 and a half and now he's having conversations and how does his pain massively better on this and really remarkable effect I cannot the only way I can explain these things is you know in a stroke you've got like these you've got dead tissue you've got live tissue you've got these intermediate zones and somehow with reducing maybe inflammation you end up with yeah more functional brain somehow if that model makes sense which it at least two we logically does something about that inflammatory zone in the middle between what was clearly gone and we're not and not is poisoning the part that's still okay right it's so what is the downside of this meaning what would one need to be mindful of in trying and approach like this the beauty of this drug is the only side effects that I've typically I see 20 30% of people get vivid dreams they get technical dreams not bad dreams not my not nightmares but there are dreams just take on a more colorful nature everyone's on well see somebody who they say it activates then we tell them to take it to ours before bedtime and if it activates some a little bit take it in the morning instead so here's a silly question yeah what's the scenario in which inflammation of the glia is a good thing it's a good thing after injury and after an infection because it mobilizes all of those repair cells to come and clean up the mess the problem that we think is going on in pain the switches don't turn off and go back to normal and indeed that either which you do beautiful intro is one of the things we think is playing a role in fibromyalgia they got an insult activation of this neuroimmune neuroinflammatory system and health these state it turns off and fibromyalgia never turned off I guess where I'm going with this is we think that at least a subset of people with neuro degenerative diseases and you mentioned multiple sclerosis but we think this is true in at least some cases of Alzheimer's disease that neuroinflammation is a part of the pathology so would there be any efficacy to a trial there in either an individual with MCI, mild cognitive impairment or as crazy as the sounds as there are reason to consider it prophylatically in high-risk individuals with the caveat that hey by the way if you happen to get an infection like this would be a good time to stop it and ride it out and get better I think the short answer short answer is yes a little bit of the long-eranswer is everything I know you know this everything we do is weighing risk and benefits yep this is one drug I am hard pressed to come up with significant risks we have we have decades and decades and decades of experience with this drug in people with addiction at 10x the dose at 10 and how long are they typically on that drug lifetime so meaning for for a subset of individuals just putting them on the party dose of 50 milligrams of meltrex on keeps them free of alcohol and opioids for life because it's so blunts the pleasure center yeah the the problem is is all the addition all I just know is that it's hard to keep people on this because they can just stop it and go back and use yeah you know so that's why you've no you have to want to be off you have to want to be off they have injectable versions of this it's not called divotrol is it it's it's an injectable under the skin that lasts X number of days months but yeah we've got a lot of long-term data on this and from a pilot standpoint with informed consent obviously and just you know I would view that as a kind of a novel treatment in patients that one could try out monitor do some objective measures and see what see what you get I wouldn't say that I want to be careful I wouldn't say that for a lot of the things that we do because there's real risks with a lot of the medications that we provide a lot of the procedures we do not only that there's big costs that come with them where is this I'm going to make a plug here I have no relationship too but we get our stuff out of ballmarr pharmacy in Colorado why they're compounding pharmacy they've got all the certifications oh the reason is you can't go to safeway or Costco and get this you can't get low dose milk racks on there you mean you have to it doesn't be compounded at 4.5 you're saying you're right good and so we go through this pharmacy because they've got good customer service they take patients credit cards over the phone and they will ship it to you immediately and they're very responsive you can probably find it in your local area at other compounding pharmacies it usually runs about $30 a month so it's basically a free drug insurance doesn't often cover up because it's they consider an experimental but it's basically a free drug so it's a bucket day yeah yeah so I it's one that I use more and more and more because of its safety profile and it's potential forgetting me a home run yeah my my wheels are turning on I'm very curious to see if anybody has looked at LDN and and and and and and and and and any of the neuro inflammation stuff because look we you know we see the relationship between herpes and plex virus and Alzheimer's disease between shingles especially ocular variants of it and Alzheimer's disease we know that there is some relationship between inflammation and this disease yeah and and we know that that's obviously not all paths pet cross through that right there there are lipid mediated paths metabolic paths vascular paths but I think you know you very difficult to make the case there's not an inflammatory path towards that condition and so interesting to think about it is and I need you know just as a ideally a good scientist tell you that not everybody buys and to the microglial model that I'm describing there are friends and colleagues at Michigan Dan Klaw brilliant brilliant guy who is very much in disagreement with me who believes that even at these low doses you are antagonizing the opi-dergic system and an essence kind of resetting it in these chronic pain states so that you're normalizing the endogenous tone and you know what he could that's the fun thing about science and why we try to keep our ego out of it the truth will come forward what's the evidence for the inhibition of the the toll like receptor is that in is that in in vitro yeah and here's the thing yeah it is in vitro uh Linda walkins markuch and did some really nice work in that and showed people have had some difficulty in replicating it but I have a hard time even you know we we know the mechanism I think seems pretty solid but when I look at the clinical conditions that it has been applied to and shown benefit I mentioned multiple sclerosis all sort of colitis I believe is another one and these weird neurodegenerative things I have a hard time understanding why mild antagonism of opioids is going to have an impact on those conditions and why do you think you see I mean that's an interesting one well it's another one of these weird degenerative through a central effect yeah yeah yeah I don't have a good answer for you on that I'm just spouting off some of the headline and the studies that I've read where it's been used I I will have to go and look just for kicks I get back the hotel room and just see about the whole mild cognitive impairment all time or aspects of it I totally don't treat these patients but it isn't intriguing ideas isn't it yeah isn't it so when we met 25 years ago how big was the department at Stanford in pain division oh we had about 10 to 12 people on it and this is all the physicians and nurses the trainees it was tiny tiny tiny tiny we were in this small little clinic and today probably a 13050 with a factor of 10 or more and we've grown to be I think the largest academic pain center west of the Mississippi we one of the top in an age fund it's really come a long way it's been really exciting to see the growth and and the careers and the people we've helped out so I'll I'll finish the story of how we met so I'm in this state of um total hell um in addition to all the stuff I mentioned about you know this incredible pain I couldn't even stand up literally couldn't stand and if I did I had to be punched over and so at the time I was dating an anesthesiology resident and she was the one that said hey we just need to get you in this pain clinic like we just we just got it we got to break some stuff like this is this is going nowhere you're circling the drain here kid and so I think she was at the time doing her she was in her last year of anesthesiology so I think she was doing a rotation through pain maybe that's that's that's probably how you know she she we easled me in there so I come and see you in clinic by the way at this point my mom had flown down from Toronto to take care of me it's not like I could drive or do anything right so my mom drives me into the hospital come in and see you you hear the story we'd ruled out anything that required any more surgical intervention in other words I'd undergone another MRI I'd had a flexion extension film it I wasn't surgically unstable and in fact where the original injury was didn't even seem to be what was driving the pain now so you said look the first thing we're going to do is we're going to give you an IV light a cane drip to see if we can just calm these sodium channels down did it do anything so you said well how much you weigh I said I weigh 80 kilos you said okay we're going to give you 400 milligrams of light a cane intravenously and I said Dr. Mackie I just took my boards a year ago that's a toxic dose you said don't worry we're going to do it in a cardiac monitored room you will be on an EKG and we will be able to defibrillate you if you have an arrhythmia so I said go for it so in 20 minutes I got 400 milligrams of light a cane didn't touch the pain did tried something else didn't touch the pain by now it was eight o'clock at night wow and you said okay the only thing left to do at this point is to go in there and do a series of injections at every single facet joint every single dorsal route every nerve route every dorsal route ganglia the entire length of your spine yeah I will not be able to diagnose what is wrong because I'm basically going to stop all the pain but then we will chip away at this over the coming months and I said great can we do it now you said no it's I had a clock at night we don't have an anesthesiologist I'm the only one here I said you're an anesthesiologist you said yes but I'm the one that's doing the procedure so I said well I can't we do that and then you said well we won't be able to give you any sedation and I'm about to stick 45 needles in your back and I said I don't care that's how much pain I am in right now so we go into the OR and you proceeded to put I think you know how to court his own you know be pivicane and you let me up up and down the back and two hours later I stood up for the first time in three months I was completely pain free this was remarkable so we get home it's midnight I say to my mom I'm not going to bed I'm going to go for a walk because like I hadn't walked in three months and you know the campus loop of Stanford very well I ran it yes yeah I walked it until the morning it's a four mile loop it's I just walked around and around and around till nine o'clock in the morning came back home went on to develop a planner fashion items because when you don't walk for three months and then you don't stop walking but put that aside and you told me look you're going to probably feel okay for a few days and then the pain is going to come back well it actually turned out to be two weeks that I was pain free and then the pain came back and over the next three or four months you repeated comparable procedures but with more and more precision I e narrowing in it what the problem was and it my memory serves me correctly it was mostly in the T12 L1 area though those and I think the ultimate diagnosis was look you lost so much disk space at L5S1 through the multiple surgeries if you look at my MRI today I basically don't have a disk at L5S1 that you've now developed this facet arthropathy that far up and that's where those nerve roots are going into kidneys and testes but what was amazing was these injections allowed me to go and do rehab which I took on like vengeance and basically rebuilt the strength in the musculature of my back and so within nine months I was like back to nine months of meeting you a year of the injury I was functional within two years I could get to the point where I forgot about it for days at a time like I gave an example I could actually sneeze without bracing wow that was something I couldn't do yeah for a year I couldn't lean over the sink to brush my teeth that's how weak I'd become like you you know just the just the moment arm of your torso leaning over I couldn't do that I had to fully brace and support myself to just brush my teeth so you asked like what was the lasting impact of that well one of and I've told this story many times and of course my kids know it well one of the lasting impacts was my absolute love for parking as far as possible from wherever I'm going because when I was going through this they wanted to give me a wheelchair parking thing yeah and I was like I don't want it you know it's just a psychological thing it's like I don't want it I don't care how far I have to walk and so now you know my kids know you sort of celebrate your legs by parking far yeah and in many ways that became part of this idea this thesis I had of this centenary into cathlan this idea of like what are you training for your training for life life is your sport and that can be something as mundane as being able to walk to the grocery store if you park if there's no spot near where you need to go and can you push the cart to the car and all that kind of stuff so the net net for me is it has been incredibly positive um again I'm incredibly grateful Sean to you because again had I not been at Stanford had I not had you know that girl friend who I won't name her to embarrass her although I think she's done the faculty at Stanford by the way you know I just think there's a lot of ways that story could have gone sideways so I so I feel incredibly grateful and the final part of the gratitude is that I would go on to Hopkins for my residency in an an emergency room that serviced some of the most opioid addicted people on the planet and based on my own experience with that I can say I always had a sense of humility about what they were going through I always looked at it as oh god I I feel your pain that is awful and I and I could have been there wow but by the grace so that's that's been my experience with it which is 90% good that's a great story you know I Peter I I listened to that and in one hand I remember it and another hand it's been so yeah it's one of a million stories you could have been talking about bob yeah as the doc and I'm listening to this and I'm like wow yeah that is the kind of thing I would have done you know late at night and just try to take control of the situation get it under control just put the fire out just spray the hose yeah because normally to be clear to the audience I would never approach that anacronic situation like that it lacks all specificity you can't learn anything from it but I remember you just being an extremist and we had to do something to help you so let me ask you question Sean how common or uncommon is my story because when when you meet a person like me is there a party that thinks we're never going to fix this guy like this guy is gonna this guy's life is over he's on 320 milligrams of oxy yeah he hasn't walked in months he's in so much pain the lethal dose a lie to cane did nothing is there a party you that thinks this is a this is a chronic pain patient this is a guy who's gonna be in chronic pain the rest of his life or do you look at a guy like that and say no no we can fix this what I usually look yeah I usually think of it is I'm confident we can really help them I don't know what help means curing is such a strong word and every once in a while we can cure just eliminate make it go away never comes back like my case like your case which honestly I didn't even know about until recently I was lost the follow up lost a follow up I'll tell you maybe and just a little bit like how I did find out and yeah you know why I don't use the word cure maybe like a surgeon would use the word because I don't want to set unrealistic expectations with patients but I don't give up you know I've never hit a point in my career with a patient where I've ever said we're done like I got nothing I got nothing you know it's we've got so many tools available to us now back when we first met we had a handful of procedures we had a handful of medications gabapentin new kit on the block opioids and says some tricyclips but that was about it and by the way that also that notion contributed to the opioid crisis because we didn't have tools now there's over 200 medications that have shown to have analgesic properties we have over 200 procedures that we do for pain scores of mine body therapies scores of complementary alternative therapies and physical rehabilitative approaches like the toolbox that we can drop on is so much larger often the problem is not with all the tools we have it's trying to figure out the right tool for the right patient the right context I frequently focus on getting people back to a good quality of life and giving them control of their life and their pain rather than a promise to eliminate pain in the acute setting it's free it is often it's eliminating pain because in an acute parry operative acute injury situation you just want you you need to eliminate or significantly reduce it before you can get people moving which was kind of in your case um yeah I I got to tell you I was I was tempted because I my memory of this was a little vague I almost I from moment I thought maybe I just look up my records on epic and just see what's what and like no man that's what gets you fired so I didn't I thought I I'm glad you filled in the the memory gaps and I'm just I'm literally just so happy for you can I ask you some questions about it all sure we kind of maybe build on some of the things we've been talking about so to what degree so one of the so some of the stuff that's going on when you were in this is you were in distress clearly there was a lot of catastrophizing going on if I can drop on that term you cut me off if I'm going off in tangents catastrophizing is this concept it was introduced by Albert Ellis in 1962 he was a psychologist and he also like the neologisms so he created a catastrophizing he created the word off-alizing, off-alizing didn't stick around. catastrophizing was not related to pain but got used for pain has three factors to it. Amplification of pain, rumination or repetitive thoughts about pain in its sense of helplessness or loss of control over your pain. Check check check. Yeah it's natural there's nothing like people we got a lot of controversy in the field on this term because it has such a pejority of an impact and unfortunately some of the docs have weaponized it against patient or your a catastrophizer tragic but it has real neurobiologic consequences because when people catastrophize when they have a loss of self control when they have rumination it negatively impacts these prefrontal cortical circuits that I mentioned these cognitive systems so that they can no longer downregulate your pain. They have abnormal connections to hypotherlamic regions which are key and hypotherlamic but to a terraridrenaline axis which I know you're very familiar with and so what you you know in an acute situation you get a release of cortisol for stress response you know this is a surgeon it's great it keeps us alive chronically terrible and so you get this alustaric alustatic overload and it starts to thin out that brain region you're no longer able to modulate and it's just worsening cycle that you get deeper and deeper and a lot of what we do in pain is we try to break those cycles and it's not one thing like I used the interventions the procedures to help break an immediate cycle to get you on a path we do this with other patients similarly and then it's learning skills. That's the very important point that I think shouldn't be lost on this which is the the breaking the cycle isn't the cure it sets you up to go after the cure. I mean I had to go through two hours a day of rehab for six months. Yeah well I mean I had to learn how to move again correctly. I had to strengthen the muscles that we're going to make up for doing what my spine would no longer do but you couldn't do that if you were in pain so you had to learn to do that and you had to be at least pain free enough to do it but not push yourself too hard that you would reactivate the injury like there was a there was a balancing act but then you know and you'd be able to sleep all these things and you had to be able to clear your mind and get out of that catastrophizing loop. Yeah that's exactly it and you had the resources to do this I was reflecting in your book and the early chapter you described a friend's mother I think Sophie and you told the story and maybe it was in the original version of it it got trimmed out and the edited but when I read that story who of this woman who shoulder injury and then went down this bad path. Yep can't golf can't garden can't do anything. All and it doesn't get mentioned in the book again may have been left out of the editor but all I'm thinking was pain all I'm thinking of is this poor woman probably had severe severe pain that was untreated and it put her down a spiraling path and what happens in these situations. Well one of the things we're learning more and more is social functioning so we call pain a bioscica social model but we tend to skip over the social small us but it turns out we've done a lot of data analysis on our own patients social isolation social functioning plays a key role in your overall pain and quality of life and you talk about this in your book from a social functioning standpoint. So you know my guess is she invariably withdrew she became deconditioned she may very well had a lot of fear of avoidance around moving her shoulder which set you up on a worsening spiral and what I think about and when I think of Sophie and I think about people as they get older that we need to manage your sleep we need to manage all the things you put beautifully in your book but I think we we we also need to help them better manage their pain so that they can have the function and do all the things that you you say so nicely in your book I don't know whether what your thoughts are actually I was going to say that I was somewhere recently where I was asked to define health span and health span is squishy to define because there's like a medical definition that I've repeatedly said I think is insufficient right so the medical definition of health span is the period of time in which you're free of disability and disease so not very helpful and I prefer a more functional version of health span and unfortunately it's too long for me to rattle off but one of the lines is freedom from pain yeah so that's you know just as it's important to have strength stability um a robeck efficiency peak a robeck output explosiveness I mean all of the things are going to reduce as you age but the longer you preserve them the better but one of them is freedom from pain yeah yeah you know the data on elderly people who get a hip fracture and then it's like spiral immediately downhill to death yeah the listeners of this podcast are not uh they're not strangers to those things oh I'm sorry if I'm repeating things not a real but that particular one is so I mean it's it's so tragic yeah and I just keep thinking if we could better help get their pain under control and address them from that holistic you know that standpoint and just get them back to a level of functioning would this story be written differently I'd like to believe it would I hope it I hope it will um yeah you know when you went through all of this you you get through the rehab like did you feel a greater one understanding of your pain what was causing it and the nature of your back and what you could do and it's safety yeah and it's actually been yet another benefit of this experience is the ability I now have to help my patients yeah so if you just look at the population and understand the ubiquity and frequency of lower back pain and you realize I don't remember the numbers but like let's say a third of people are going to go through some bout of lower back pain in their life um a number of my patients have also been in the loop of chronic lower back pain right and for these patients one of the most powerful messages I can deliver to them is learning that a setback is not permanent so part of the journey because remember it's not like in the nine months after this injury got better I never had another setback no within that period of time I would have days where I felt bad again now fortunately I never went back to laying on the floor for days that I never experienced that level of discomfort again but there were many days when I was very uncomfortable and it would wax and wane but over time and with every time that I would recover from one of those cycles my confidence would go up yeah the ability to know that this is going to pass and I'm going to have to make some adjustments yeah and I'm going to have to not sit and I'm going to have to change the way I lay and I'm going to have to do these exercises a little bit more that's okay this will pass and so I actually just got an email from a former patient he's not even my patient anymore and he said to me hey Peter just want to let you know man I have never forgotten what you said about this and I just had a big setback last week and this would have normally taken me down the spiral to hell and I hear your words telling me it's okay this will pass and he's like you know what it's a week later I'm already on the mend so there's no difference between the this not impacting physiology right it's impacting the psychology and the psychology is what goes on to impact the physiology so again I think of that as I tell patients this is not going to be a monotonic improvement right it's going to look more like the S&P 500 where if you step back 30 years yes it's monotonically going up look at it for a given week not at all yeah can go down it's it's quite volatile now the volatility will decrease over time but it never goes to zero yeah that's a great great story and clearly you've it's helped you be a better doc and help people you know I listen to your story and everybody's story obviously is very different and personal I have my own variant to this and you know I I don't talk about this much because I tend to be a little private with these things but I suffer from cluster headaches and all my life as far as I can remember I would get these headaches it was like a bomb going off in my brain how often every two years every two to three years it's a classic fall spring cycle and all through my teens my early adulthood I get these two weeks I'd be in just terrible the most insane pain I've ever had I've broken a lot of bones and sports nothing like trivial compared to that and nothing I would do would work I occasionally go to the emergency department they say it's a sinus headache and they give me on a histamine and they'd prescribe them and sure enough they worked because it always went away in a couple weeks right I remember in residency getting one of these and the midst of cardiac anesthesia rotation and barely able to get the patient to the recovery room and I just went into a call room and I just hung out the thing and the thing is nobody knew what they were I didn't know what they were but I was scared every time he came on I thought I had a brain tumor I was convinced and I thought this was going to kill me and you get really scared that it's never going away you eyes catastrophized after the end of like a couple weeks I'm like this is never what the hell am I going to do I can't work like this I can't live like this then I become a pain doc and I'm like well shit I got cluster headaches and how are they treated now well first of all just just to let people know what a cluster headache is it typically manifests as headaches that last anywhere from upwards of a couple hours they can occur eight times a day to you know every other day they tend to have these weird characteristics with their underclass of trigeminal autonomic cephalages fancy term for simply meaning that you get eye tearing redness in your eye I get what I refer to as a sticky eye sensation like my eyelid gets heavy in a droop's I get my nasal congestion but one of the major characteristics is extreme agitation extreme agitation meaning you know Beth and you know would say well you didn't do better to lie down like now it doesn't matter and I just pace you pace and you pace until it goes away um so what I did you know in the period of all this fear I learned every damn thing I can learn about cluster headaches every single thing what how many people get these or presented the population it's under rare condition it's one of those rare ones that affects men more than women but women do get them you think I would know the prevalence of this too but less prevalent in migraines yeah okay yeah less prevalent in migraines common treatments for these um there's there's a board of and there is preventative and what the preventative are like calcium channel blockers that you you can take a board of is you know the typical migraine medications the trip tans so I have stockpile so of you know trip dans a high flow oxygen so you know I knew I was getting one it's before these happen I get this pro-dromal phase with weird appetite sleep gets disrupted I know and a sticky eye sensation I was giving a talk at the nap of paying conference and I knew they were coming on so I threw a tank of oxygen in the back of the car and metal rescue it now if I can get it in time if you can abort these things in time you can save yourself several hours of absolute agony and you can catch it in like a half an hour so the long and the short of it is it was through that journey of learning that I became informed and I developed self-appacacy so when I got these attacks when I knew what they were I no longer had a huge amount of fear that would further amplify things I was fearful it was a brain tumor I was a fearful like I was having a subarachnoid bleed right I knew what it was it didn't change the sensory dimensions of the pain it didn't change the agitation that I knew even if I didn't catch it it was going away in a couple hours and that gives you control so when these happen I know I'm prepared I know it's going to be a shitty two weeks and I buckle up but I know how to deal with it I know I'll come out of it and it makes a huge difference in quality of life and that's you know what I message is I would try to give patience is it's about learning as much as you can about your condition being informed and putting that to use and ideally giving yourself a degree of self-appacacy over your health and when I listen to your story it had parallels there in that that journey that you have and you you've clearly used it it may be tried to say make you a better person but yeah and yeah I have a lot of empathy for uh people is a consequence well Sean this has been this been a great discussion um I think we're we're we're certainly better off today as a species having a medical discipline that is devoted to pain we have the luxury of caring about this now right you know there was a time when just not dying was the highest priority and now it's it's we need more than that it's not just that we don't want to die it's that we want to be able to live pain free not to be confused with discomfort free I'm still a big proponent of discomfort as I'm sure are you we should be out there you know working out hard experiencing discomfort but but chronic pain can be inflammatory to the psyche it's not something I would wish on anybody so it's great to know that that since my time is a patient there that department has increased log fold and I hope that's true and trust that it's true around the country so thanks for the work you're doing thank you Peter I uh you know it's been 20 some of your since we've seen each other and if I can just say that I remember when I I saw you you were kind of an intense guy and I've melod have you? I've melod since then I remember thinking to myself this guy is either gonna crash and burn or he's gonna do something really awesome and then decades go by and I get this phone call from Ian and he's like you know dad Peter just gave you a shout out on one of his podcasts about how you helped him and he's like how do you feel about that and I said I'm just so happy for him it's like I had no idea that he's done so well for himself and and and you have you know you are yes you're seeing one patient at time and providing great care but I think this format is reaching so many people and this is what we need more of we need more Peter at he is we need you like delivering these messages that are empowering people because you're you're making a big impact out there and I just appreciate you inviting me on to spend some time with you so thank you. Thanks Sean.

100% of people are heavily impacted by what we just discussed. They misinterpreted the data so drastically and scared everybody with so much fear that you actually have an entire generation that has forgotten how to prescribe hormone therapy. When you took estrogen and progesterine or estrogen alone, you had a decrease risk of colon cancer, you had decreased risk of fractures like significant decrease of fractures. Decrease of diabetes, we saw a decrease in overall mortality, a decrease in cancer specific mortality. The reality is this is half the population. This is not niche medicine. If a penis tripled up at age 52, we'd probably have a vaccine sponsored by Pfizer. Right? They created biagra. They would create this vaccine. No one even tells me. I love that analogy. There are two hormones we've talked a lot about, but there's a third that we haven't doesn't get enough attention in women. And of course that's testosterone. I don't know who decided that men get testosterone in women have estrogen. Like we have both of the hormones. We love to gaslight women and say, well if you have your period, your hormones are normal. And the reality is, that's not true. I know there are people in the Medicare system who are going to be interested to understand that. If everybody in Medicare, eligibility used vaginal estrogen, we would save Medicare between 6 and 22 billion dollars a year. They're going to their doctor for cultures. They're in the ICU with sepsis. This is a huge economic and mortality problem that we're dealing with and no one cares. We just got done saying that that study didn't show that. So why is that box labeling still there? We're killing women by trying to protect them. Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Rachel, thank you so much for making the trip out to Austin. I have been looking forward to this episode for a while and I'm willing to go on record predicting that this will be a very popular episode given the nature of our discussion. I am so thrilled to be here. I have been nervous for quite a long time but I'm super happy to be here. I almost don't know where to begin. But it might not be a bad idea to just give people a little bit of a sense of your background. You are a urologist by training and maybe help us understand how you're training in urology led you to what you're doing today because most urologists wouldn't be doing exactly what you're doing. When we think of urology, we think about, you know, prostates. We think about kidneys. We think about bladders. Yes, but what you forget Peter is that urologists are ultimately the quality of life doctors. We deal with urination problems and we deal with sexual medicine. No one cares about erections and orgasms in libido. Quite the way that urologist cares about and when we're board certified, actually it's not a gender thing. We're not penis doctors only. We wear board certified to take care of everybody's genital and urinary tracks. And so what the unfortunately society has led us to know a lot more about the men's sexual health and men's genitals than female genitals. And so my background, I trained in urology really because I was interested in women's health but I also was interested in sexual health sexual medicine. And I didn't like delivering babies. I didn't like OBGYN. It just didn't fit well with my personality. And what I love about urology is that we can see everybody and we can really dive deep on quality of life issues. And the magic of urology is also that you really can you get to know your patient. It's not like, you know, when you did surgery, you take out someone's appendix and you never see them again. Maybe you do one post-op visit. Urologists have deep relationships where both surgeons, but we actually care about the medical side of these quality of life issues. And so as I was going through medical school, I really realized that talking about sexual health quality of life issues, that was fun for me. I was good at that. And in medicine, you kind of gravitate towards what is easy, not what is hard. And so it's just been a joy. And really, I've been working to further the field of urology to make us better at taking care of women. And so really, I do a lot of educating and teaching to my colleagues about how we really need to care about the whole, you know, like everybody. I really mostly want to talk about it from a female standpoint today, truthfully because I think this is where there's just a death of great information out there and where I think there's an abundance of garbage information out there. So while I appreciate that your breadth of knowledge will cover both sexes, you'll probably notice kind of a bias in what I want to talk about vis-a-vis women specifically. So let's start with perhaps the biggest and most obvious difference between men and women. And that is from an endocrine perspective, women go through this period called menopause, which is a rather sudden and a abrupt loss of their sex hormones. And that's, you know, to be contrasted with the way men's sex hormones kind of decline over time a little more slowly. So again, the listeners of this podcast are highly area-dite and they won't need like the lengthy dissertation, but just give us a quick overview of what the heck is happening in menopause. Why is it happening? And then we can get into maybe what some of the symptoms are before women might really notice them. Yeah, well, you know, I certainly did my research and I am not a car person, but I know you are a Formula One guy. And I got a very interesting email last week that said, Dr. Rubin, my wife is seeing your practice and she, her libido is now like an F1, Formula One race car and I'm like a 1988 Honda Civic. What can you do for me? And I think that really my analogy I really like to look at is sort of the gas tank analogy. This idea that men, as they age, you know, sometimes we see a decrease in their gas tank. They're feeling low, they're feeling down, they've got erectile dysfunction low libido. Whereas women, age at age 52, their gas tank is empty, right? This is a castration event. We don't have many castration events in men's health. And so menopause is sort of a, your gas tank is officially empty. There's not much in the tank. Perry menopause is this time where it's very erratic. The gas tank is over full and then it goes to empty really quickly without warning. And so I like that analogy because I think it's helpful when we're talking to women about the reason you don't feel like yourself is because there's just no gas in the tank. So we see the ovaries are no longer producing estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, the way that they were during your reproductive years. I love that analogy. I've never heard it before, but it absolutely replicates what of course we see clinically, which is in Perry menopause. Why do we sometimes when we're measuring a woman's labs say every three months see periods where estradile is through the roof, FSH and LH are low and three months later it's completely flipped and of course with it go symptom. So can you explain why there's this, you know, if we have kind of hormones running like this during premenopause, they're like this during menopause, but it's this transition is nothing like linear. It looks kind of like the stock market actually, it goes up, it goes down and even it's not even just checking every three months. If you check it every 10 days, you're going to see a fluctuation. I'm obsessed with looking at the menstrual cycle. I'm obsessed with talking about numbers here because it is so fascinating and we are not taught to think this way and so I have a lot of curiosity about it. So for example, when you're in your, let's call it healthy reproductive years and by the way, nobody is the book, right? We think of that you talk a lot about continuous glucose monitors. I would love continuous hormone monitors and unfortunately I know there'll be a lot of unintended consequences in bad things that would come of you, but I'd be very interested because the book says, our low. So if you have your period that you're bleeding, that's day one, your low is not zero, right? In fact, it's probably somewhere 40, 50 is probably what the low should be of estrogen. That's true, that's true. And that's, you know, a peakograms per milliliter as opposed to testosterone, which we do nanograms per desoliter as you know. So, so, probably let's say 50 is your low. Then you go at ovulate and that's in your mid cycle and usually it's about 150. Let's say ish, maybe it's 200, 300, whatever it is. Pregnancy or level is 3000 or higher, right? It's very high. And so if you're in your normal reproductive cycle, you go from 50 to 150. So let's use the gas tank analogy. You're at a quarter, 10 get 50 and you go to three quarters tank at 150, then down to a quarter tank, you can drive wherever you want to go, you know, during that time. What happens in Perry, Mana Pause? And it is this chaos and erratic sort of fluctuation where your body is just wanting more hormone than it has your brain, your FSH is telling your eggs to do more than they can, sometimes they over-shoot. So now you are overflowing gas. We've seen Estr, I had a lady come in, you know, her day one, her estrogen was 200 and her day 10, her estrogen was 900, right? So this is his wild fluctuation in Perry, Mana Pause. And what I'd like to do now, just is make sure that anybody listening who wants a more nuanced overview of this, we're going to link to a video that I made a couple of years ago where I walk through the ovulatory cycle. And I draw the graph of estrogen, progesterone, FSH and LH, according to the nomenclature you're using by days. But let's also have you do an explanation now of the role of FSH and LH on the brain, because you've already referred to that. And what the feedback cycle looks like with estrogen, I just want to make sure people are following the physiology you're describing. And that video is so fantastic. We actually were talking about it before doing this podcast about that video. And I said, you know, if you asked most OBGYNs to draw the menstrual cycle, many of them wouldn't be able to do so. It's incredibly complicated and it's so confusing and we think our doctors know everything and unfortunately they don't. And so what happens is estrogen, you know, again, you have your period, your lining of your uterus is shedding, your estrogen is kind of it. It's all time low. And again, just to make the obvious statement, it's because most of the time when a woman ovulates, she does not get pregnant. Right. So that's why it's in this non-pregnancy state, right? You didn't make a baby, you're shedding the lining, your estrogen's about 50. Let's say to make it easy. Now it's starting to up, up, up, up, up and you're developing this follicle, right? So this egg is developing and then as your, you know, the LH is sort of your brain's sort of marker of, okay, it's time to ovulate. So that's when you pion a stick and you're trying to check if you're ovulating, it's checking your LH levels. And so you're going to see this increase in LH, that happens again. Everyone's a little bit different, but it happens kind of mid-cycle day 10 to 14, you know, somewhere along that again, you're all just not gynecologist. And so you get this LH surge, the egg pops out and it is the shell of the egg that creates the progesterone surge. So you actually don't make any progesterone really in that first half of your cycle. And then after ovulation, we call the second half the Ludial phase, which just means, you know, sort of that's when progesterone is around. And so you get this surge of progesterone when there is no fertilization, that that shell of the egg sort of evaporates and then you lose your progesterone and it is that withdrawal of progesterone that causes the uterine lining to shed. Now again, this is very confusing for people because hormones through that time, your ester, your progesterone goes from very, very low to after you ovulate, very, very high. And it's that cycle every month. Now, estrogen again goes from 50 to 150 back down to 50. That's what the book says. I don't know about you, but my patients are not all on the book, right? There's sort of- Yeah, a lot of my patients don't read the book about what their physiology is supposed to do. It's very disappointing. I agree completely. And so we're super interested in this is really trying- because we care about how people are feeling, right? And so everyone- you know, I'll say, I may say this a lot during our conversation is there's the book answer, there's the Instagram answer, and then my answer sort of somewhere in the middle, right? Is how we sort of talk about it and understand it. And so again, I think the numbers are helpful for people to see when you're pregnant, your estrogen's 3000. When you're sort of regularly ovulating, it's 50 to 150. Perry menopause, it could be zero, it could be a thousand, and down to zero in two seconds. So let's talk about why. So why is it that in Perry menopause the fluctuations in ester dial level are so dramatic? I think it has to do with the fact that you have a limited number of eggs, you're sort of getting to that end of your, you know, sort of bucket of eggs that you're born with, and sort of, and that's again controversial on the internet. And then so your body is really trying to do what it has always done, and it's just having trouble. It's having trouble recruiting the egg, ovulating, you don't ovulate every time, sometimes you ovulate twice, you know, or push out two eggs sort of in this Perry menopause cycle. So we can sometimes see really like high elevations, which can come with symptoms. And that's the challenge of Perry menopause is sometimes you have symptoms because you're too low, sometimes you have symptoms because you're too high, and sometimes it's that fluctuation. Like again, we'll go to the car model. You're driving a hundred miles an hour on the highway, and you go to empty gas tank immediately. That is not good for a car. That is inflammation. That is irritation. That is a lot of, you know, that is a lot of Perry menopause symptom. And so maybe to extend the analogy, part of the reason why a woman during this period of time can experience these enormous surges of estradile is if you think that there's say, a tank in the gas line, and you really, really want to squeeze the, the, the lever to get as much gasoline as you can in the car, sometimes you overshoot, and just you got a whole bunch extra in there, because again, you're, there's, there's volatility in the, in the follicle release. I know you would like this analogy. Yeah, no, I love it. You're welcome. The one other thing I want to talk about, because it's going to come up later when we get to HRT is, do you buy the argument, which is, the argument I have found most appealing, as to why women have varying degrees of sensitivity to the dramatic reduction in progesterone that they experience in the last quarter of the cycle, once the lining shed. So we talked about how, of course, during the Ludial phase, we're building you know, progesterone levels are rising. We're building up the enemy trio lining in preparation for pregnancy. Again, most of the times that's not going to happen, lining shed, progesterone crashes. This is what's referred to as, you know, obviously, PMS, and some women are somewhat unfazed by that, you know, and other women that's a big deal. And so the question is, is this about central receptors of progesterone and varying degrees of sensitivity? I think is a really important question, and we see this clinically all the time, right, in that if you give somebody, say, micronized progesterone or e synthetic progesterone, say, in birth control, you will see a wide variety of reactions to these different medications. And so I would say it has to probably do with the GABA receptor, right, and the metabolites of progesterone and how the body, you know, how the receptors in the brain sort of use these molecules. And so I think we just don't know enough about, you know, I tell my patients all the time, I wish, oh my gosh, we've so much work to do in women's health. We have so much research, we need done. This is why I come on this platform, not because I want to be on this platform, but I need smart people to be listening to this, to ask the research questions and to do this research, because clinically we see this all the time. You give it, you know, somebody, and I will pull up, put up that menstrual cycle with my patients and say, when do you start to have symptoms? Are you having symptoms when your estrogen is falling? Are you having symptoms when your progesterone is falling? And can we sort of hack the system to help you feel better and how are you going to respond to it? Because when we give someone micronized progesterone, I would say a third of the patients love it and guzzle it like it's candy and they're the happiest people in the world helps their sleep, they're just as anxiety changes their life. It's absolutely life-changing. A third of the patients are like, I don't really notice, it doesn't bother me, I've got no, you know, it's fine like it. But if you come, I need to take it, I need to take it, I don't need to take it, my uterus, no problem. And then you've got a third of patients who are very sensitive, right? The progesterone. And even within that third, it is extreme. I mean, we see progesterone allergies where people have horrible reactions to it makes me too sleepy, it makes me feel bloated, I don't like this. And so I don't as a clinician and an interested researcher, like I don't know exactly enough to be able to spot who those people are ahead of time. We've established now what's happening? We've established that during the period of parry menopause, the one consistent thing that's happening is inconsistency. At some point, we get to the place where the consistency returns, but now it's a new norm. And that new norm is, you don't make estrogen, you don't make progesterone. The signal from your pituitary, FSH and LH, begin monotonically rising, rising rising. And so, you know, if you were to do the blood work of a woman in her 60s, who had never been placed on HRT, you would see a very high FSH, a very high LH, usually above the labs cut off for measurements, you know. And then Estrodial and Progesterone non-existent. Let's talk about all the reasons why that woman that I just described in her 60s, who is now 10 years out of any hormones, what are the risks to her physical health, mental health, emotional health, the whole picture of her health, cognitive health, everything. What is what is she worse off for at that period of time? So I think there's a really important question in the sense of what is the risk of taking hormone therapy in that patient? And what is the risk of not taking hormone therapy in that patient? And so I think it's super interesting because we love talking about the risks of medication, but we don't spend a lot of time time of the risks of not taking medication. So if we think about that woman as she gets older, she certainly will have the microbiome in genital and urinary changes of not having hormone. So as a urologist, this is the actually one of the things that one of the couple things that will kill her, right? As the u-lose hormones in the genitals, which are very hormone sensitive, the bladder is very hormone sensitive, you change the microbiome, you decrease the acidity of the tissue, the bad bacteria grow, your risk of urinary traction infections increased drastically. So she may get recurrent urinary tract infections or pelvic pain. She may develop osteoporosis, right, which we know more people dive hip fractures about the same with dive hip fractures as dive breast cancer. So the risk of not taking hormone therapy, when you get a hip fracture as all of your listeners know, you're going back to the life that you lived is very challenging, right? Or you die. And so there's also the risk of we know dementia and Alzheimer's much higher in women and we can argue the data and I don't think we actually have good data about whether hormones are, you know, when to start them and if they're actually protective and how they're protective, but we also know that heart disease is the number one killer of women and we know that things get worse as you get older. So I think there are significant risks to that person and from the mental health perspective, I think there's no question that we see worsening of, now I will say, Perry menopause from what I understand of the data is actually worse on mental health and can actually love a lot a little bit once there's less erratic hormones. But again, an empty gas tank is still an empty gas tank and so we see a lot of challenges, you know, sort of in this time period. We talked about obviously the risk of dementia, talked about the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, right, all of these are risks that are pretty clearly going up in the absence of hormones. So do you want to talk about the history of HRT? I mean, you know, it was a largely normal practice in the 1960s. They, you know, certainly had some fits and starts, right? They initially were just replacing estrogen. Figured out pretty quickly. I mean, within a few years that if you only gave a woman estrogen, you were going to run the risk of endometrial cancer going up because the endometrial lining just continued to get bigger and bigger and bigger and you eventually developed hyperplasia, which presumably became metaplasia and ultimately cancer. They figured out pretty quickly how to combat that if you just oppose the estrogen with progesterone, you keep the endometrial lining in check and this largely became the standard of care through the 1980s and into the 1990s and this was largely validated by epidemiologic observations, which showed that women who took hormones did significantly better. Now, people who listen to this podcast are well aware of how critical I am of epidemiology and it's certainly very easy to make the case that in the 1980s, women who were taking hormones had a healthy user bias, right? These are women that probably had better access to health care. They were probably more health conscious and as a result, they were probably doing many more things to improve the quality of their health. So the NIH did something that I think made a lot of sense. It was the right thing to do, which was they said, look, we can't rely on this epidemiology. We need to do a randomized control trial. They did it through something called the Women's Health Initiative, which had two components, a nutritional component that was asking a question about low-fat diets and then a component that was looking at the HRT. Would you like to pick up the story as to how the study was designed? Maybe talk about some of the potential pitfalls of it and ultimately how the results of that have been misunderstood and misinterpreted for so long? The fact of the story hasn't been made into a Hollywood biopic mega drama. I don't know, right? This is a big deal, a billion dollars of our resources went into doing this study and there are many things that we learned that were helpful and useful and this huge set of data that we're still using today to extrapolate information from and there was a lot of good that came from it, but there was a lot of misinformation and just really bad marketing or really effective marketing you could argue because what is so wild Peter is that when this study came out and they did a press conference. Before the study was published, they did a press conference. Have you ever seen the NIH do a press conference? That Matt Lauer talked about or that was made it on you, you know, like good morning America, like they did a press conference. I remember I was in medical school at the time, like I remember sort of this happening and they said, okay, this we had to stop the study early. It is increasing the risk of breast cancer and increasing the risk of blood clots and cardiovascular disease and we have to stop the study and everybody this there's different statistics out there but people say about 40 percent maybe of women were on hormone therapy at the time overnight it went across to nothing. You're talking billions of dollars of an industry went to nothing and the people who are prescribing the hormone therapy were like this doesn't make any sense. I do this. I've been doing this for 20 years, 30 years. I don't have a clinic full of people who are dying of blood clots or heart attacks or who get breast cancer like this is not my clinic whose clinic is this and then over the years, you know, then they published the paper and as we talked about or, you know, before we did this podcast is that they misinterpreted the data so drastically and scared everybody so with so much fear that you actually have an entire generation that has forgotten how to prescribe hormone therapy and this is where the nightmare that we're living in today because now we realize that the data was misinterpreted. So if we talk about and again and the WHI was one medication, one dose, that's it and it was a sort of birth control pill style kind of hormone therapy so a synthetic estrogen and a progestin it was not sort of the what we call you know more and we can talk about the marketing term bio identical but the FDA proved products that we used today like Astridile and progesterone their different medications that we used today and so you're talking one medication, one dose and we are still practicing fear-based medicine 30 years later whatever it is saying like we don't practice any other medicine like this. Well there was one study about surgery 30 years ago and that's the way we practice medicine, right? We evolve we learn new things. So what it is show let's talk about the good. When you took Astridin and progestin or Astridin alone you had a decrease risk of colon cancer, you had decreased risk of fractures like significant decrease of fractures, decrease of diabetes okay that seems like a good thing. This is in the hormones we don't even really prescribe anymore right? We saw a decrease in overall mortality, a decrease in cancer specific mortality and then when you looked at the cardiovascular data over time and again I'm a neurologist I'm not a heart expert but you saw there was actually no difference right? It actually wasn't so scary. Now as you get older we know birth control pills can cause blood clots so we do worry about giving a birth control pill to grandma because you can increase blood clots right? That's true. I agree with that. When it comes to breast cancer the most fascinating data that didn't make the press conference. Women who were on the Astridin alone so they didn't have a uterus so they didn't need the progestin therapy. Had a decrease risk of getting and dying from breast cancer right? And that didn't make the new estrogen was never this, even in that study that put the box labeling on all the products it's not true right? So then when you looked at the estrogen and the progestin groups there was a fear that there was an increased risk of incidence but not mortality from breast cancer and even when you look at that data there is questioning of the fact that the placebo group actually was more protected by breast cancer because many of them had been on hormones in the past and when you use a correct placebo group the the lines actually go together and so you're more of a statistics nerd than I am but the reality is there was no difference and so we scared an entire generation of people away from hormones because of a bad misinterpretation of statistics. So Rachel I don't know how good you are at sensing a person's blood pressure from across the room but if you were able to sort of project your your your vision into my carotid artery I see a bulgey. Yeah you you'd notice that my my blood pressure is up it I'm probably at 180 over 120 right now. First off I think that was a remarkable succinct summation of the WHO. I'm only going to repeat a few things. Bec not because I didn't think you did a great job you did but because sometimes hearing it twice highlights the egregiousness of this study. Shout it from every rooftop you can find. And truthfully I have friends, female friends and I have patients who to this day are paranoid about hormones and I just I want to offer yet another opportunity for them to sort of understand what's going on. So this was a study that had you know two parallel arms right one where women without the uterus were just randomized to either this synthetic or equine-based estrogen versus a placebo and then one where if you had a uterus you got MPA a synthetic progesterine and the estrogen. As you pointed out the elephant in the room here was the one finding that got all of the attention was that in the women with uterus group if you got the synthetic progesterine and estrogen you had an increase in your incidence of breast cancer. It turned out it didn't actually lead to any change in mortality from breast cancer but there was an increase in the incidence. Now the number is really scary if it's given in relative terms. It was a 24% increase in the incidence incidence for the listener meaning getting breast cancer right. So you had a 24% higher chance of getting breast cancer if you took the two hormones. On the surface that sounds devastating but again as people who lose in this podcast know we always need to think in terms of absolute risk. And relative risk doesn't mean that much if you don't understand absolute risk. So if I said to you Rachel I have a treatment for you that is going to fix a hundred problems but it increases your risk by 100% of getting hit by an asteroid. Would you take the medicine or not? Well you'd have to know what your base level risk of getting hit by an asteroid is and given that it's almost zero doubling it doesn't mean anything right. So the absolute risk increase for these women was 0.1%. So to put that in less technical terms it meant that you will even if you believe the results of that study and you've offered a great explanation for why the actual results should be questioned but even if you take them at face value for every one thousand women who were put on HRT an additional one got breast cancer though she didn't die from it at any increase rate to the women who didn't get the hormone. This to me is and I'd like you to push back on this although I'm worried you won't be able to because you share my bias. This is the greatest injustice imposed by the modern medical system in our lifetime. You are not going to get pushed back from me on that. I think women's I think that this is a disaster. I just got back yesterday from teaching at the largest internal medicine conference ACP the American College of Physicians and you're talking more than 20,000 internal medicine physicians. I was asked what a wonderful thing I was asked to give a course on female sexual dysfunction and it was wonderful. I talked a lot about menopause. There was no other menopause content at this course. There was no courses. How to prescribe. Given everything you've done my colleagues and myself have done to bring it into sort of just popularity. Patients are coming in asking questions and there wasn't even a course to learn. I can't say that's true for GLP ones or any of these lipid lowering agents or all of the things that you've been pushing. The problem is you now have a you have a brain drain I think because the doctors who prescribed hormone therapy either retired or died right and there was no one they taught ahead of them. Now I was very lucky. I had very good mentorship and incredible experience but we are now trying to make up for a last time to train people how to write prescription. It's not enough to say hey the WHI was misinterpreted and we've done a bad thing for people don't know how to do this and it's not a small, it's a huge problem and the reality is this is half the population. This is not niche medicine. The fact that menopause medicine is the tiniest little room of subset of gynecology which it should not be under gynecology, right? This is whole body medicine and yet nobody seems to care. Yeah it's really interesting to hear you say that because you're highlighting something that's as dramatic and potentially more dramatic than the thing I've tended to focus on. I've focused more so maybe I just take for granted that I got lucky and I had amazing mentors and they taught me how to do this stuff but it's also the nature of my personality to just be endlessly curious and show up in somebody's clinic for two weeks and do this. I've tended to focus on the lost generation of women, right? So I had my analysts do this analysis two years ago and I don't remember the exact numbers but the analysis was calculate for me or estimate for me the number of women who were deprived of HRT because of the WHO and calculate the excess mortality that was achieved through that injustice, through hip fractures, cardiovascular disease. We just went through the entire list, right? So calculate the number of lives that were lost the amount of disability that was incurred because to your point even if you don't die from a hip fracture 50% of survivors never regain the same level of function and I didn't even know how to quantify all of the sexual side effects that women unnecessarily endured all of the vasomotor side effects that they unnecessarily didn't even try to quantify that because I don't know how to but that's the thing that I focus on and again it's personal to someone my age because my mother and my mother and law are in that category, right? Like they're the ones that got absolutely screwed by this system. You're highlighting something equally and potentially catastrophic with potentially a greater impact which is we failed to train a generation of doctors to do anything about it and if that's not reversed the problem doesn't get much better. Yeah I mean the data's very clear on this right less than 6% of internal medicine OBGYN or family practice doctors get even an hour of menopause education in their training. Do you remember learning about menopause in your medical school? Zero. Zero. One minute. I didn't learn one minute of it and so here's the... I did learn that hormones were bad. Oh yeah you were right. So there's this so because you are taught hormones are dangerous or the bodybuilders take the hormones the snake oil salesmen take the hormones right like we don't talk about this in real medicine right so you actually have everyone says it's not my it's not my it industry it's not my thing I went to this internal medicine conference you know yesterday and all the internal medicine doctors were saying but this isn't this isn't my field like I don't feel comfortable right and endocrinologist was standing there saying I don't feel comfortable doing this I think you're a hormone doctor like that is what you do it is so embarrassing I've been asked to speak at multiple academic centers to teach on hormone therapy and every time I'm like is this real life I am a urologist teaching hormone doctors about how to prescribe hormone therapy and it is real life and this is why I'm so loud about it because we have to change this we have to change this on a big level because I need the ICU doctors and the pulmonologist and the card in the you know the heart doctors and all the doctors to know that menopause affects their organs right colon cancer why aren't why aren't GI doctors talking to women that estrogen prevents colon cancer why are we checking dexas at 65 like why are rheumatologists not prescribing hormone therapy I found out recently that psychiatrists because I do a lot of teaching about how to prescribe hormone therapy a few of us are very passionate about it and I was like sit with me I will teach you how to write the prescriptions I've had psychiatrists tell me their malpractice insurance will not cover them if they prescribe hormone therapy and I said wait a minute you prescribe post-partum depression drugs which are pregesting based right you do reproductive psychiatry which means birth control is a part of what you do and you're being told you're not allowed to prescribe hormone therapy when hormone therapy is one of the greatest antidepressants in the history of medicine it is insanity we're living in a nightmare yeah so let's talk a little bit about how we go about doing things so there are two hormones we've talked a lot about but there's a third that we haven't yet talked about that is very linked to these two hormones doesn't get enough attention in women and of course that's testosterone so before we get into how one should think about replacing hormones can you talk about the relationship of testosterone to women's sexual health and what's happening to testosterone levels during this transition from parry to menopause because of course this I want to bring this into the HRT discussion so it's super interesting and I'm very passionate about this topic and so I think it comes from this idea that I do testosterone for men all the time right I'm very confident I love prescribing testosterone for men's sexual health for and actually very interestingly enough when we prescribe testosterone for men remember their gas tank doesn't get empty it gets low right it's off label right we are doing off label testosterone therapy and men unless they have client filters or some you know significant medical problem like we're doing off label testosterone for men and it's very understood it's talked about the FDA just three weeks ago remove the labeling on testosterone therapy saying it no longer is a cardiovascular disease risk so that's a great news right so the thing about women in testosterone is it's actually not a menopause thing testosterone is an age related to client so in your 30s you're starting to drop your testosterone and testosterone I don't know who said who decided that men get testosterone and women have estrogen like we both have all of the heart like we we have both of the hormones sorry interrupt you probably heard me make this point before because you alluded to it a few minutes ago we measured testosterone in nanograms predestilator we measure estradiol and peakograms per milliliter if you normalize those to the same level women are shocked to learn that they have ten times the amount of testosterone in their body that they do estradiol at peak estradiol we way more right and I love sharing that right when you put everything in the same units we are testosterone driven beings both of us right are testosterone driven beings and so it's you know again and we don't teach this to OBGYNs no OBGYN knows what some do but but very few know about the role of testosterone in women's health and so we love to gaslight women and say well if you have your period your hormones are normal drives me insane this women are told this all day every day is well you you can't possibly have a hormone problem because you're getting your period regularly and the reality is is that's not true why because if no one taught that that curve that curve we were just talking about testosterone is nowhere on that curve and so we know there's a peak of testosterone around ovulation right that is nature's way of saying let's make a baby we know that we know that your libido goes up around ovulation because your testosterone goes up and so there is this age related decline in testosterone and here's another big problem we give women birth control pills all the time how does birth control work by the way birth control is high dose hormone therapy we love hormone therapy in birth control but as soon as you become menopause everybody's afraid of hormone therapy it makes no sense so birth control is high dose I would argue you know sort of the hormone therapy we're talking about the WHO that is more synthetic that has side effects that have issues like that so birth control turns off your ovaries and it adds back a final ester dial and a synthetic pregestin it doesn't add back testosterone so we are botching testosterone for women sort of for along the life cycle to be honest but if you take someone who's never been on birth control their testosterone starts to drop in their 30s so what are they complaining about it's not just a libido thing we know their testosterone receptors all throughout the genitals and the urinary tract so we see women have an increased risk of UTIs we see an increased risk of pain within her course or pelvic pain conditions we see there are some studies that indicate potentially depression and anxiety can increase because we do think there's a testosterone effects on the brain but we have global consensus and I don't know if you've read the news lately Peter but like we don't agree on too much as a globe but there is global consensus that testosterone and women works for low libido and so specifically the data is on postmenopausal women that's where the global consensus is but there is data in Perry menopause and much smaller studies on before that so but the consensus is it works but everyone has emotions about testosterone I don't know I didn't think testosterone was appealing but apparently it is a feeling for people because people hate talking about it and again nobody taught you how to prescribe it so people are and there's no FDA approved products for women except in Australia it's approved by their their governing body and so you have a lost art of knowing how to give people back testosterone when they are symptomatic and I think this is an area where women sometimes are also a bit concerned about what happens if I take testosterone because testosterone understandably has conjures up images of all sorts of things from large muscles big moustaches lots of other things so so how do you talk to women about this we we enjoy having these discussions and and also acknowledging side effects right like the most common side effect we see in women is acne right and and I don't think I've ever gotten to the point where I've seen any of the really dramatic side effects but I do tell women I say look there's a decent chance if you were shaving your legs every five days you're going to be shaving them every three days that that's that's a chance if you were kind of susceptible to acne growing up you might get a little bit more but it will have to back off um but how do you how do you talk about the risks of testosterone therapy I love talking about this and I'm actually grateful for celebrities because just in the news in the past few weeks Hallie Berry says she's on testosterone Kate Winslet says she's on testosterone therapy and they look pretty amazing to me and they don't look androgenized at all and so I actually want to do this study it's something my research team's working on is I think I have more patience who never start testosterone therapy because of the fear of side effects then actually stop testosterone therapy because of the side effects that's my sort of observation in doing a lot of this now when we talk about side effects I tell them think about a foreign teenager they have these great libidos but they have some oily skin acne you know but that's when you get really high with your doses we really don't see it clinically yes could you I tell them to put the I I use FDA proved to testosterone for men just a doses kind of one tenth the dose in a way they rub it on their leg because if they do get hair on their leg people are used to having hair on their leg and so they shave it they wax it they laser it whatever it is that they do with hair would leg hair um I don't have that many patients stop for acne oily skin again I think there's that fear when you get really high in the dose so I'm not a pellet a promoter or user because you get super physiologic levels and I can't take it out if you get a pellet put in and so if you have deepening voice or clitoromegally or you know a hair issues these are the challenges with some of these super physiologic levels but when we're using sort of reasonably dosed like topicals we really see magic happen and and I can't tell you when we get estrogen and progesterone right for our patients it is by adding that third piece that testosterone because your ovary does three it probably does more than three things but at this point estrogen progesterone and testosterone when we add that testosterone piece I it's wild although the patients come back and they say me wow I feel like me again it's wild right that's the piece wow I didn't realize how badly I felt wow that was the missing piece I hear it over and over and over again I can't not want that for all women right I can't not want to give them that as an option on the menu let's just finish the swing on on testosterone do you prefer than to rely on the topical version of which would be like an androgyl type product and just dose it at a much smaller dose yeah that's typically how we do it and how our guideline sort of look at it so is wish the international society for the study of women sexual health fabulous organization you can find any doctor to help you with menopause and sexual health by going to their website they came out with a really lovely sort of how to practice guideline that they took from the global consensus and they do recommend using sort of that FDA approved testosterone for men and using it at appropriately doses for females so I like test them which is sort of the one percent generic testosterone gel I brought I'll show it to you I brought it for you to show you it's a it's a five milliliter tube of gel our male patients would use the whole tube of gel rub it on their chest every day I very few men who do that by the way they injections orals those are much better and so I tell my patients use a blob or a point five ml so they can put in a syringe if they want to and dose out that point five ml they take a blob they rub it on their calf every day and so just don't use the whole tube should last you about a week or 10 days that's kind of it's an ish right like it's it's not an exact precision science but the patients can figure this out it's not that challenging and I I will say this and I think I've colleagues who disagree with me on this and I would love to know your experience I think testosterone I think for men too but that's my bias it takes a while to kick in like I will tell patients like you need to do this regularly and I think it's gonna be three four even five months before you're gonna really wake up and say wow this is working oh my gosh like someone just walked across the street and I did a cartoon style head turn with my eyes popped out of my head oh my gosh I initiated sex wow that orgasm was easier to have right it's these are the things that patients notice I also get patients telling me there's stress and continents is slightly improved why because of your reads for a has to stoster on receptors and we know that for all genders and these these are kinds of things my patients will report but I think I don't know what do you think I think it takes a while hmm it's an interesting question um I mean I definitely agree that that's true for some people that said I've also seen people who within weeks report feeling better now the challenge here of course is the only way you could understand this is through blinding right we just don't know how significant the placebo effect is and and therefore it's hard for me to to discount or know what we do because we have studies on testosterone which show I mean within my observation yes I want to ask you another question about netesto so netesto for the listener is a nasal formulation it's an FDA approved formulation um we've in theory it seems like a great idea then practice it has not really paned out just based on its messiness it's it's a gel a nasal gel we've had women use it vaginally you know nausily like what's your experience been with it so it's getting harder and harder to find these days and so I think similarly we've been interested in it and people have played with it before this idea can you do you know one squirt into your nobody likes to squirt things in there it is it turns out and so it's a challenge now I also any of these topical testosterone formulations a lot of them have alcohol in them so I don't recommend putting them on your genitals directly um but I do think it needs to be studied for this you know it's it's challenging finding the formulation of testosterone that is low enough like from the male side because we have lots of formulations for men that is low enough to kind of give an appropriate dose why isn't a female formulation being made buckle up buttercup so here we go we had a billion dollars that was put into it a billion dollars and a five-year study that was done at the FDA and it showed it was safe it showed that it was effective it showed that it was fine it wasn't that's here's the the TLDR on testosterone is it's not that serious right we wanted to be serious again not a feeling we wanted to be like all about aggression it's not it's not a feeling like it truly isn't um and so they did five years of study a billion dollars went into it and the FDA came back and they said oh women have breast tissue so we're gonna need five more years of data and another billion dollar study and every company was like I'm out right the benchmark was different for women men six months and this was a real goal post move yeah they just keep moving the goal post everywhere they move the damn goal post okay I talked about the labeling on testosterone being removed that it does in worse than cardiovascular disease why because they did the traverse study that your listeners know about that proved it the box labeling on estrogen products which says that estrogen causes stroke blood clots heart attacks probable dementia like we just got done saying that that study didn't show that so why is that box labeling still there we're killing women by trying to protect them why do you think this is happening if you if you if you try to steal man the case for the other side where where are they in their thinking on this I think medicine has a humility problem and a a deeply ability to say hey we didn't we didn't know what we didn't know back then we're learning and we're adjusting they don't like to say I don't know they don't like to say to evolve in their thinking and for some reason women's health comes with so much bias and it is the amount of money that goes into women's health research is like worse than it was 10 years ago right like like this is a paternalistic I mean I hate to put sort of sociology on top of this but what like again when I I as you know I spoken with one of the PIs from the WHI and I think she is by far the most honest broker of that group and I don't have good things to say about that group I really don't but I also can't even wrap my head around their thinking like I can't steal man their case I wake up in the morning and like how is this real life like we met okay I'll give you an example we met with the chief for the administration chain we met with the the I think it was the the chief medical officer of the FDA we were someone high up at the FDA it was a room full of parry menopausal women I was like yeah we got this it's a room full of parry menopausal women and we presented our case about vaginal hormones which is basically micro dosing hormones and they prevent UTIs by more than half when you use vaginal hormones you treat the genital urinary syndrome of menopaus and we said to them we said you're labeling this should not have the same label of all estrogen products you should remove the labeling and they said well we're really going to need industry to come at us to remove the labeling I said you didn't need industry to put the box on why do you need industry to remove the box but we no longer have industry in this field in any significant way because the WHI destroyed that industry so we have a huge problem where you actually don't have any money to his women's health I think Pfizer completely fired their women's health division saying yeah we're gonna look at allergy now you have entire department we did a study once on pelvic pain we were really in botulinum toxin and pelvic pain and I was on the call where they said oh we have a new CEO now and women's health is no longer priority like I heard those words so we do have a paternalistic problem we it's true and unfortunately it's not getting any better I usually do not subscribe to to theories like that I usually find myself thinking there are alternative explanations and we're just pointing to the most sensational ones but it gets hard to dismiss an argument as follows right which is if the tables were turned and the WHI was really the you know MHI right the men's health initiative and it produced equally idiotic results would we be in the same place we are today or would men have said oh hell no to the traverse trial right there were two bad studies that were done horrible studies that made no sense that showed testosterone had some dangers so they the FDA threw that box labeling on sit oh my gosh within minutes they created the traverse trial it got done in five years and within minutes when it was finished and it got published in the New England Journal of Medicine the box was removed and by the way the traverse trials not even a great trial like I've been so critical of the traverse trial I think you could have come to the same conclusion of the traverse trial if you knew how to read all of the data before and actually don't think the traverse trial added much but anyway yeah but that's the point I think totally because you could look at data oh there was an increased fractures from the top testosterone causes fractures that makes no sense we know that's not true we know testosterone helps bone mineral density and so you can make the same arguments of how you look at these studies how these studies are designed the flaws of them you're going to do a study for five years why are you giving people gels you know is that the right thing so why are we looking why do we care what the people of the women's health initiative said 20 years ago why is that even news right and why can't it die and because you don't have enough people like you standing up you don't have the internal medicine doctor standing up and saying this is wrong because they're not teaching it right you don't have the OBGYN saying this is wrong because they're delivering babies and women are dying in childbirth women's health like men up has health in particular is important to nobody right and when it's nobody's problem nobody takes ownership of it yeah I mean I do believe this is going to change and I and I don't know who said this but it's it's a it's a great quote that said funeral by funeral science makes progress and so you know that's not a that's not a that's not a great explanation for what's about to happen temporarily because you know it's going to be a while before everybody who held that belief in their in their soul is no longer around but it it does give me hope that a new generation of women will come along and take ownership over their health and and and look I've seen a change in 10 years I mean 10 years ago when I was prescribing hormones to women you cannot believe the fights I would have with their other doctors and I don't mean like you know we weren't fist fighting but they were scolding me like how dare you you know and they but but but it came with an arrogance of in at a lack of willingness to even look at the data now which I found ironic right it's like if if you want to scold me you better know as much as me and hopefully more but the this this sort of arrogance of I'm going to scold you but I know nothing and I'm not actually willing to have a discussion with you because I'd be like great let's let's turn to figure two in the jam up paper and let's look at this and look at the appendix and look at the supplemental data like are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing can we at least agree on the fact no we can't and it's so fascinating because I would never I would never tell my I do sexual medicine so I look at the whole patient I look at everything and I would never say to them hey you're you have to stop this beta blocker right now because it's causing your erectile dysfunction right I would never tell a patient that though the beta blocker may be worsening his erectile dysfunction but I would never say stop this medicine it's kill it's hurting you right I would talk to their doctor I would have a conversation but there's something about hormones that doctors who know nothing feel very confident in saying you can't be on this you must stop this without even having that curiosity of huh I wonder if the person who prescribed it actually knew what they were talking about and it is it is everywhere right we see this all the time now let's talk about the flip side because the unfortunate nature of everything we've just described is you create a fringe movement and unfortunately I've seen a lot of doc on a box hormone practices that are I believe putting women at risk and I believe are doing bad things to women in the name of doing good and I don't believe that these are inherently bad individuals I think they are I think they're ill informed I think they're just not that bright and maybe some of them are just actually charlatans and they're seeing an enormous opportunity here as a general rule I tell patients be very very suspicious of a doctor that is selling you hormones be incredibly suspicious of any physician who has their own compounding pharmacy within the practice and is giving you compounded formulations and also making money on it talk a little bit about the I don't want to call it the dark side but just kind of the fringe side of this world so I would argue that people care about their pain points people want to feel better people go to anyone who tells them here's you know there's a whole supplement aisle at CVS that makes all these wildish claims that we're going to help you with everything and the reality is is I just got done saying you're kind of colleges and your internal medicine doctors are going to in that 10 minute visit tell you that you don't need this this is not going to help you and so enter the fringe people the snake oil salesmen the people who are doing wildly inappropriate things that doesn't mean the hormones themselves are bad it just means we have a marketing problem here if we're not doing it and helping people people are you know they hear their friend did it they hear their their neighbor did it and they said I want what she's having right this is why we call ourselves the menopause see this is why we teach so loudly is because we're trying to bring it back into medicine and evidence based medicine and say you can actually do this quite reasonably in fact there are many FDA approved products that work you know much better that are more regulated that are totally safe you know here's what they are they should be covered by your insurance you know and giving them that knowledge because the problem is is when no one is right it's too quiet no one is giving people answers no one's even looking at the questions so then the fringe people take over and are unfortunately doing very inappropriate thing you know what we see this with men's health too right as a urologist we see shot clinics and all these wild PRP clinics and testosterone pellet clinics and compounded pellets and all of these things because my colleagues we are not doing enough to take care of men's sexual health and so these clinics exist to prey on those patients who deeply want to connect and get their answers right which is why my colleagues and I are even loud about it on you know for everybody yeah the number of online testosterone clinics is mind boggling and you know a lot of them are prescribing I think second tier drugs right and you know what I say I say you know with these things is the people who need it are not being offered it and the people who don't need it are abusing it right and that is true for hormones for everybody because they just they just talked about this the last men are pause meeting less than 4% of women are on hormone therapy right now less than 4% that's worse than 4% of eligible women who would be really be required less than 4% that's worse than 10 years ago it is so bad out there I need so I did the same calculations you did when I was on my Uber on the way over I said how many women are over 40 it was something like 84 million according to AI right and I said okay and there are about 3,000 people on the men-upos society website that doesn't mean everybody knows what they're doing or that they all do the same thing but divide 84 million by 3,000 it's a big number and we can't see patient panels of 27,000 people like that does not the math doesn't math there so we need people to step up and write the so who should be writing estrogen prescriptions who every doctor who sees a woman of that age every doctor who sees a woman of that age and so who actually does nobody let's talk a little bit about the playbook I want to tell you how we do it and um I don't I'm not saying we do it right because I don't think there's a right way to do it but I mostly want to hear how you do it because I bet you're way better than than we are. Maybe we take a step back and explain we've already alluded to it twice but I just want to make sure people are understanding this if a woman has a uterus you have to protect that end of me trail lining so even if she's in the camp women who don't notice being on progesterone you have to be on progesterone. We'll come back to IUDs and progesterone coded devices and things like that and let's just talk about the way you get progesterone so the progesterone's the easiest of the lot here right. Is there any reason when giving oral progesterone to use anything other than micronized FDA approved progesterone orally? What's the lovelies we need at toolbox because not everybody responds to the same thing I love micronized progesterone and it's a fabulous product so yes I think it's my go to first line sometimes we need to put it vaginally instead of orally to help with some of those sedating side effects so you can avoid sort of going to the brain if you put it vaginally and so we do find that cuts down a bit. The deer going to start orally. I typically start orally. We're going to start at 100 milligrams depending on your grams. Estrogen I typically start with 100 milligrams some people say you're going higher with your estrogen you may need to do 200 milligrams of progesterone that data is not very clear and so and there's really two ways to give progesterone you could do it every single day right so typically 100 milligrams every day and then some people in a lot of data shows if you do it cyclically like 200 milligrams you know 12 to 14 days out of the month in another way to do it. Both are fine but when we see many patients right they feel better doing it 100 every day because it can help us sleep an anxiety reduction. And do we believe that 100 systemically is sufficient to oppose estrogen? I think that's the way I think there is not enough data there and we need more I think if patients bleed it's a nice tell that maybe they need more progesterone I think there's some interesting that I've learned that some people say if you take it with fat or you take it with something to eat it absorbs better because my you know progesterone's absorbed very well which is why we always had synthetic progestins you know in the first place and so we're still learning sort of the capabilities of micronized progesterone but according to most menopause specialists out there they typically will use 100 milligrams every day or 200 milligrams 12 to 14 days of the month. So the only thing that we do I would say front there is while we start women at 52 a hundred we will generally take them to 200 if tolerated and if not keep them where they are at a hundred but we find women who are in that one third to one half group who are very positively selected towards progesterone they feel fantastic at 200 the most notable improvement is sleep. So would you agree with that that's the thing that most women are just over the moon we have well-sleeved together it is it's so fun to get to get to get sicker and mood improves. And then of course now so now let's talk about the other subset of women and this is a real subset. No question. I would say in our population it's it's about 10 to 20 percent for whom if you bring progesterone in the room something goes wrong. Their mood really changes now it can in some cases become depressive but more commonly what they tell me is and I'm quoting them this is not me saying it I become a raging bitch and I'm worried I might kill my husband so for those women we think progesterone's a bad idea and we then use a progesterone coded iUD so are you doing that or are you using a repository at that point? Yeah you can do either right you can say hey try taking this vaginally and see if that goes away right see if you're no longer feeling anger or bloated or you know have irritability and so vaginally can be an option we love a progesterone coded iUDs right they're great in perimenopause why because people think that you just kind of like lightly like dance into menopause it is like bloody murder healthy and right like you can be terrible you can bleed the whole month you can bleed heavy you can bleed when you're least expecting it so the iUD is very nice because it will stop bleeding and so you throw an estrogen patch on and some testosterone and that's your really great perimenopause plan now you can still take it and get birth control which is very important right and so you can add micronized progesterone to the patient who gets good sleep even if they have an iUD that doesn't add danger we love that right so we love iUDs for this population there's another others and then there's the synthetic progesterons which you can use as well I've seen people do things like slimmed which is a birth control a progesterone only birth control pill at a patch into testosterone to that as well now again a synthetic progestins sometimes can have mood side effects as well so they're not completely benign for all people um there's another uh i don't know if you've used this at all in your practice uh it's called duovey have you heard of this yes so it's just a um it's an oral estrogen but it also has what's called basodoxafine which protects the uterus but is not a progesterone based medicine i wish they were separate i wish we could just give basodoxafine alone any pharmacy so it didn't necessarily have these these oral estrogen if you don't have to now it's again oral estrogen is not evil um you know i'm a sex doctor we know that transdermals a little better for sexual function so that's again why i'm a big fan of transdermal products as well but that's kind of another option for progesterone uh people get uh historic demies for lots of reasons of we've had patients do that who really don't tolerate progesterone and then you can just use estrogen only are you referring women who are on what potentially might be a low dose of progesterone to their gyan for endometrial ultrasounds on some regular intro roll just to look for hyperplasia or anything like that so we really don't like to look for things um the nice thing about endometrial cancer from what i understand again i'm putting my urology hat on i'm not a gynaecologist it bleeds so if you now if you bleed um then if you bleed and you just started a new hormone therapy it's probably okay now for me i like to know if there's any structural things going on to have a polyptoof a fibroid is your lining super thick you know if you're in parry menopause you still should be bleeding right so it's that challenge i don't go looking for things that aren't uh bleeding because i don't necessarily want to find things um and so so no that at this point there's not necessarily a reason for routine surveillance because if you're lining is say six millimeters and you're not bleeding um are you really gonna put that woman through a biopsy and through a hystoroscopy and those have significant you know pain and and problems that go with that as well anything else you want to say about progesterone i think we covered a lot of progesterone now i think do you start it can confidently with the estrogen do you like to start one before the other i like to start one before the other in general because i like to people to know what's doing what i agree because you know when you just give when when someone comes to see us is give it all to me yeah it's always a disaster every time it's a one time it worked well for me but it's pretty much a disaster so i like to stack it so as we can and again you're not going to cause and endometrial cancer in in three months of using just estrogen and you're talking something that takes years and years and years to develop and even that data is not that clear cut so i'm not worried about me causing a uterine cancer now often again we'll start with the estrogen because i feel sometimes you'll start with progesterone if sleep is the major issue but i find like the vasomotor symptoms are so um it's such a big deal to get rid of those so i do like often starting with estrogen and then slowly adding in the other ones yeah that so i'm really happy to we're following your playbook already so yes we almost always start with estradial and we muck around for a while till we get it right and that's why i saved it for last by the way because it's the hardest in my opinion in my experience to get right then we fiddle with progesterone and then testosterone if they're not already on it but to your point some women are coming into pairing menopause already on testosterone okay let's talk about estradial um there are two other estrogens estradial is e2 but there's estron e1 and there's estriol e3 now the FDA only has a battery of approved products around the second estrogen which is the dominant estrogen there's no FDA approved product for estron and there's no FDA approved product for estriol but there are plenty of compounded opportunities around that in fact the most common of them is referred to as biased by estrogen which is an 8020 mix of estriol and estradial um what is your take on why that product exists do you view that as a reaction to the wh i i mean how do you think about it yeah i think as you said it right there i think that what happened happened is the women's health initiative happened in hormone therapy all went into the to the under the alley it went to the alley and i think one of the ways that these alley docked back alley doctors did it was saying oh we're using the safer version we're using this compound and we're gonna make it 8020 and we're gonna use the more safer option by the way i haven't seen that data uh you know and there is no data on biased in large trials that's gonna really tell me what it does and so and we're gonna just use this um and that's what got people through for a while and i don't actually blame those people if they had no alternative right if i were in the middle of the desert and i had the options and i was having horrible symptoms and i had the options of nothing or a biased cream like i'd probably slaughtered the bias cream on me but we don't have we're not in you know it where we are now we have lots of options we have FDA proved options and they're covered by insurance most of the time so i tend i don't prescribe it because i haven't needed to now if i have a patient who comes into me and they're feeling great and they have no problems do i have to change them we'll say well do you want to save some money like we could change you to a different formulation that's an option sometimes i'll even check if they're having symptoms we'll check their levels and i don't know if you find this but their ester dial level is essentially zero it's less than five and i'm saying listen i think you're just using fancy lotion i think you're paying a lot of money to put nice lotion on you and i don't know that it's protecting your bones and if we're using this to protect your bones or to stop your hot flashes or to help with your sexual health maybe we use the formulations that are a little bit better studied and that you know i know our absorbing in your body because i can prove it so that's my i know what's your take on that we don't use it at all i have used it occasionally in the past probably about 10 years ago um largely in women who were terrified of HRT and to your point it was viewed as look if you buy the argument and this is a biochemical argument there's no there's no human data that that demonstrate what i'm about to assert but if you and and again i say this because one can look at a whole bunch of biochemical charts and tables and talk themselves into anything being true but there's there are biochemical arguments to be made that estron and in particular one of them at tabelites of estron and i think it's four hydroxy estron the is the is the estrogen that is driving breast cancer so in an estrogen sensitive breast cancer given that you have so many estrogens is it more likely that one is responsible than another and and so the answer is oh you know some of the data suggests it's four hydroxy estron well estriol has no biochemical path to even get there in other words the there are no series of enzymes that can convert estriol into four hydroxy estron and of course there are pathways that will turn estriol weekly into estro diol so maybe you get a little bit more so in every all there's a long one in a way of saying you know no no no reason at all from an evidence perspective to use it we don't use it have not used it in a decade but that that was my half-baked argument in certain situations and in fact i did use it once in a woman who had breast cancer was adamant that she needed hormones symptomatically she really seemed to want it very badly and i felt that this was a reasonable compromise for what it's worth she got insanely better on the biased so how much of that was from the estriol how much of that was from the estro diol i have no idea when i teach this and i i do a lot of teaching of physicians holding their hands saying you can do this you can write these prescriptions and one of the things that i just keep coming back to is the sentence what are you afraid of right and i love that because when someone says well can i do it in this patient what do you afraid of can i use this product what are you afraid of and it forces i think in menopause medicine the reason we're all struggling is we're not yet at an algorithm or a playbook as you say that it's a one-size-fits-all what's so sexy about this field is we actually have to use our brains we have to use our brains we've to talk to people we've to get to know what's bothering them and we have to do the right tools for them which may be different in each person and so then it becomes you have to also understand what your patience afraid of right because that is the only thing that matters is what you're we take risks all the time i took a risk taking a car to get here right we take risks i with you ever drink alcohol you are taking a risk right we all take these calculated risks and we all have different calculations and so i love to push people of well if you were to use this so so patient comes in on biased uh is that safe well what are you afraid of am i afraid i'm going to hurt this patient i don't think i'm gonna hurt them necessarily but i don't know what's in that compound i don't know if the top of the bottles the same is the bottom of the bottle i don't know if it's good for her bones i don't know if it's absorbing in the way that it should be but i do have studies on FDA approved ester die all right and and then it becomes what am i afraid of with the with the patients well what are you afraid of about the ester die you afraid of cancer because you know that the women's health initiative people who used ester gen had a decrease risk of getting and dying from breast cancer our patients don't know this right yeah and you you mentioned this earlier i think this is one of the biggest limitations of you know how i talk about this thing medicine 2.0 which is very few people are conditioned to ask the question what is the risk of not acting uh you know we we we we we we have a reasonable idea of what is the risk of doing x what is the risk of doing y although in this particular example we seem to get that you know patently wrong but the what's the risk of not doing something is is very significant so let's talk about all of the different ways in which a woman can get ester die all through an approved tested chemically sound means yeah so um a little bit of nomenclature here right there is systemic ester gen right so when we're talking about hormone therapy whether you call it hormone replacement therapy the new way we talk about it is menopause hormone therapy or if you want to just say hormone therapy is totally fine we're talking about hormones for your whole body right uh estrogen for your hot flashes for your bone protection um uh for your skin here in nails right that's estrogen that's systemic estrogen but there's this whole other topic which i hope we talk about later because it's my favorite one which is local vaginal hormones which are to treat the genital and urinary symptoms of menopause and those are pretty much safe no i'm going to say they are safe for every human on earth including your 99 year old mother and law in the nursing home who is potentially could die of urinary tract infection so this is kind of the two separate areas and i think the question you're asking me is let's talk about systemic estrogen with systemic i and we can let's come back to that as we talk about genital urinary yeah because i got a lot to say about that one so systemic estrogen has a toolbox right we have patches we have gels we have rings which go vaginally um we have oral uh ester dial right um we have um those are the big ones there are injections that's kind of an old school way that i kind of use sometimes injections of ester dial valorate or sippianate um and so each one has pros and cons um and it's nice to have the toolbox because not every uh product works for every patient and the key is is getting it right for that patient because you need something that they're going to do and that they're going to do it for a long time because these are not things that you just you know do for a weekend let's start with the oral so we have an oral formulated estrogen um we don't use it that much i'm trying to think used to use it a bit more than than we did now honestly sometimes i would use it for women who were we were struggling to get the dose right on something else and i just needed something to get them through the weekend and it was like okay just i want you to just take a milligram of of of of of of this ester dial tablet tonight while we readjust your cream or your patch or whatever when are you using oral ester dial so i don't use it much um but that's not to say that it is there isn't useful i think it is actually very useful i don't need to underused right for example people are used to taking birth control pills they're used to taking pills they like pills you're doing for a a healthy person uh with no major risk factors of cardiovascular issues taking an oral estrogen really is not going to increase your risk of blood clots or heart attacks or anything like that at any significant worries some level it's no more increase in risk of blood clots than a birth birth control less it's less yeah so given the ubiquity with which women are on birth control pills where it shouldn't get into blood is not proportion yeah so what is your what is your advice to or what is your patient selection criteria on that in other words who are the women that you would say i don't want you on oral is this just factor five laden is this women who are obese like where do you sort of say uh the risk is a little too high so i tend to always start transdermal and again this is my sex doctor hat because we learn from this study called the keeps trial where they looked at oral estrogen versus transdermal estrogen and uh it's a fascinating trial but in that trial they found that um yes there's a slight increase of blood clots right with with oral estrogen but sexual function is better in transdermal and that's because of what happens to sex hormone binding globulin so when you take oral estrogen we talk a lot about first past metabolism through the liver it goes through the liver the liver lots of things go through the liver when you take medications um in this one in particular it can pump out more clotting proteins so if you're at any risk of blood clots just like birth control pills right if you're at any risk of if you're a smoker if you are overweight if you have a genetic predisposition to blood clots we're not going to use an oral hormone product does i make sense is that helpful um now i want to paint this because this is actually an area where i would love to see research i was speaking at a Harvard testosterone course with a morgan Tyler uh and mochera who you've had on the show and and i was speaking about women's testosterone use and um the speaker who got up there um to talk about a transgender hormone therapy talked about sublingual estrogen you get referring to sublingual estrogen and i got up to the micro i ran to the microphone i said what are you talking about i've never heard of sublingual estrogen there's no product who what are you saying and he says you just take an oral estrogen tablet and you put it under your tongue like a tick tack and you let it dissolve and it doesn't go through the liver and it works fabulously to increasing blood levels and i said oh my god this is it this sounds amazing and it doesn't drive up s h b g presumably because it's not going to deliver the liver which actually if you think about it logically i love logic here because we don't want to use we love logic is it will if you take an estrogen ring and put it in the high dose estrogen ring and you put it in the vagina same thing you absorb estrogen vaginally so what's the difference there right a sublingual estridile so i think it's fascinating i don't have many patients on it but i would love to see data sort of looking that direction because it's cheap oral estrogen is cheap uh you get lots of doses you can dose it you know does that mean you can get away with a lower dose you can get away with a lower dose absolutely you must right because of that upper dose effect so how do you dose it then so again i don't have patients on this and i haven't seen any studies on this but i i think you ask this guy yeah absolutely how does he do i think they typically again transgender hormone therapy is just much higher doses so my guess is one or two milligrams b ID is probably what they do if i were playing with it i would probably be nervous and i probably do 0.5 you know and i check levels and i do twice again this is not what i do in my clinic just as we think through what are you afraid of right what are you afraid of with this it's pretty fascinating stuff okay um let's talk about the peniply of topical ways you can do this creams patches what are the challenges of using these things how do they limit women's activity levels i mean i used to have this whole talk i would give women about what i thought was the best way to maximize the absorption of the cream and what i wanted them to do before they put it on and i wanted them to have a shower and i want to do two exfoliate their inner thigh and i didn't have this whole like routine that was probably so elaborate that it decreased compliance because like yeah yeah yeah so i thought that is not a series but i thought it was not a series but i thought it was true right for men and testosterone they we often find the topicals do not it's some they absorb beautifully and you get these beautiful levels and they feel great and then you do have a population that just doesn't absorb well through the skin and unfortunately we don't know who those people are right so it is i always tell patients that like i'm gonna here's the menu and we're gonna tinker we have to tinker to get it right for you because you're not like anybody and so patches a lot of people have heard of patches they like patches they make twice weekly patches and they make once weekly patches i find the twice weekly patches are much better tolerated and my patients like them better what's nice about patches is you have a wide variety of doses that you can play around with and so i always when i start patients on hormones i typically choose like a medium to medium low version because if you go too high initially they get breast tenderness and they get really annoyed with you and then you have to backtrack so i always like kind of tie trait up a little bit as we need to so patches are nice but for some people they don't stick well for some people they don't absorb well for some people they feel that they kind of drop off if you change it twice a week they feel like they get in a little lower we also notice women who use the sauna who are very very athletic and exercising like crazy you just haven't adherence physically and adherence problem yeah and there are people who are allergic to the adhesive so we see that as well so that's so some people are patch you know they love patches again you have to have a menu if you're going to a doctor and they give you one type of hormone therapy and that's the only type please run right they need to know the menu because you are not a you know it's not a one size fits all right so there's gels and there are number of different gels there's gels like the brand name is diva gel goes on your thigh there's estrogel which goes on your arm there's eva mist which is a spray sort of an aerosolized spray that goes on your arm gels can be really nice because it's every day so it's dosing every day the challenges sometimes they take a little bit to dry so if you're a busy person and you want to rub something on you want to run out of there I find gels not everybody wants to do something every day so again it's you got to get to know the people of like what do you what do you what do you like to do what's your routine you have to get it into their routine and sometimes you gotta work up to it and sometimes I have patience right they'll they'll use patches but when the summer time hits and it's hot and muggy they'll switch to the ring right or they'll switch to a gel like they'll those kind of what's the case for not just using the ring all the time oh so I love the ring so there's just two types of ring now this is important yeah it's really important because your pharmacist sometimes messes this up so there are two FDA proved rings now a ring just like a birth control ring you set it and forget it you put it in the vagina the vagina does not feel it like a tampon you don't feel it and it just stays in for three months at a time and it's sitting right up against the cervix it's not like a diaphragm where you have to place it or a menstrual cup or anything like that you just kind of push it in there and it just settles in and finds a place by the way if you have penetrative sex most people don't take it out they don't feel it like there nobody's bothered by this thing so this ring goes in there stays in for three months now there is a femoring which is a high dos ring which means if you have a uterus you need progesterone to protect the uterus and it comes in two doses 0.05 and 0.1 then there's an e-string which is a two milligram like localized estrogen ring that is you do not need progesterone if you have a uterus because it's just treating the genital urinary syndrome of menopause so it's not training your half flashes, subprotecting your bones it's not going to help your night sweats but it's going to prevent UTIs it's important that you know the difference because the pharmacist sometimes won't and he'll give you the wrong ring which could be catastrophic if they think they have a systemic ring but they have a local ring so the ring is lovely just dose is the only difference between the two right yeah they look a little different but yes the reason one is just a high dose and one is a load but it's the same frequency yeah both three months okay I thought you changed the e-string more frequently but good to know okay no three months now there's a company right now studying a product and I'm not it all affiliated but it is a one month ring that has both estrogen and progesterone in it which is very interesting and I'm curious to see where the research goes with that and it's a one month ring so so the issue with the ring I love the ring now there are women who you you show them and they're like I am not putting anything in my event like no I don't want that there are women who've used rings for birth control they love the idea I will tell you and we've been hoping to publish on this clinically again I don't know about you but my patients don't listen to the book they don't read the book and they don't follow the FDA curbs but my patients it peeders out like it literally stops working that last one everyone's a little different but I have patients where that last month they are dragging their half-flash it went on just swap it every two months so it's expensive so a lot of times insurance doesn't cover the ring it's about a hundred eighty dollars cash price when you use an online pharmacy called transition and so it's expensive sometimes they'll slap a patch on or a gel at the time to sort of overlap so they'll change it early or they'll add a different therapy or they'll stop using the ring altogether it is like perfect for like two months and then it kind of and we'll check levels again there's the book answer the Instagram answer and the doctor who been answer this is where checking levels is actually helpful I would love to you know I'm sure there are a couple of my patients that would actually volunteer to do this where we just do twice a week levels for three months while they're on a product while they're on a ring it just watch the curve it's incredible right because you will see it you'll check it you have a point one ring in and you should expect estrogen levels of 60 70 something like that and you'll see an estrogen level of like 13 and you'll be like oh my god this is not work right and they'll complain of hot flashes night sweats you know sort of their symptoms will come back and so we see a lot of ring issues with sort of dosing for that purpose and then another problem is if you have any kind of prolapse so as you as people have babies everything's can kind of prolapse and so people can the ring can fall out during bowel movements other things like that if there's not enough space in there so I had an ultra marathon right I can get expensive it gets expensive so I this ultra mirror this is where checking levels is beautiful marathon runner comes to me you know she loves her ring she's doing great she messages me oh my god I feel awful something's not right I've just like I don't feel like myself again I said oh you know where are you in your ring you know where are you in the cycle of your ring we talk about it so let's just check a level see what's happening sure estrogen was undetectable I said okay we need to change this ring and she messages I can't find it she can't find the ring it's not there she probably had a bowel movement didn't it fell out she didn't notice and then her sort of levels dropped so it's where the detective work kind of helps you kind of figure out what's going on with your patient so the ring is not perfect for everybody but I love the ring you know if you're in Perry Manopause and you have an iUD a ring you put a little testosterone you know every morning you know it's a mate like it's really a set it and forget it sort of you get vaginal estrogen systemic estrogen you get your pregesting from the iUD you add a little topical testosterone low very low maintenance and completely solution yeah and not that expensive like you can do it relatively inexpensively two things I want to talk about on the lab front we've talked a lot about labs so not sure if you share our our view on this we are really fistidious about using LCMS for estradile we do not want to use the Eliza based assays at all are you pretty meticulous about that or do you find that you're just happy checking any estradile I typically get the sensitive estradile level yeah that's what we get for everybody in same with the testosterone as well so let's maybe make that a PSA for people both physicians who are out there and patients we have seen that if you do not use the the LCMS assay right which is the very sensitive the liquid chromatography assays the results can be meaningless and i mean truly meaningless and the reason is that the Eliza based assays are so susceptible to interference from other molecules and there are some really known obvious supplements that completely obscure the findings so buy a tin which is in a lot of things will I mean render a non-LCMS test irrelevant but I think there are other things that were just not fully aware of so you know it is worth splurging and paying the extra maybe it's five or ten dollars be the cash price difference on that test but absolutely make sure when testosterone and estradile are being measured if you're the physician you actually have to go through the hoops and make sure you're ordering the LCMS test and if you're a patient you should be asking for it so we're going to get a lot of hate uh just so you know we get a lot of hate there's a lot of um there's a lot of disagreements uh when it comes to hormone therapy how to properly do hormone therapy had a check for hormone therapy and one of the places and it's funny because I truly believe and for anyone who's going to say mean things about me on the internet from this podcast I truly believe that actually most of us agree on like 98% of this like truly we want women feeling better many of uh most of us believe the data that hormones the benefits outweigh the risk and so I think 98% we agree there's the 2% where there is uh disagreement and part of it is also in the what we don't know yet right like the the unknown and the curiosity and sort of things and lab testing is one of those issues the book says never check labs if your doctor checks labs they are really doing something wrong you should only care about symptoms and then you have sort of the fringe that are doing all saliva-based testing every minute check labs do you know all these expensive labs which I do not agree with again the Instagram answer the book answer the doctor who an answer of sort of there are reasons to check labs and I do find labs similar to you my curiosity with labs is so fascinating when you can capture this perimenopausal fluctuations and show the patient the reason you feel so terrible is because your estrogen was a thousand and now it's zero and that hurts now do I need numbers to to to to to know that that's what's happening it actually helps patients quite a lot for them to look at this and see the data um what is your take on that because it is a very controversial issue I'm surprised but this is you have to understand I don't spend any time paying attention to the buffoons in the periphery on this topic so you know I don't like the term even I don't like the whole terminology around functional medicine I don't buy into the idea that you need to be spending and an ordinary amount of money on esoteric nonvalidated labs um again I think you can you can go to lab core you can go to quest you can go like any clear approved lab that knows how to do an assay correctly is all you need um our view and what we tell patients is the symptoms are the most important things but the numbers help direct my thinking this is how we manage thyroid this is how we manage sex hormones you know and and and to be clear like there's again I you know there's a character chair of the Dunning Kruger curve that I just find so helpful right so for the folks who aren't familiar on the x-axis you have experience right and on the y-axis you have confidence and in the in this sort of character version of the representation of this curve you initially have a huge spike which then falls into a valley and then a slow rise and of course the huge spike is referred to as the peak of Mount stupid followed by the valley of despair and the slope of enlightenment and it's just important for people to understand that when you are on instagram and youtube disproportionately you are seeing people at the peak of Mount stupid which is to say they have very low experience in insanely high confidence and these are the ones that are telling you that TSH I'm making this up as one example TSH must be between 0.4 and 1.9 and if it is any bit above 1.9 you have hypothyroidism and you need to be on armor thyroid or naturethroid or whatever and and and it's sort of like no none of that is correct okay and you just have to take care of enough patients for enough years to get humbled enough to know that whatever you think you know with rigidity is probably wrong you see don't my gray hair that I've grown it's true right and and I find you know what's so again that humility of medicine is I have made a car I am famous and my patience love me because I spend a lot of my day saying we don't actually know this is a data free zone here's what I think here's how we're going to use logic here's the tools in our toolbox but there is that ability to really know the data so well to truly understand there's a lot we need to figure out and that's why I have a research group and that's why we're trying to answer these questions because we have more questions than we have answers but I also need to get my patience feeling as good as possible and that is it's a dick ding to be honest yeah so here's what we do we focus relentlessly on the symptoms and we care what the estradiol level is we also think the FSH is a very helpful marker so if a if a woman's FSH is 78 and her estradiol is 40 I'm inclined to believe she needs more estrogen especially if she's saying I think I feel a bit better I'm just not sure like to me that says I'm going to go more and by the way with the labs being where they are I'm more inclined to push a little bit but again nothing tells me I've given her too much estrogen more than her saying her breasts hurt and that's the advantage of doing it with these short-term estrogens because I can pull it back really quickly so I don't know if that answers your question but I would consider myself an essentialist on labs kind of a minimalist essentialist but neither not an absolute is to any other direction and I love that and I think it's so re such a reasonable and logical like the logic there it makes so much sense to me so we're totally in line with that and that's why again it's very confusing for our patients on social media because they want the exact answer right and you're not going to find your exact answer from one doctor on social media right oh my gosh you said that I have to use an estrogen gel but I use a patch should I switch to a gel and it's not again it's not that serious there is a menu if it's working for you and you feel like you're getting what you need now it's good to get educated and learn about all the different options so that you can see what's right for you but I think expecting that one doctor gives you all the answers is not going to happen so anything else you want to say about systemic therapy before we go and talk about local therapy in the context of genital urinary symptoms of menopause yeah I think we haven't spent a lot of time really talking about the symptoms of menopause right what are we treating why do people have why do people need systemic therapy and I think you know I'm often saying that menopause has the worst PR campaign in the history of the universe why because we think it's for old people and we think it's just hot flashes and we think hot flashes go away there's actually not enough education like we can argue about E1 E2 but the reality is doctors don't even know the symptoms of menopause patients don't even know the symptoms of menopause right the person who was doing my makeup this morning she's like I just feel awful I feel like an old person I'm not sleeping I'm not fun anymore I can't drink I can't you know my joints are achy and as it welcome to you need hormone therapy right like I'm always teaching no matter who I'm whether there's a cab driver a hair stylist I'm always teaching but this idea of of of you have hormone receptors throughout your whole body it is a whole body experience so yes there's hot flashes and night sweats and by the way hot flashes are not just a nuisance that is a neurologic vascular genic probably event right the worst your hot flashes the worst your risk of cardiovascular issues and things like that joint pain is a huge one I never thought as a yearologist I would treat so much joint pain never in a million years did I think I cared about joint pain and yet patients come in all the time and say oh my god I don't get out of bed feeling old I don't feel creaky my joints recover again after I exercise and again am digastank inflammation when you I think hormones are natures a joint fluid if you will so so almost like break fluid right go back to the car analogy and we are gonna work it heck out of this mind so it's really cool so your eyes knee lubrication your ears need wax your vagina needs lubrication your joints actually need lubrication and so think of hornet teenager you've got oils oily skin so so hormones create these oils vaginal lubrication oil for your skin there are hydrogen receptors in your eyeballs right in these myobian glands so so I think of hormones like fluid so as you lose the hormones or the hormones go too high or too low it dries everything out and so you get joint pain you get frozen shoulder you get plantar fasciitis and now it was recently published on by Archmai Khalid Vonda Wright the musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause right this idea that so many women in their 40s and 50s everything starts to break down it's because the gas tank is empty and that inflammation increases it's such a simple and it's such a simple analogy so what are the symptoms you've got muscular skeletal symptoms sleep issues mood issues bleeding changes um obviously low libido orgasm problems or rousal problems pain with sex increases like crazy um I sent you a list here what am I missing you've got you've got a list there uh irritability very common one um I think the one that I was gonna ask you about is brain fog and depression um this is one where I think this is a I think this is a very unique one because it's one that gets easily dismissed as something unrelated same same more about those it's it's one of the most common symptoms and all women start going to doctors in their 40s like like doctors you I know you're listening and you get so many people and every day you say oh it's probably hormonal but you're not giving them the solution you're just telling them it's not cancer so the neurologists are seeing all these patients to rule out um you know a cognitive decline or all these other issues but really it's that brain fog because your brain is filled with estrogen receptors this is crazy researcher okay I don't know if you've had Lisa Muscone on but here's this researcher from Cornell neuroscience researcher who says hey I want to study Alzheimer's I want to do this this is just in the last couple years and she goes to her lab manager and says okay what's the assay for estradile and the brain I need to look at estradile receptors in the brain and the people at Cornell was like that doesn't exist she's like what do you mean that doesn't exist she's like how can we not look at estrogen receptors in the brain so she gets um Maria Shriver to give her a giant amount of money who gives her a huge amount of money so she now develops this assay this is only within the last couple of years she just published in nature very early findings that what would you expect right your body is efficient it's not going to do things it doesn't need to do so the hypothesis was that as menopause gets later and later the estrogen receptors in your brain are going to down regulate why have receptors around when there's no estrogen to feed the brain what did she find the exact opposite right that actually even up to 65 she stopped looking past 65 because she's like there's no way that's going to matter the increase in receptor density the older you get and it correlates to brain fog and irritability you can sort of correlate all these symptoms my reading of that was estrogen is so important in the brain that it has to upregulate the receptors as the estrogen level goes down and down and down and in other words it's a lot like the way the brain is treated for glucose the body will if you you are fasting the muscles will within days become completely insulin resistant it's their way of saying every molecule of glucose that that liver spits out better not go into the muscle it better go to the brain and so you look like you have diabetes in an effort to save glucose for the brain and I think that's what's happening with estrogen and could you argue that weight gain in menopause is evolutionary so that you make more estroner what up right that goes to the brain because it wants every more so that it can get right so this idea of hormones matter for the brain deeply right this is very important so it's fascinating research but you're going to see a lot of again think of a receptor as perimenopause is happening the receptors are full now they're empty then they're full now they're empty now they're have full now they're empty it is this is why we see ADHD pop up in perimenopause all these women are saying I have now new diagnosed ADHD it's real why because your brain is is having a panic attack because it's just trying to figure out some stability here which is my actually in empty gas tank so in menopause when you are totally empty the brain fog gets better right because there's stability of hormones and so on but if we just all I'm saying it's just adds some estrogen right to just keep the receptors happy the other one that we didn't talk about was the urinary symptoms so both urinary and continents and then the higher prevalence of UTIs you veluded to it a little bit but just maybe finish the swing on that okay so this is my favorite topic in the history of topics because we used to call this problem initially it was called senile vagina that was the initial yes there was a papers written on the senile vagina then it got up I don't even understand what that means it an old vagina I suppose but then it got changed to vulva vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginalitis that was the terminology that was used to be unfamiliar with the time before that I was seen on the scene of vagina check the history books very fascinating so vulva vaginal atrophy was sort of the common name of this okay as you get older the vagina atrophy is it travels up it shrinks up you know again if a penis tripled up at age 52 we probably have a vaccine sponsored by Pfizer right this is this is they created by agra they would create this this vaccine no one even tells me so you're saying if by the time a man became 50 his penis became a shriveled up useless organ you you you're you're saying that the medical system would have probably done something about this you might be on to something Rachel I I I know what I'm talking about so this is right so so so this is the thing we just told we just called a vulva vaginal atrophy and we said well if you have pain with sex or a little vaginal dryness here's some moisturizer here's some lubricants here you go if you're really bothered really bothered you got me really bothered then there's the thing called vaginal estrogen that we could give you now here's the crazy part of this is it's not just a little vaginal dryness the vagina and the bladder need hormones right babies don't have hormones and that's why you see it's red it's irritated they're these small little labia manora diaper cream was invented right to because it looks so painful then hormones had they pee their diapers all the time the genitals morph and change with hormones right puberty happens and you have a change of the genital in urinary system and and so what happens is as you lose hormones it goes in reverse and so it changes the microbiome though the hormones keep the tissue acidic it grows the healthy lactobacillitis it is the vaginas supposed to be acidic it's supposed to be able to fight infection and without proper hormones you lose that ability to fight infection so you see urinary frequency urinary urgency vaginal dryness increase in leakage increase in urgent continents and recurrent urinary tract infections which can and do kill people okay we've known this since the 90s in the New England Journal of Medicine actually this was on estuary all they looked you could reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by well over 50% we have known this all along and yet and that was with topical estuary all yeah interesting yeah I wasn't unaware of that and yet there is no FDA approved estuary all formulation despite that fact yeah correct I think it's available in Europe so we so the name got changed in 2014 okay 2014 a bunch of people got in a room and they said you know what this boba vaginal atrophy thing that's kind of a bad name because it doesn't describe what's really happening to people so they changed the name to genito urinary syndrome of menopause g sm now there was one urologist my mentor was in the room and they almost didn't put the word urinary in it and he fought and he yelled and he's here this is the power of one person to be able to change the whole world and they said okay well listen to you we'll put the word urinary in it and I'm so glad they did because the urinary problems are the things that kill people right people are dying of urinary tract infection in fact a large amount of money goes to medicare expenditures when it comes to urinary tract infections and we published last year that if medicare patients use vaginal estrogen which is safe for everybody and $13 a tube we would save medicare between six and twenty two billion dollars a year billion just say that again please because I know there are people that are in the medicare system who are going to be interested to understand that okay so when you when you do a low dose local vaginal estrogen or dha product you can reduce your risk of urinary tract infections by more than half they're safe to use if you've had a history of blood clots breast cancer whatever medical problem you can come at me I can tell you that it's safe okay it will not only help with lubrication help with pain with sex help with urinary frequency urgency leakage but it will reduce your risk of urinary tract infections by more than half it's also inexpensive and covered by ur insurance if everybody in medicare eligibility used vaginal estrogen we would save medicare between six and twenty two billion dollars a year and in my opinion that is a conservative estimate because of how many patients are getting urinary tract infections they're going to their doctor for cultures they're in the ICU with this is a huge economic a more bid and mortality problem that we're dealing with and no one cares I mean again I always try to come up with this steel man and say is it that they don't care or is it that they're unaware or is it that they feel that it just needs to fall on the shoulders of somebody other than themselves so I think we have a marketing problem I truly believe this is a marketing problem because let me tell you but okay let me push back not because I don't agree with you but I'm just gonna put put my my hat on that says the opposite right so maybe I am too attuned to this but I feel like there is nothing more talked about right now I mean look at what Hallie berries doing look what Oprah's doing look what Gueneth is doing I mean there are so many very powerful very influential women that are talking about this why is this not in the zeitgeist right now it's getting better but again they don't know how to write the prescriptions okay so let me tell you you think there's not enough physicians talking about this then if it really comes down to prescriptions if it can't get them it's on over the counter if you can't get the prescription or if you don't go to your doctor saying that you need it we had an Instagram reel just yesterday that the patient said I sent my friend went to her doctor said she was having pain with sex asked for vaginal estrogen and her gyna colleges said and I quote you need to think of other ways to change your relationship from now on it's not in the cards for you what does that mean meaning you can't have sex anymore right and the fact is it's not about sex is about urinary tract wait a minute yeah this is impossible for me to fathom a woman went to her gyna colleges and said I'm having pain within her course yeah this woman any idea how old this woman is in her 60s okay and the gyna colleges said didn't didn't you think this gyna colleges doesn't know about estrogen honestly I don't know any more it's incredible right so so okay so we could argue via agra 1998 via agra comes out via agra changed the world billions of dollars what is via agra is a pd five inhibitor it relaxes smooth muscles of the penis increased blood flow gives you a rigid erection so it helps with a rousal for men okay if you take it micro dose low doses it can also help with bph or urinary problems right we love via agra we love cialis wish it was in the water we should study it in women um if this is the problem though because I didn't medical school oh I'm gonna talk about that but but I will argue we've had via agra for women long before we've had via agra for men and we've known about it since the 1970s and via agra for women is vaginal hormones what do vaginal hormones do they relax the tissue they increase her rousal they increase lubrication they increase orgasm they help with urinary symptoms so they do everything via agra does and they permit urinary tract infections via agra doesn't do that so you're talking about better than via agra it's inexpensive now it didn't use to be so when I got out of my training a tube of estra is with five hundred dollars wow because of people like mark Cuban and good rx and I've I've talked to mark Cuban on my dms in twitter and he knows more about vaginal estrogen than ninety percent of doctors but this idea of of it's not expensive a tube of estrogen is thirteen dollars right and you're saying that the reason that this price has come down is I know mark is a very hard liner against the pbs did mark basically take a sledgehammer to that yeah they changed they changed they changed they get and so it's incredible oh my gosh it's incredible and he understands it's he he literally understands the nuances of why vaginal estrogen is so important that's great I can't get doctors to do that I think he's he's incredible and so so so we've a marketing problem we have a product that is better than via agra for women it's been around longer than via agra it's inexpensive it's inexpensive what are we missing what is it's marketing we're not telling the patients we're not telling the doctors and we have a box labeling that says this product causes stroke heart attacks blood clots probable dementia breast cancer and needs to be taken with progesterone not one of those statements is true not one okay so we went to the FDA and says you got to remove the box this is not you're you're killing people and the FDA said we're gonna leave the box on this is a nightmare right so so can I can I just tell very personal story I promise it will take long so I was just spent my mother just died in November we spent six months in the ICU in Houston Texas six months my mother nobody was shipping an ICU for six months it was absolutely gut wrenching horrible time for me my mother had been on vaginal estrogen because you know of course I'm gonna one heard of prevent UTIs for many many years you know she's 70 year old woman many years so she gets into the hospital has a transplant has a catheter and isn't doing well is on ECMO and very sick for very long time and I said to the doctors I said I know this isn't the most important thing in the world but I'd like to restart her vaginal hormones because having a catheter being in an ICU and being a immunocompromise my mother's risks of a urinary tract infection are incredibly high and a urinary tract infection is going to kill this woman so I would like to restart her vaginal estrogen and because menopause medicine is a tiny little field in a tiny little corner they looked at me like I was an insane person I said what do you mean you can't this is this is like your mother is very sick right now I said I know my mother is very sick right now and this is one thing I can control I sort of did a do you know who I am because I'm on the guidelines committee for GSM for the American Urologic Association so for the transplant team I had to write up a whole I wrote up a whole S bar of like here's why it's important years the research here's all the literature here's the citations and they said but it'll increase her risk of blood clots I said no it won't vaginal hormones don't increase your risk of blood clots you're talking my it's like hydrochorded zone cream but compared us saw you measure all right those are very different things so then they went to the ICU team is an oh can't give this to her and increase her risk of blood clots had to convince them then the pharmacy they finally got them to write the prescription I had to teach them how to write the prescription pharmacy wouldn't dispense it why it increases the risk of blood clots it says so right on the box so I had to call and yell right I'm trying to run a practice in Washington DC my brother and father are trying to advocate with me because they know that this isn't they also follow me on social media they know this is important finally the pharmacy dispenses the tube of estrace there's no applicator the nurses don't know how to give it I had to show them and teach them how to give my mother who is on ECMO and you know ultimately passed not from a UTI thank goodness but but had to show them how to dispense I had to do all this being one of the leading educators on this topic what is everybody I'll still and guess what the teams changed every week we had to do this every week and to teach them why this was important and how to do this vaginal hormones should not be gynaecology it should not be a small subset of menopause medicine we could save Medicare between 6 and 22 billion dollars a year if people understood this if the box labeling weren't on there I mean I I it is so personal at this point and yet it is it is it's it's it's horrible well I'm very sorry to hear that that story both at the personal level but also at the the the sort of meta level of what is implied I want to clarify one thing Rachel if a woman is on a high enough systemic dose of estradyal does she also need later in life local estrogen maybe even not later in life so we find that systemic hormones are not often enough to help with the genital and urinary symptoms and the most doctors don't know this and you're not again what are you afraid of you're not adding any systemic risk it doesn't increase if you're estrogen level 70 on your patch and you add a vaginal estrogen her estrogen level is going to stay 70 you're not going to get that systemic absorption but you are going to reduce your UTI rate significantly how is that he been done it's a great question it's a very much expert opinion and and when the guidelines come out in the next couple weeks or actually when this the think of how intr it I think of how easy it would be to do a study where you took a group of women they were all at systemic target of estradyal and you randomized them to a placebo vaginal cream versus an estradyal vaginal claint cream you could follow these women for a year if they were in a susceptible enough population and you would get a very clear answer as to whether or not you're getting additional UTI protection and if the answer to that is yes just imagine the implications there at that point it becomes malpractice you're definitely and you are you're getting more you we know and we just publish the study that dha does the same thing it reduces the risk of UTI is by more than half why is dha doing it so dha is a fascinating so they've looked at a lot of oral you probably know this data better than I do oral dha the data is all over the place right because your adrenal adrenal reaction to the tata so but when you put dha vaginally it is this idea is that your vaginal enzymes convert it into both estrogen and androgens and what's so fascinating is we know that the vagina the vulvar vestibule the clitoris the bladder have androgen receptors so us using just estrogen in this tissue maybe missing the whole point we probably we do have patients that benefit from having an androgen in the tissue as well and the only FDA proof product we have is intro rosa which is vaginal dha now it's often hard to get for patients if I could get it for everybody I would it's fabulous because the tissue needs in these androgens so it's it's it's um the data is very good it's just we've just started using it so I don't have a lot of experience with it. It's going to change so there is some data not a lot but there's data that shows someone with urgency I mean give them vaginal estrogen switch them to dha it'll help those people who still have urgency. You think it gives you the same UTI protection? We we published on this so we just published in the menopause journal that it shows the same decreased risk of UTIs by more than half so that was a very proud publication that we just put out and so we use it frequently what's nice about the product it's a nightly product it's dha and palm oil so it's very moisturizing very lubricating and my mentor Irwin Goldstein published that actually it also helps the tissue called the vulvar vestibule. Do you know what the vulvar vestibule is? Well I know what the vulva is and I know what a vestibule is but I don't think I know what the vulvar vestibule is. It's okay so I'm obsessed with homologs. Homologs are sort of this idea of how one part you know I'll give you an example the penis and the clitoris are exactly the same. Yes, sorry they're homologs of each other right the head of the penis and the head of the clitoris homologs the um your rethra right they're all so so it's what part of the body and one is the same in the other so the homolog okay of of the labia sorry of the scrodo skin is the labia mature. Okay you're with me the prep use or the hood right they every every the clitoris and the penis both have a prep use or a hood to it um the so okay so there's a line that goes down a penis that goes down the the penis and the scrodo I'm do you remember what that's called? Meadie and rough uh you got it raffae yeah okay so the median raffae is the line that goes down the penis and the scrodo I'm straight line right in the middle what's the homolog in the vulva? I just learned this. Oh well it must be the vestibule. No. No I don't know. Close labia manora okay so it's skin it's echoed arm right so it is skin right and we're split open so if you take the median raffae and you split it right that's your labia manora which very hormone sensitive I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm very pot I'm not on tick talk but I am trending on tick talk because I talk about the labia manora shrinking and disappearing and menopause and the internet has broken because of it so the labia manora is very hormone sensitive tissue that we do not study and we know almost nothing about but it resorts in menopause inside the labia manora so if we cut into the median raffae in a man and we do this when we put in penal implants or we do your rethral surgeries we get to the male your rethra so Peter your outside of your cheek is skin right the inside of your cheek is different tissue right you agree one more sensitive one's thicker so the the skin of the of the median raffae is very different than the skin of the tube of your rethra you agree for sure so if you split open the labia manora you get to the urethra and that is the vulvar vestibule so the tissue that surrounds the urethra in a woman that goes all the way around and I will show you nerdy anatomical diagrams when we're done here because I need you to know this that is the female urethra it's called the vulvar vestibule it is made up of endo dorm so we think of the cervix as a transition point but the most important transition point that affects sexual health and a woman is when you go from echo dorm of the labia manora to endo dorm of the vulvar vestibule and then pass the hymn is mezo dorm okay it's fascinating anatomy why is this important super compressed it's super but it's so important because if you push with a q tip on the labia manora they'll have no pain if you push them on their vulvar vestibule they'll say that's my uti that's my interstitial cisitis that's the pain that I have with sex it is rich in hormone receptors it is so this is why 50% of women go off there endocrine therapy for breast cancer because they have urinary symptoms pelvic pain symptoms and it is all sourced in a body part that no one taught you in medical school and I did that on purpose because I knew you wouldn't know it because no one is taught how to examine it they put a speculum in and they bypass it completely and they are missing the problem so my back to the dha this tissue has estrogen and testosterone receptors in it so sometimes estrogen is not enough to help this vulvar vestibule tissue and so dha there's some data there's one paper to suggest that dha is enough and this is the one time that I will compound a product for a woman otherwise I use FDA approved products in my practice and I compound basically the amount of estrogen and estrogen top vaginal topical cream the point of 1% and I will use a topical testosterone point 1% different than the 1% we talked about for libido but a point 1% they rub it topically on this vulvar vestibule you cure pain with sex you help these uti symptoms interstitial cisitis goes away so many patients it's miraculous sorry tell me again point 1% t and what was the percent point 01% ester dha and we typically use like a versibase or a methyl cellulase base no but I would love to see that studied right I would love to see it's the base it can be usually a methyl cellulose or a versibase there's a base called a lodge that a lot of people are using right now again I am not a compounding junkie in any way this is a miraculous compound that gives like literally wool if you have a patient who's on vaginal estrogen systemic estrogen systemic testosterone the sapirai self pain with sex is still kind of hurts it's always the vestibule and the pelvic bone is super interesting isn't it fun um there are three other questions that I want to ask you going back to hormones postmenopause um and these are I'm saving the three most contentious questions for for last on this topic question one I buy your argument this is someone's posing this question to not me I buy your argument that hormones are safe but I am now 56 years old I finished menopause at 49 isn't it too late to do anything about it yeah so we have this idea in menopause medicine called the timing hypothesis or the window idea right so the question of the timing hypothesis is what are you afraid of what are we worried about worried about blood clots we're we don't want to hurt people we're worried about cancer we're worried about blood clots we're worried about heart disease but the question is is does the hormone therapy that we use apply to the data that we have and I would argue it doesn't and so there is a level if we don't know what we don't know but even the timing hypothesis using prem pro which was the medicine used in the WHI is under question so Susan Davis from Australia just wrote a big paper questioning the timing hypothesis and say actually when you look at the data really closely even it doesn't really hold mustard we shouldn't really be forcing people to like say you cannot start hormone therapy after 60 so I think this is where shared decision making really comes into play of what are we treating what are we trying to care about your bones do you care about your sexual health do you care about you know sort of your mental health and do you want to see a hormone therapy helps with these things now hormone therapies indicated for three reasons vasomota symptoms hot flashes night sweats that sort of thing prevention of osteoporosis which to me is a green light so anyone should be offered hormone therapy because who wouldn't want to prevent osteoporosis and the thing I just talked about a lot is the genitaline urinary syndrome of menopause so anybody of any age and I'm talking even parie menopause and premenopause vaginal estrogen or dha is safe and really helpful to prevent UTIs and should be used absolutely everywhere throughout life throughout life okay now I'm going to ask another question that is the extension of that question but I think your logic is going to hold the same which is the hedging strategy which says not only use as little as possible for as short a duration as possible says you really need to stop this after 10 years right I mean so even if you were lucky enough to catch a woman through parie menopause and you know you got her on hormones by the age of 49 now that she's 69 you got to stop it right definitely not so that's really the there is no data to suggest stopping and in fact stopping it all of your bone gains that's right they all go away quickly by the way that was the argument put forth to me with one of the authors of the WHO is by far the most willing to can see that mistakes were made right which was okay yes I will concede that the ester dial is doing amazing things for the women's bones but remember they're going to go away when you stop the hormones as though that was a necessary thing to do so keep them on right and again this idea of if hormones if it's not broke don't fix it by taking a woman off of hormone therapy you actually potentially could be disrupting any plaques that are there you could be causing vasospas like there are all these things that could happen and so we really don't want to take women off their hormone therapy unless there is a reason to and the only reason I honestly see is if a woman has an active cancer that you are going to target hormones as a target for your treatment of cancer that's not to say the hormones cause the cancer but we have a target sometimes because all body parts have hormone receptors and we have used hormones as a target for our breast cancer therapies and some other cancer therapies is that helpful does that does that make sense yes and it actually does tails perfectly into my third critical situation which is how do we manage hormones in women who are at risk of breast cancer from a familial standpoint who have been diagnosed with DCIS which is not cancer but increases the risk of cancer so that's kind of a subset of the first group and then in women who actually have breast cancer or have a history of treated breast cancer so I would imagine you see women that fit into all three or four of those buckets how do you handle it yeah so first we take a long time at my clinic and we get to know each other and we really try to dive into the data and say what do we know what do we not know and I always tell people you can't take hormone therapy because Rachel Rubin tells you to take hormone therapy you have to do your own research figure out what you you know what you're interested and so I have a lot of colleagues who are talking about this you had Alvram Blooming on your show and he has a great book called Estrogen Matters he's an oncologist who's questioning a lot of this research we have amazing colleagues of mine like current men who is a gynaecologist who had breast cancer as a young person there are 20s and now takes hormone therapy and talks a lot about hormone therapy and teaches courses on hormone therapy and breast cancer so I am always learning about well what data so I don't like fear I don't like telling women they can't do things with their body I like understanding well what are we afraid of and so when it comes to the braka patients if you do surgical menopause on someone and they don't have cancer and you do not give them back hormone therapy you are trading one problem for another you may give them extra life from a breast cancer perspective but you are shortening their life from a bone health and a cardiovascular disease perspective that is very clear so the other problem is the DCIS if you are not going to give someone endocrine therapy of any kind and they're done they have surgery they're done there is no reason why they can't take hormone therapy and then when it comes to active breast cancer there is a lot of emerging questioning in this patient population and again the question is if you're allowed to get pregnant are you allowed to take hormone therapy and that's really the pushback that we give some people and I think there's a lot of data that we need here but we need to be asking these questions I'm a urologist to stop when I came out of my training it was testosterone fuels prostate cancer now 10 years later it's you have prostate cancer sure we can give you testosterone no problem if you have metastatic disease we target testosterone so we're going to use castration level androgen blockers but that doesn't mean if you have localized disease that you can't have testosterone therapy so we think of testosterone and prostate cancer as a saturation model concept and I actually think we need to be using that model potentially when it comes to breast cancer and have more logic and understanding unless fear it's marketing prostate cancer is testosterone sensitive prostate cancer but we don't cut off testicles for the fear that an abnormal cell will happen in a prostate all a lot of breast cancer is estrogen receptive breast get not all of it right but some of it is that doesn't mean that estrogen causes cancer is that helpful like I think it's a it's insanely helpful and of course it echoes exactly what Ted Schaefer said when we spoke about this after discussing the traverse trial which was I think to me the most telling thing that Ted said was look if I have a man who's got a gleece in 3 plus 3 means he has prostate cancer and we are going to follow this and if it becomes a 3 plus 4 he's we're going to actually have to take this thing out we'd put him on TRT if he needed it and his argument was exactly your argument on the pregnancy side which is the reason we would happily give him TRT is let's just assume he's a man replete with testosterone would we castrate him during that period of time of observation of course not so why would I not give him testosterone if he needs it even though he actually has prostate cancer and this is again where that patriarchal divide happens is we're willing to take those risks and focus on quality of life when it comes to men's health we castrate women with the mere thought that they may develop an abnormal cell in their body and completely ignore their quality of life and all of those things that go with it and that women are more than breast tissue they are so much more than their cancer risk and we have to understand and actually have these reasonable conversations with women and what I say is your oncologist is not in charge of you they don't tell you they give you advice they are so that's like a pit crew let's go back to our car model you have a pit crew but you get to decide who's on your pit crew and who fits into your pit crew but it can't be just one doctor you may need someone to talk about your sexual health you may need someone to talk about your menopause hormones you may need a bone doctor you may need a you know a heart doctor so you need to collect your pit crew but with one doctor says no you can't do this with your body I don't like that termina I don't think it's fair anymore and when you give women information about how their bodies work they make great decisions for them they can look at the menu and say listen I'm most worried about Alzheimer's and I've looked at the data and this is what I choose to do or hey I'm more worried about osteoporosis listen my grandma died not sorry my grandma broke a bunch of ribs raised she had Alzheimer's and osteoporosis and my grandpa hugged her and she broke a bunch of ribs like that's not how I want to age right so what do I care about I don't want to get osteoporosis I don't want to get dementia and I've seen all the literature hormone therapy sounds pretty good to me right like and that's really the key I think there's a lot of people on social media maybe negative about hormone therapy but if you look they are on hormone therapy themselves they will say they have an estrogen patch on I'm sorry I don't because I don't pay any attention to social media there are people out there saying they're anti HRT but they use your chart so I don't what's their argument what are they talking about this idea that we are overselling HRT that not every woman needs HRT and I'm not suggesting every woman needs HRT but I want every woman to be offered the menu right I want them to know what they are like like just like I want people to know how to exercise and lift weights and eat healthy here's the menu if you choose to smoke and drink and do drugs that is your choice but I want you to know that the menu exists does that make sense sure what do women need to be aware of so not every woman can come and see you right not every woman has access to a doctor who has the breadth of knowledge that has select few do in this space so A how can women find practitioners near them and what do they need to be aware of what are the exploitative practices out there that they need to be mindful of and not get dupped into sort of some you know either dangerous therapies or you know just overly extractive therapies there's danger on both sides there's danger going to the doctor for 10 minutes and saying oh that's not safe you don't want to do this right and there's dangers of going to the very expensive pellet clinic that is going to overdose you and charge you lots and lots of money so you need I like being somewhere in the middle and getting a few opinions here right so this is where opinions can be following the a bunch of people on Instagram don't just follow one people follow a bunch of people if you like books there's tons of books now on menopause right there are some of your favorites so I mean you've got Mary Claire Haver is the most popular book called the new menopause either herish has a great book called Pick Your Menopause type there's been a hot and bothered as journalist wrote a great book on Perry menopause Jancy Dunn Tim's in Fidelityll just wrote a book about menopause who's also a reporter so you're getting a estrogen matters is a great book right really great book so this is there's a lot of books now thank goodness you know there's one called the menopause manifesto there's great books on menopause there's also podcast now there's great podcasts out there there's great Oprah just did a special on you know there's there's documentaries on PBS now so menopause is having a movement so you can't have this excuse anymore of oh my doctor doesn't do this go find a different doctor they're telemedicine company and what's the what's the website you remember post dot org is the menopause society website that doesn't guarantee you have someone who knows everything but menopause dot org means somebody took a test and put some effort into saying I care about menopause I I'm on that website but is swish isswsh.org is the women sexual health society so people who we care about menopause and sexual health so that's a great place to find a so those are two websites that can help you find someone again you have to advocate for yourself because no one will do that other than you and so I think the more you educate yourself the more you can find the right people in your pit crew we're gonna fill that gas tank and get you where you want to go do you feel that there are too many women that are still getting their hormone therapy in the in the sort of dark alley with with sort of highly sus individuals and if so what would be what would be a clue that you're in that camp because there's nobody that's in that camp that knows it right so what what who or what are the I want I want a woman who's watching this who's not getting great medical care but thinks she is to maybe get a bit of a hint as to what that might look like I think this is a problem when your doctor only has one type of men when your doctor says no you can't have anything that's suspect if your doctor says you can only have this really expensive product that has to be inserted into your butt four times a year and you have to pay me thousands of dollars that's extremely suspect compounded by me if you say you have to pay lots of money for this special compounded product that's safer and more effective I call red flag on that situation if you have to give very expensive saliva testing labs and they're making you pay a lot of money very suspect again that doesn't mean you can't do it if it's working for you and you're happy you have body autonomy you do what you want but know that there's red flags there I think the pellet industry we I have a big problem we have an FDA proof pellet for men okay it can be FDA proved I don't upset with a pellet as a concept if the pellet companies care about women do the studies go through the FDA show me it's safe if you believe it's billion dollar industry if you believe that it's the greatest thing in the world show me so that I have that so that I can start using it because I'm gonna because the FDA is a pretty good compounding pharmacy so do the work go I have my beef with the FDA hello you need to take that box labeling off estrogen products especially vaginal estrogen but if the pellet companies deeply care about women which they say they do do the work that everyone takes advantage of women all the supplement companies all of these they take advantage by promising these things to women but they don't do the work of science so that's what I ask is is just do the work Rachel as expected this was this was a fantastic discussion and I think it adds to what we're trying to do in this podcast which is really have nuanced and deep discussions about important topics you know not every podcast I do gets to impact that many people some of them impact nobody they're just really esoteric but they they they they fit into my curiosity window but but this is this is kind of a topic that really impacts almost 100% of the population because 50% of the population is who we just talked about but the other 50% of the population would be hard pressed to say that they don't care about at least one person in that other group so again 100% of people are heavily impacted by what we just discussed can I say one thing real quick is that I'm I'm also a men's health doctor and I lecture my neurology colleagues and I say and you talk about longevity and here are the things you can do for longevity I think you're missing one point and that is that men who are divorced single or widowed have horrible health outcomes horrible whether you look at mental health prostate cancer cancer outcomes horrible they die sooner so if you want longevity if you want to keep living how do you you have to keep people partnered and when do people get divorced between 40 and 60 that is the age of parry menopause and menopause menopause is killing men it is killing men because it changes their marriages and it leads to divorce which leads to death so I give this lecture of if men's health doctors if doctors truly cared about keeping men alive they would do menopause medicine because that is the most one of the most important ways to keep men alive so that's my other argument for you to focus on this and really make change here and I'm just I can't thank you enough for this platform because it is everybody's problem. Rachel thank you very much for the work you're doing and thanks for coming today. Thanks for having me

You keep talking about making me a kick ass 80 year old. I want to be a kick ass 40 year old. Yep. What's the flaw on that logic? If I'm going to be an awesome 70 year 80 year old, I kind of have to be an awesome 45 or 55 year old. We're going to be doing things now that make you crazy strong to help your lean muscle mass, the burns your fat, all those health risk things, but you're also going to be way more prepared for whatever life throws at you. As a person listening to us, who says, look, man, I've been not getting better. But how do you help that person think about whether or not there's an underlying structural problem that needs a surgical intervention or a more direct intervention versus you're not being instructed to do the right things and or you're being instructed to then you're not doing it. I think your rehab clinic needs to do more than just offer services. They need offer a plan. The magic word of capacities, what's all about. Are you building me back to what I want to do? If you're someone like me and you who part of our CD involves probably walking on uneven surfaces one day. Yeah. All of your training should account for that. If we're just doing bicep curls and calf raises, it's like I'm on these railroad tracks, but the minute you make me go sideways or rotate, it's trouble. What I always tell people to do is like, look at your kids. Like if you go to a coffee shop with your kids, I guarantee one of them will run and jump off a rock and do a twist and land it. When was the last time one of us did that? The pathway back isn't necessarily pain free or injury free. It's more of a trajectory that's going to get better. Pain does not always mean injury. Pain is your brain telling you, hey, I don't like what's happening here, but it doesn't always mean your broken or busted. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. Kyler. Wonderful to have you. Yeah, thanks, Jeremy. I want to kind of give folks a little bit of a sense of what you and I came up with a few years ago in the throes of my recovery from shoulder surgery. And why that kind of gave us this idea to take two things that seemed quite unrelated at the time, which was my recovery from an injury, coupled with this idea that I'd been marinating around this idea of a centenary into Catholic and a marginal decade. And why we decided to kind of put these, the best ideas or the themes of these together. So how does that sound? Sounds great. All right. So let's see, you and I met four years ago as soon as I moved to Austin. Yep. And we were kind of just, I don't even remember what we worked on because I think it was just like preventative stuff, right? It was like, yeah, you really wanted me to come over. I think initially just doing some DNS stuff, like some routine maintenance things. And somewhere around this second or third visit, I was like, well, what's going on with this shoulder? And that kind of kicked off this whole conversation because, you know, in my world, this idea of just doing one technique or providing one service isn't really a complete approach. That's right. So you're right. We were probably a couple months in maybe. Yeah. And it was clear that I was nursing this bad shoulder. And I knew what was going on because I had torn the laborum before the diagnosis I remember was actually made in 2009. I had my first Arthur Graham in 2009 for folks listening, who don't know what that is. And Arthur Graham is an MRI where prior to you going in the scanner, the radiologist takes a needle about yay long, right? Like four inches long. Shutes the needle into the capsule and injects contrast so that it really allows the MRI to show the laborum and how much it's detached from the Gleenoid Fossa. And so it was, it was patently clear at that time. I had a torn laborum. It was significantly torn, but not as torn as it would be, you know, 12 years or 13 years later. But I had largely avoided surgery by, you know, doing as much as I could to strengthen the the rotator cuff. And frankly, I was afraid to have surgery. Right. That was the bottom line. Is I didn't want to trade one problem for another, meaning I didn't want to trade pain and instability for immobility. And I saw that as the trade off. Again, folks listening probably recall that I had a podcast that did a sit down discussion with who is the amazing surgeon, Alten Barron, who ultimately did the repair. But what I was most impressed by in that experience, which turned out to be wildly positive, was that immediately you and Alten started working as a team. And maybe you could talk a little bit about what you guys decided to do in the sixth, I think it was eight weeks we knew prior to surgery. We scheduled it such that you could do something before them. What was that discussion like? Yeah, I mean, Alten did an amazing job in a lot of ways. But one of the things as a rehab professional that I really appreciated was how he didn't want to just cinch down that joint to wear his liability was so covered that that shoulder would be strong. But you lost a ton of function. And I think that is one of the key things that he did for us was he did the right amount, he put the staples and the sutures and the right places to where that shoulder would be functional. And we got to your shoulder well before it became any kind of more significant structural compromise. So it's really important window to do so. But I do remember that conversation because you had a date several months out where you're like, I mean, I have to use my arm a lot. I need to be strong. Yeah, it was it was I basically I needed to be able to hunt in September. Yeah. So we backed out of that said the surgery needs to be no later than March. It was January. Yeah. And then the question was, should you do the surgery right away or do you use two months to pre-have? Yeah. And so tell me how you thought about that. Yeah, no. I mean, that conversation was one of my favorites because I've done this before where if we know the big picture goal as well as the near term surgical date and then we reverse engineer, okay, I want to check off a certain amount of things pre-operatively to where that joint is ready. And essentially, the most simple terms, what you're looking for in that situation, especially with the shoulder because it's such a mobile joint is you want to make all the muscles around the shoulder just awesome. But we need to do so in a way that doesn't make the surgery, you know, more complicated or injure you more, right? And so we did a lot of things where we did not only use technology like BFR, but we also used very aggressive approaches on your core stability, though you're scapula, interacted with your ribs and all these things haven't effect on how my shoulder moves. And if my really mobile shoulder that has a torn laborum isn't stable and doesn't have a support infrastructure around it, you're always just going to ask for more pain. But what the best thing about that is the day you got the surgery, we jumped on it really quick once things were healing from the surgery itself. All those other ancillary things were actually functioning really well. So now we only had to really target the shoulder itself because the rest of the human was really strong and ready. Yeah. And so the things that I remember which are probably fewer details than what you remember is one, how much rotator cuff work we did ahead of time, particularly around superspinatus. So we really got that muscle as strong as possible in eight weeks. And that's, you know, anybody who's gone through that type of rehab, which I'm sure many people listening have, it's uncomfortable. I mean, you're burning a little tiny muscle that you're not used to working that hard. The second thing that I remember and hands down the most important thing was what you and Alton decided to do postoperatively, completely shattered everyone's understanding of what we do with these patients. Right. So the traditional view is, especially this wasn't a slap tear. No. This was a complete, like the entire laborum was hanging by a thread. And normally, as you said, a surgeon's primary objective is, he, I'm going to make sure that this is never unstable again. I'm going to cinch this down really tight and you're going to be in a sling for four to six weeks. And that's going to give it plenty of time to heal. All of that sounds great. But you'll never regain your mobility. You'll never regain the range of motion. You want the healthy range of motion you had. And frankly, you'll probably atrophy away. Yeah. And so Alton said, no, we're going to have you out of a sling in 24 hours. And I was like, how is that going to be possible? Right. And yet we did. And again, there's no way he could have done that if you guys weren't partnering on this. So how was that even possible? And why does that fly in the face of everything we would think of? Well, I think the broader picture here is what we touched on, the liability and it's really difficult for modern physicians and rehab pros to integrate. Professional sports try to achieve this as well. But they have time constraints and all these other constraints with how many people they're working with. So ignoring all those layers, I think the most important thing is to know, all the I had these conversations in detail. And he was really specific about, okay, did we get the training we talked about? Is that supersponatus, the Seratis anterior? All these other muscles that help stabilize are those like really good? And I had some metrics I was able to discuss with him. And he felt really confident in the stability of your shoulders. So if we're speaking to a general population, I would say that no sling or sling decision was based on what we knew exactly what we did. The other thing is that you followed everything to a T. One of the big complications in rehab, athlete or not, is our people following the rules. Are we going to take this athlete or individual out of a sling? And are they going to forget about it? And all of a sudden go reach for the cereal? Or are they going to follow the rules? And you were definitely a rule follower. So he and I had a high confidence in minimizing the risk. Yeah, and that you know, truth be told, I learned a lot of that the hard way from my first orthopedic surgery back in 2000 when A, I'm not even convinced I received post operative instructions. And if I did, I didn't read them. And I was breaking every rule there was. So yeah, I was, you know, the stakes were higher here in a way. And I think I was very mindful. For example, you know, people myself included when you have surgery, you tend to go on YouTube to learn all about it. Right. Right. And I'm like, okay, I want to see everything. I want to watch the post operative. I want to watch the rehab process. And so one of the big milestones you see for people with laboral surgery is when they do, when they basically can dangle the arm and, you know, rotate like a lightweight. Yeah. And you know, all of them was really clear like, you're not going to be doing that for a while. Right. We're talking about range of motion. Right. Without stress on the repair. Right. And very early on, preoperatively and post, we were able to do very general but targeted isometrics where there wasn't complexity and the joint itself. But we were loading the tissues in a very articulate and specific way. And that's how you, again, put this support structure around it. I was kind of described as like the role cage in a car. Like we want all the muscles around that to be ready to absorb force. So those joint structures that are getting the staples or whatever else in there aren't stressed. Right. We don't want to yank on those things while they're healing. Yeah. So in parallel to this, right, I'm continuing to sort of refine my thinking around the idea that we're all going to have this marginal decade one day and it does come across a sort of a depressing thought. Right. Like nobody really wants to think about the idea that there will be a day when you knowingly are unknowingly enter the final decade of your life. But at the same time, you know, to act as though it's not true, won't make it not so. So I think it occurred to me that the more deliberate we can train for that last decade as though we are athletes, the more we can enjoy it. Because as I watch people in the final decade of their lives and I've had the both privilege and cursive seeing a lot of it, I believe that the thing people complain most about is what's taken away from them physically. Yeah. Now there are lots of people in the last decade of their life that are lonely because, you know, they were miserable sons of bitches and their family, you know, they don't have family or friends. Yeah. All of those thing, there are many people whose cognition has failed them long before their body has failed them and that can be very distressing. But if, if I'm really thinking about this in terms of large numbers, more than two thirds of people, I would say in the final decade of their life when they're really thinking about what's impacting the quality of their life, it's this, it's the physical part. That's the thing I've lost that I missed the most. And sometimes it could simply be freedom from pain, but more often it's restriction of activity. Yeah, totally. So you, I mean, but I mean, that's my biased experience. You see much more of this. Tell me what you think. Yeah, it's a really analogous to the Proathletes I've worked with as well where it's really interesting to see these mature athletes who've been playing their sport eight or 10 years and they're starting to kind of look this reality that their career is going to be over. And they start recalibrating how they train because they start thinking about the long term and what's really fun for me is when they start to get that perspective of it's not just about this weekend, it's about the long game here. And I think to your point, a lot of people out there have the best intentions and they're maybe even working hard, but there's no precision. It's nothing's accounting for their specific details, their nuances of their joints and how they move and how their body feels when they move and they're trust in their body and all these variables, right? And a lot of people are either want to put in the effort and don't know where to start or a lot of people are putting in the effort, but it's not calibrated. Yeah. And I kind of even began to observe that in myself, which was their word, a lot of activities that I was doing where I was doing them because I'd historically always done them. Yeah. Right. Like we fall in groove. This is a type of exercise I enjoy doing. This is a turk type of workout I enjoy doing. And then I had to kind of take an honest assessment of some of these and say, okay, for every activity, just like for every investment, there's a risk and there's a reward. And the way you might think about investing in your 20s is probably different from how you maybe should be thinking about investing in your 60s or 70s or beyond. And similarly, the risk and reward changes over time. So for example, when you're 20, the risk is just inherently lower because you have better tissue. Right. You, you know, you, you, you, you, you, we could go through all the reasons why inflammation, so that's since like everything that changes as you age reduces tissue quality. And younger people, I'm sure you see this all the time, can just get away with doing things incorrectly. In fact, I, I, I, would you agree that sometimes some of the most gifted athletes actually have horrible patterns of movement, but because they're so gifted, it doesn't seem to matter. Yeah. I mean, specialization is one, right? Some people just born jumpers and then you train it. They, they practice it when they play and they get better and better jumping, absolutely. But more over it, it's almost like we're set up for failure, right? We're set up with this baseline norm of I could bench press 225 when I was senior in high school, but then that individual is not accounting for the 20 years of lack of, lack of activity, lack of practice. They, they've, they've at your feet. And then they jump right back into the gym and then they hurt things where they feel like they quote, can't do it anymore. And the reality is it's all about capacity. It's like if you don't use it, you lose it. And a lot of us aren't really thinking about what if I actually actively lost from an activity standpoint. Is it jumping? Is it mass? Is it strength? All those variables that you spoke to? But I definitely see this a ton on the injury and pain side, right? Injury doesn't show up out of nowhere. It has reasons why it shows up and it's compounded by emotional stress and all these other kind of multifactorial things when our brain perceives threat, we feel pain. Absolutely. Sometimes that's a physical threat. Like I even jumped in a long time. I started jumping, all of a sudden I wake up my killies' sore. That doesn't mean I ruptured my killies. But it does mean I was not prepared for that movement because I kind of been on the shelf for long time. And so I think a lot of people with that investment strategy analogy is fantastic and they should really incorporate that is making sure they're accounting for all the buckets that their body needs to do, not just with what they want to do, but what we know people need. Right? Demographics, Western society, age, all these things play a role to like if you pull up to step the stats. A lot of people will have a high risk for low back or high risk for an ankle or whatever. Yeah, the jump is a great example because if I go back to when I was in my sort of training peak, right? So basically age 13 to 20. Yeah, call it those years when I was training a lot. Jumping was an enormous part of what I did. Yeah. There wasn't a day that I wasn't jumping. So for example, I was skipping rope 25 minutes every single day and lots of those are doubles. Right? So you really up there, absurd amounts of plyometrics. And then from basically 20 to my mid 40s, didn't jump at all, right? Like not a single jump. Yeah. And that became one of the realizations was, oh, you've lost a lot of tissue liability. Yeah. And so as one example, now something that I do a lot of is like low level jumping. Right? And you're right. Like sometimes I get really worried. I'm like, oh, man, I don't want to have an achilles rupture. Like that is the middle-aged man in general. Yeah. Like I'm playing soccer with my kid and I'm just waiting for it. Yeah. Right. I mean, again, in my private practice to see this all the time. But what I always tell people who is like, look at your kids. Like if you go to a coffee shop with your kids, I guarantee one of more run and jump off a rock and do a twist and land it. When was the last time one of us did that? Right. And that's why they say maintaining play and always playing games. And and now and actually increasing that to where it's randomized games. Right. Like you're actually reacting to things because there's a neuroplastic effects as well. It's right. Just for the tissues like rehearsed load on the achilles in the foot. If you go and get a job and you drive to work and you sit at your cubic all day and you drive home and you didn't jump, that times five or 20 years it's going to cause a lot of lack of capacity and your tissues that you don't want to like learn the hard way. That's right. Because all I'd been doing in the intervening 25 years was swimming, cycling, hiking, which is fine. But it's not jumping. It's not reactive and it's and so again part of what made me start to realize this was as my kids got old enough and I was now playing sports with them. When you play basketball, soccer and baseball with kids, you realize exactly what you just said. It's not a predictable movement. It's never the same movement exactly three-dimensional short-long, quick-slow. Yeah. A lot of variables there. Which actually gets to this the idea that people listening to us are probably very familiar with, which is the centenary into cathlan. Have you give me some of the things on your centenary into cathlan? Yeah. I think for me wrestling with my kids, which means getting down on the floor, having the flexibility, wrestling with my grandkids, wrestling. Yeah. That's big. Just like play. Right? Because I'm not a child driver. Yeah. Well, yeah. We're depending on the kid. Yeah. If they're my grandkids, maybe. But that's definitely a goal of mine is is that bonding that you get when little kids are wrestling on the ground and I saw my dad recently doing that and I thought that was really cool. He's over 70 and he's on the ground, messing with my three-year-old and it was just cool to see. That's how I added that to my list. I was like, that's really cool that it was hard for him. It wasn't easy, but he got down there and he could do it and he didn't suffer from it. That's one of mine for sure. As you know, I fell in love with rucking over the last couple of years. I want to be able to really crank out some mileage, especially national parks as I get older. I'm not looking to be an ultra-marathon or per se, but I really want to be able to hike long distances, probably with a pack on it. What's, so if you're in your marginal decade, how many pounds would be your expectation? Do you want to be able to do, you know, give me some numbers. How many miles? How many pounds? Yeah, I think my numbers will be a little distorted because I'm pretty big guy. I'm 63 over 200. So I should be able to carry at least 20 pounds without worrying about too much for four to six miles. Okay. I like that, cool. Yeah, I mean, I want to be reading this on what kind of terrain. So I would like to be able to not to technical, like I'm not thinking boulders and rocks, but I definitely like to go hills up and down dirt track, all that kind of stuff without having to worry about it. Okay. What else? Another one is, I grew up being an athlete. My youngest seems to be the more inclined to be an athlete. So as I age, I want to be able to hang with him as long as I can. So that means throwing hitting a baseball as long as possible, who knows how their career's will evolve from an athletic standpoint. But odds are they're not going to be pros. I really want to keep that base where I can keep playing with them as long as I can. But to me, it's all about being able to still play with the grandkids because families, one of the most important things out there. And if your grandpa sit there and could do cool stuff, I think that serves as a great role model. Whereas if you're suffering from an injury, you're not healthy, then they want to hang out with you. But at the same time, kids want to go do stuff. And I don't want to be left out. Yeah, I agree. I think as much as I think there are probably examples where, you know, the wise old grandpa or grandma can sit inside and tell stories to the kids. I mean, there's value in that. But I think there's even more value in going to their world. They typically don't want to come into your world. You'd have to go to their world. So you have to be able to go fishing, like, and again, people listening to us who have young kids should not waste the opportunity to observe what young kids do. Yeah. And yeah, there'll be different technologies in 25 or 30 years. But I think the principles will be the same. Yeah. The kids like to play. And therefore, playing with my kids today is giving me a dry run of what I want to be able to do in 30 years. Yeah. And if you are building up these areas of need or you're accidentally letting these certain athletic kind of movements fall by the wayside, all of the sudden you're like, oh, man, I can't do that anymore. You know, I love coaching my kids basketball team. And one of the other kids in our team, their grandpa was out in the court with us one day. And you know, he was, I think 74. And, you know, he wasn't, you know, doing a wooden milledunk or anything. But he was moving and he could shoot. And every kid there, their eyes lit up. They're like, Grandpa can shoot. That's crazy. That was a cool moment, you know. And that's why I put on my list of just playing with kids. Might be my whole CD. I, you know, my wife might have some different to say about that. But I think for me, it's like, if I can play and if I can do all those things, then I'm, I'm doing pretty well. When I first introduced this idea of the centenary into Catholic on to, to, you know, the first of our patients. This is before, of course, we started 10 squared. Yeah. Um, one of the bits of pushback I got a lot was, you know, especially from people who were like in their 30s and 40s. They were like Peter, yeah, I'm not that interested in like 80s and 90s. Like I, you keep talking about making me a kick ass 80 year old. Like, yeah, I want to be a kick ass 40 year old. Yeah. What's, what's wrong with that? What's the, what's the, what's the flaw on that logic? Well, it's to me, it's everyone's drawn to this high performance. Be awesome right now, right? And that's like a boom best strategy, right? You might pull it off, but you're high risk. And eventually, you'll hit the wall if you're, if we're a race car, right? But if we're thinking long term, then by default, if I'm going to be an awesome 70 year 80 year old, I kind of have to be an awesome 45 or 55 year old. Like we're going to be doing things now that make you crazy strong to help your lean muscle mass, the burns your fat, all those health risk things, but you're also going to be way more prepared for whatever life throws at you. And if your buddy talks you into going skiing or going to do a volleyball game or whatever else, you're going to be way more ready for it. If you're thinking long term and building this crazy robust foundation, rather than chasing the newest technique or the newest technology. Yeah, the analogy I used with people at the time because archery is something I enjoy is that, you know, what we're trying to do is train you to be exceptionally accurate at 100 yards. And you're telling me that you don't care about 100 yards, you just want to be accurate at 40 or 50 yards. And I'm telling you, trust me, if you're an ace at 100 yards, it's like shooting fish in a barrel at 40 yards. And this is where the analogy is actually has a deeper layer of truth, which is that's a very non-linear thing. 100 isn't just twice as difficult as 50. It's like four or five times more difficult. And similarly, you know, to be really fit and healthy at, you know, in your 90s, is a dramatically more demanding feat than, you know, just to be a fit 50 year old. Yeah, there's a lot stacked against you, plus like variables that we're not prepared for or we could roll our ankle, but give me somebody who's strong all day. And if they spring their ankle coming out of the bar, they're actually going to spring it less odds are, right? So all this like insulation and capacity we put around us with the individual goals is crucial to prevent injury. And these injuries can stack up and cause a lot of trouble. And then we get less healthy. And that's how you get these multipliers where I was on track to be really good, but this knee arthritis or this multiple meniscus repairs I had to get because I wasn't stable caused me to actually lose my hiking ability. And then I'll send my gut less healthy. Let's fast forward a little bit, basically as I'm kind of getting better from the shoulder thing and realizing how fortunate I feel to have had this experience where, you know, I've known Altan for a while, then I met you. It's this kind of great connection. I sort of say, hey man, what do you think about this idea of we kind of build this separate little business that just focuses on the training piece that's outside of my practice, outside of your practice, but integrates it with everything that's necessary to train a person for the marginal decade. So you bring in all of the cardio training, you bring in all of the strength and conditioning, you bring in the coaches to integrate the whole thing. So okay, we're doing that now. Of all the things we do in 10 squared, I still think that your domain is the hardest for people to wrap their heads around. I think people understand, oh yeah, you guys, you guys will help me get a high VO2 Max. And you'll boost my zone two and you're going to make me stronger and bubble how do clients look at you? What are they on? What are they? What are they? What are they? Figure is going on with you. It's funny you say that because it always takes them like the assessment takes you know two days and we're looking under the hood a lot in a lot of different ways. And it's funny how they evolve like their perspective of it because you know what I was kind of forced to do in my career was become this, you know, I had I had experienced working with teams and all that other stuff, but I kind of became an offseason person for these athletes. And by default, I had almost become a strength coach, not because I wanted to that was my goal, but because these athletes needed that bridge from I'm injured to I might be injured to hey, I've got the green life for performance. And that spectrum we're always all humans are moving up and down that spectrum based on our recovery and all these variables, right? So what's been fun at 10 squared is I get to do all the assessment I want and it's not really a clinical assessment, right? On the one hand, we're of course looking at things that either have pain or that individual member has had a previous injury with and we're accounting for that and we're making sure that's on track or could be improved and we add those things, but then I also get to play around and look at what else is weak? What is this individual at risk for? So one example is we have a client who loves to surf. He's got a shoulder issue. So by default, surfing and swimming on a surfboard is a different position than a traditional freestyle stroke. So we had to make his shoulder uniquely robust in certain directions. And so that's part of his strength program. One of my biggest pet peeves in the rehab world is when people give someone 30 exercises that are really tedious and boring and no human sticks to that. They might do it for a week or two, but if it's not bridging to what they love and what they want to do, and we'll get there. So if we can bake in, having making ensuring that all the strength training won't make them worse, and then also make sure that we're baking in their little corrective exercises or improving the gaps, that's where you make a huge difference into how someone feels, but also how they can perform. So what are some of the things you see that, and I'm not asking this to be critical of what other rehab professionals do, but as a person listening to us who says, look, man, I've been kind of not getting better. I've had fill in the blank injury, so I've had tennis elbow that won't get better. I've had lower back pain that's just not getting better. I've had shoulder pain that's not getting better. How do you help that person think about whether or not there's an underlying structural problem that needs a surgical intervention or a more direct intervention versus, you're not being instructed to do the right things and or you're being instructed and you're not doing it. Like how do you walk somebody through that tree? Yeah, that's obviously to have you lived with law details. I think the first rule is the medical community, so your orthopedic surgeon or your neurologist and your rehab pro have to be in sync and have a relationship. And how often is that happening? I mean, it's very rare. Like what's really interesting is the philosophy and the individual just spirit of either the surgeon or the rehab pro, they have to be kind of committed to the service oriented field. Like if they're just doing it for money, they're going to do scale and they're going to do like the PT mill that there's four clients with one therapist and that therapist is probably doing the best they can, but they're just kind of outnumbered, right? And they're not accounting for this four different people all at once. So first off, it has to be one on one, right? Like you cannot tell me that you're rehabbing you the same way you could rehab my grandma who had a shoulder issue. Wait, are you saying that let's go sound like an ignorant question. Yeah. Are you saying that in some facilities, one PT will work with multiple clients at the same time and put them through the same workouts? Yes. Even if they're they have, even if they're quite different. Yes. Oh yeah. Typically it's a very cookie cutter approach. I see. And usually it's an insurance model thing, where you know they know that these certain exercises and putting ice or stem is going to be reimbursed by the insurance company. So the PT clinic is going to do that on everybody regardless of what they need. So that's one of the biggest pitfalls is it's never one on one. It's not custom. I mean in the same way I've had pro athletes come in and we're supposed to do shoulder rehab that day and the night before they did a ton of stuff to their shoulder. So I guess what? I'm not doing anything. Right? Like they actually need to recover that day. It needs to be customized, right? But to go back to your original question of how do people navigate this world? I think your rehab clinic needs to do more than just offer services. They need offer a plan. Right? This idea that, okay, this is what I offer. I offer cupping or dry needleing or whatever it could be. One service doesn't ever fix anyone and it definitely doesn't increase their capacity over time. The magic order of capacities what's all about. Are you building me back to what I want to do? So if your rehab clinic is a bunch of passive modalities on tables and a bunch of texts do an ultra sound and stuff, that's a red flag for me because they're not going to build you to get stronger and stronger. Number two is the orthopedic needs to actually be hunting down that physical therapy. So excuse me, a lot of times when I see the orthopedic world is they have to give their clients something for rehab guidance, right? Because they're not totally sure if their clients going to go to rehab can they afford one on one and all these other factors. So they give them this handout. Well a lot of times this handout is from 30 years ago and it's the same five or six could kick out our exercises, but then there's no accountability, there's no nuance. So there's just a lot of holes in this path to try to get your shoulder or your back or your knee from it hurts. Do I need surgery or not? Built all the way back up to you. I can do whatever I want. Now is this taking the extreme example of the other end, right, which is professional athletes. So you work with a lot of them. You work with golfers, football players, basketball and baseball players typically. Is there any other type of athlete I'm missing? I've had some incidental tennis people. It's okay. A lot of runners too. Yeah. Now some of those athletes come with deeper pockets than others and come from leagues where, you know, or so. So when you're talking about, you know, the NFL players, for example, is that problem completely solved? No, not at all. And there's a lot of environmental problems, right? So one of the biggest issues with all these people and I know I have friends that work with all these professional teams that are great and they're kind of handcuffed because they only have their athlete for so long. So you all of a sudden get this multiple cooks in the kitchen problem where even if everyone has the no ego and the best of intentions and their most science-based people, they're still not sure, okay, what'd you do last week? What are we trying to do? Are you in a contract year? Like there's so many variables for pro athletes. So in a weird way, a professional sports is wellness upside down, right? It's how can we get the most out of this athlete, this commodity for their contract? And that's not really a long term play. And so that's what's been really interesting at 10 squared. As we've had some pro athletes approach us with like this idea of, hey, can you guys be my reliable, like you're invested in me only and be my oversight? Like where are my gaps? Is this okay? Should I play through this pain? Because there are times you play through pain, there's times you don't, right? But the most important thing is this idea of having one person driving the bus who knows all your variables. Because if someone comes to us and changes their sentientering to Catfly, like they want to change one item, like hey, I really want to start doing jump rope every day. And then we look at their testing, we're like, look, you're high risk for Achilles. Let's begin your program. Some really good, articulate smart strengthening to get you there, rather than just hope it works out. So how do you guys do that? So, I never, I didn't ask her in advance if we could do this. So we might have to edit this out of our discussion. But can we use my wife as an example? So my wife is a client at 10 squared, right? Great example. So, so Jels are runner. Yeah. Like a little deer runs runs runs run run. Yeah. And so, so I don't, I'm pretty hands off. I'm very hands off anything that has to do with her. I'm already my design. Can you, can you tell us a little bit about her? Yeah. And, and what did you learn when you did an assessment of her? And how did that impact how she works with the other members of the team on the cardio side, on the strength and conditioning side? Yeah, other than saying that she's a saint for having signed up with you. You want me to talk, okay. Yeah. So, Jel was a great example of, she had some pain when she showed up. And again, I'll just talk about a detail and she can delete if she wants. But, Jel's a really great example because she had some pain when she showed up. So my job immediately is evaluate that pain. Is that a structural insufficiency? Are we worried about a real injury here? Or is that just an annoying nuance, right? Based on the testing I did. So, I did my clinical exam, but way more detailed than I normally would in my private practice because the 10 squared we have the time. And we want to remove confirmation bias. So, we don't want me to say, oh, your hamstring hurts, let's order number eye. Like, let's test it six ways and in a smart conservative way. And if all six of those indicate that, then we're going to do a number eye. Right? So, with Jel, we saw some proxmal hamstring issues. She's, of course, like you mentioned in Durin's athlete, her profile, her demographics, her running history, all pointed to there might be a tendonopathy there. And then based on my testing, it reinforced that. So, I said, let's get an MRI. Let's really evaluate this tendon because we knew in the near term within a year she wanted to run Boston. And as a injury person, I saw this as, look, she's okay now, but it hurts. Once we start stacking up her mileage, that thing's going to get in the way. Well, there's another detail here that I do recall, which obviously you recall as well, but it might be worth pointing this out to the listener. So, she normally only runs one marathon a year. Right. Last year she ran to, she ran her Boston qualifying marathon, which I think was Chicago or Houston or something like that. Yeah. And then got into the London marathon and went and ran that seven weeks later. Yep. And started to get for the first time ever a little bit of knee pain. And the other knee, the other knee, the side that was totally okay. So, can you explain why you didn't think that was a coincidence? Very much so. So, that story kind of perked my ears up, right, that history. And I saw her for an knee pain and brief to get her through London and that kind of stuff. But the way runners move, a lot of people don't appreciate, but running, even though I'm moving straight ahead, is technically a unilateral or single leg rotation propulsion drill. Explain what that means because it's counterintuitive. It really is. So, golfers are actually the same. They're single leg actually rotates to create that torque. So, what happens is my favorite term that's out there right now is called the spinal engine, which is really speaks to this reciprocal movement of the spine on top of the pelvis. And then my feet through the ground. So, those three domains, if you will, work in unison to propel me forward. It's a lot like with sailing, like you put the sail relative to the wind and it points me into direction. Yes. And so, all three of those domains have to work in sync. And so, when I all of a sudden see an athlete like Jill, she wasn't new to running. She definitely added her volume in a short window, which is a great recipe for injury. But that right knee flaring up told me, okay, there's something going on at either her feet or her pelvis that's not in sync. Because she essentially, with her mileage overloaded that right knee and created a repetitive stress injury. So, that's why I was saying earlier injuries don't just show up for fun, right? The great Almighty Bubbed and say, Jill, it's here right knee pain today, right? And so, whenever you see a story like that, and then you do the evaluation. And the way her pelvis was rotating, the way her core and her spine were set up. And also the way that left hamstring was affecting her motion. She was basically dumping into that right knee over and over. 10 miles for someone like her, no big deal. You stack up two marathon's pretty close with that much mileage. All of a sudden that right knee really flares up. And so, the right knee flare was actually an indicator of something else going on functionally. And it wasn't only about making her knee better, which is what traditional medicine does is like, okay, rest it, ice it, mocks, cam, treatment, rehab, chiro, whatever. And then the knees better. And then traditionally, those people go run again and three or five months later, it comes back. So we need to look at these asymmetries everywhere else, not just the side of pain. And so, if the knee is caused by the hamstring, what do you think is the cause of the hamstring injury? And why are women, middle-aged women, so susceptible to this injury? Yeah, great question. I think, demographically, you know, a lot of middle-aged women, it's getting way better, but don't strengthen ring number one. So the health of their tendons and the muscle fibers and the mass of the muscles just aren't normally as high and as strong as someone else, especially if they're an endurance athlete, right? Because typically, runners nowadays know that they need a cross-trained, but how they're doing and what looks like it's still a big gap in my opinion, right? So using the word cause is always tricking by my canics, but because it's always kind of like the snake eats the tail. They're all kind of intertwined, but the most simple way of describing it is that tendon overuse and what we found out with her MRI is that she had a true tendonopathy damaged to that proximal hamstring tendon, as well as one of the hip rotators that inserts on the same site next to that hamstring, had a little damage in irritation. That area was a byproduct of the way she was rotating through her pelvis and the way that spinal counter rotation was happening. Jill has a tiny bit of scoliosis, which just sets her up for that asymmetry, and so her brain subconsciously was basically forced with the decision of, do I jam my right low back or do I really try to pull with that left hamstring? And that combination over time created a little frame in the tendon. And the other thing I would add to this, which I suspect any woman listening to us, whose had kids will appreciate is even though Jill is tiny, she said her body never went back to pre-pregnancy. So if she talks about how she used to run before 2008, so our first child was born in 2008, and she ran a bunch of marathons before then, and then she's run a bunch of marathons since, and she weighs the same. This is not like, you know, she's been very fortunate in that regard that her body weight has changed my period of time, but she says she cannot buy a mechanically do what she used to be able to do. Now, when I hear that, I assume her pelvis was mechanically changed by having kids, and she feels it, but she can articulate it, nor can I necessarily, but she just says there's something different. I don't run, she felt like she used to float. And now she feels like she runs. Yeah, right, she's colliding. Yeah, I could definitely see that and I think a lot of women feel that way. My wife had the same experience. I think one of the biggest crimes in modern medicine today is that, you know, a running back, if we blow an ACL, we know exactly what to do, and there's a protocol, and everyone's like, okay, and eight months, this athlete will be back, but women, everyone cares about the baby, right? The baby's born even the mom cares about the baby. They sacrificed their own body just to make sure this, this little creature grows up and gets everything in needs, right? And so this focus on what women need the first year after is very lacking in my opinion. I hope somebody's listening to us, by the way, it's thinking of another type of a 10 squared, which is like, absolutely. What are we doing for women immediately post baby? Yeah. And again, it's, you know, vaginal and c section is too totally different operations or too don't you think too different? But there should be really robust, you know, rehab paths to get them back in amazing shape immediately as opposed to, yeah, well, we'll come back to this in 10 years. Yeah. Well, I mean, the complexity of what they deal with is fascinating, right? Because not only do they just add weight by adding this human, the relaxing hormone creates areas of stress and laxity that will shorten up and tighten up over time. Yeah. But it affects different women differently. Some women's feet change, right? In that environment of more relaxing and caring more weight, the arch and the foot gets affected. And so, in a way, I always look at it, it's like, okay, all these areas suffered a little bit of what you might call as an injury. But let's look at it, like, okay, it's a natural process. But how do we account for all these layers? Like, no one out there is telling women to do foot strengthening when there are two months pregnant, right? But they should be. I wouldn't have thought of it until you just said it now. Yeah. No, I mean, literally women just like we did for your shoulder. If you've found out your pregnant, you should start doing some foot strengthening things, some core stability stuff, making sure your motion. There's a ton of things you could do. Pre-hop, right? And then after, obviously, you know, God willing to say how goes and get the baby good. But then you start trying to strengthen the right way, you know? And I think there's something about the pelvic floor that is absolutely decimated in pregnancy or delivery, more to the point. Yeah. And I deep down believe, no pun intended, that that's a part of what is gone wrong in her hamstring. And I see this in many of her friends, right? Yeah. Because they'll come, you know, this is like very common complaint is that is, and then it doesn't present as even a hamstring injury. It presents as either knee injury or a high, like an Istio-Tuberosity pain, which is like the sit bone. And they say, oh, I just, I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to sit. I want to sit. Oh, yeah. One of my favorite words, the exercises down. He called me and he's a hip-ortho, great guy. And he's like, hey, you know, you got to help me out here. My wife has the same issue. And she's been doing traditional PT for like eight months and it's no better. And she's about to fire me, you know, because she's like, what are you doing? You know, but it's a very common thing. And that's what's been really cool for me to see these pelvic floor specialists that are rising. It's really cool field. A ton of expertise with it. I am not an expert in pelvic floor binding means. But like you touched on the pelvic floor is very much a big player and how we pressurize our interbdomal stability. It's basically the flooring of that whole canister that we're supposed to create with proximal stability. And so if the diaphragm or the pelvic floor is in doing its job, then our body's going to immediately start to compensate and create rotations and tilt around things. Let's, let's talk for a minute about the, the core. Like, again, I hate the term because it's so misused. But the way we talk about it is probably most closely aligned with how DNS thinks about it, dynamic neurmuscular stabilization. So maybe just say a moment about it through, through the lens that we think about the core as a cylinder. Yeah. Um, as opposed to quote unquote abs. Yeah, exactly. I think that's the starting point that I wish everyone could, automatically understand is that if you have a really prominent rectus abdominus that's six pack, that has nothing to do with how you stabilize your trunk, especially if I'm doing things in multi planes like tilting and rotating. So it's not just your oblique see there, but it's the deep stabilization system that not only pressurizes with our diaphragm, the pelvic floor, but it's also all the small muscles up and down my spine, including like multi-foot eye. Do all those muscles kick on and create stiffness in the right way at the right time. I think a lot of times people are accidentally overcoached into thinking they only need stiffness because the, the second step to that is, okay, now I can activate that deep stabilization system. I have that bracing. I'm pressurized. I'm using my transverse abdominus. All these other structures down there. Now can I do that with motion, right? And that's where you start looking at someone kicking or running or throwing, like that needs to be a dynamic system, not just a stiff system. And I think a lot of people, they don't have the first one. So they see a ton of these exercises like the DNS three month or dead bugs or whatever else you want to call them that create kind of deep core stabilization. But they don't see the next step after that, which is, okay, now how do I maintain that pillar and that strength and then I get a free shoulder blade or a free hip to move. And one of our shared clients, he had a lot of ridiculous nerve pain from a disc issue. And he was convinced, you know, he had some of that. But one of the most fascinating cases for me in recent memory because with him, we were able to actually find a trigger point that referred pain that mimicked that ridiculous nerve pain. So when we literally pressed on his glute minimus, he got referral that he thought was a tribute to his back, right? So that was it window towards, okay, that's a muscular issue. That's not your spine causing trouble. And then we gave him these stabilization drills which helped that glute just kind of relax for once. What we see all the time in the clinic setting is muscles are meant to be a muscle. My bicep is meant to contract in relax. It's not meant to be a shoulder stabilizer. But if my stabilization isn't doing its thing, then that bicep and the trap and all these other muscles try to help. And that's where we lose freedom of movement. But because your body is essentially perceiving a little threat, a little instability, and so it tightens other structures up. So then I see people coming in our office saying, will you try needle this or work on me or do soft tissue work? And you're like, yeah, but that's going to be the good of the stretch place. That's going to be a six hour benefit. But if we activate this deep stabilization system and get all the parts moving in unison and in sync, all the sudden those movement problems go away and you're much more robust and strong. Yeah, there's so much I want to say on this and I don't want to lose the thread, but I'll sort of say two things that that seem unrelated, but they're quite related. The first is, I wish there was another word for stability that didn't imply static. Yes, because stability and we just we we we sort of think of that as things that are not moving. Yeah, right? So rigid, stable, etc. But the true way to appreciate stability is kinetic stability. That's why in the book, which I know you haven't read, but if you do read it one day, no, I'm not too busy. I know. In the section of the book where I write about stability, the analogy I use much against the desire of my publisher who hated it was that of a race car. Because you can think in like, how does a race car explains stability? But if anybody's driven a race car or if you haven't, if you can take my word for it, one of the fundamental differences between a race car and a street car is that in a race car, you're transferring much more of that horsepower to the tires than you are in a street car. In a street car, a lot of energy seeps out because the chassis is not very stable. Right. And you might say, well, why? Well, in the case of a car, it's because it's more comfortable. Yeah, you know, race cars are not being optimized for comfort, they're being optimized for performance. If you're optimizing for performance, you actually want more stability in the chassis and the suspension so that you're transmitting more force to the tires and the tires to the surface. And similarly, when you think about an individual who has stability, they are able to transmit force much more directly to the outside world and they are able to receive force more safely from the outside world. Yeah. And that's why like no matter how long you ever gave me, I could never throw a hundred mile an hour fastball. And it's not that I don't have this strength. I'm sure that if you put even the, you know, even if you put a 20 year old version of me next to a picture, I could out, I could have outdone him in every measure of strength. But I didn't have this stability to be in motion and stabilize the capsule of my shoulder and transmit force like a whip through my arm. Yeah. And so you wouldn't look at a picture and thinks that's stability. But it's remarkable stability. Dynamics stability, absolutely. And there's a ton of analogies I've heard over the years. I'm not a car expert like you, but one of the ones I've used a lot in my practice is, you know, for while I had this really old truck that we were working on. And it was like a mid 80s Chevy kind of thing. And when you turn the wheel from, you know, my hands are at let's say nine and three, it wouldn't turn until my hands got to like 12. The steering on that thing was sluggish, right? So that dynamic stability, it wasn't very good, right? Whereas like an F1 car, a go car, that thing moves with the micro movement. So if you translate that to the human body, anybody listening, if I said, hey, do a skater hop or you leap laterally from one side to the other, how you land and how you can you stick that landing or are you falling over as you go? Yeah. So, and there's a million variables involved there. But the big ones, of course, are your rate of force, like can you absorb that? Can all your tissues, the arch, the killy, the IT band, the hip, your core, can all those tissues kick on at the same time to create stiffness. Number one, and a precursor to that is where's your balance? Like to generate that first force, where you organized or did you have to like throw your head in the hands a weird way to generate the force? But now I'm not in an optimum landing position. So what a lot of times you see in youth athletes is people rush to put strength on them, but a really good strength coach can put strength on a college athlete, you know, in eight weeks, right? But do they have speed? Do they have organized movement? Are they quick in all planes of motion? Is there balance really good? Because now my nervous system, my software is ready to absorb all these things. And then you put strength on top of that, that's a great athlete. And a lot of these genetic people that are just naturally really good, they have some of that kind of underlying ability to where they can land and organize well. And then later they put strength on. You know, pick a sport and you can show me somebody who was really athletic and they weren't really big and strong, but you can put the strength on later. And that's one of my biggest kind of personal passions is these like 14 to 15 year olds who just get buried in the gym and then they tweaked their back. I had one local team where it was a golf team and about 30% of their athletes had a stress fraction in their limers mind. Oh my, what? Yeah, it was absurd. How was the strength coach not getting fired? So I reached out to the head coach and the strength coach and to give all these people a little bit of a past, they're not really equipped because they're managing 200 kids. I think it's just a bad setup. Right? You have 200 athletes that you're supposedly managing a program for. And you're not watching technique whether or not you know what you're talking about. It's a whole another argument. But like the idea of, okay, we're going to do a high performance on a 14 year old and put strength on them. But no one's watching technique or teaching them the foundations of lifting. While at the same time, they're 14. We should be making them quick athletic and coordinated first because that's a platform you want to build an athlete on. You don't want to make a kid really slow but really strong when they're 15. Right? Because you can't train. It's really hard to train speed as you go there. Yeah. What is it that you see? So when a client comes into 10 square and you do an assessment, how do you gauge how far they are away from being able to do the dynamic movements? How are you engaging? What are you testing? What are you looking for to say? Yeah, this person could start doing plies. Like for example, one thing I love doing. It's kind of one of my, I don't have this on my centenary into Kaiflan list because we're being so strict about that only having 10 things. But I have kind of a side list of things that I want to be able to do. Like I want to know how late in life. I can maintain certain metrics. And one of them is how late in life can I still do a broad jump of my height. Cool. So why is that something I enjoy doing? Because it combines two things. It combines the concentric strength and power to be able to leap. But even more importantly, and at least as difficult is it requires the eccentric strength to land decelerate really quickly. Yeah. So how do you know when you look at someone if they're ready to do that, for example? Yeah. So we did a ton of work. And the literature and the science is out there to a degree for you stack things on top of themselves. So you start with isometric. And you progress people to more kind of in explosive or compound movements. Right? So let's assume that I don't have any injury risks at all. And you would determine that based on just my history? No, a testing. Yeah. A history testing, demographic risk. There's a lot of variables we look into for having concern about like musculoskeletal injury. That's number one. But yeah, every person is different that way. And we've had people come in who've had multiple surgeries and injuries. And then we've had other people come in who they're high risk for injury. But overall they're pretty good package to work with. Right? There's not a medical concern, if you will. So ignoring all the medical side of it, you basically, I really like following the principle that the exercise is the test. Because we basically look at everything about four to five different ways. But if I watch someone do, let's say a wall squat. So just to be clear, people understand a wall squat is just the level one. It's isometric. Isometric load. It's what we all used to do in like high school practices, where a burned your claws and your patella tendons. And we can even set you up to where you're on the right position. So that's going to tell us a comfort with the position number one. Right? Can they even get there? So tell me what is failure constituted by pain or not doing it for a certain length of time? Which we said we have has a qualitative and a quantitative associate. So the quantitative we have minimums or it's either time or percentage is a body weights for every test or distance is like you mentioned on the broad jump. But then there's also like how does it look? And then the how it looks one is the vague part of the movement world. So you're going to have your coach and myself both looking at it. But then we have other ways where we're confirming that with our motion capture machines, with our force plates, with our videos that analyze the movement. So there's a lot of ways to confirm. You can also see these things kind of cross over, right? So how does someone do on the double leg versus single leg? It gives us a really nice window to okay, where is the lack? Great example, two leg really strong. They're solid. We put them on single leg and they're abnormally less functional and weak and do have the range. So I'm immediately thinking okay, there's a balance control issue here. Because on two legs, I'm really stable. But on one leg, I'm significantly less stable and it's much more complex for the body. And so if there's scores, even though they're strong and there are quads have the capacity. But when they're on single leg, they're they're not strong and they can't stabilize. That gives me a window right away as saying this person has a major balance risk or things like that. And in the case of that individual, do you not progress them? No, we find their floor and we build from there. So some people will have really cool robust, you know, Instagram where the exercises for one region. But in another area, we're filling in gaps. We're building foundations and we're basically building them up from wherever those floors are. And the key for us is this big grid we have where we have every category movement we care about and then we build them from their floor. So what I always kind of, I'm really visual person. But I always say, okay, we have this baseline floor. Maybe for their upper body pole, they're on the third floor, they're bad ass they're killing it. But then their core stability in one plane is like in the basement. Like I'm worried about a lumbar stenosis or an nervous you. So that takes precedence first because I don't want this person to experience pain. And I want to build them up to where they're all on the first second, third floor of the building. Okay, so let's go back to jail for a minute. So we have this diagnosis, which is, okay, we've sort of figured out why your knee is hurting. We now have a radiographic diagnosis, that completely comports with what's being seen on the physical exam and symptoms. These are stubborn injuries. Yes. So what's the, what was the next step? So the next step was immediately, you have to have a part's approach first. Right? If I have a damage part, we've got to make sure does that need an intervention or not? How are we going to address that? So with Jill, we knew her foundational like underlying movement patterns or disfunctions, if you will, that were contributing to that. So we put a package together for her program, that was all of those underlying structural functional issues that didn't make the hamstring worse. We started building those right away. While we considered play the rich plasma, and she actually ended up going for it to create essentially regeneration of that tendon at the damage site, which she did perfect with. We had to have a lot of come to Jesus conversations about, you cannot run too soon. If we're going to go through all this trouble and financial costs, we want to make sure that that can heal as much as it can. So everything we did in her programming was to ensure we didn't flare that up. And then conversely, we really communicate with not just the strength team at 10 squared, but also her physical therapist off site and her running coach. And all of us had to put together this six month plan where her running coach didn't actually flare it up, right? Because he does have a window to everything we're doing. He definitely needs to talk to the PT as did we to where she could quote, get medically cleared. I should know this because I live with her. But I don't remember exactly how long she actually had to stop running. And I mean, I know that it was right after the first and second PRP injections. But does eight weeks sound about right? Yeah. So because of her timing for the race and she wants to run Boston, we had a little extra runway. So the more healing time you can get the better, we have a lot of people who are like really impatient dying here. If you're a pro athlete, you might not have that luxury, right? But that's what's been fun for me about 10 squared. I don't have all these environmental constraints. I could just get to look at people. When you're training for an event that's 30 years from now, you got to take short cuts. Yeah, let's take a breath and be really detailed, right? And so with Jill, the PM and R docks and the physiatrist will always kind of give you different amounts. But usually two rounds for her issue. So you do one round of PRP, basically do nothing and then you do another round about two weeks later. And then you slowly let that heal and you start to add physical therapy. So with Jill total time, we were doing a ton of stuff around the area of the injection right away. Like that's imperative. You don't stop everything. You just protect the area and you train everything else. So that is going to be one of the reasons why we get a lost success with her. And then back that up with, we really did targeted physical therapy for that site to promote the healing. So the physical therapy side, they're using a ton of things like BFR, dry kneeling, we're necessary. Everything you can just help those parts heal, foster that growth hormone, foster that protein synthesis, build that muscle up without a lot of force and the tendon, all those things that a traditional physical therapist that knows what they're doing, they can crush that. Yeah, and she for eight weeks had to swim. Yeah. So she was pleasantly open-minded. It's hard for every athlete to not do their support. I get that. But I've delivered that medicine over and over for a long time. And so she swam. So she didn't lose any true cardio, right? She yes, she lost a little bit of running strength. But someone with her background and her base and then keeping everything else really strong, she's going to hit the ground running and she's running now and doing really well. And so I always say I have two athletes. I've athlete that I've encouraged. Like it's okay. Those tend to be more of your traumatic acute like ACL type people where you got to show them in the lab and show them in the gym that it is okay. Keep pushing, you're good. And then I have the other athletes where you have to hold them back. Right? And so Jill's going to be that one like, let me go, let me go. And we have to play back cop just enough where science supports that. So where she doesn't flare it up again, because we need her to have a nice smooth progression. I'd rather her be really balanced and athletic and strong and feeling good on race day, not like a bunch of junk miles in that tendon and the knees starting to hurt her again and stuff like that. All right. So let's pick another type of client that you'd see at 10 squared, which is maybe somebody who comes in who doesn't have a great training history. Yeah. They don't have, they've never really been an athlete. Right. Um, and, but, but they, but they, the thesis really resonates. They sort of go, you know what? Like I get it, man. Like this is like I feel fine now. Even though I'm not particularly athletic and I'm not training a lot, but I'm young enough that it hasn't caught up with me yet. You know, I'm in my 40s or whatever. Yeah. Um, but I now accept that when I do my test, like because those people don't typically do very well on the assessment because it exposes, you can't, you can't hide from not having done the work. Yeah. Um, so how do you think about like where to start when there is so much work to do? So you talked earlier about, you know, this is on the second floor. This is on the first floor. This is on the penthouse. This is in the basement. We're going to focus on the basement. What do you do when everything is first floor basement? Yeah. So great question. I think number one we got to build the habit. So that's a big part of this is when your coach is basically in contact with you every day as much as you want to help bend and twist and develop that formula, to swear that person is actually encouraged to do it. They enjoy it. They like it. I've had people tell me, yeah, this core stuff makes sense, but I just hate getting on the floor. Okay, we got to pivot and change the program, right? Because if I just try to convince you to do an exercise that you hate doing, it's not going to last. That's number one. Number two is we want to really mitigate the risks of injury because those just you get some momentum going on the psychological habit side. And then, ugh, I pulled my hamstring. I'm devastated, right? So we got to get those foundations going. But then usually we look at the medical risk side. So some people, the CPAD test was terrible, right? Their VO2 numbers are bad. You know, in our society, you got to have a good heart. We want to get that off the table from a risk factor. So we'll probably really put that routine cardio in in a manner in which we don't flare up the things that could create an injury. So one client we had recently, he didn't know it. He didn't bring it up. He's never had leg or foot issues at all. But his testing, his calves, he's a big fall risk. His calves were crazy week. His balance wasn't good because he didn't have strength and he's definitely a high risk for an Achilles. How old is this person? 52. You wouldn't expect to see that in somebody so young, right? Yeah, but he just poured himself into his career and really successful, really smart, cool guy. But he just hasn't trained a lot of and he had kind of a health scare, which is what motivated him to get organized. Let's get this stuff right. You know, it's interesting to see his really successful, like analytical brain, use that scare to be like, okay, I got to get, I got to get sorted out. You can see he operates his business the same way, right? Problem identification, what's a solution? Problem solution, problem solution. So with him, he didn't know he had any of these risk factors, but he was a textbook for having a fall or blowing out his Achilles because of the weakness and the lack of capacity and strength he had. And if you were to handicap that, like, how many years away would he have been from something like that being quite likely? Is it something he's going to have before he was 60? Yeah, he's definitely in that bucket of he could have been, you know, it's a little fear of injury, but like he wasn't set up to like having to change direction quickly, or maybe trips off a curb after dinner in New York, right? Like he could have had something like that easily, right? Bit guy too. So, you know, top heavy, just like me, big tree fall hard. So with him, he wasn't even aware of that weakness, but the last thing we're going to do is give him a running program, right? Like we got to design his CPET stuff and his VO2 max training and his own two training around these inefficiencies with his body. And so the workout in the gym needs to link up perfectly with those risks and also what is the most important thing for him right now. It's not difficult to communicate to clients because did they ever feel like, hey, I'm not doing enough? Oh, yeah, a lot of people are overwhelmed, but what's been really nice is the data, but then the calibration. And so what's been really cool with some of our clients we've had for several months now is consistency is always the name of the game, especially when we're playing the long game, like we are. And with someone's going on a two-week vacation, we want to know, where are you staying? What is the gym look like? We will change your workout so that you can keep doing it while you're on vacation. And if you tell us, look guys, I'm going to be really active in the day. I kind of want to decompress. I've been working in my basement garage really hard for three months. Great, let's take care of the total human. Let's give him a 30 minute, like, small thing to where you can almost have that lightning of like the mental load, just decompressed, but he's still making gains and he's still building that up, right? That's what's been fun for me that I almost never got the chance to do, even though I wanted to with some of my athletes because there would be so many variables in the way. With this, if we get a video of your gym and we know, okay, they don't have a bench that goes to incline, but we do have TRX and they have a treadmill that goes to incline, but they don't have a bike. We can change their workout to where they keep marching along and it's an agreeable way for them. And it's not just like, oh, I was on vacation, I didn't work out for two weeks. Because you can also actually, if you don't work out for two weeks, we go backwards. That's a bummer. Yeah, this idea about foot reactivity is so important, right? I think, I've been much more attentive to it in the past couple of years and I've noticed the number of times when I've lost my footing and regained it. I've never had a fall. It's never resulted in anything because it's been it's been caught. But I keep thinking to myself, like, this is the type of slip that can be devastating. And I don't know how long I'll, like, I don't know how long because these are really type two fibers that are doing it and the type two fibers atrophying as we age. And is the jumping, is the types of jumping things that we do sufficient to preserve it? Like, what, you know, if you're someone like me and you who part of our CD involves probably walking on uneven surfaces one day. Yeah. So being at whether for you it's rocking for me, it's maybe going out and hunting or something like that. Like, you're not walking on pavement. Right. And you're not even just walking on, like, beautifully manicured grass. Yeah, it's slanted to the side. It's like pebble gravel. Yeah. Like, you're always going to lose your footing somehow and you have to be able to regain it. What are the most important exercises that you need to be doing to maintain all of the characteristics of tissue and nervous system to preserve? Yeah, I think the best way to answer that is more principle based. So I think number one is we behave in a three-dimensional space. So this idea of only doing calf raises my toes pointed straight ahead, insufficient, right? Because to your point, there's going to be moments where my toes are out or one toe is out. So we want to do all these strength exercises and multiplanes emotion. And that doesn't mean even in a static position. But that's like a lunge, lunging to the side, lunging backwards. Like, you want to train in a three-dimensional space number one. So all of your training should account for that. If we're just doing bicep curls and calf raises, it's like I'm on these railroad tracks. But the minute you make me go sideways or rotate, it's trouble, right? So three-dimensional number one. Number two would be to get motor unit recruitment, right? To really make sure that those muscles are firing, you need to do really heavy loads or things that are really fast, right? To get that nervous system to like wake up and respond. The problem with that is not of a lot of us are ready for that. So what usually start with is really long hold isometrics. So we put you in these different positions and find ways to resist that and pull and create stiffness and remodel those tendons. So we're essentially making those parts ready to start going into the danger zone that is explosive powerful movement, right? I don't I shouldn't say danger zone as much as I should say like this is an ask. Yeah, risks zone. So these heavy overcoming isometrics they call them. One of my favorites is that mid-diple is kind of a standard in the sports science world where you have a bar and you basically calibrate the machine to where the bar is about the mid-diple and it's almost like the very top of a deadlift and you just pull but the bar doesn't get to move. And the sensory input is like the four stacks and they're measuring your balance your force and all these other cool metrics. But holding that over time we're now isometrically loading the heck out of my grip, we're loading the heck out of my shoulders, we're getting into my feet, my quads, my hips and I'm just holding that for time. That sets all these up. And you just do this with a super super heavy loaded bar that's too big for you to lift. Not necessarily you can actually do an empty bar but you pull it up against the safety bars in the rack or something like that. I symmetric thigh pull is the thing to look up. But there's a lot of ways to load these heavy isometrics because that gets your tissues ready and you build that up over several weeks and that 10 in a dab and now it's ready to resist force. And then the way you bridge that is you start doing deloted plyometrics. So now maybe we do some sort of like a band assisted pogo where I'm actually pulling on a band ahead. Oh sorry, overhead. You're pulling down on that band. It's essentially lightens me right because the band's going to pull me back up. And now I get to train that speed and that quickness through the ground but it's not my full body way. And so that's a great way to bridge from okay now I've got the parts ready. Now can I d-load the amount of force and train the speed. Once I've got the speed going in the parts, now I just get to become an athlete and do body weight and beyond. And so that's where you see these really high level athletes, even at early ages, their trainers know how to build that paradigm up and bridge it across to where you don't get any injuries along the way but you get a really springy force resistant person. So so many of us like we touched on initially don't train pogo's, we don't train plyometrics, we don't play like if you go out to the local men's and women soccer league, how many people there over 40, not very many right? Now there's a lot of reasons why that is but we're not playing games and we're not reacting to stuff. And so we need to make the gym at safe space where we can recreate these things and essentially test out these movements so I don't lose it. And maybe just to even things out so Jill doesn't think I'm picking on her injury. Let's talk a little bit about my limitations. So the thing that's probably been my biggest source of nag in the past 12 months has been foot ankle. Like let's talk a little bit about those injuries, why they're occurring. And again, they're not debilitating. They don't actually prevent me from doing a single thing. But because I'm sensitive, I just want to know, like hey, like is this a harbinger of something? And so what's your assessment of what's going on in my, and how would you even describe it? Would you describe it as my ankle? Would you describe it as my you know, nivicular tailor joint? Like where is the actual issue in me? So with you without getting your foot out, you have a very mobile foot. So you know, you're swinging back around, like the swimmers have really great mobile feet, right? Like show me a soccer player who had their foot strapped and cleats for 10, 20 years versus a swimmer, like very different setups, right? So it's really speaks to how tissues adapt over time. So your feet have a ton of motion in them. They are not restricted. You also do a lot of barefoot work in the gym, which is helpful for you. Your feet are actually pretty strong, too. Like if we test your big toe and your smaller toes, you don't test outside the normal limits for strength requirements. But your biggest gap is that multi-positional stiffness and that ability to create force absorption through your tissues. And you're actually set up for that because you can move so much, right? You don't find those in-ranges, either the boany in-ranges or those tendons can't grab because there's so much play in that pattern. So what you accidentally do all the time is you'll go on a rock or you'll go on a hunt where you're off-road and you're getting all these angles, you'll slowly flare up a tendon and tendons are notorious for not hurting. And thank you for not telling everybody the last cause of injury. I would never. Just for the listener. I don't know why, but I somehow decided two months ago to pick up a pogo stick. Never done it in my life. It's somehow decided. Is that in the bonus since you need a cat on for you? It's like I'm going to add another activity. Pogo sticking up and down the driveway. Yeah, that goes in the bucket of you should have called me first. Like what? I mean, you survived. Second I started. I was like, oh, not a good idea. I'm just got your feet not at the other end. You know? So because your feet are so mobile, tendons are notorious for they don't really hurt at the time, but they hurt like crazy the next morning. And what you always routinely say, which is really common if you're playing or fasciitis, or pateler tendonitis is when I first get up, it's really stiff and creaky and soar and hurts. And that's because tendons love blood flow. They love movement and they love motion. And so all those chemicals that come with inflammation, if we're just sitting around or sleeping, that's the opportunity to get stiff and really sore and achy. So with that kind of symptom pattern, you're not really lost on what it is because that's classic tendon, right? You can walk, we can load it. There's no like failure. So we're not worried about a muscular strain or any other damage, but that tendon gets really hot and spicy, especially in the mornings, if you're not creating that stiffness. So we started doing with you is just that. And just to be clear, we are nine or 10 weeks ago, since my pogo sticking debacle. Yeah. I no longer have, it's no longer as bad, but every single morning when I get up, there is still incredible and sharp pain right at that tendon. Yeah. Why is this taking so long? Well, tendons are one of the slowest things to heal. And I guarantee if we really zoomed in and looked at all of it, like you probably have a little tendon-opathy in those tendons, little damage here and there, that could be contributing to that irritation. But the most important thing is understanding the tendon-stake months to regenerate. And if, you know, you and I have had a pretty consistent attack with it, but we finally got you on a really good like rehab program you're doing yourself where we're loading the heck out of it with these isometrics and we're building the load more and more and we're loading those isometrics in different positions. So one of the ones we do with you a lot is that front foot hover, but you're actually planar flexing. So where you're driving, you're doing as much of a calf raises you can in that split squat position and then we make you hold that while you do that split squat. So it changes the whole angle in the relationship. But it's a complex movement. So we've got a plate in front of me. Yep. Just basically finding a bump of the plate. So we're two and a half three inches up. Yep. The my front foot just, you know, ball of foot and toes are on there. I'm in a split squat. Yep. And what am I doing with that front foot? I'm lifting it. Yes. So to plan to flex. Yeah. For you, the goal was really training. So your toe off was one of the problems. So what happens with you is when your foot, you're actually your heel lands, you're driving your body forward, your foot's behind you. You would do like a little bit of a rotation out and create like a little bit of a whip through where it wasn't nice and pure rotation rolling through the foot in the toe. It was kind of complex and putting extra stress at the ankle. That times 10,000 steps a day will really, you know, pick at that 10 and make it sore, which is why you wake up the next day So what we're trying to do is put these tendons at different lengths and then putting a lot of load through them and then the complexity we're adding isn't necessarily at that joint, but we're actually adding motion and complexity above with the lunge and also the requirement of you having to stabilize, centrally having to stabilize centrally in that mid-party or body while that foot is locked in. So someone with a really mobile foot, you tend to really use that foot for everything and that's how you spice up those tendons and I'm essentially putting that foot in a position where that tendon has to heel and it has to get stronger, but then I'm making the other parts of your body reach that complexity and meet the demand. So this is the second time I've had this flare up. Right. This is the first time I had it was probably a year and a half ago when I really started increasing rucking volume. Yes. Was that unreal? I mean, this was caused by kind of an acute incident, which was the pogo sticking where I clearly over plantar flexed or dorsy flexed. Yes. I guess we saw that extreme dorsy flexion that did it. What do you think was driving it on the rucking side and what is more importantly, what does this mean for me? Where do I turn? Yeah. How do I make it? Because right now it doesn't matter. If this keeps happening and I'm in my 80s, this is the difference between reacting and not reacting and being able to get around a knot. So how do I prevent this from being a lifelong problem? Yeah, that's a great question. So I think the pogo, that dorsy flexion, or bring your toes up, the pogo, when it's a sudden like a cube force like that, you probably also just create a little bit of a joint irritation. It's analogous to jamming your finger. If you move those two joint structures together really hard quickly and your body can't absorb that force, that'll get a lot more sore than if it's just kind of a slow repetitive stress like the rucking. The pathway is, and you've noticed the relief, like when we do the manual therapy and things like that, that's a nice short term, like off feels a little better, a little less pain, great. But the bigger picture and the ask of your body is teaching it, how can it respond to this and how do I build that force in those tendons to where not only is that tendons start to regenerate and heal, but then it's also ready to react to all the things you do. So knowing for you specifically that you love to use those feet and the more barefoot you are, like you're more likely to do that, we need to do a ton more quick work with you that's deloted to train all those tendons. I mean, there are so many tendons in the lower leg and the ankle. We need to train all those tendons to get quick and stiff in different positions so you don't jam the joint or create a stress in the tendon. Should I be doing less barefoot activity? No, I don't think so at all. I think that's a pathway to frailty. Like you want to stimulate their sectors in the bottom of your foot. Do I want you running on like a river like barefoot with a sharp rock? No, because that's going to cause other problems. But I think having you barefoot makes your foot in mobile and strong, but then if we piggyback that with this specific type of training for where your gaps are, it's a huge payoff. Let's look at the other side. Most people don't have your situation. More often than that, people have a really rigid foot that's weak and stiff. So we're actually going with a whole other direction where we're trying to get motion in the foot. We're teaching that foot to separate rear foot and forefoot. And how do those people present? What's the pain or what's the injury they present with? Interestingly, they actually get a lot of symptoms up the chain. So that foot isn't, you know, our foot has so many bones on and all these articulations where we're supposed to comply to the ground. If that shock absorption goes away, like let's say I'm wearing these big goofy running shoes that they sell now, that have the rocker where it's all just like patching holes in the boat rather than optimizing movement, if we have a foot that is stiff, those force factors go up through the body. So now my knees, my hips and my spine have to figure out that force distribution because one of my best shock absorbers is the foot and ankle. If that's not doing this job, everything else pays the price. So I see a lot of people wear, like let's say the solace is weak and they're lower part of their calf so that control of their tibia as either walk or lunge isn't there so that ankle just kind of locks up and then they send all that force to their knee. That's why like one of my favorites is anyone with a chronic knee issue, I'm going right at that foot and ankle first because of the foot and ankle isn't up to the task that my knees take a beating. So I don't want to jinx myself and I hope I'm not doing it by saying this. Is this why despite all the crazy stuff I've done, all the miles I ran growing up, never really had a knee issue but boy do I get these feet issues? Do you think I mean it's a good theory but absolutely yeah, like you're really good wide mobile feet, like your knee is gets to be a knee, right? If that rotation that pivot joint that's supposed to happen at the ankle isn't like pronounce to the amount you want and it isn't mobile enough then that knee and that force factor is going to happen at the upper tibia and the femur where you now you start to get these little moniscous things that showed up out of nowhere. That torsion happens has happened somewhere. Let's talk about something that you touched on a few minutes ago which is around sort of fear and we see this a lot. We see this in the medical practice where we have patients that are you know where we're overseeing all their training and I sounds like you see this at 10 square as well where you have clients that are just coming in for obviously the training pieces of this. So is there any kind of common thread to this or does it come in all walks of life? I've seen it in former athletes who are injured but the injury is so bad that they just can never quite get back to you know they injured the back and then they're sort of like they never quite want to go back down my path especially if they've had multiple re-ingeries. Yeah. I assume you see this in people who are not necessarily athletes so what do you think is going on there and how do you how do you kind of work up the confidence to to accept that the pathway back isn't necessarily pain-free or injury-free but it's more of a trajectory that's going to get better. Yeah I love what you just showed there. The graph is it's always going to have peaks and valleys and you know when your brain perceives the ret whatever that could be maybe you're you know your dad heard himself playing football so you're scared to play football right but when your brain perceives the ret not only is your heightened awareness up right your nervous system is kicked up but we're more sensitive to pain so certain things hurt more when we're ill or when we're stressed then if we're not right and if we stick to just movement themselves a lot of people are afraid of certain movements because it hurt me in the past or they heard it could hurt them or maybe they just haven't done it long time so they're nervous about it right so you can actually empower people if you show them there's a rational reason why that that fear could be there or why that pain is there pain does not always mean injury pain is your brain telling you hey I don't like what's happening here but it does always mean your broken or busted another thing to think about is your image isn't always like a death sentence right like if we MRI 100,000 low backs there's going to be wear and tear especially if we're over 30 years old same goes for every other joint in the body does that mean we design your whole clinical plan around that no we really need to think about okay how much is there what do they want to do what are their strengths what are their weaknesses all those things we already spoke to so when there's fear involved you really have to address that because the individual needs to know that a you have a plan form that you understand their fears and then b we got to count for those fears in one way or another so I mean this is not data but in my private practice the amount of low back like flare ups just your traditional backspasm not a surgical candidate just like high back pain but no damage the amount of those people that have come in when their wife spots going to labor or they they're worried about getting fired from their job where they have like an emotional mental stress in their life the amount of those people is infinite like I've had thousands of people come in and go in my back flared up out of nowhere and then you start to dive in like what else is going on and they're really worried or stressed about something so what the goal there is you can't always fix those external cultural psychological emotional things but we can address them and identify them and sometimes they need therapy they need other things to address those but more importantly we need to empower that individual and give them rational reasons why you're like hey this might be why you've cleared up in that glute or in that mid back and this is what we're going to do about it and if you outline those plans for people and give them the tools now you've equipped them to actually help themselves this whole game of I'm going to take an extra review and look oh there's one little bone spur but now I'm going to scare you into like a 40 visit package to my car practical and it's something that game needs to go way fast because the only thing you're doing is making people feel more frail more afraid and you're actually only helping the bottom line of your business you're not helping that individual so it's really about empowerment with education what is it that you would see when somebody comes in that would make you say actually we need to immobilize you or we need to you know like what is that something that's only going to be on an exam where you see a motor weakness for example a mobilized how like put them in a boot or you saying well let's just let's look at lower back so if somebody shows up with a lower back complaint to you what's going to make you say no actually the answer is you know seeing a surgeon or complete and total rest or you know how are you what is kind of your algorithm on people presenting with lower back pain yeah I mean lowbacks are great so number one is and for the neurons out there if there's weakness or you don't have bowler bladder function and things like that right away get a value weight right because the way nerves work if if there's pressure on nerves it could at over time create permanent damage now a lot of nerve pain is sensory right that electrical sciatica type stuff it's that tingling and that weird thing like that but the real number one that you look at is do they have weakness or do they have loss of some sort of you know control foundational control right that's when you got to get integrated with neuro and orthos right away um if we don't have that now you're in the like decision making domain right so this means you you're going to do the rectal exam make sure your tone is there yeah exactly okay that's definitely on the longest of things I refer out for okay um so if you're in that kind of mechanical low back pain or even some disc nerve issues but no weakness now there's a ton of strategies we can do almost as a first diagnostic step to see how your body responds now what I mean by that is we're not going to do some crazy aggressive therapy or treatment or manipulation of the spine but we're going to do some sort of intervention like muscle work or Mackenzie exercises for discs which are highly researched and really effective to see how the body responds to those things if your body responds in a positive way even for two hours that's a great indicator like let's keep going down this road because even the best surgeons that you and I have both talked with about mutual clients they'll say let's give this little time and see what your body does things can heal the natural process of the body can take care of themselves so a disc bulge one of my favorite examples actually is a disc herniation she confirmed on MRI she would do a Mackenzie protocol which again is fantastic scribe for people what that is so Mackenzie protocols are really great system that um you essentially put the patient in various positions and you do these like gentle arching or pumping and you're basically trying to take pressure off that disc to where slowly over time that bulge can re-center and balance out can people do these by themselves you need to be yeah okay you can go and we can link to where people can go and look yeah Mackenzie protocols fantastic their website has a database where people can find people in their town so if they have nerve pain it's a great place to start because all those Mackenzie practitioners know what I just outlined too like this is a Mackenzie thing this is not but what's fascinating about Mackenzie sometimes even in the room they'll get a reduction of nerve symptoms while they're and so nerves provide very like productive information like you can trust symptoms of a nerve really well so if I get what they call a centralization meaning I'd satac pain all the way down the leg and then you put me in this one Mackenzie position and now it centralizes to the hamstring that's a great idea that's a great diagnostic indicator exactly and so just because that individual might have an MRI with a disc herniation that does a mean it's an injection or surgery right away obviously part of the decision making is what is there what are they having to deal with in their life what is their timeline all those other factors but if you can encourage a hot disc patient to wait and and make sure that they're actually letting things heal and run their course they could be much better off and forward at 10 weeks. Some will always the sign of a great spine surgeon right just once you rule out the acute weakness the thing that is a surgical necessity yeah the ones that want to wait are generally the better surgeons yeah we've chosen the better side for sure yeah but this case I was going to talk about earlier she's at fast anyone so confirmed discerningation and then she had an annular tear which basically the annulus is a part of the disc and it best analogy to describe it is she had like a little thing that was a equivalent of like a cuticle they're just kind of peeling off so traditional protocol we started to turn on Mackenzie's great lady we're actually still friends but she was really hurting so we worked with her for like two three weeks and every time we put her in that Mackenzie position it hurt her worse and it was local pain but the ridiculous symptoms reduced so long story short what we learned over time she went back over to another place try that for a while didn't work the disc herniation was actually taking care of itself but that annular tear was still sticking out creating extension base pain so after about a year of rehab her body was able to scar up and that healed and it was fine but it was really interesting to me was she needed Mackenzie's early but then we actually had to cease the Mackenzie's because we were jamming that annular tear and so then we were storage is more pillar strengthening dynamic neuromusco stabilization all those other things so it's like different things at different times played a big role I mean when we it's just it must be amazing how often we all encounter hopefully not personally but professionally people with lower back pain like this statistics are sort of you know I don't I can't imagine there's too many people listening to us who don't have personal or indirect experience with it either obviously through themselves or through somebody they know closely there is something about it that I can really relate to being nerve-wracking it really is it can be terrifying and and and and also demoralizing I think is how I would describe it just demoralizing when you lower back hurts in a way that I don't it's not the same as if you're shoulder elbow knee or hip hurt no it's different I mean the best analogy is I spray my wrist you know I might have to wear a brace or something but I can generally function I can go to a movie but when your ribs or your back is hurting not only are those muscles much more big and powerful so when they react in spasm they're really good at it right like these small muscles my wrist when they react in spasm I go that's kind of sore but the low back I mean that group of muscles is really good at freaking out right the type one fibers postural stuff a lot of detail the other thing is you can't do anything without affecting you right you sitting in a movie hurts walking hurts I mean these people it's a fixed them constantly and that's a big part of the rehab story is finding these little winds where they can actually do something and it either does get worse or have a verbid makes them feel a bit better um the human body is meant to move so you think it's a scalable I mean I feel fortunate that you know we're able to take care of people where we have the luxury of doing this very bespoke approach and yeah you can you can you can integrate your strength in conditioning with your cardio with your PT rehab and all that stuff and it's all it's all great but like do you see a day when this could all be app and AI driven where any any person out there with any set of lower back symptoms could be provided with the feedback that they would need to to take care of themselves if they execute absolutely how would you get the feedback I mean is that basically is it just I just said you have good enough image recognition software that is that would that be that would that be a necessary step that if you were using such a device like an app you would have to be able to set up your phone on a tripod to be able to able to capture you doing it because the advantage of being able to do this the first few times with an actual person like you is the queuing is so important a lot of these exercises are not um there's not natural yeah well especially if you're that person who's suffering from that injury then odds are you didn't perform these exercises well subconsciously so that's what's set you up for it right what is interesting is the the video recognition software is getting fantastic I've demoed a few now where they're like the AI is actually watching someone do movements and saying hey you know this was too far out that way or whatever but that also goes in the bucket of everyone moves differently right like my femur length is different than yours so the angles with which I'm going to lunger can be a little different and so this idea that if you take principles and you know the symptoms and then most importantly you know how people react to really conservative loads that almost tells you more than did their tibia rotate three degrees or not I could care way less about three degrees of tibia rotation based on AI software and care way more about you know what I did these lunges in this setup and we activated some neuromuscular reaction to where my glute fired a little bit better my knee felt way better right and then when people give us that good kind of qualitative feedback now you know how to trim up that program so I think the AI part of it's going to be more that it's going to be less about oh what degree did it move but more about how did you respond to each drill that's safe and then we go from there right yeah agree and that's where training the AI is much more nuanced and complicated 100% yeah image recognition is one thing but it's yeah knowing what to do with that information yeah knowing am I going to do an overhead dumbbell in a dns three month and all these other nuances versus the legs right like there's certain cases that I'll do that one for one and the other for another and it's it's really a matter of knowing what you got to start with and then we test it a little bit and then we test it a little bit more and then now comes our dictated by how do they respond to that exercise and why did you kind of gravitate towards this I mean we didn't really get into kind of telling people your story but sure you know you went to Cairo school yep but then you immediately went out and did a sports medicine thing you yeah and worked with the New York Giants why did you just opt into kind of the role you're doing now which is much more in the PT rehab space then it is the what people I think assume of traditional Cairo practice which is here's a here's a 40 adjustment schedule you know yeah and like I'm an a crack and again I I don't have a point of view on that but yeah what drew you more towards the the side of things you're on now yeah I mean I think it speaks to a bigger thing which I'm really degree agnostic in the sense that I hope someday in the future there's like a more clear certification or degree where there are Cairo's and PT's and frankly strength coaches all three of those people I would trust way more to do rehab and get someone better like who would I send my mom to I would send my mom to all three of those people if they have certain skill sets and like approaches right independent of degree or yeah credential totally because you know the Cairo degree was my baseline training that's where my license is and all that but the traditional view of Cairo is with the manipulations and the adjustments like you know that's 5% of our week at my practice right we are practicing we have Cairo's and PT's but you can't really tell who's who because everybody's doing what we call as active rehab so one of the things I always tell people I don't care what their degree is but if you're going to rehab clinic and it's one to one relationships so it's not group but it's one to one and they've got a bunch of weights in there as well as the traditional bands and stuff now that's an indicator okay these guys are going to build me back up to something actually strong not just like make me coming here forever and do rehab purgatory why I do the same micro drill over and over right like we got a build over time so I'm really agnostic to a degree but yeah that said my story I basically tried to create a residency for myself right out of Cairo school and back then it was really manual therapy based I learned a ton we were I was by far the lowest guy in the total poll which we all know that works a lot of time a lot of learning but I was there to soak it up and everyone always thinks that like pro sports is the top right and it is in a lot of ways but it wasn't really for me in terms of an official team relationship because I just didn't like that personal schedule and it was pure chaos like you spend a week fixing somebody up and then they go out there and get blasted again you know like oh that's bummer it's kind of like when my son builds his tower magnetiles and his sister knocks it over it's like the look on his face was me every Sunday you know so I really enjoy the off-season side I really enjoy more of the project and I really like realized early on that when you're only doing pain relief manual therapy work there's a lot missing right we're not building people up right so that's when I just started doing this deep dive as much as I could learning from as many people as I could about the foot and balancing and her muscular training and all these other things to where you know it's a compliment and my private clinic when people like what are you like we actually have people coming off it's now we're like I need to go see my carpactor later and one of my other docs a bit like well I'm a chiropractor like what I had no idea they've seen this for years so we're probably supposed to identify ourselves better but the regardless for solve problems what is the role for what most people think of when they hear chiropractic right the adjustments yeah like what does it do well I mean I I guess like I don't want to ask you to sort of be critical if that's the word of a profession that you remember of it but the fact that you aren't out there doing it 24-7 suggests either you think it's really really valuable but it's just not something you want to do or you don't think that it's valuable enough and so how would you how would you advise somebody that came to you and said hey Kyler I have injury x my neck my back whatever um I got this awesome package of 40 visits for x no more dollars with my local chiropractor I see him for eight minutes a week twice a week actually it's really special um uh do you think that's a great plan? No and the way I would describe it is I mean I've benefited from getting adjusted myself like things get out of whack right like things get stiff you sleep on a plane where like that's a real thing but it's a tool in the tool belt and the really good practitioners have a bunch of tools and so I could say the same thing about chiroprat adjustments as I could dry needleing or active release or um a colonel taping like a million tools out there the really good practitioners have a huge tool belt and they know when to use which one at what time yeah so just throwing cupping at somebody and hoping their muscles get better it's insufficient in the same way I'd say just adjusting someone over and over it's not enough there's more that could be done and so what I get asked a lot especially now that I'm older like oh my friends I've accumulated over the years like I didn't account for as I got older there'd be more questions exponentially because they're all getting sore and hurting but what I always tell them is I need someone who's got a bunch of tools in their tool belt I need someone who's going to literally treat your case um as something unique every time it's not just like this oh we everybody here signs up for twice a month like that's a big red flag for me and I really want everyone always building towards more strength you have to be adding strength that's what makes things stick that's what optimizes movement that's what makes people feel empowered unless frail and frankly builds them more of like a moat around themselves to where if they do step off a curb weird or they sleep weird on a plane they're less of a triage patient they're more of just like almost sorted it but they still work out and the workout helps it so isn't safe to say then that whatever the suite of underlying modalities are from adjustments to taping to cupping to needleing to active release to manual that you name it the goal of all of these and the more of them you can utilize the better is to create a window in which the individual is safe and out of pain so that they may do the work to retrain a movement pattern and increase strength. Yep is that if you were going to do some terms absolutely we say that sometimes about even horizontal injection like I don't like people racing to get a horizontal injection but if you tell someone that's strengthened and that really hurts when they do a lunge they're going to look at you like your jerk so at some point we need to do something to get that pain down so then we can open that door and run through it and running through it with strengthening and making them stronger okay so let's kind of put this now all back together right we've kind of gone really deep down one of the three pillars you now have basically two things you're trying to do you're trying to do everything you're doing in concert with a broader agenda of creating a precision training program not an exercise program not a workout program a training program for an athlete who sport happens to be life and you have to be able to do it with the strength and conditioning coaches the cardio coaches and then the other thing you have to do is you have to do this remote because most of the tense-quiet clients are remote because you said they come to Austin for two days they do a whole bunch of assessments they go away for six months then they come back some of them go away for less but yeah you know a lot of them they just they go away for a year and they come back in two months because they're out of the country and it's just not easy for them to be here so how are you able to do this remotely what are the challenges and what what enables it to to to make sense yeah what do they need when they're back home yeah that's a great we get that question a lot because even you know before 10 squared like some of the athletes I would manage you travel a lot like a couple my golfers you know they would call me and say my back hurts from the hotel room and I had the luxury of knowing so much about them and how they moved and what their body looked like I could take all that and then be like well what are the symptoms we rule out the scary medical stuff and then we try some exercise right and we were able to get a lot of results for these athletes and they're about to tee off and two hours and compete right so we've taken out model and if we know when we were designing the assessments that 10 squared one of the biggest themes was we need enough time to know as much as we can right like a lot of people want it to be faster but we're like we need to have that initial step needs to be so in depth that we are certain about all the factors of how you move and where you're strong and things like that when I have that certainty and I'm not flying blind and someone calls me and says you know what my knees really sore after doing these exercises we either hop on a zoom and just talk real quick and I can actually test them on zoom because the exercise is the test so many people think they need a doctor to do like a lockman's test and pull on their leg the story the profile and then how they respond to the exercise that is the test and so we can program exercise is really effectively in a remote way to kind of probe the fence or test it and if it responds the right way we definitely can fix it quickly I had to climb this week it showed her his bugging him we did a zoom call took about 20 minutes we have our library attend squared I fired him off a few exercises he message me like feels up better he didn't have to go to doctor he didn't have to go anywhere now obviously if the story was different and I was worried medically I'd concierge that in the sense of I'd find him some a local and refer out but if I'm not worried medically and if we think it can respond to load we're gonna load it and a lot of times people are shocked that we can make their neck tension go away with an exercise in the same way that if they traditionally got on massage or something they'd get that relief it has to do with what your body does when things are off and if you load it it'll actually respond more because your nervous system's involved as well I want to tell a story on that vein that I is one of the most incredible experiences I ever had this would have been in 2018 or 2019 and I had kind of the first flare up I'd ever had of my lower back since 2000 right when I had my bike surgery and all that nonsense so I'd got 18 maybe 19 years maybe it was early 2019 without a single flare up and then it happened I get the flare up and at the time I was working with this guy it was my first person I'd ever met who did DNS and so I had already learned about intribedominal pressure we were doing all stuff in fact when I went to see him my back was totally fine it was actually I had 10SL though I had this 10SL though and he figured out pretty quickly that my 10SL bow was completely due to my scapular instability and my chief complaint was when I do a lot of pull ups my elbow hurts sure like that I'm in play tennis right yeah so we had fixed all that but I kind of was like this is amazing like I want to know what else is going on and then independent of that I get this lower back flare up and so I'm in there seeing him on one day when I'm in honestly like about the worst pain I'd been in in years by the way his training by the way is also a chiro so he's a chiro by training who probably hasn't done an adjustment in 20 years sure just doing DNS and I'll never forget the exercise he had me do because I was like I don't know how this is going to work dude yeah so he laid me on my back and he had me get into like an imaginary leg press position you know those old school leg press machines where you're pressing up yeah not the one where it's on a slope but the the rack moves vertically super old school yep so I'm on my back I'm in that position and he is now laying on top of me so he's got his pecs basically on my feet sure and he's queuing me through really good intributional pressure and isometric contraction pushing yep and low and behold my back is getting better and we're doing sets you know 10 second 20 second 30 second and at some point I'm getting so strong like we need more resistance so now we go and build a makeshift thing under the squat rack where I'm on you know I forget I was on a Smith machine or a squat rack where basically now I have infinite resistance kind of like how you described it with the partial deadlift yeah and I am getting to the point where when I walked in there I wouldn't have been able to push 10 pounds away from me that's how much pain I was in and now I'm convinced I was pushing 600 pounds of force against that immovable bar yep and I've never felt better sure and I couldn't understand how that could happen yeah how is it that I could not walk but limp into that guy's gym that day in so much pain and spasm yep and in our later I feel like a million bucks sure how could that happen well two things one thing in your story is you know it really speaks out pain is inhibitory right like when your brain is perceiving that threat in that pain it starts to just kind of it goes in a preservation mode right where it's like look I'm not going to have you run the fastest 40 year life because I don't trust all these movements I'm trying to figure this out I always my analogy is like it's like that hand on the buzzer with family feud where the brain like whenever it feels threat it's like I'm going to hit this buzzer and I'm going to send you a pain signal doesn't mean your damage it's just like I'm hovering and if you're really stressed or it's a really high level pain it's like I'm going to do it first sign of trouble right yeah so number one it just really explains you know your story is that kind of effect but then it's like okay how do we get the brain to take the hand off the buzzer what loads can we introduce to make these muscles like one term in the in the musculoskeletal world or reciprocal inhibition so if I'm going to contract my bicep like crazy my tricep almost has to eventually get enough signals where it can't fire right your brain might be trying to fire it and it's got this co-contraction going on and there's that protection going on but the more stimulus you give that bicep eventually that tricep has to let go so what he was doing is he's putting you in very specific positions to where you had to load something where neurologically your brain says I'm going to turn this other thing off and I got to actually meet the demand of this force because force is how your nervous system responds and so he was loading one direction so much that eventually that QL or whatever else could have been spasming with you had eventually kind of melt them like go not only were you now activated and stable and feeling stronger but that muscle was in this inhibitory contracted state and then I let go one of the things I say in my private practice all time my first five years out of school I was working on the QL like my thumb has got scars from it I don't touch the QL anymore like about eight or ten years ago I realized you don't even have to beat someone up so much and it weird way these kind of exercises are more gentle they're more therapeutic and they're more active they're active so it's long term like you're tapping into that nervous system and so demoing an exercise or having someone do a very specific exercise based on the profile and their symptoms is actually a great way to make someone feel better and you just got to give them the right stuff again it's it's it's I consider that one of the most profound experiences of my life from a physical perspective and also in how much it changed my point of view about what back pain is and isn't and I don't want to suggest for a moment that if you're sitting you're listening and you have back pain that's the answer going find a guy to do that but but I'm saying that there's so much more going on than we realize and so much of back pain is not surgical and so much of back pain can be healed with retraining a movement pattern and and getting our nervous system to kind of get out of the way I have a lot of clients that come in and they're like look I'm nervous about the kind of thing or they they have some fear around it they heard stories whatever right so I'm like they're like can you help my neck though absolutely because there's a million other ways to cook this recipe to where we normalize the motionier joints we make the muscle strong again we re-establish the relationships of your shoulders and your scapular neck there's a million ways to make someone feel better with exercise where you don't have to do aggressive therapies I don't care if it's stem cell or PRP or prolo or dry needleing or caro it doesn't really matter exercise needs always be the answer and you can do therapeutic exercise actually doesn't lot for people that drops the pain too and so walk us through the framework because you've got it I love your framework for how you approach me so what's the framework yeah so first off you know kind of that bifurcation we talked about earlier where you know are doing need a consultant orthopedic or neurosurgeon right that's number one so we're gonna make the decision the story the incident what it looks like like if we're talking me if you know their soccer player they twisted it really weird yesterday it's all swollen on the joint line I'm more worried about the joint if conversely if it's a runner where it's been kind of often on for a long time no acute incident no joint line swelling the pain is kind of vague those are two very different presentations so ones gonna be more like orthoconsault ones gonna be like let's let's tinker around as a rehab pro and see what we can do right so that's the first bifurcation is basically playing doctor and being like what's the right path the other thing I really want to encourage is that the best orthopedic surgeons in the world like you spoke to earlier they don't want to do surgery or inject everyone right away they're referring out all the time and a lot of clinics nowadays have like a physical therapy clinic in house and there's all kinds of constraints with that and the best orthos don't just give someone a list of every pt clinic in town they're actually referring to different clinics based on that clinic strengths and experience right some clinic specialized in running some specialized in strength training like if your orthos specifically searching out different pt clinics that's a huge win it's a great sign they know what they're if they just give you hand out and they're like go call somebody that means they think all pt's the same and all rehab's the same and it's not right so that's number one once we've got past that bifurcation of knowing that it's a rehab case then the protocol really turns into what is the safest and smartest way to create a change maybe it's a manual therapy maybe it's trying to make maybe it's one of those treatments we spoke to earlier or maybe it's a strategic load that decision is a lot of times based on the patients comfort like how you read the room are they they like cattle rancher dude who wants to push through pain and they're gonna go back to work tomorrow or they someone who's really scared because the pain is high right we got to build trust we got to get them some sort of pain relief to show that we're medically being responsible and making sure we're going their eye direction but then once we've created that change then we start to load it a lot of times if I have a joint that I know is permanently compromised let's say someone with total knee replacement I'm not gonna actually beat up the knee a lot traditional insurance base rehab is gonna go after that joint because that's the code that's associated with it and they know they're gonna do that really well what I'm gonna go for first is the foot the ankle the hip and their pelvis in general because if there's a lot of low fruit there I can enhance the pelvis strength or the foot strength and I can actually buffer that knee to where it doesn't have to work nearly as hard and those people get a reduction of symptoms overnight kind of this was really a ton of fun enjoyed sitting down with you it's not normal that I sit this far from you but at a distance you look just as great as ever devastating as always thanks a lot

If you ask me, what's the theme for today? It's a sperm matter a lot. Alright, so now let's talk about the guy who comes to see you. He's been on exogenous testosterone for three years. Presumably there are no sperm. I would bet 95% confidence that he would have no sperm in a scene. So what are you telling him now? How are you going to solve this problem? Oh, this is a very important point. So 80% of conceptions naturally are at home. A curl when sex is front loaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation. Tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing on fertility for men. 20 minutes on 140 degrees, three times a week, would probably make you zero. What paternal age do you worry about? National guidelines for sperm donation, 40 is considered older paternal age, 50 for sure. Right? If you look at risks too off spring, tell me what your impression is of the effect of any or all of the above on fertility. You double the stress and a man in testosterone level will fall. And then the sperm production falls for a whole different reason. Hey everyone, welcome to the drive podcast. I'm your host Peter Atia. Hey Paul, thank you so much for coming out to Austin. Peter Atia, the man, the myth alleged I am. It's so excited to be here. So this is in many ways I guess what's going to be part one of a two part series I hope to do on fertility. And given the complexity of it, I think the most logical way to do it would be to break it down into male fertility, female fertility. And there's obviously going to be things we talk about that'll overlap. But I was trying to think about the best way to start this. And the first thing that came to my mind was, can we just explain what's involved in conception? And maybe do it through the lens of the sperm. But like how much of a challenge is this? I mean obviously there's an enormous evolutionary pressure for this to go as easily as possible. But what is actually involved? So what happens for a sperm to fuse with an egg? What are all the things that are standing in its way, so to speak? I mean there are a lot of, so reproduction is an incredibly highly evolved millionaire process. And remarkably, conserved among mammalian species, even among land species and water species of animals. The giant is cervix's, uterus's. And the question is why is it so much work for a sperm to get into the vagina, especially in say water? And then have to go through a cervix and then the immune system and uterus is very active because there's a hole in the woman to the parrot name to the abdomen. So it has to be highly protected. And then you have to go through the uterus so there's an attention 12 inch swim, which is equivalent to about a 20 miles swim for a human. Based on the size of the shark. And how much this is they have to go and they do that in minutes, which is crazy. So it's an interesting challenge that nature has kept in place for a million years and I really respect evolution. And it is why we're here for, you know, eat sleep reproduce. So it's so basically, with ejaculation, the penis is shaped to fit into the cervix. So everyone wonders, it's getting to the right spot. It's also interesting that the semen is collagulated and then it liquefies. And that's because there's a lot of species of lower phyla that they have to leave as soon as they have sex. Otherwise they get killed, like praying mantises and black widow spiders. So you've got to get out of there as a guy. So our ejaculates and humans are sticky. By the way, is there an evolutionary explanation for that? I have no idea. Yeah, why you went to that? I don't know why one queen bee and the bees in the hive die after mating. I have no idea why that's an advantage. But I guess females are prioritized in the evolution. And that makes sense. So there's a the anatomy is perfectly defined. So a lot of men think they're having trouble placing things. But that I usually don't worry about it because the cervix and the penis, it expands. It forms a seal. Then there's a crypt sperm have to go through a crypt channel, which is only a few sperm make. It's a 100 million sperm may start out. Maybe 5 million make it through the first barrier, which is the cervical barrier. The vaginal fluid is acidic. How is it? How is it? 5, 5, and that's seen when there's a page of seven. It's all buffered. So it's soon as that's as a hostile environment. So it has to get out of there quickly. As soon as it liquefies, there's sugars in there and then they go through the cervical path. So 5 million will make it one out of 20. What amount would it? No. Yeah. One out of 20 makes it through the cervix. Then a hundred make it to the phlopian tube and then one will make it to the egg. Literally only a hundred. Right. So we've set large studies in the 50s where he had had women have sex before his Correctemies. And then he swabbed different parts of the reproductive tract. These are young women for different reasons, not in fertility and found these numbers. And that's the basis for our move to technology from 5 million moving sperm is when we start doing inseminations of versus sex, etc. So those are based on the kind of numbers of sperm that reach the uterus and reach the thing. What's really interesting is this some fascinating research. Everyone thought the van guards sperm wins. Yeah. So it's the phelps sperm that's going to be covered. And there's a company in a hot-abost and called Eric's biocentus and I'm consulting with them. Disclosure. But they've discovered that sperm work in failing says. So because the immune system is so vibrant in the uterus, the first round of sperm gets through the sex and typically absorbs the immune systems. And it's a CREATS FCR receptor. And by the way, we've referred to the immune system a couple of times now. What is it? Is it just a bunch of antibodies? Are they B cells? What is it? It's a barrier. They're sites like there's T cells, B cells and antibodies. It's a full immune risk. Absolutely. So it's a specific immune response. It's anything for anything. Wow. I mean, you think about it. And there's also a mucus plug that exists for 28 days a month to prevent anything going through. Because it's a hole into the woman's body and parrot nightisers there, right? So this and this cervical mucus thins and that's the let's sperm through for two days a month. Incredibly detailed, perfectly orchestrated system. So it looks like the first round of sperm get through the cervix, get into the uterus and they get demolished. And they're failing, like a Roman failings. And maybe a second round goes through and they get demolished. And they're secreting the FCR receptor in the immunoglobulin. Because that's what antibodies bind to. So the female antibodies bind to that. And we don't know how many failings is go through. But then it's like a, it's like a, I run up the middle and then eventually, the predisposed sperm for it. And immune systems deactivated and they get there. It's a while that's a hole in the way. And that can be measured now. And there's actually going to be an assay available to look at whether you're doing this. And it's, they're calling it a sperm cycle almost like ovulation, spermulation. But it's an hour and a half cycle when the failing system is working sperm, our deactivating the immune system and then maybe they don't. So there are groups of, there are jaculates, which is a group of sperm, some of which do this well and some of which don't. And that can be a whole reason for infertility. If you're not able to deactivate the system, you're going to, you're not going to be able to get through because the immune system is active. Let's go through those numbers one more time. About a hundred million, a jack-a-later at the cervix, you're five million get through to cervix into the uterus. Y

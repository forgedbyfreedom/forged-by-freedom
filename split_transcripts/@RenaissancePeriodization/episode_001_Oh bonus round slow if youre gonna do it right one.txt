Oh bonus round slow if you're gonna do it right one more one more one more one more one more don't go anywhere Hey folks, I'm Dr Mike this is Jared Feather I have been pro and this here's Blake Blake is 10 weeks out of the J-Cutler Classic Bodybuilding Competition and a few more weeks after that out from probably the USA's in July and He already has arms that are quite large, but this morning he looked at his arms in the mirror and he thought This is not big enough. I'm gonna call Jared. Jared's gonna call Mike. We're gonna get in here I got Scott the video guy to get an RP video of Blake's arms being physically torn from his body through weights You in for it. Oh, yeah, my man Jared what do you think? It's good. He's like he said already gigantic arms. He's gonna show us how to train arms Today the manager is my learning Twenty-two years old I was 23 years old back in 1866 folks. Let's get started Let's lock it out really quick up top up and then as your elbows Try to keep the hands yeah, you want to bend them towards your hips. Yep keep them in and just touch your chin Oh shit yeah slow on the way down and quick on the way up. All right Blake is starting out with triceps Then we're gonna do some biceps and triceps and biceps gonna be a giant arm best First exercise is the barbell spell pressure But cues here to keep the elbows flush into your body To come down with your elbows traveling down towards your hips as you bend now this way This way totally cool the max variance causes elbow pain a bit more frequently than bending the elbows in is gonna be in close tight slow on the way down and with his arm length and ratio Looks like his chin is a great for a certain portion of his body to touch and then come back Slow on the way down back. We're in multiple sets and then we're gonna after another exercise The way we warmed up was like the bar for 12 95 pounds for eight one 15 for three three to four reps there. That's a really good progression forming up normal rest time between all the warmups and Blake has already done 115 for three We know it's a good weight. We know he can handle it now he's gonna do it for sets of well time to 15 to the primary work sets Normal rest time in between all of these Yes, there's a time for all kinds of drops at supercices Set or don't worry we get to that later in the workout, but the first exercises Generally should be moderate rotation range nice and heavy because you are fresh enough to impose that much tension through your muscles Later when you're not fresh you can do all of the tap muscles We can switch Yes, couple more I'm right here with you Okay, but those that was Push push push I'm late. Well This is really good too. I've a dead skull pressure in the walk. It's a weird exercise 115 pounds for set of eight we want a little bit more repetitions so we are going to do 95 pounds for the remaining three sets There you go Simple touch of the bottom leg control the whole time Yes, make it hard no Push up and forward Yes How was it slow control that shit? Push Go Was that Okay, okay, again Fast to switch man of all time Well, there's a big ass tricep so I must tell you you things though. They're non-sensical And I have big triceps. So all right, well, thanks. Thanks for your time Push that way Yes Slow control Push Good one more slow control Yes, yes, like you are fucking not let's do this shit push it Go 115 for set of eight 95 for set of eight 95 for set of six This is a fast switch boy. He's getting tired real quick. So we have to accommodate We are going to reduce the load even further to get him back into that Rep range more targeting which is sets of 10 to 15 hopefully will get at least 10 here with 65 pounds That'll be set for last set and then move on to the next tricep exercise You've got to make sure you stay in that rep range you decide it now Could you go all the way down to sets of five totally? But if you want to be on a certain rep range because you want a certain stimulus with the T-grade Sure you find exists while that rep range. Yes, you have to reduce the load and he's resting in normal time These are not drop sets when the camera's off we're here two or three minutes and it's just big muscles Fast-bridge crazy asshole must like this you've tired real fast. We have to accommodate Probably somebody showed up the fucking work today, huh? Let's go. Oh, yeah My man Help those in Public in One more go One Eight hit a front get some more Boss my skill in the last time I got a good blood shape, bro. Fuck happening there guys try something. Yep fall script fall script so thumbs thumbs like this. Yep. This guy's built for it. Okay, so we want you to slowly descend just like skull crushers. As deep as you can all try fucking crazy stretch right here. I need to put this thing lower. Yes beautiful. That's exactly what we want to know. These are going to be supersetted after your over-ide extensions. Keep your butt up. Look forward. Yes just like that. Yep. Yep. Look forward. Sink in down with your elbows flush to your sides. As deep as you can go. And up. And slow and pause. And up. Flack out. Slow and pause. And up. Break. Stop. Oh that's a week fine. Very fine. Very fine. I may ask you at some point if you can't do enough reps regular to drop to your knees which I'm sure you state your day job. That's a whole blow job joke here. And I got it bro. Blake is big and strong. He's technically as well connected with his muscles. He knows what to do. He's super coachable and cute. Which means he's only going to get two of each exercise. Two tries to set two by set. This is realistic. He's actually a body-real champion. We're not here to try to fry his muscles completely off his body. Pointlessly leading to more damage than a growth. So we're going to do another four sets. This time it's going to be a superset style. Overhead cable tries to extensions. Super set two deficit pushups from dumbbells. This is going to rig. Foric I'm trying to swear last maybe. Fuck. That's right. Here's try steps. Big time they're going to be useless and then we move on to the buys for the guys. Set's of 10 to 20 hopefully on the overnight extension. Set's of at least five on the pushup. If it doesn't work if he's too fucked up. We have to go to his knees. Many of you are familiar with that. So from your day jobs. I'm sorry. But honestly it's a great leverage to get more reps out. Watch for his technique. Watch how diligent he is at keeping his elbows in. And how slowly he enters in to that mass of tricep stretch with his mass of tricep. Lots of amazing tips. So pick up from this video. Don't ever completely mock somebody's technique or completely copy it. But yeah this is fun to close. Yes slow slow. Deep one more. Go. Yes again slow. Deep you got one more Blake. That's fucking get after it. Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go and then slow is if you're gonna do another but don't slow slow slow pause. Rack go go go go go go go right into pushups. Oh shit yeah. Full lock out to mother fucker. Let's go. Full lock out yes down slow. Let's go let's go. This children you don't fucking swear. Good one more deep deep press out. Go lock. How do you usually train your arms? I just feel like try it. All tonight tries the bise. Okay I usually do like whole exercises for each or four for total. Four for each. Well today you're only going to do eight sets total for each of them. But we won't you won't need much more. No I'm fucking sure. It's like tell us the world. Yeah you try a set two more sets and they're already done. So everything now is overkill. Yeah. Lean into the paint. It's not going anywhere. You are here to collect the fucking paint. The paint means growth. Yes one more. I was in and back. I didn't think so. In and back strong lock out. Wow. Yes. That's it for another. One more let's go. Yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah. Your charge let's go. Oh. Oh block it. Oh yes. That was if you're going to do another elbows in slow. Slow. Slow do not let go. Do not let go. Do not let go. Relax. Fuck yeah. It's shit right away. Good. Two more. Oh yeah. All day. One more. Yes. These. Let's get live here. Oh yeah. The same thing. Explode out. Slow down. Deep. Explode. Slow. Deep. Explode. Oh. Good. Slow. Slow. Control. Deep. Explode. Slow. Control. Control. You're in charge. Oh, my. Deep. We came here for the pain blade. Up. One more. Let's go. So we ended up trying to set up to the strap. Everything you have in your fucking body. Up. Up. Yes. Oh yeah. I'm good sure. Oh. Dude, let's get it. Oh, that's good. Let's get the fucking man. Folks. People ask, what does it take to get on the R.P. channel, the train, the knock mic, Jared, and stuff like that? Or what are you guys looking for? We're looking for two things. Have good technique and fucking try. Yeah, he's asked big arms and all that shit. He knows first two things. Are going to take his big arms and make them fucking bigger than ever. Because that's what it takes great technique. He never broke down his technique. And he tried hard enough to not be able to push himself up off the ground. I don't need time for biceps. Hey guys, I want to take a minute to tell you about our team full-run membership. You get six programs every six weeks. So depending on how many days we do train, what muscle groups fits that you would like to do. If you are specialized, we're generalized. We haven't for you any time that you do. If you need any sort of diet, we have five different diets. We have a muscle gain diet. We have a main insight. A fat loss diet. And two different many kinds of options. A three week and a six. If you want to ask your question. One way is to type it into the form and someone including myself and I feed pro-Gereon feathered. We'll get back to you. There are also weekly lives. You submit your questions to be answered. And myself and Gerard do weekly life to get everyone's questions answered in that form every single time. If you have a question about your squat technique, about how to program your next diet or training, anything that you needed all we've got. You've covered. So come join us today. And I'll see you guys there. 4 sets of tri-sets done with skull crushers. 4 sets of tri-sets, super sets are really like six effectively sets of tri-sets done with the overhead extension supersets of the push-ups. Blake's tri-sets are done. That's essentially 10 hard ass. The aim basically to failure working sets. That's it. Lights out. By set time, our first exercise is going to be an easy bar curl. Watch for Gerard Feather's technique instruction. He's going to be focusing on bringing the elbows in. I'm opening up the bicep at the bottom for a big stretch and following the natural arching motion of the curl. That shit works. It's not the only way to train biceps, but it is one of a few very, very effective ways. We're going to be doing sets of eight to 12. Probably here for Blake. He seems like they kind of got the V-in-Vet source shift. And then after that, we're going to do another final bicep exercise. The four sets here. Let's get it done. Double storage is here. Come on, one more. Control. Chest up. The entire time. Good. One more. Come on Blake. You got a tri-a little bit today. Yes. Slow. Chest up. Stretch. Stretch. Back. Go to that about 10. Do you count? I don't know. 10 it is. Probably about 10. Okay. The max three sets. We are going to ask you to do 10 reps for all three sets. Bonus is if you fail, you can put the bar down and rest for like 10 whole seconds or 15 seconds. I'll go a bit. And then go again and tell you get to 10 and then you get a full two minutes rest. Sound good? All right. Take your time for the next set. We are no rush. Pushmen. Every rep needs to feel like that at the top and if it doesn't, it's not right. So go down slow from here. That was in. Yes. You got the same time. Yes. Exactly. Pushmen. Just push him up. Peak, right? Pushmen. Pushmen. Yeah, I know. Pushmen. Blower. Pushmen all the way down. Let's stretch. I don't care if you get fun. This got to be perfect reps. Bored. Good. One more. Down slow. Down slow. Slow. Slow. Chest up. That was in. That was in. That was in. Come on. Go. All right. That was six, so far. So far. You got four more. Yes. Nice. Down slow. Down slow. Last perfect rep. Fight those elbows in the whole time. Don't lean back too much. Fight the elbows in. And then up. And nothing. As if you're going to do another slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Control. Control. Rapp. Fuck. I'm going to throw up. That was a hit. My man. Do you want to crash going to throw up into? Yeah, grabbing one. I don't think I'm going to. Stop. Step right. Ah. Five. One more. Let's get six here, man. That wasn't quite it. Fight it. Good. Slow. Let's do seven and then rest. Chest up. Slow. Slow. Ah. Slow. Slow. Ah. That's rested out and get three. Nice 15 second long rest and then three good ones. There you go right there. How was it? Push him and push him in. Ah. Control. Rapp like I'll do this by steps. Yes sir. There. Slow. Ah. Sit. Three. If you're going to do it right one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, I'm going to wear. Let's get back in the fight. One more good one man. No bullshit technique today. Stand straight up elbows in. Perfect. Fucking Rapp. Yes. Yes. Close it up. Slow is if you're going to do another one. Slow. Resist. Resist. Resist. Resist. Resist. Rapp. Oh my god. Shit. Oh. Holy. Oh. Oh. Dude. Oh. Well, seriously, we have more biceps left to do. I know. We'll figure it out. Last exercise of the day, inclined dumbbell curls. I'm going to see what he has left. We'll see what kind of set reps can plays out. Forset, probably. I'm going to order regularly the Rapp to see where he's comfortable and take him mildly out of that comfort zone. The key here with this exercise is to stay nice and upright and to really let your biceps stretch at the bottom. And then a nice peak contraction at the top with a slow, eccentric control. The stretch back here, the inclined curl pulls the bicep out this way. Pre-stretching it. It's kind of like the stiff leg and that left pre-stretching. Your hamstrings. That is something that really, really, really hits the bicep on a very special way. And if you haven't tried it in your program before, give it a shot. Blake has a shirt on these before, but he sure has not been like we're about to do him. Let's get him to it. Couple more. Couple more. Couple more. Couple more. Let's get the dumbbells together. Let's do 12. Two more. Right away. Yes. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Slow. Slow. Get ready for the specs one. Yes. Yes. Yes. Slow. Slow and wrap. You got two extra. So only eight on your next set. Easy next set. Okay. Let's explain something strange. Blake has arguably 21-inch or bigger muscular arms. How the hell is he only using the 20s on this exercise? I'm sure you've done the 20s at home for a set of 10. What explains this? Well, for her stability was fresh. He could have done maybe the 40s. Okay. Different world. So he's really beat up, which makes sense. Another thing is that muscle architecture, the way the muscle is shaped, where it inserts and originates by a small fraction on the bone. In tons of neurological factors, how much your nervous system, how much muscle contraction, play a role in strength generation. Somebody significantly less jacked looking in that regard, arms-wise. For example, somebody like Joe Sullivan. Way stronger. It doesn't look as strong. Generally, the bigger your muscles are the stronger you are. There are absolutely exceptions in a huge spectrum of variables. So Blake actually got really lucky. He doesn't need to beat the shit out of his joints to get incredible workout for his muscles. It brings me to our next point. Let's do the next set. All the way up. Yes. Seven. All the way down slow. Eight. One big. All the way up. All the way up. All the way up. Yes. Slow. As I've found other. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. And wrap. That is the workout. What do you think? Good. Yeah. That's probably not a while. No way. Are your arm workouts typically this in tons? Yeah. I train my arms hard when I'm the way you're under-ground. Okay. I don't like the super-constraight movements of shit. They don't bodybuilder. You know. Hopefully you know. You're wound your way to be in bigger, but less dumb. Yeah. I will definitely encourage myself in my training now. I'll do some good exercises. Do you have any thoughts? Any tips for the people at home who watch 21 in charms? But are not either our meeting or entertains on your arm sessions. You're going to have 21 in charms. It's ridiculous. Yeah. I'll end up in done five sets to go. Yeah. This is in times for severe ends. Folks, good tech bee and a shitload of effort. Wherever your genetics are, that'll make sense. It'll give you the best possible results. Until next time, see you next time.

I'm just letting this go. Too much good footage. You too. Like many people you, and I know you right there are the viewer, have two distinct problems. Problem number one, your arms are too small. Problem number two, the amount of time you have to train them is also small. And that's a big deal, but it's nothing we can't handle. Myself and IHBB Pro Jared Feather, also known as the man with the biggest arms of all time. We're competing at that dish. Fucking weird. They're quite big. For you, they're the biggest all time. Oh sure. But they've ever been. Which is great. I'm just going to be a witness. And we did promise that you're going to do Get Big Arms Fast. But we meant with that this workouts fast, and you can do it and workouts like it, and we'll talk about principles in a bit. And then you can get the biggest arms you can get genetically. While doing this fast. Fast. It's really, really, really, really, really, really great. We like to do it by taking two, just call the qualification. That's the logical foul. The fast was the workout. The big arms was you will get something like big arms doing our fast workout. Will you get the big arms fast? No. Now, it should take some months, years. And we're not going to lie to you on this channel. Just in the clickbait. I guess. Here's what we have for you guys. Jared is only going to do. Two. And taginistic supersets. Buy a step and try a supersets. Just two. Each one is going to have. How toast do you want to get four sets? That's a sum total of 16 sets of arms. So, but in rapid succession, the actual workout itself, but for the fact that we're going to be blabbered about technique, is going to take cheese probably like 15 minutes. And if you have 20 or 30 minutes to spare about two to three times a week, you can do something like this workout. We'll talk about how you can exchange exercises. Talk about it right now. You can do any kind of bicep and tries to exercise this. And this way, you can smash arms, get out quick, get to the little cafe down the street with that one girl. Kind of looked at you that one time. You flashed them, shit said it was just looked at. You're the girl on the guy flashed. I did the big arm. Our people are in workout now. I'm like, you see that shit? No shit's button. Pop an after that. One. Two. Three. Arms. All right, folks. First exercise combo is cable curls. And again, no particular attachment to that bar. Yep, there's a little double arm time to there. Whatever bars comfy, I can't use this bar because I don't have the mobility any more Jared can. So this is going to be the first exercise. Pretty close to zero rest Jared's going to walk over after doing about G.W. Wis.20 reps there. He's going to go to cable push downs and do something like 20 reps there. Wait about 30 seconds. And then hit this again. 18. Slow on the descent. 19. Fuck. Slow. A pop-up. Super slow. As if another. Rack. Excellent. Excellent. Push downs. You're going to be interested in having your elbows move back. For that stretch as you come up. As soon as it's your viceps, you can stop here. You can continue here a little bit more long. Hent activation, but that's not so necessary. Give them deal with choice. And of course, a smooth push down all the way. If you have to press it a little more, if you can do the arc, it's all right answers. And you know what else is good? Be shutting up. Pop. And just letting Jared be beautiful. 11. Keep going. Two more. Lucky number 13. Let's go. Drop. My man. Go. Slow. Shit. Shit. Yeah. Now guys, calling an audible here, you want to stay in that 10 to 30 rep range. Jared, you want me to lower the weight a little bit for next time. We're going to take like a 10 to 20% reduction. Jared was at 120 for this. We're going to take him down to 90. We want 15 to 20 reps on the next one to keep that rep range where we want it. You're just going about one zero to two reps in reserve. And I've, you know, kind of out. I'll talk to myself. I think it's about 30 seconds. Jared hit it again. Tack me twice on this. You're of course doing all good technique. Not in this crazy bullshit. No swinging. But you're looking to take your pinkies and shove them up into the sky as you move up. And you're looking to do the same thing with the insides of your elbows. You want to show the insides of your elbows to God. Slow. Is that 10? You're going to rest a bit. Rest a bit. Don't go anywhere. Curve ball. We said 15. We're going to my Ruffo way too. That shit. And you can totally do this in this workout. So you got short time. You got to hit it hard. Four more Jared. Let's go baby. Three. Hell yeah. Big moves. Yes. Slow. Block yeah. Right into it. 12. I'm post-contest. These are good times to do. These types of short workouts are when you're having a ton of intensity techniques inside of your training. In vacation periods post-contest periods. Time's when you're limiting the load. If I see you're on a cruise, you have like 50 pound dumbbells as a high sick goes. These are times when you can really do antagonistic techniques. You're going to take two percent. Push. And. Rest a bit. Finish the two. Slow. Full lock out. Yes. Slow. Shit. Awesome. One more of these left. I'm going to sheep. You don't look at a sheep. Is this a belt workout? My lungs are fucked. Seven. Slow. Block yeah. Eight. Slow. Alright. Let's go Jared. Move. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. Oh. Right into it. Oh. Cool. Six. Racket rest. Four left. Take about five seconds here. Two. Three. Go. Slow. Yes. Go. Man. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Four. Take a break. Oh yeah. Yeah. My lungs get you. Alright. Jared's going to take a break. And then we have the next exercises. Let me demo them for you. So you see what's in store. First exercise in this second series is going to be a dumbbell skull crusher. Notice we did bicep curls as the first exercise in the first series. And that's because we want to make sure bicep's get the due diligence and thus the try set quality was much lower here for the push downs because you're so tired after bicep's every time. This time we flip the script to give due diligence to try set and make sure this work out evenly hits everything. Or roughly evenly. Another four sets here of both. And that's it. Hit it. Beautiful. Two. Last point here. Take a pause. One whole second. Up. Yes. Good stop. Good stop. Good stop. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right into my sense. Lightweight here, Jared. 10 to 15. And then rest a little bit. Four on your gun. Go. Yep. Last one. Go. Go. Slow. Fuck yeah. IFBB Pro. Jared Feather got more than he bargained for. And the same he artwork out. One more. Slow. Pause. Push. Wait. Yeah. That's good stuff, Jared. Huh. That's stuff whenever you're ready another four. Yes. One. Two. Wait a minute. That he's such a cool. He's shit. One more Jared. Try. Got damage. Slow. Control. Pause. Push. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Three. And then you're done. Far too. Yeah. Well, you got a good form. I'm from all this. One. Two. Last one. Big push. Yeah. Rack. In this respect you're my weights. Forms get pumped after not you or else after not your form will just be like, I love that shit. I can't do this. Let's sweep. Get the eight. Two more. Go. Slow. Great. Relax. Four. One. Two. Three. Go. Four. Hell yeah. Oh shit yeah. Two more in your done. Last one. Victory Jared. Let's go. Ah. Slow. Beautiful. Great. Great. Little break. And then try steps. Good stuff. Yep. Yes. To the girls. Seven. Fuck yeah. Nine. Good stuff. One set of five and that's it. Good. Two more. One more. Fuck. God damn it. I just let this be going. It's too much good footage. Tell the camera what you feel. And why? Oh. Disanyments. Burn. Condolacty. Motabolis. My forearm for my biceps. My triceps. My front-dulse a little bit from that last bit. Do you have a pump? Oh my god. Pump out of this world. Post contest stuff. Or on a cruise after you get a shitload on the buffet. This is the type of pumps that you get. Especially when you're doing intensity techniques. So this is good. Can't bend my arm all the way down. No way. Yeah. Can't hit. I can't do like a front-dulge right now. Try. Looks really cool. That almost veins weird. Again, I'm a fan of agonistic superstets. But that was fun. I actually don't do antagonistic superstets ever. So I'm sure there's some sort of novelty. That's imparted if you do something like that. You know? So maybe something to throw in. Every like other block of training. So. Or all the time if you want to save a shitload of time. Right. So. Got a pump. Yeah. Getting going out. Go ahead. Take a shirt off and dance around the cruise or whatever. Dance around the cruise folks. If you're on a cruise, go talk to people. Everyone there have a good time. If you want to do this workout, it'll only take 20 minutes out of your day. And then you're back to party. It'll put inches on your arm. That's one of the course of your. That's the most important part. Yeah. Inches on your arms. More important is inches on something else. That's not that's kind of channel for that kind of stuff. We'll see you next time. If we had a cruise. One week cruise. What's up funny. But it was going on in your home. As your home state of Missouri was the cruise theme. That's awful. Kind of activities can be expected on the ship. Cornhole. Okay. That sounds fun. Are anyone there? Baseball. Okay. Great. Kids activity. Build your own rickety. Death barn. Oh yeah. You said dad. I did see dad. Let's get to that work.

As they say in the industry, Olympia predictions, it dime a dozen. Nobody cares. They're like, we're trying to be not swears much on YouTube. If they're like, but, yeah, everyone's got one. No one wants to see yours unless I'm subscribed to you on OnlyFans. And then I really want to see it. Please, mommy. Do you really want to see your subscribers do you see it over the earth and... Mid it. Please, mommy, more update picks. Subscribe to a single person with only things. Slow as much. Riving to a single person with only things. We've got a horn hub, 199 a month or so. It's too easy. Come on, guys. Well, you might mess really like that person. So meet porn stars and then just go... Well, not everyone has that kind of cash through a put Jerry. That's trash in your income around. I'm always a fussy. I'm coming. I live Vegas. No, Vases are rich people play. No, it's not. It needs money to be in Vegas. I've seen the last place I've seen. I've seen the last place I've seen everywhere. There's Casinos, Jen. I hope it just... There's a wasted money. Here's the thing, guys. Vegas also has the Olympia, which is coming to you in a couple weeks. Couple weeks. And we're going to put this video out just a couple weeks before. And we're going to have Olympia predictions. So feel free to use this as a proxy IQ test and retroactively Great Us on how well we did. Yeah. And I'm a classic physique pro. Mike isn't a bodybuilder. So we're just going to stick to those two divisions. Although I have my guess. There are other different. I have my guess. Name the other divisions. Go where I go. Okay. You have men's physique. Two, twelve. Fitness. Everybody forgets about fitness. Don't forget about fitness. Fitness are actual athletes. The only athletes of the Olympia. We're like actual like ex-geness and stuff like that. Yeah. Fitness. You look like that. What can you do? She has some kind of crazy split mid-air. Oh, yes. Women's bodybuilding women's physique are bikini. We forgot well enough. And while it's of course. Well, I didn't forget. It's just my. It's always. You're going to get your point. That's why I don't know. You're going to get that well. Yeah. Try to forget well this. Of course I'm my prediction. So I'm going to be sure. We're going with what? What? Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Then Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. and Sean King, French. Oh, that Chinese man. Who follows our people? No way. And us, my man. Yeah? Yeah. He was the very intelligent trainer actually. Yeah. Cods like that. Yeah. He's got a great book. Yes, I agree. His quad is ridiculous. That was great. No surprises, nothing no upsets. Uh, I mean, he would be one. He could kind of go up. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Because he knocks out Brianna on the top five. That's pretty cool. Because that'll be the first time Brianna's on top five. What's so mad about what you hate non-Briya? Uh, I'm not hate non-Brianna. This is YouTube. This is a public race. I say some shit. You're a brand. It's great. He's been going down to you. He's been going down. Yeah. He's been going down the ring for the fucked up. Yeah. You know, when you have guys that are better, that there's better, it's not a big deal. I got my ass with this year. Whatever. That's what's left. That's respect. Okay. Jerry's on that low. Classic physique. Good. West next to 12. Just open your own studio. 12. 12. I don't know because this is exciting. Lonsford's going to the open. Oh, he is. You know, bloodsford. I'm looking at his videos at two thoughts. One, that's not a human being. Yeah. Two. How is he a little me too 12 motherfucker? He's not. And so like you might not open. He's the only two I have battling out would be like Clarita and Keyon. Because Keyon looks ridiculous right now. Keyon is the person who has the best genetics in the world. Of all time, probably. It's impressive. And Sean Clarita has to eat for three weeks after the show to get back to zero percent body fat because he's negative when he competes. Then you say you saw him in real life. Yeah. And you were like, Jared was like, Mike, the pictures and the videos. They don't do any justice. It's not a real person in real life. They're literally like, when you see somebody like you were tanning. Literally tanning next to each other. Like his quads don't make sense because every, this is highly genetic. He's just very fortunate. Every part of this quad has striations on it all the way up all the way up. So even when he hits just front relax, some of those people have separation. They don't have the striations because they're hitting it like hips back. Yes. Even with his hips back, his hips is just striated. That's fucked up. But Keyon has this issue too. And better shape. Way better shape. Keyon's shape is unstoppable. Yeah. So if you come to the end. So he comes in and has some trouble coming in. Correct. But he's at whatever five or four weeks out, whatever it is. And he's looking the part. He looks like he's ready. Yeah. So it's going to be cool. And he's bigger than Clarita. Much taller and much. He's too tall. Yeah. He might be too, too if I don't know. Chuck Clarita's tiger guy. You see him in pictures. You're like, that guy's just jacked. Really bad. If fat free looking guy. What do you think? Oh, like people can knock him off. He's not great. The thing is like beating him in real life. It's a lot easier said than done. Yeah. You got to be Derek. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's very interesting. Very exciting. I was going to say lunchford forever until I realized he was no longer in the division. Is that true? Or is he still going to cut down? These guys play games, bro. Derek and the open. It's confirmed. He's like, he must have he might be in my top five. Yeah. He's all man. His physique. Yeah. If I was Derek lunchford right now, I would just stop training. Take 10 pictures and retire. You're like, I did it. I'm the perfect human being. I agree. All right. Two 12s are exciting. Let's go to the open class. Rammy. So I had this conversation with somebody earlier for God. I forgot what the fuck it was. But they were like, the agraramies and trouble. XYZ is in it. And I'm just like, you do understand that Big Ramey has just posted, with maybe with some of his most pleasing lines ever. At a bodyweight of 339. Mm-hmm. And he already has strations. Yeah. Because if there's not something you just go, oh, he'll just get his ass kicked. And also, now that he's working with wasn't Chad Meckles, I guess. Yeah. He has completely feathered and dry glutes. Or the man who weighs 2.95 on stage has completely feathered groups. And on like running Coleman, I know I'm talking about shit. Ron is the goat. Fear, always will be a running Coleman. He has a streamlined mincection. Great line. Caped out. One guy was like, yeah, man, I wish Big Ramey had a bigger back. What? So he could fly away. Are you out of your fucking mouth? Listen, that some guy has fucking best back. No, so no, it's back. That's pretty much the wrong one. It's a running. Oh, Ronnie. That's a big, Ronnie needs a bigger back. No, Ronnie has one of the best back. It's ridiculous. It's like, I don't understand how your last backlatch you got this. Big is backlatch, but it's never been on the old beer stage. But apparently it's not good. That's hilarious. So in any case, Big Ramey has to be something magical has to happen for him to lose. He has to come off and somebody has to come in to really fucking pond. Yeah. Who typically is it like you don't break it? Chippon. How did you ponder? He did. Who said last year? Second or third. We were second and we're in a, um, uh, ran and got there. I don't know if you're memory that correctly. In my memory, there's wrong. I don't know. I know that he had like an issue with like somebody felt he had sight and handsman and stuff and his delts. So sure. He got knocked down or something. So how did your pond looks incredible? Well, he doesn't have that physical size. Right. He just shredded the bone. Shredded the bone. He has great lines. It's like the cleary to shit. Right. But not amazing. The reaction looks like he's 23 and never took drone, which is not. Then there's, uh, Brandon Curry. Who I think, I think one's for it's going to be. Oh, wow. Brandon Curry looks really good though. Curry will look his all-time best and I still think there's like 48. And I still think Derek one's for it. Derek one's for it's crazy. So you think Derek left for it's looking into that top five? I really do. I think you've slipped into a few things through your life. Yeah. But the top five he's slipping in. Yeah. I think I think he's high chance of placing really really well. Yeah. Look third worth. Wow. What do you see Nick Walker in that equation? I don't think Nick's making top five. I think Bonac is also looking his both. Bonac showing up. Bonac's always looks flawless. Best ever. And you got Curry. So that's five. I don't think Nick Walker slips into five. Now what about, uh, And I think that there are many people in her library. I think there are many people in the library. I don't think Hunter Beat and Nick last year. I think Nick's real voice hire. I think Hunter looks great. Hunter looks bigger and leaner and a meter I might add. Yeah. I think a lot of these guys try to add sides way too fast and they lose a lot of separation. Like it loses a lot of like Hunter use that really deep watch for like separation. And then as she got bigger you don't really see it. Like it's from relax. It's like that's a really nice shape. But there's not a lot of separation. So he does have a great waist of huge arms. Yeah. But Nick Walker's arms are bigger and his back's better. Are they really? Oh yeah. They walk his arms don't make his legs. He's big. I think six maybe. But there's also like Andrew Jackson going. And if it was up to me, Samson doubt it would be in that mix. Samson doubt it has been like 80 pounds of muscle in the last one. It's like getting to that Ronnie stage where you're like that's not really. Yeah. All the shape guys have been that mix. Like I really love, uh, how do you say profile? Rafael. Rafael, bro do. I just, that's jujitsu. All the shape guys would be one end if I was, you know what I'm saying? Because you don't have what it takes to get big enough. Right. Exactly. No, but Samson doubt I think is going to really surprise people to make the top 10. Ian could also be a brother. I am. Valle. Yeah. He comes in. He's big. Well, brother. It comes off sometimes. I look at Ian's training weights and I'm like, I think I have good genetics, but that's the next level of shit. Like, is it, why would you incline press like five plates on every machine? And he's just being completely unaffected by it. Yeah. He's really intense. He or his legs big enough. No, he's missing improvements definitely. And his back is improved to shit live. So I think he could definitely take the broad out. You don't got to win the front poses. You just got to win the rest. I don't want to. Yeah. And he wins this side just. Yes. Yes. It's like chef. And he's like, you're here. The broad the right side tries it was nice. But I think Ian's just at the end of the day, all these predictions are nonsense because it all depends on who comes in and shape on the day. Because if you could speculate about muscularity and conditioning and most guys deliver, but it's, sorry, muscularity. But is it already dry and full on that day, especially dry? If you are super dry out of your mind, then you're going to do well if you're not. Yeah. Then you could do much worse than people expect. Yeah. Which is why so that top five, I think it's pretty sad and storm, but like I said, like, Nick can easily squeeze in there. Any other guys that would stick to squeeze in there. Like, depends if everybody else comes in shape or not. Folks, without they're looking now, that's how I see it. This is exciting times. Yeah. It's probably the, it is second, third, fifth golden age of bodybuilding. And this is the biggest Olympia of all time. No way. Of all time. They're like 60 qualified classic guys over 30 bodybuilders. Wow. Because like the COVID thing made, yeah. Like the qualification period really weird to 14 months or something. Sure. So like, even I like competitor. Yeah. Like there was the last show to qualify for classic was last week and I made it 60 guys. I'm pretty sure. Is how did you pun? Is there any status updates on his visa or is he in American now? Is he going to be able to make it to him? Yeah. He's making it all the thing. Yeah. International politics of suits. But yeah. But you know, it's just all freedom and prosperity and welcome to go to bodybuilding. Anyway, politics aside. Thank you so much to you for that insight. I've no idea who these people are. The fact that I sometimes pleasure myself to thinking about them. Yes. And folks, if you think we're wrong, please be nice. But get in the comments. Me, me. You know, and tell us what your top five is for any class you want to talk about. We'll get in there and tell you why you're stupid. Yeah. And then you couldn't possibly be right about anything, especially this. See you next time. Thanks, stop for a bit.

Go, finish, finish, finish, finish, finish. Finish. Finish. Finish. Question. When you guys go somewhere, you go alone? I don't. I only go places with my European bodyguards. And yeah, they both have PhDs. Doctor, sports science. Doctor, sports science. Me, I'm Doctor Mike Giffin-Chelter from Renaissance Predensation. This is Milo. This is Pac. They are sport scientists and researchers for real researchers, not like me. They are here to do some working out illustrating the value of partial ranges of motion. What the hell am I saying? There's our world, the T-Full Rom dead. Find out more right now. My PhD is actually on range of motion. Oh, that's right. We found that doing partial repetitions in a length in position. So in the stretch position, like the very bottom of a row, when you're sure the place being pulled all the way through it. That seems to be as good or like a better for a higher pitch fee than a full range of motion. At the very least, something to try out for a higher pitch fee. So in this session, we'll be taking you through some length and walk. Different techniques to emphasize that stretch in your self-right. Because I've seen studies and I've seen smart people like you and the Parker talk about lathe and bias partials. But I'm always like, how does that really look in real training? Like can somebody do some fucking sets to show me how that looks? And maybe give me some good tips and techniques because length and bias for the back might look different for the triceps and for the chest and for whatever. So you guys ready to show me some love? For sure. And she will seem to think that it's quite difficult to integrate partial training. When you're reality, as you'll see now, it's super special. Yeah, but you're Greek and everything you say sounds smart and spokes maybe you're just smarter than everybody. If you know how to page, do you can't do a shift? I'm sorry. Hey, figure. I'd figure is only. You're not making eight figures just sign out. Get out of my DMs. Get out of the general. Let's get to work. What's good? First exercise, primeral. This machine actually allows you to load different ranges. Let's put it on top. It loads that length in that stretch position the most. So what we'll do will do a four-in-jim motion here. But we'll use these loading pins to emphasize that stretch. So if you have a similar machine, you don't have to do partials. You can do a four-in-jim motion and still get the most out of it by simply emphasizing that length and position. In this case, typically what I'll do is load maybe 20 to 30% of the weight in the mid-range on the middle pin and load the rest of the weight in that length in position. So you get kind of the opposite effect of a traditional row where it's really hard and a peak contraction, which likely isn't ideal for growth. In this case, you get the opposite, which means more muscle growth. We're going to go for literally as many reps as we can. Oh, God. Until failure, you guys settle up, too. Yep. You say it, Russia. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. You can finish that wrap. Finish up at the top. Oh, now we're talking. Let's go on the school. All the way. And that's what true failure looks like. But was it really failure? Greek failure. So people asked why not all of the top one. The way this machine is designed, it's weird, because then it's zero load at the top. So you get to the very top and you're like, you can technically take your fingertips and push the handles back of them, and you're going to touch them again. What's some kind of something in the back there? So that weight really works like a counterweight, but at the top it's quite easy. And at the bottom, as you go down, it's weird because you're used to a stretch. But as you go down in this machine with the pins loaded as they are, your stretch is exponential. Essentially, what happens is because it's so easy at the top, if you really try and explode out of that latent position and produce lots of force in that stretch position, it just makes the machine fly. Yes, essentially. And you have to slow down and push that. So you have to slow down and purpose and for a lengthen work, we really want to spend as much time as possible, as much effort as possible, as much effort as possible in that position. So if you don't have any weight in that contract position, it makes you kind of throttle the contraction. And we don't want that. So we want some resistance still in the mid range, then we're short in position, which is the heavy emphasis on that length position. The three people that are on this machine are like, Wow, finally. Yes, yes, yes. You weren't going to be on this machine and you were on a similar chest supported row. You could literally, and I'll do my set as well. You could literally get a big stretch and stop the movement somewhere here. Yep. And that would be pleasant. And we'll have other exercises to illustrate that with later. Two other ways to emphasize that like position, generally control the eccentric the most when you reach into that stretch. Pause at the very bottom in that stretch and then contract forcefully out of it. The second way is if you're going relatively close to failure or two failure even, try and end the set when you fail in the lengthen position. So if you can still get reps in a short and positioned or a four-way motion, keep going. Let me just impart shows at the end of your set. That's really good option, I'm so much. Nice. Go ahead. Yes. Try one more. Oh, oh, you're shit. So, my lowest saying is when you are here and you're squatting, let's say, squat, leg press, hack squat, barbell squat, whatever. When you're doing your k-d's, it's okay to go quickly from here to here. Sorry, but slow down at roughly the halfway point and milk it out to accentuate the center. So, pause, consider pausing, rock it up, finish the rep. Slow. And then if you're doing partials, come up to just where it gets a little easier, slow back down. A lot of people can do the partial, what they don't want to do is right here, you're tired and your quads are pumped and everything sucks. Slow, back down is brutal and it blows. And then when you want to do really take it to the limit and fail at the length and position, that means if you can only come up to here, you just do squats until you can't move and you fall over and you probably die. Yeah. And then life's good. And then you're not there. Yeah. As far as a centric leg goes, if you're doing like a pool four seconds or so, you're probably more than covered as far as that goes. Great point. Yeah. Just for the years to do like, okay, how much? How long? Yes. Is it good always be longer? We can move on to double pullovers. Double pull, ooh brilliant. Really great. Extra, I sure, let's do that. We shall do an amrover and see what gets most reps. So lately my lows and my low and nice, my lows and I. Anyways, our training has been sort of more auto regulated because we've been traveling. But a great way for the intensity to be up and for us to actually push ourselves is to just constantly compete on stuff. As we will now, so I propose we'll go heavier, which I'm not sure about. My low said that this will be plenty. I propose we get married. That's already covered. Wow. Same thing, yeah. Don't rush it. All the other bottom. Beautiful. Go. Yes. That's it. So another way to emphasize that stretch is to pick certain movements over other moves. In this case, if you did a cable pull over, like a cable lat player, you would get a great stimulus. It's a four-ingermotion for lots. A lot of shoulder extension, but the resistance curve is relatively even. You're still training the important position and that's all along good that's your goal. With certain movements, like a bummer pull over, by design, it is already a latent partial. Even if you want to, if you go past here, there's no resistance. It's your only training in that stretched latent position. Even more than that, the hardest part of the lift, the place we have to do is the most tension in your lats, is in that bottom position at low muscle length. And then it gets easier and easier linearly until you get that top position. So both in terms of range of motion and in terms of resistance curve, really solid option for up and down. And we're doing exclusively parses here. So we're not going to be doing the fall bend. Correct? Yeah. You're inch from touching the ground. Want that extra round. Oh yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go. Finish. Finish. Finish. Finish. Helping safety. Am I right? He has both. The way to manage failure on this exercise is too full. You can go to really what is true failure on this in two ways. One, if you just can't get it up, you just gently go back to your end-rong and just do this. Your arms are sufficiently clear. You've had no one standing around you, the weight drops a couple inches, no big deal. The second way to do it is what he did, which is if you realize that at this point with straight arms you are at concentric failure, you bring the weight closer to you just by little bending your elbows while bringing it up, not only do you go for sure to failure, because you're like, well, I can't do the straight arms, but you use accommodating leverages in order to do a mini mechanical drop set on that last repetition. So it's both safe and meg effective and you know you went to failure, so it's like checking all the box. At least it's okay, let's go. One more. It's cool. You're going to be familiar. You're probably a state, slow, control, pause and explore. Another thing I really like about the Dumb Up over, I was supposed to cable pull over, is that it's quite stable and so reaching failure and gauging failure becomes very easy. Personally with a flat prayer, sometimes it's like, I just shift my hips a little bit that can do something. Hail, it's pretty obvious when you fail, especially if you're reaching your arms out and your elbows are relatively close to lock out. You know, like, for pack on this last set, you actually had an upward, I had an a scent and then a mini decent and he bent his elbows and fish, it finished that rep. There's no way that he could stay outstretched, he would have gotten other rep. That's for real failure. That's what we call this failure and training. Really his technical failure without good technique, continuing, he could not have continued to do it. So I was really really good. So I'm this exercise, we'll be doing integrated partials, integrated partials, fancy term, really just meaning you do a full range of motion up and you do one, two, three partials and then you do another full range of motion up and you just continue in the cycle for the whole set. The reason we do this is two-fold. One on set, next, sizes like the bar dos squat. Just doing length and partials are just a bottom half, isn't very safe because of that last drop when you're really close to failure. You may try and get a full breath to be able to re-rack it afterwards, but you may fail. And so for those exercises, just doing making partials isn't advised. However, if we just did partials at the end of the set, you'd get maybe one to three partials. You wouldn't get that many partial reps and thus the emphasis of the set wouldn't really be on a stretch anymore. It would still just be basically a four-inj motion set. But by sandwiching in a four-inj motion rep, some partials, a four-inj motion rep, some partials. What we're able to do is accumulate more length and partials and get a greater emphasis on that stretch. Let's go, go technique. Elbows to the sky and then slow. She purchased up the whole time, once we went. You got for sure two partials. Yep. Just up the whole time, let's go. One more partial at least. Go. Fuck yeah. Yeah. Oh, you got more. Halfway. Yep. Another one, halfway. Yep. Let's do this, Milo. One partial for the road. That was good. That was really good. Very nice machine. Awesome machine. Awesome machine. Yeah. It's so smooth. Very smooth. How do they do it? I don't know. And it already feels like it's emphasizing that stretch position. Oh, yeah. Yeah, relative to most machines I've used. Still better in the final. That's a failure. And here's really a defeated lucky. Farstunderization goes because I see that common being made by people who, I guess, are new to. Partials had long lost length training. As you can see, some, there was some variation between some reps. But it wasn't anything too crazy. And after you do that for a few times, it's pretty easy to set certain points. For references, well, pack a little less experience of Partials Maddo. And this is our first time using the machine. At least based on my experience, performance week to week is very stable, which kind of implies that range of motion is similar, unless I'm just pulling myself into it in the same numbers over and over again. But based on some of the reliability that we have from studies based on mountain experience and client experiences, it is reasonably reliable. So just make sure you pay some attention to a range of motion and you should be in good shape. Go finish. Finish. Finish. Yep. And then slow. You got two more partial. I ain't go shit. Let's stop. Hit it. Shoulder poses. There we go. He big. All right. Cool. He still rolls for the girls. What do you get when PhD sports scientists collaborate with pro body builders? The most effective muscle growth training I've ever made. Get yours now. The pre motion machine is what I believe God actually uses to train on. And so typically you would have the curl situation a look like this, which is dope. But if you want to try this out, you actually start at the bottom of stretch of a fly. Everything is open. This will stretch the fuck out of your chest. So if you do chest and biceps in the same day, it's got a helpful. But if you're doing this on a day in which you don't train chest, it's actually nice stretch out your chest a little bit or blood flow. And then what you do is you simply from full extension curl. Full extension and curl. And the way the angles work with the machine is here. You get crazy stretch, crazy tension. But as you come through here, it's actually very easy. So it's already a lengthened bias exercise. Which is pretty dope. You have a name. It's going to be called the double dildo curl. How could it be called anything? It's a new thing where people name exercise after themselves. I mean, they've been doing that for years, but you see slide modification in the next and it's like the doctor. Oh yeah. This is the doctor idiot curl. Yeah, wait. Yeah. That's how I'm now in in most places in the world. So we're about to do some partials on this. Whenever you're talking about emphasizing the stretch of a variety of ways to do it. On the primer, loading my lengthened position. On the pullover by design, partist in my position. And it's already lengthened partial. On the lateral raise incorporating integrated partials. If you really want to emphasize the lengthened position, especially in exercises where you're not really challenging that lengthened position very well. What you can do to make it more challenging is get more working in that stretch position. It's to simply just do the partial range of motion in the stretch position. That way the whole set is spent at those productive muscle. And you get a lot of tension, a lot of stimulus in that stretch position. Ah, let's go finish. Couple more. Slow big bars. Yep. Yep. Beautiful. Put like I'll do them. Nice. That was a nice exercise man. Thank you. You got this. Three. Three. Let's go. At least one more. I was go goddamnit. Finish. That's it. Nice. That was awesome. Beautiful. Deep stretch pause and explode. At least one more. Let's go. Control control. Full pause. And explode. Let's go. Last one. Let's go. Control control control pause and workout. That's it. Yep. You did it right for a time. There you go. Big brain. Big brain. Pat, who is that on your ship? Is that joggernott or some shit? Here. So it's Thanos, Dr. Doom and Bane. Oh, it's just all bald people you look up with. Yes. Tom Hardy. The CGI guy. And Dr. Doom. Oh, are you serious? Oh, whatever. It looks like a blow job. I mean, I'm saying it. I'm not complaining. Oh, you do it. Beer did Caucasian men. Diamond doesn't. Some people say, but I got special ones. And with tattoos. Where the fuck are your tattoos, man? Torbrio. And 12. Holy shit. So anyway. Hi, I was mom and he's just upgiven on growth hormones. 12 Holy shit. Pack over here. I'm 30. We didn't. Well, the Greek 13. I really agree. You need about 30. You're slightly more hair on your face. Change smoker and then the truck drive on the piece. Yeah. Can I have my face fly? The tracksuit ship is very great. I like it. You're like on the Olympic team maybe, sort of. Yeah. You think I have the hangs around with the hangs around with the hangs around with the guy who's on the Olympic team. That's all of Greece, by the way. Also, we didn't train chess, but the hell happened in your ship? Tom, it got pumped from the bicep stretch, whatever we just did. And the pullovers. Boom. Any words of wisdom on this lengthened partial situation? And I'd say as we briefly mentioned during the video, he got the door, wrap quality, control the eccentric, make sure that you are getting that deep stretch. And that's it. It's not that complicated. It's the equivalent of train hard with a bit of a softened one. A little bit of spice. Let's say main things remain volume intensity. Good technique overall. But a bit more range of motion is always welcome. Every little bit counts. Every little inch. Every little edge counts folks. You think about what that means in your spare time. We'll see you next time. Peace. Peace.

Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Pre-Dization. And today's video is about the three pieces of gym gear that advanced bodybuilders have to have, of course, that's a clickbait title. But three pieces of gym gear that I think have huge benefits for advanced bodybuilding. And please make all the inside gear jokes you like in the comments. And boost the algorithm. Here's the deal. First, what is an advanced bodybuilder? It is somebody in my view, the best definition for this I've been able to come up with. Is somebody for whom the basics executed normally, no longer cause reliable gains, for whom even some insights like, oh, I have to start dealing with the start following program, they no longer produce reliable gains. This individual has to have training as well as possible. In order for any gains to be even highly probabilistic, otherwise the default is no gains at all. That's right. You have seen people training for years at your gym. Putting in lots of effort and not seemingly progressing, you could technically call them advanced if they have already done a lot of the basics pretty well, and it's just the nuances they're riding on. Four folks in that situation, nuances matter as far as executing your training. For example, at that point technique has to be personalized, to whatever gives you the best stimulus to fatigue ratio, not somebody else. I got an intermediate, can squat like most people and get decent squat results. An advanced person may have to squat very differently for their own body type, or even a band in squats altogether and search out other better stimulus to fatigue ratio exercise. With nuances like that, it also makes sense that some gym gear stuff you can buy and take with you and you can get a lot of benefits. You can also start to make advantages at the advanced level that are difficult to ignore and unwise to kind of relegate to thinking, wow, you could use this stuff, but you don't have to use it. No, no, this stuff really does pay big dividends, especially for the advanced. First thing, first on that list, is the Versa grip. The Versa grip company, they ignored all my calls and emails. I never called or emailed them, but I did talk to them once at the Arnold, and I was like, hey, I have a following, and I want to rep you guys, I don't need any money, just want to be able to say that real cool. And they're like, yeah, we don't do a brand sponsorship for athletes. Okay, you guys are cool. Anyway, oh look, a train I have to catch, and I ran under the train and committed suicide. So that didn't go so well, but so this is not any kind of sales pitch. I make nothing off of this or anything else real here. Versa grips, Versa grips essentially are the modern version of a lifting strap, and they are categorically better and almost every way. They're all pretty close to magic. If you wrap the Versa grip handle around something and put your hand on top of it, there's a very good chance your entire hand will fall off of the bone before that Versa grip breaks or is let go. All right, or let's go. And because of that major advantage, Versa grips can take back training, deadlift training, any training where you have to pull with the arms, especially shoulder training. How do you do laterals with your regular grip is beyond me, if your shoulders have gotten as strong as most people's shoulders, get in relation to their grip. If your back has gotten as big as strong as it usually will in relation to your grip, if your legs get as strong for stiff leg and deadlift and dumbbell lunges, etc., as strong as the normal people's legs get when they're advanced and relation to their grip, because they're grip gets stronger, but the back and the traps, and the legs for sure often waste strong or muscle groups. If that happens, you can no longer use many exercises without grip becoming the predominant limiting factor. When you're training your back, short of like, flat prayers, and a few other things, your grip may be the only thing you are training very hard after a while. If you get Versa grips, of course you can have regular traps or fine chalk is very good, but Versa grips show me that you are interested in the highest level of grip ability and you're just interested in the really shutting off the limiting factor. You can do machine roads, and it's all just down to your back. Amazing, huge dividends. I can't recommend this product more. If you haven't gotten it, and you tell me your advance, then I see your workouts, you better have the strongest fucking grip of all time. Or you just haven't thought things through. Next, weightlifting belt. Any kind of belt is really good. I prefer the pioneer brand belt, because they have so much customization, and they're really high quality, but other belt companies are fine. Some of them are very good, a weightlifting belt, or a lifting belt in general, does not have to be for the sport of weightlifting. A lifting belt allows you to create a high level of intramodinal pressure in your core and glumber region, which allows you to transduce more of a signal to contract, especially your legs during heavy leg training. And what that does is it just leaks out more ability out of your legs. Now as I begin to, as an intermediate, that probably just doesn't matter that much. And your legs and core will be in ratio, relatively strong enough to each other that you have a core, realistically that can outlift your legs and that's never too weak. But your legs get stronger than your core. We know this because almost every powerlifter at the high level, when it is legal to do so, will wear a lifting belt. The reason for that is pretty simple. The core tends to be a weak link, and if you make it stronger via the addition of a belt, notice you're not making the core stronger itself. You're making the whole system of core plus belt stronger. If you use a belt, you can get more out of your legs. And as a hard lifting lifter, if you're doing hacksquats, if you're doing regular squats, if you're doing good mornings, as a high advanced bodybuilder, you probably are interested in putting out a belt, because it will just maximize what you get out of your glutes, your hamstrings, and your quads at the very least. And if you're going to do any kind of dead lifting, it also keeps your back nice and safe, at heavier loads than you would normally be able to use, which is a really, really big deal. It's a big help. Is it mandatory, of course, but does it make the situation better? Where it actually makes your legs get absolutely higher, raw stimulus magnitude training? Yes. Yes, it sure does. Will it make your core weaker to wear a belt? Yes. But only if you wear a belt, and never increase how much weight you're lifting, above what you could have done without a belt. If you can squat to 25 for 10 without a belt, this you put on a belt and squat to 25 for 10. Never go above the 20 or 30 extra pounds of belt can let you lift for the same reps. Then yeah, sure, shit, your core will get weaker the belt will remain, and that it'll be harder to squat to 25 for 10 without a belt in a few weeks. Why the fuck would you do that? You put on the belt so you can go and get stronger in your legs, and now you can squat to 40 with a belt for 10s, to 25 for 10 without a belt. Without a belt, we'll still feel weirder, and for a few weeks you'll be weaker, just because you've learned to use the belt so well. With the underlying strength and size of the core musculature, we'll continue to go up if you use a belt, if you challenge yourself. So if you ever want to take the belt off, you know, feel weird to use it, no belt squats for a while, but then very shortly within several weeks, literally, two or three, you will be as strong as you ever were without a belt. Amazing. Lastly, number three, are weight lifting shoes. These are shoes for the sport of weight lifting. They have a heel and an easy slow ramp, that ends at about three quarters of an inch, to one and a quarter inch typically at the end. In the heel itself, these shoes allow for a huge amount of stability in leg training movements. They allow a ton of friction between whatever it is you're standing on and the shoe itself. And because they have that ramp situation, the actual heel lift, you get two things out of it. One is you can now go much deeper with all sorts of pressing and squatting movements and get your quads at better stimulus. And can commentantly, you don't have to lean forward as far because your ankle mobility is now higher, because of that heel, so you can actually take stress off of the back and put it into the quads, amazing. And also, you have the ability now in many more situations with a deeper range of motion to continue to press through your heels, and your front of your feet. And as you can press through the whole foot, you can lift more weight, activate more faster switch motor units, and get bigger and stronger. They're very for sure. So weight lifting shoes, not only put your quads into the best possible position to get torched, because they allow your knee to have more flexion with less of your back inflection. So they allow you to go deeper and provide more profound forces. They essentially allow you to expose your quads, but put in them and have them in a weaker position, but a more challenging position for them. But at the same time, the weight lifting shoes arm your quads with the ability to be super stable and pressed through the heel, which is kind of the ultimate in engineering the best possible leg training. When you put on weight lifting shoes versus not having used them, you take any hackswatt leg press, regular free squat, and turn it into a movement we were like, hold the shit, I'm getting a lot deeper. This is hard, but also this feels smooth as fuck, and I feel fucking strong. The best possible combination you could ever say. I will say how people train their quads at a high level without weight lifting shoes is beyond me entirely, but then you look at how a lot of ice-beaproast, quote unquote, train their quads, and you could really improve the shit out of the training if you showed them how to use weight lifting shoes and proper technique. Now, those three things, I think, if you're an advanced lift or you should highly consider, does that mean you should stay away from these tools as a beginner or an intermediate? No. But what I would say is, you can get a lot without them. They do cost money, they do wear down, you'll have to replace them. And the best reasoning I have for you is, give me a compelling reason why you need these tools, and I will say it's a good idea to get them, for example. If you're a beginner and you never have grip as a woman in problem, my and fucking gods and AMD, you need verse of grips. Fact, checked, problem solved. Weight lifting belt. If your legs are on fire, they're getting sore for five days in a row, you're still getting stronger, you never have an issue where you're like man. If I had belt, I'd get sure I should more lift more with my legs, and my weak course keep me away from being able to have stronger legs. That's the start of thing. Up until most people get most women get beyond two plates on the squat for full depth, and most men get beyond three plates on a squat. A lot of times for most people, a belt isn't even just that. Like doing a whole lot of nothing, just sitting there. And weight lifting shoes is one of these things, where you could get pretty early, but they're pretty expensive and have a requirement, big investment. So if you've been lifting for like six months or a year or a year and a half, and you really love the process, and you know you're not going to quit anytime soon, yeah, I would get weight lifting shoes is totally fine. And also it pays to just have a situation where you don't really overinvest in this shit, it's like a lot of people lie to you in it all, rate lifting shoes, and then you just don't lift anymore. That's just sad. And weight lifting shoes really pay their big dividends, once you're bigger and mobility is a little bit harder, and you're lifting really, really high loads, so they're super technique stuff is important. And also when you're constrained to variations that don't include squatting, like leg presses and squats, the squats are too axially loading for you, then weight lifting shoes pay huge dividends, but if you can do a decent barbell squat without weight lifting shoes, you can for years get bigger and bigger and bigger in your legs, and not have to buy weight lifting shoes because their benefit will be instant, but it will be really small. And you can offer the $200 that they cost. Now you can get weight lifting shoes for 70 bucks. That's all good and well, but just making sure I'm speaking to the general audience member here, like yeah, again, if there's a compelling reason, definitely buy it. When you're in your intermediate years, you may start to develop these compelling reasons, and slowly buy up the stuff, so by the time you aren't advanced lifter, you already have them. I'm not saying when you turn advanced, whatever you have your fifth advanced birthday party and balloons and stuff, you have people beat with a piata baseball bat. That's what you do to clowns, they think, once you get through the piata, you turn your attention to the clown, but you don't have the no more eye cover. Put it on the clown, time up, not just kidding. But maybe clowns are terrible. Don't just turn advanced and then buy these things. As an intermediate, you'll discover like, okay, I really fucking need verse of grits. My grip is just huge when in fact, I need a belt, and I would like some weight lifting shoes. So by the time you enter advanced, you're already rolling with all these things. Folks, give that some thought. Like, comment, subscribe, whatever, and see you guys in the comments below.

There's a ton of beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, but there's more beef around the Glen on Humorl joint of a Jared Feather, IFB pro, is favorite top. Delta exercises for your side gains begin right now. All right, what's up everybody? So my first exercise that I'm picking is one that you probably don't see me due to often, but I will program a lot of clients. The free motion front raise, where you're kind of starting with the cables behind you, is an amazing front tilt exercise. I program it a lot for tons of female clients. You aren't doing a lot of pressing in the gym. If somebody has weak front delts, the only way I really tend to program their front tilt training is with more isolated variations of the front tilt. Like you can't do military pressing and stuff, especially if you're packs in your triceps, need a little bit of extra work, but you're trying to emphasize the front delts. Feel free to military press. But I think you can do a better job of isolating the tissue and doing some form of a front raise. I think that the free motion station here is the one front tilt exercise I'll put on this list. Simply for the fact that when you start with the cables behind you, you get way more of a stretch. And I think that I had to put a front tilt exercise on this list just because people are going to be like, well, we're the front tilt exercises. This is a damn good one. The horns are growing. Why you got to hate? Why you got to hate? You raised me. I know. Look, people. Front raises are dope. Jared Spotong. If you're going to want to add front tilt volume, you might not want to add it in the most fatiguing way possible, which is the standing barbell press, followed by standing dumbbell press, followed by seated barbell press, followed by seated dumbbell press. It really is a high fatigued exercise. It's great for stimulus, but not just for front delts, for triceps as well in front of her packs. For a lot of the female clients, Jared trains they're judged very much on their delts, but they don't want them to have triceps or excessively large. They don't want them to have huge upper packs. And so for them, this exercise is super, super critical. So this is a little bit more of a scalpel, rather than a hammer that really focuses on your front delts. My front delts on an half the train was I had literally fake front delt material scalpel did. It wasn't Guatemala. That where we went. The guy was a doctor. I don't know. There was like crickets and stuff around. I did it without being put under. It was tough, but not my front delts, they're big. So if you are doing the front raise variation, you could also use cuffs keeping your thumbs facing up. We have actually done many variations. And I do this often. You'll see at the end that have a cable faceable variation that hits a couple of the delt muscles. If you do the variation where your palms are facing down and you do this, you're getting a lot of front delt of all, and especially coming out here. But it is an awesome lateral del exercise too. And because I train my lateral delts, rear delts, probably four times a week, I tend to do that. I'll have variations like face pulls or upright rows where you are hitting some of the other muscles that you're getting the traps involved, you need to be red delts involved. So this one, if you are a female who's training lateral delts and you need to hit front delts as well, like on my female clients, I say, or somebody with a weak front delts, of course. And you still want to hit lateral delts that day. This is a totally awesome variation because you're hitting both pretty well. But if you are literally just trying to isolate that front delt, putting the thumbs up to the ceiling and cuffs even better almost. I'll make sure you have some straps on our straps right now. But hitting them like this, you're going to get a lot more front delts taking a little bit of a less or more of the delt muscle that you're out of it rather than just using front delts like this. All right, my second variation for delts is the upright row. I keep upright row variations in four more lateral delts training. Basically half of the last 14 years, which is my entire training career. A lot of people say they don't like them. They're an amazing lateral delt exercise. Overall, for the muscle structure surrounding the delts, great trap involvement as well. If you'd like, oftentimes people run into this situation where they do start to train with lots of frequency for the lateral delts. And if you're doing a lot of lateral delt variations, machine lateral raises, dumbbell lateral raises, especially some people tend to get issues with their elbows because you're always holding the dumbbells and machines out here. And especially if you don't have cuffs, this can become a pretty big issue for elbow tend to not use things that nature also the movement pattern. So damn similar like this. So I like this for variation just for a penasionally angle changes and things like that, just the way that you're actually targeting the tissue getting a little bit of extra trap involved in it. Because I got shitty traps anyway, and I don't think anybody has two big traps. Making sure you have your versus on. Good call, my doctor, Mike. Keeping one or two of these variations and for messes like for me is kind of like how I like structure it. Couple lateral raises variations, couple upper variations, maybe a cable, faceful variation. But the upright row is one of my all time favorite, just especially on a cable. I'm done with your shit today. I got some of your shit. You're done, okay. Okay, son. No, dad. I want me to go because when you got laid off of the factory, yeah, who is there to take care of it? Your face was there. And I've made with my face. You sure did. A lot of folks will ask questions about what kind of bar to use, where to stand with respect to the machine and how to art the trajectory. And really, that's one of these human variations is so wide. Situation that the answer to the question is try a bunch of them. See which one's work and you're not looking just for the perfect one. There's going to be a bunch that works. Sometimes if you stand a little bit behind the machine. As you pull, you have to pull back as well as up and engages the posterior side of your lateral delts, even your rear delts a little bit. That's really nice. You can stand closer to get the full elbows up. In fact, if you liken it, it's pure side delts at that point. You can use a straight bar. You can use a slightly curvy bar. You can use hypothetically all sorts of attachments. Really the question to ask is how do my wrists feel? How do my elbows feel? How do my shoulder joints feel? Am I getting a good kind of stimulus tension and stretch and pump and burn into side delts that are targeting? And also how much am I being forceful? Like, how much weight I can lift in this facility? The rule is flat, but do I really feel like I'm recruiting everything? Your wrists and elbows might feel fine in the script. They don't hurt, but you just don't feel like you're activating a whole lot. If you feel like you're really doing something, a wider grip could work, a narrow grip could work, and everything in between. They're supposed to every part of upright rowing, including how high you're pulling. There's nothing wrong with pulling just to your nipples. Matter of fact, I'm just going to cut myself off. Then pulling to your clavicles is cool, pulling to your chin, nose, eyes, and you can do the James Hoffman where you can pull above your head. That actually is a ball of variation. You should try unless your shoulders were bullied at school a lot. Just never recovered. To my points about the grip and variation you use, I am pretty good with a close grip on these. The wider I go, the worse it feels to my delts. The easy bar attachment here also feels a little better for my wrist. So I can get a pretty close grip slightly holding onto these, the groove part here on the easy bar attachment. And I can get pretty high as well. So if this is as high as you feel, you can get without your shoulders hurting or elbows or anything that's fine, I'm able to get pretty high on these, especially when I use that closer grip, experiment with your grip with, experiment with the attachment. And if you can get through a larger engine motion without pain, it's probably a little better. So if the close variation with the easy bar attachment allows you to get here and the straight bar wider grip allows you to get here. Try this out for a little bit. See how it feels. If you don't have any joint pain, it's probably good to go. If over the course of a couple of mesocycles you can experience and joint pain. You don't have to take them out entirely, but you can experiment with different variations. The next variation that I like to do, and this is probably one of my all-time favorites, is the cream motion y-rays. There are tons of ways to do these. So if you don't have some people lying down, I see them do behind the body. I've seen them do without crossing the cables, I see them with crossing the cables from this height. This is probably my favorite height to do from, and I also like to cross the cables in front of me. It's a very awesome stretch for the lateral delts, and it's one of the only variations where you can actually come all the way across your body and get the full stretch for that lateral delts. So this is a variation you can include a lot of intensity techniques with like length and partials and things of that nature. So this variation, just one of my all-time favorites, especially whenever you're getting somebody really deep in a contest prep and you want to take a little bit of stress off the elbows, because you can, in fact, use these cuffs yet again. Give these a shot if you've never done them. The y-rays is a really bad exercise, and they're all kinds of different types of y-rays as you can do. The biggest thing in a y-rays generally is getting that huge stretch across the body and getting the full range of motion on the exercise. So a lot of people will ask us about this, but do I need to change which cable is in front between sets? So if you like, you can readjust, take this cuff off, put this cable over the top, whatever. It's not a huge deal to be honest, but if it is something you want to track and using something like, let's say the RPA Perchree app, you can make notes about that. If you're that concerned with it, I assume you're okay with thinking, note about it. So just set one, right cable underneath, set two left cable underneath, that's how I would track it. So again, not inherently necessary. One, dealt might be getting out in front of the other a little bit, but to be honest, they're both getting crazy. I'm good stretch here. So just for your sake and for neuroticism sake, feel free to switch them up between the sets. Quick tip on the free motion, y-rays is when you cross streams like they hold us and goes, boss does not to do. And in some more camp when you're kind of pee with each other, what? The might snag a little bit, but the way to deal with that often is to back up a little bit more out of the machine that helps. You might also have to cut your arm at the bottom and just come down to hear if you come across, they'll snag. We're just flying to where a good spot is for you before snag occurs, and then go from there. That's my only tip. The geodd described this so well, I have nothing else to add. I've never had much to add, really. I've just been grifting on YouTube. Next exercise that is in my top five favorites for the lateral delts or the delts would be the dumbbell lateral raise. Dumbal lateral raise is just an exercise that everybody has basically access to. A lot of room gyms, a lot of people have plenty of fitness style gyms or gyms that don't have free motion stations. I have really fancy machine, slatter machine, things like that. I have kept lateral raises with the dumbbell in for a very long time as well, unless I'm having some sort of like elbow issues at the time. There are tons of variations you can do that include just doing a regular dumbbell lateral raise, full range of motion, all the way up. Super arm laterals, pauses. You can even do a variation where you keep tension on them. You don't go all the way down because there's not what happened down here. So I'm just going to show you guys the generic dumbbell lateral raise. Maybe a few cues like you can be able to do. But definitely one of my all time favorites. Dumbal lateral raises, amazing exercise. Just watch the swinging and make sure you're using full range of motion. These are your stuff of variation applies to all sorts of lateral raises here. Some folks like to point their pinkies up a lot and come all the way to the side and really even like back behind themselves. Narlie for rear and side dos. Probably don't want to go to high, it feels wack in the shoulders right here as an excellent movement. You can get a little bit more parallel and come a little bit more to the side rather than back. Generally stopping right about here. If you like, you can keep your palms down to the ground same way. Come up to the front here and then a little bit out front like this. And then you can stop here, but you can also do the super rom-ladderals. So when people say, you know, where should my wrist be, where should my shoulders be, which way should I arc. The answer is generally like as long as you're not pointing your thumbs up. That's really front delts. If you're pointing your palms down or even pinkies up, any variety of back to side to slightly front. You know, people call this the scapula playing works and any range of motion works, including a super rom-range motion. A range of motion that goes just to below parallel and even my one of my personal favorites, just above parallel for a one second hold and then a slowies enter back down. The next variation on my top five favorites for delts is a modification to the cable face pool. The notice was different attachment. You'll notice that I'm kind of at eye level here. This variation is cool because most people don't have weak rear delts. You get a lot of rear deltraining with your back and similar to the first variation I showed you with front delts. You can modify this such that you're getting the rear delt hit really well, especially on the stretch because of some of the tips that I'll share here. But you can also get more lateral delton involvement because you're trying to train those lateral delts a little more frequently in your programs. This one's really cool to just hack onto an end up a program. I especially like this variation for myorips and super sets. So doing the face pool this way and going into a super set we're doing a regular face pool can really fry the rear delts a ton. And you'll have a nice lateral delt hit there at the end and then the myorips really mess me up on this exercise. You can use your straps. You don't have to use your straps. I use attachment for specific purpose. There's a V here and similar to the cable that people use generally the rope. It gets this out of the way. You're not smashing yourself in the forehead because whenever I do this you'll see how it looks. There's one more tip that I want to share with you guys. So Scott maybe if you can come see the cable. Just people don't really think about this too often. When I'm doing this variation. If I let the eccentric come down here. I'm running into a situation where I'm actually taking tension off the delts and I'm allowing the cable to pull up this way. There's like no tension on this. It's just kind of coming this way. I'm lifting this up intentionally because I'm trying to keep tension on my rear delts the whole time in my delts. So if I can resist the cable pulling me down just the tad it's a lot better for the eccentric action here. You're going to run into a situation where you do the rep and it's starting to get really hard and the set of staying up here and staying into the rep and really leaves that stretch. You'll see people go like this. Oh yeah, that's nice because it's easier. So if you can really take the eccentric slow, come back and do it and then keep the cable high, high, high get the stretch on the rear delts. That's going to feel a lot better. So a lot better a lot worse. But so watch the cable make sure it's under the proper height. You can just set it down one lower if you'd like because you're going to lean back a little bit. But it's for me, this about like chin height the cable is because I know that I'm going to lean back a little bit. But really take that cue into consideration because oftentimes when people do the eccentric phase on a lift, they speed it up. They try to get other muscles involved because it's getting super hard. But here, I mean, Mike say all the time on the channel lean to that pain, lean to the stretch. That's how you do that on this exercise. This is what I call a hard implement. So I'm a solid to it. So I'm going to get the job done on prom night fellas. But it didn't call me Mr. Flapian high school for no reason. I should boy out here. Yeah, like that. And while I always packed the size and it was black. That's curiously enough, similar shape. My shits lie exactly this way, the whole. The reality of the matter is not in that's true. However, rope phase poles are dope because they can accommodate a different angle up front and behind. They allow you to open up your elbows at the back. Some folks will love this kind of fixed attachment. A lot of people like the rope for the phase poles. Really, it's your call 100% experiment and give it a shot. Another thing that you guys will see me do is I like to do my phase poles. You'll eliminate it in the back almost entirely and really prioritize in the side don'ts. So what I'll do is I will lower this implement all the way down to about hip height. And I'll pull from there, just my favorite variation. But there are no wrong answers. Anything between hip and head and even just above head height is really really good idea to try. The last thing you notice how I did the reps. The way that we're doing these and set of just coming here and pulling straight to the eyes. To get the lateral delts involved, you're actually moving the elbows up and back out of the way like this. So this is rear and lateral delt. You're hitting both at the same time. Whereas yeah, maybe you're hitting a little more lateral delt and tears in the traps and all the rhomboids and stuff like this. Like a road to the eyebrows. We're trying to attack the rear in the lateral delts on this exercise. So if you can pull this up and back like this, keep that cable tension high here. You're going to get a lot more out of the exercise. It's going to be harder. You're going to use less weight. All the good stuff that we reach. Give it a shot. Is that fine? No. No, it's just higher. Just probably about 5-10. No, it's fine now. 5-10? I'm putting it. But we're eye to eye. I'm not taller than him right now. Folks, that's all we have for you today, Jared. Thank you for putting the D in delts. Yeah, that was a great. And those are just 5 that I like. I believe you put on top 5 videos as well. Go check that out because it's really good as well. I think we have some different variations in there. But no wrong answers on lateral delt training. Besides the wrong answers, you can't do squats for lateral delts. You don't screw it up. Yeah, don't screw it up. I really like these at the time of filming this. Maybe I'll find ones that are more in the future. Yeah. Look, those are great. You've put the D in delts. Let's go put the D in me. Which other? Beautiful. See you guys next time.

Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Pyrrization, and today's video is the five rules of chest training. Yes, they're rules, but they're not hard rules. Think of them more as helpful hints for your chest success. And that's sort of rhymes. Alright, rule number one is in my opinion nothing beats deep, controlled presses. Be they incline, be they horizontal, be they decline, big presses make big chest says. Ah, I'm sticking to that. Flies are cool too, and they're super effective. I just want you to know that you're not going to cable crossover with pinkies out yourself towards enormous pecks. It's not one of these things like for biceps, where isolation exercises seem to be the bees knees. Big heavy compound presses are really an almost certain ticket to a big chest, so don't ever forget that. It was good for gram, great grandfather, it was good for grandpa, dad did it. Your little brother's doing it already. We're older brother has a kid and he's doing it already. Don't fall behind. Number two rule. Like most muscles seeming, right? If not all, they get a better growth stimulus. If they're stretched deeply while they are loaded with a huge amount of resistance, anything between sets of five to sets of 30 repetitions, that deep stretch is critical under load. So if you can generate a deficit in which you can press quote unquote below your pecks, you are going to get a huge stimulus easing to this. Don't do a ton of sets at first because it will absolutely fuck you up in the best possible way with the laydowns and muscle solenoids and growth of course. What does that mean? Consider getting a cambered bar, which has a little do-hikki, wiggly thing in the middle of you can press below your chest. Daphisit pushups are super easy for anybody to do, two plates go between them. Machines that are well made and can do a deficit and of course dumbbell presses of inclined and flat can both be done outside of your body to do a deficit. Anyway, to create a deficit is going to pay off. It's a huge addition if you've never done it prepared to be like holy fucking shit. What the hell am I doing to my body? Good things you are doing to your body. Rule number three, flat pressing and inclined pressing, flat flies and inclined flies are all correct answers. And I just don't understand why the internet is full of people being like and you need to do inclined for better chest don't do flat. You need to do flat pressing, flat press don't actually work. Which I never thought somebody would say, but then Doug Brugnoli says inclined stone actually train your chest. If I had hair I would be doing this with it. Pretend I have huge horse-like name, sexy locks. I pretend this daily. It's all right answers folks. Press press press away fly away, decline, flat, inclined. It's all good. Don't get caught up in the weeds just do good pressing and flying work. If it gives you chest to big public, make your chest sore, it's the right answer. Number four, this is a big one. Try to do what power lifters do. Now they do it in order to shorten the range of motion. But they end up getting themselves into the most hyper-trophic muscle growth promoting range of motion by doing this. They do two things. Instead of flying flat-backed on whatever bench they're doing, whether it's machine press, whether it's dumbbell presses, or whether it is flat press. Instead of laying flat, they arch their backs, not a ton. Some of them do, just a little bit. Arch your back a little. Think of it more as sticking your chest up and then take your shoulder blades and slide them back and under yourself. Now when you press as you press, you're going to lift your chest up. To the bar, or to the dumbbells. And through the sky, pause and then come back up. Slow and controlled, big chest all the way deep. Keep your shoulder blades back. Keep that back arched or in other words push your chest up. Don't ever lift your butt off of the bench. That's really bad. Can get you hurt. But if you arch and retract, you are putting your chest at a pre-stretched advantage for muscle growth. They're basically in a more hypertrophic position to begin with, which is awesome. A bonus point is that in my view, the probability of shoulder injury is lower when your scabs are tacked back this way, so you're winning on two grounds, potentially. Not mandatory, but give it a try. Some people who have trouble feeling their chest, mind muscle connection, trouble with pumps and soreness and fatigue. They do the archer or attract and they're like, holy shit. Finally, I can feel my packs. Lastly, control the eccentric and pause your presses, especially if you're doing deficits that keeps you safer. And it gives you more time in that nasty stretch position. So instead of mention like this, come down under control, couple seconds. Pause, be barbell, be it dumbbells, be whatever. Pause for one or two seconds. And then press back up. Control, big stretch, pause and go. That will keep the weight on the bar of the same. Reduce the total number of repetitions because each rep is harder, but increase the quality and safety of the repetitions beyond what they normally would have been. You're now doing the same amount of actual effort, but your effort is more effective and safer. I can't think of a better way to get good training than have it be more effective and safer. They've only more clowns were involved and made it fun. Like every time you do a bench rep and lock it out, the clowns got the kazoo thing or whatever. It's like, that'd be great. Jim's work on that.

Huge problem is a lot of people are not going for deep stretch nearly enough and their biases in Christ. Show them a video of lying dumbbell curls and they say that looks lame, but in reality lying dumbbell curls are probably one of the most brutal and effective ways to train your bicep. Downside you get to flex your ego less than that girl over there by the dumbbells isn't as impressed because you're not doing the full stack. But guess what? You have to say you don't want any part of her life. She's supposed to take side beams all day long and ask to you of like, is this underwear like a kid? Like, uh... Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for RP Strength and there are five things about arm training that everyone gets wrong. Okay, it's not everyone that's thumbnail title, lakery, but it's a lot of people. And I would say it's five things about arm training that everyone pretty much are most people at some point got wrong before they got right with God. Speaking of God, what does that have to do with arms will here's the thing? If you're a guy and you have problems in your life, bigger arms will fix all of them. Scott, have you ever gone to the bank and asked for an absurd loan with no collateral? I have it. Okay, you haven't because you anticipated that was stupid and there was no way they're going to give you a loan, right? Correct. Did you have giant arms, however? I definitely did. Yeah, that's really the problem. You got big enough arms, the bank will lend you anything. If you were a girl and all of your friends are getting married, but you're still single, it's probably because your arms aren't big enough. Now it seems obvious, doesn't it? That one grandma you had, she was just such a great woman so wise in her elder years and still so spritly looking at her arms next time you're hanging out with grandma. Kind of big for a lady, huh? World peace. People just need bigger arms. Animals rights. Can you imagine a cow, Scott, which is big ask, biceps and triceps? There's no way we're mistreating that animal. It's so glorious, gorgeous. Big arms are it. However, on our way to the obvious, obviously great goal of getting big arms, which is obvious and amazing, we tend to air in at least five really common ways. I'm going to talk about them, but talk about why they're not such a great idea to do and give you alternatives that are better. So number one, is the myth that you must have an arm day? You must do biceps and triceps together in the same workout. There is no distinct benefit of this. In fact, if your biceps are sufficiently pumped, it actually limits the range of motion on your triceps, which sometimes means they're not getting as much of a stretch and high load stretch, which means actually it's suboptimal. Can you do an arm day? Of course, but it's not an necessity. It's cool vibe, you get a big pump, but I don't actually help you with long-term growth, any more than training arms biceps and triceps separately in their own day. It's tough to program this into the same split, because a lot of times you back and biceps, chest and triceps, but then if you're doing arms, it's also like a dirt. I had biceps, the triceps, you want to know, is it gets confusing? The other problem with this is that there's a discordance and healing time. Triceps tend to be bigger, stronger, more susceptible to stretch under load, and so when you train biceps, you can do 10 sets of biceps and they can soar for a day or two and then you're good to go. You train triceps, they get soar for like two or three days and maybe even four and then you're good to go. So if you're always trying to train them together, you'll have to needlessly constrict the amount of effort, or volume you do for triceps, and needlessly do too much for biceps, it's a weird way to try to make things work. So I got to say, bice and trice together is totally fine, but absolutely not an necessity or a net benefit. If you're doing it for vibes, God bless you. If you have to screw up the rest of your program to keep an arm day in the mix, consider not doing that. Number two, a lot of people will say that for legs, you need to hire reps to grow. That's a 15 to 20, but for arms, sets of 8 to 12 grow best. That is not from my experience a dependably true thing. What that ends up doing in most cases is constraining people to one very small rep range, where for biceps and triceps are a grade 8 to 12. The reality is that in many cases, sets of 5 to 8 can absolutely 100% grow your biceps and triceps really well. So can sets of 8 to 12? So can sets of 12 all the way up to even 30 repetition. So instead of thinking okay, legs, higher reps, arms, lower reps, think of legs and arms as any number of reps between 5 and 30, and there are two things to say about that. One, try to find which rep range works better for your biceps and triceps in that whole huge range. And two understand that any rep range that works best for a while will eventually get stale and then it's a good idea for you to shift the rep range to something higher or something lower, which unjust variation will promote more growth. Don't constrain yourself to one rep range experiment across the board because for you you might find that on average sets of 15 work better for my biceps. So it's a 10 work better for my triceps, but every now and again when that gets stale I flip the script and do them in reverse. Number three, huge problem is a lot of people are not going for deep stretch nearly enough and they're biceps and triceps. People do cable extensions halfway down, they'll do bicep curls and they don't ever get a deep stretch or they'll just do bicep curls standing up and they don't have any tension in the bottom because gravity doesn't point in that direction. Show them a video of lying dumbbell curls and they say that looks lame, but in reality lying dumbbell curls are probably one of the most brutal and effective ways to train your bicep. Precisely because it stretches your bicep under its most maximum load in relation to gravity at that very deep part of the stretch. For triceps, squat crushers, etc. Yes, you'll have to take some lead off the bar, book going all the way down to a squat pressure to stretch your nose or each shin or even your throat if you have a spotter. Scott, what you once called a throat goat? Yes, what is that mean? A lot of money on that. Oh, like singing? Yes, it's a kind of singing, isn't it? Playing the body trombone? It's getting fluid if you roll. The skin fluid, the meat fluid, the great instruments are as I can tell. In any case, going for a deep stretch, any exercise you use, make sure it's loaded. In most cases, in that deep position and do not rip your soft off, go for that deep painful stretch hold it for a second or two and then go back in. You're going to get more pumps, more soreness, more growth. Downside, you get to flex your ego less than that girl over there by the dumbbells, isn't as impressed because you're not doing the full stack. But guess what? You don't want any part of her life. She's supposed to take stock memes all day long and ask to you if it's a thunder where I like. Okay, like a good Lindsay, you're good. I'm going to be up on my body here, girl. I don't need this any more ally. You know, the underwear, you know, Scott, I kind of screw myself on that one. Do want to see more of that. Huh? Number four, a lot of people who want big arms do not train them frequently enough. You're triceps, you can train in most cases hard two to three times a week. You're biceps, you can train in most cases hard three to four times a week. A lot of people will train the rest of their body and then have a one day in which they'll train arms and yeah, your arms get a little bit of work from chest and a little bit of work from back but it's just teeny teeny enough to maintain them. And then you're really only stimulating your arms robustly once a week. That's crazy. These are small muscles. They do not take one week to recover. Look, if you trash your quads and hamstrings. In my take, yeah, five days to recover two extra days to recover completely. And then you hit it once a week. You'll have great gains. But for arms man, like you can just train them more often and to most people don't. So, if you're building an arm program, make sure it has multiple arm days. But we get least two. Maybe as many as three or four if you can recover. That's the real best way to get as much arms size as you can. And lastly, but not leastly is myth slash mistake number five, which is forgetting that your arm has two parts. The upper arm and the lower arm. Your forearms can contribute massively. To how big your overall arms look. It is a distinct visual difference. For whatever size your upper arm is as big as possible. A bigger lower arm, a bigger forearm will almost always make the overall look better. Scott, can we make a note please? I mean, they had the editor folks put in a visual of Frank Magraath. He has enormous forearms. And when you look at his arms, you're like what the fuck? Maybe we can throw on some leap priest or something like that? Big forearm dudes. Oh, that's a, that's a search I've done before. And why not Jared Fathers well? Bigger forearms contribute massively to arms. So if you want the biggest arms you can, sorry I said that wrong. You want the biggest arms you can have. You should be training forearms diligently. Three to six sets, some kind of forearm curls. There's a bunch of different kinds. Multiple times per week will get you notably bigger forms. One hundred percent. All right. Go download the RPI Parchifay app link in description because we have multiple preset templates that focus on arms is a priority and also take care of the rest of your body. So you can just do them verbatim or change them yourself. It's a fucking sweet app. Give it a shot. And if you want more forearm hypertrophy over the more endurance kind, you're going to need to see and hear something beautiful on your screen. And what's more beautiful than my face except me the everything in this world? And if you want more of my face, I have a separate YouTube channel. It's just called Mike Israto. I talk about artificial intelligence. I talk about morality. I give life advice. I talk about progress. It's a nice upbeat channel. It's a lot of nerd stuff. Worst case scenario. You could hit the mute button. Get to work it out your forums. That's why I watched the channel. That was weird. See you guys next time.

Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Anassand's Periodization, and I have five rules for you to follow for your quad training to get the biggest possible legs that you can. These five helpful, hopefully, tips will get your legs bigger, so let's just get to it because you don't have time for videos, you got time to get big legs. First, quadriceps like many other muscles seem to grow best when they are stretched under heavy load, which means that if you're doing depth, squats, hacksquats, leg presses, you want to go deep for a big stretch. Take those squats as far as that range of motion goes until your calves touch your hamstrings or put another way, depth before dishonor. Rule number two, when you're pushing whatever implement be it a regular squat, hacksquat, leg press, pendulum squat, Smith machine squat, I can continue, but I won't. Make sure that you're pushing your weight through your heels as well as your toes. If you're just on your tippy toes, those are 60 squats, they can be effective, but in most cases, you want to produce as much force as possible, recruiting the big, strong, narrowly motor units in your quads to get as jacked as possible, which means force through your heels and through your toes at the same time and even foot dispersion of force. Rule number three is as you descend in squats, Smith machine squats, leg presses, etc. You name it, you want to, in most cases, to have your knees come way over your toes at the bottom. First, in a squat, you sit back and down, but then as soon as you've tilted your hips and broken through, you want to make sure that you sit straight down, letting your knees come forward while your heels stay on the ground or on the platform that you're using. As your quads are involved in that forward knee movement, they are going to be stretched a ton on her load, put into a very mechanically disadventageous position from which they will have to work super hard and thus get tons of growth. And the big benefit is you don't even have to use that much external weight. If you know how to squat properly, a hundred pounds less than you used to squat for reps can zap your quads better than that hundred pounds more ever could. Rule number four is to match the repetition range you use to the exercise type that you're using it. Here's an example of things that work for most people. Definitely feel free to be creative, and if this doesn't work for you, adjust it to your own needs, but here we go. That's a five to ten are probably best for squats, why? Because squats are conducive to lifting really heavy. And also, there are such a whole body movement and involve a lot of your anti-gravity muscles for balance and coordination that they take a ton of metabolic drive and they generate a ton of systemic and cardiovascular fatigue. So if you're doing many more than 10 repetitions a lot of times you're breathing becomes limiting factor and the last several reps just aren't quality and won't stimulate as much muscle gain as if you made the weight heavier and kept the sets to five to ten reps on average. Sure, you could do sets of 12, but you guys know what I mean. If your breathing is what's keeping you back, it's not a great hyper-chive exercise. Great breathing exercise. But we're not here to do cardio where you're going to get been quads. Next, if you're doing hacksquots in most cases, you want to take advantage of the fact that you can go a little bit more high rep because it raises you a bit better. Sure, you can do hacksquots with sets of five to ten, but a lot of times that much knee flexion without any hip help is a bit much of an isolation exercise and it doesn't feel 100% as safe for the quadriceps. You can totally do your hacksquots with sets of five to ten, but I recommend the best rep range for me on average for hacksquots is sets of 10 to 15 reps. 15 and up for me and my personal experience and most of folks I've trained with starts to become again a little bit more cardio and not enough heavy resistance training that actually trains the target muscles. For leg presses, the best range that I found is sets of 10 to 20. Again, you can do sets of five and sets of eight and leg press, but that's a bit heavy that's probably better reserved for squats. Anything above 20 reps is just cardio, but the leg press lets you sit down and braces you in. So there's a wide range through which you could use it or cycling somewhat with a hacksquot, but also giving you that 50 to 20 rep range to play with reveriation. Lastly, the term heavy leg extensions makes almost no sense to me. Why would you do something heavy in a position in which your body limits you from using heavy load and even trying very hard? Your quads activate better when you're heel and foot have something to press against, then just extending your knee against resistance. Heavy leg extensions are just not the best use of either heavy or leg extensions. You want to go heavy to squats, but if you wanted leg extensions, there are excellent exercises that you can do for variation in the higher rep ranges. You can do leg extensions for 10 or more reps, but the real money is 15 or even 20 to 30 reps. In leg extension sets, especially if you drop sets, supersets, my rep match reps, all of that stuff fries you out. Thus, you have a whole spectrum of which exercises to use more often when you're going heavier, which ones for intermediate loading, in which ones for higher reps, thus you can match the exercise to the loading and vice versa and get the most out of the movements as far as effectiveness and as far as safety. Lastly, if you're really serious about quad training and you want to take your quad training to the next level, buy yourself some weight lifting shoes. They don't have to be super expensive, but any weight lifting shoe that's literally in a sport of weight lifting, it's not like I'm saying, oh, a lifting shoe for lifting weights. It's a weight lifting one word shoe. If you google that, it's the shoes with the heel that rises as it goes. Those shoes are going to just completely upgrade your quad training to the next level. They allow an unbelievable amount of even support so that pushing through your toes and your heels is super super easy to do in almost intuitive. They provide you with a ton of stability and also by raising your heel, they extend your ankle mobility and let you get super deep stretching the quad without involving the lower back and the hips as much and thus making all of your quad training even more targeted for the quad. Folks, that's all the tips for now. Please shoot some questions that you have in the comments below. I'll try to respond to a few. Like, subscribe and we'll see you next time.

One of the funniest things to me is when I get criticism on the internet, all to well received, all taken. Of like, man, you just got to sling this iron bro, stop with these wacky exercises that target the muscle like you look the ridiculous, like, pick up a barbell. They get a sweet. So imagine I already took your advice. Uh, 24 years ago. And it failed me. Thank you. I'm going to be doing good exercises now with good technique. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for RP Strength. And believe it or not, I got a few things right. When I was really early in my training and let's learn from how magical and perfect I was and how I did everything right. Not true. A little while back, I think we put out a video about how some of the stuff I did was not so great. And that definitely wasn't out ideal, but I did get some stuff right. Let's talk about it and see if you can learn from it and maybe do it a little bit yourself. First, progressive overload. I would seek to add five to ten pounds to the bar. Or wrap here in there to dumbbell movements, kind of from day one. I sort of just thought that was the point. It turns out I wasn't wrong. I knew almost nothing, but I knew like you got to add some weight. And I did read Arnold's education of a bodybuilder, not the encyclopedia of a bodybuilding. That's an alladermook. And he did talk about like just like pushing the pace a little bit. And I did that in it worked wonders. I even went so far as to put weights in my backpack. I remember I had straps. The 120 dumbbells on each hand for lunges. But that wasn't enough because I was going over 20 reps on those. And I was taking a backpack and putting 60 pounds in there. So two, 25ers and a 10 plates zipping it. It looks sagged a lot at 60 pounds. That's supposed to be doing that. And then I would lunge with it. And I got a little absurd. I probably could have had better check the heat. But the idea was more and more and that was really good. It also helped me challenge my notions of what I couldn't couldn't achieve. You know, you get to the high 300s in the squat. You're like, am I really going to squat four plates on a side? I don't know. You get to you like in 365 and you stay there forever. But if you go to 375 and late 385 and late 395, D load and you just want to jump away from 405. It can be a thing as long as you push pro actively, not just reactively. Yeah, if you seem to be getting stronger, push up. Try to push up anyway and see if you can match it. A lot of times it's just the mentality that's keeping you behind and not really the physiology. Don't just go by feel, push the pace gently in most weeks by little bit. Another five pounds and another rep and you're going to do really, really well for yourself. Another thing I did early on was I worshipped religiously with sacrifices, mostly animal squirrels and stuff like that. And I'm not necessarily a possum here and there. I worshipped the compound basics. I was drawn spiritually to pull ups, bench presses, shoulder presses, squats, deadlifts, rows and so on. And these movements allowed me to narrow my focus on strength and technique. Once you build a lot of good technical acumen and a lot of strength, you can open your focus to everything else and it comes super easy. But if you don't have a lot of strength and technique, everything else kind of is a little bit difficult. It also allowed me to keep my approach simple and consistent, focusing on these core movements. And to be honest fellas, I have many, many flaws. I have never, ever in a million years had paralysis by analysis. Whereas I like to call it analisess, parahlysis. Analisess, if you spread out anywhere, it's the destruction of the in any case. I never had that straight up I've never had in my entire life. And I didn't even know what the hell I was doing for a long time. And then when I started learning, I didn't have a moment where I was like, oh my god, there's too much stuff. Nope. I stuck to the basics until there was a compelling reason in need for me to incorporate other exercises. And I gently did. And then I was like, oh, that's great. Or maybe I had to work and I went back. Analysis, paralysis often occurs when you see the entire latent space of all of the exercises you could be doing. And you have your group that you're doing. And you're like, oh, I, if I did these, I'd be better. That's how he'd become a champion. You say to yourself. But the reality is if you just stick to the core group, you don't have to worry about what else is on there. You know, Scott, the video guy. He has a core group of guys. He always hangs out with. And they do physical things with each other. One more on the road. He's a cute boy. He is very not frequently like, oh, should I do things with him? The boy will like him. I will like. I say, no, Scott, you got your boys back home. Stick to your boys. And he's like the right. They're sexual, very young. They're men. Uh, everything. A few were old. Silver daddy is their call. Scott, do you think you'll ever be able to quit your addiction to silver daddy's? I mean, that's tough. They just keep cutting better with age. You know, that's tough. And in much the same way. I couldn't make it, fellas. Leave in the little one at it this out. It much the same way. The compound heavy barbell basics and dumbbell basics. They're always good. They don't get better with age. Although you get better with them at them with age because your technique grows in and your strength builds. I'm not telling you just jettison all the other exercises. I'll have something to say about that in a little bit. But if you want to stick to core compound heavy basics, they are never going to do you dirty, especially as a beginner. They're going to build an incredible base of size and strength for you. And then you can later refine it by adding more isolation and machine exercises, which exactly what I did. Another one. Point number three, something I got right is good technique. I did not have it right away right away. I'm going to clearly ask you guys if you saw me lift in high school, which many people did and even my gym teacher was like they could have better technique. And I was 16 and entirely interested in hearing things like that because yellow I'm going to like jam weight. One of the funniest things to me is when I get criticism on the internet all to well received all taken of like man, you just got to sling this iron bro, stop with these wacky exercises a target the muscle like you look the ridiculous like pick up a barbell. Hey guys sweet. So imagine I already took your advice 24 years ago and it failed me. Thank you. I'm going to be doing good exercises now with good technique. Technique is important. I didn't have it in high school. I actually got hurt a few times in high school. I heard my shoulder benching. It sucked. But after my first four years of lifting I got into power lifting and power lifting is a standard. You can be under any impression of what a squat is until and unless you try to do a power lifting meat and then tell you this is a squat and nothing higher than this is a squat. So you're at least going to be sinking below a parallel which is really really good even fire purger. And the bench press, you got to touch your chest and the deadlift, you got to keep you back straight and all this other stuff. And so at some point with these technique tips I picked up from power lifting and transfer them into bodybuilding and that technical stringency was really really helpful. So I didn't do it as exact to begin or at least I had. But pretty much a pretty early intermediate. I already had good technique and it never left and I've just been perfecting it ever since. That kept the gains consistent and kept me safe literally for decades. Whereas before I actually got probably got more hurt in the first three years of lifting that I did in the next 10 because precisely that I was not doing a technique in the I was. Number four thing that I did was consistency. The only time I've been away from the gym from regular gym sessions. From more than a week and a half ever, ever to this day since I started lifting was when I had hernia surgery and I say you're not supposed to lift and even then just after two and a half weeks I was doing light lifting already. And believe it or not, but for the first two years of my lifting actually wasn't in love with it. It was just painful and I hated it but I knew I had to do it for some reason. But I kept showing up and getting more more results and after about three years I was falling in love in the rest of history. And now lifting an iron like spiraling into the sky together and staring at each other like face to face. I've got my hands on her waist or whatever like this were super hard flying. And then later I'm like trying to get my tongue all of it in there and smooch it. She's kind of like, I know this room is romantic romantic. No, no, no tongue. But in any case that's lifting an eye. I didn't always have it there but once I did, he once you fall in love you're good. You'll be consistent. But be consistent anyway. So if you don't love lifting yet stick to it at least two days a week, maybe three. And a few weeks off here in there in a big deal but don't take months off. Focus the gains will come, focus on the gains, focus on the fun. Eventually you'll fall in love and consistency will no longer be an issue but it's a big deal especially early. And lastly, number five, thing I did early that was really good was incorporating some variation. Some people can do the same identical movements for years and years and years and not that an eye. God bless. This can work but in some cases it risks kind of overuse injuries because it's the exact same force vectoring pattern to the exact same tissues the exact same way over time. And also it can risk psychological burnout. There's only so many high bar squats you can do until you're like I never want to see a squat bar ever in my life. And you did a break. So what I did is very similar movements like I talked about but I would change things out every few months when they felt stale. And the way I would change doesn't necessarily go into different exercises which sometimes I did but a lot of times it's subtle changes which are awesome, awesome injectors of variation into your program. Things like stance width, medium stance squats, narrow stance squats, wide stance squats, grip width, pullups with shoulder width, pullups with just on side of shoulder width, wide grip pullups, grip type, overhand grip, neutral grip, underhand grip, repetition ranges, sets of 5 to 10, sets of 10 to 20, sets of 20 to 30, exercise a order, sometimes it's bench first and fly, sometimes it's fly first and bench every few months I changed that. And of course the exercise itself take away leg press, go to hacksquat, so on and so forth. Even though back in the day I didn't ask squatting because I was too big of an 80 to figure out how to do that exercise properly. So at the end of the day that variation kept me progressing, it kept me safer and it kept lifting way more fun for decades to come. So don't just pick your core exercises and be like that's it, 5 moves every day, that's cool. But try after a few months with the same movements, two change the grips, positions, etc. And maybe some exercises, nothing you can change is the cadence of the lift, you can do slow race tricks or quicker race tricks. When you have that intelligent variation every few months instead of every few days or like once a week, you get to best of both worlds of awesome progress, milking out all the games you can from a lift for a time and then switching and having a ton of fun doing some new stuff. Should you try to stick to all of the things I found that worked for me? Yeah, probably because they're quite basic. There was no rocket signs here, but whatever else you find in your lifting that's working well for you, forgiving you better results, or even if it doesn't give you worse results, but it makes the gym more fun lean into that foreshur. Because it might be a strategy to keep you in the game and progressing for years and that it'll pay dividends. Because eventually you'll wake up and you really go, my God, them huge. No, how did this happen? This is bullshit. I've got a scarth. I've got to buy clothes and then even know where the my pants and too small and then the biologists obviously that big enough and you know when my muscles don't push up my cock bulging the majins because I've got a lot of space. People think all maybe he's backing something in there, but when I've got to be quiet, the jeans tighten up and the people can see like oh my God, this is like a micro penis, what's going on? Is it really a woman? Do I look like a woman? Am I talking like a woman? Do you know? I'm Arnold. Stop it. But listen, before you go, yeah, I, what you want to do is look into the description. Because you've got to have parents, you're free, but then what that means is a fancy science word. In Germany, we just call it something simple like Guggenfang Baigur Starrl, which actually means dog. Yeah, and then but it's going to get you jacked and there's electrons in there, whatever. And then if you're too big, it's too fat and you're disgusting, you're too skinny, you look at you, you're puny arms, then you want to do the arpy diet, couldchap, which I didn't know what it does. It tells you what to eat and you need to help. Look at you, pathetic. Anyway, I know what the hell that was I blanked out. I'll see you guys next time. You know, one in five, her 1.5 and 10,000 males have a micro penis mic, so you're not alone. With the, where they bit this is theirs, isn't that this micro is mine? I'm going to be the champion Scott. No, you're not the most micro. That's right. Yeah, no, bullshit. The guys come up to me to like, hey, I'm really sorry. What you're sorry about is because you have a micro penis. No, don't, don't, don't stop the recording. We're keeping this in and I'm like, no, but that, yes, I do, but yours is smaller than mine and they're like, that's not true and then they pull me pants down and they're like, but you don't have a penis. I'm like, bullshit, you just don't have telescopic vision. You need a life microscope to see my shit. Yeah, and I'm working on it. It's getting smaller so at some point it's going to be electron microscopy is the only way you can do it. With the hell that's like the longest rent of Ghana, the Zahnolting 9. Anyway, I'll for real see you guys this next time. Peace home. Are you gonna hit the button?

52 sets per week for the whole body? No. Folks, I'm Dr. Mike. I had to leave forward to say that to make sure that you understood how serious I was about. A ledgering one of my name was. Huh? Who the hell are you? What am I? Don't worry about that now. Just answer some questions and you'll get your doll back and reunited with your family. Stay calm. Tell us your name. My name is Milo Wolff. Soon to be Dr. Mike. Soon to be. How soon? Well, I'm defending in three weeks. Oh, so. Congratulations in advance. I know that's a faux pas to say. Not at the final. Yeah. So yeah. Three weeks later, you DM me, you're like, I didn't failed. Yeah. They did. So you are getting your PhD very shortly. By the time this video will be released, certainly you will have a PhD in a sports science. Don't act like you don't know the answer to that question. It has to be from you. It's interesting. I see. I see. You're like, I don't know. Maybe sports science. I don't know. I never looked into it. Okay. And you are a super expert in the science of range of motion. And we've got many interviews with you over a record in the channel about that, especially in the member section of Yama Fakazus Careous. Deep science member section. But you have recently done a pretty in-depth perusal of the volume literature. It's kind of a demon coming back to hot me from the past. I've been a volume science and joyer for some time. And recently some studies have been coming out. And they're saying something very interesting. And hopefully Scott the video guy did what we were planning to do. The thumbnail for this video that you clicked is some absurd claim of doing some absurd number of sets is going to get you jacked. And if you're not doing it, you're a loser. That part is quick-baked. Though you may in fact be a loser for reasons that we can't account for. It'd be like that sometimes. It would just not be like that sometimes. And tell us what's going on with the training volume. Maybe Milo, if you can start, tell us what the story was for what we thought. Something like maximum recoverable volume. You still look like a few years ago before the Barballo studies. Et cetera, cultureist. Yes. Yes. About five years ago, our best thinking based on the study we had was that around 10 to 20 sets was the best place to maximize our approach to the. We had pretty consistent evidence as summarized in a metinosis by Brad Schoenfeld that's doing more than 10 sets was better from muscle growth than doing fewer than 10 sets per week per month. And from what I remember, they didn't have the density of data above 10 sets to conclude confidently. First of all, any specifics, what happens above 10 sets just that it's better. And also a lot of people were asking Brad about, well, what about what about north of 20? And he was just like, guys, we have like four studies total above 10 sets. Generally, they're all better than the studies below. But one of them is 21 sets and nothing else above that. So we actually don't know how high the volume cap goes. Exactly. But also in terms of those response relationship, you very much saw that each additional set yielded more growth. At least within the confines of what have been studied up to about 15. 20 sets to compare in different studies. Right. Not sets added week to week. Correct. So it couldn't conclude that bad scratch. Even though I was on about the ship for no bad damn good reason. Informed by science, but guided by the spirit, that's how I like to describe myself. My psychiatrist disagrees. So at that point, we knew that like generally, if you look at the studies of their whole, if you were going to design a program for someone and they're like, I want growth. Or at least from 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15 plus ish, go higher and you'll probably see more growth for most people. That's correct. Okay. Yes. It was definitely a positive relationship between how much volume you did and how much hyper-to-views all. Importantly, in these studies, sets were taken to fail your typically. So if you're taking a lot of submaximal sets, you may or may not see the same relationship. You may actually get it from higher volumes. So that's a consideration. Right. Most volumes, because submaximal sets both do not cause as much stimulus per set, linearly, and cause significantly less fatigue. So it's kind of like, if you're less fatigued and you need more volume, maybe you can do 25 or 30, etc. sets if they're actually submaximal. Correct. You can recover from more sets given that each set is less fatigued, and thus you can get more total stimulus in times. So that was our understanding about five years ago. Now, since then, there's been multiple new studies looking into higher and higher volumes. With this most recent study by Anderson Colleagues looking at, at the peak volume, 52 sets a week. Well, that's a plug-in deck of cards, maybe. You know what you could do is have a deck of cards with you. And like for each fucking set, you do you lay out a card. Do that would be so demeaning, because you'd be like, oh my god, I have to get through how many sets this week. We can walk away. You're a hypertrophy stripper, and I'll just throw the cards at you. Just make it raise as long as it's demeaning to me. I'm turned on. 52 sets per week for the whole body. No. So in this recent study, they looked exclusively at the quads. They did train hamstrings as well at the end of each session, but that was a total of eight sets per week. So very low volume for the hamstrings. So you could essentially review it as a specialization phase for the quads. We're going all the way up to 52 sets. The average cross-the-hole study for that group was 37 sets. 37 set average. With a standard load. And ended up high. So they started somewhere in the 20s or something like that. 22 to 52, 37 average. How long was the duration of the training in a month? 12 weeks. So over 12 weeks, they went from 20 to 52 adding six sets every two weeks. No d-loads, no d-loads. Full send, full send. They didn't train anything other than their legs. They were free to train their upper body in their own time. And given that they were trained subjects, like they squatted on average, four and a half to parallel three plates. That's dope. It's pretty solid. Yeah, it's a big fucker. So my hunch is they did train upper body, but I don't think they trained it to the same level as they trained their quads. Because if they did that, they just got in the quad program and just do it for everything. Imagine if they actually did that. That would be crazy growth. Interesting study. Or maybe. Or they would be nuts. Okay. And then so what are the subgroupings in that study? Because they didn't just have one condition. So they were the other ones. So to give you a brief overview of the study, they had a wash out phase, or essentially for two weeks, participants were very low volumes to sort of sensitize them all to the same extent to training overall. Then they had a two week from the realization phase, where they gradually added volume to get a 22 sets of quads per week. And from there they had a 12 week intervention period. One group stayed at 22 sets for quads the whole time. So it was 11 sets in one session, 11 sets in one session. Which is like a lot. That's a lot. All sets were taken to RP8 or two reps in reserve, except for the last set, which was taken to failure. So actually as far as like ecological ability, it's pretty close to what you're doing in the real world. Yes. The last set of each exercise or other exercise. Session. Each exercise. So basically exercises. Yep. Squats, lighter extensions, leg presses. Squat, like, post-legs. Interesting. Okay. And then the last set of each one of those they took to failure. Otherwise it's a two RIR. We're going to get this question. So we might as well answer it now. People will say that beginners don't know how to train close to failures. R is meaningless. We don't even have to address that because these aren't beginners. These are three plate squatters. Been training for mostly two to three years plus. And you know, sure. They had a scientific definition of train participant usually. So I got that one correct. And then what is the situation with the confidence that we have? That they really went to reps and reserve based on the literature that you're familiar with. Yep. So we actually can do a systematic review of metanalsis on how accurate or people that estimating reps and reserve. This is with them lab conditions, whether or not these results generalize to the average person and a gym, unclear. However, in lab contexts across the bit about 10 to 20 studies. But hold on, the training situation for the study also occurred on a lab. That's correct. So we didn't say that internal validity is really high. 100%. So in this context, on average, people are off by less than one rep. They underestimate themselves by just shy of a rep. So if they think they can do two more reps on the given set on average, they're a bit closer to three reps. Yeah. That's generally the result. It's not fields and fields and reps and reps away. It's not enough of a difference to really make a practical impact on the results of the study. Sure. So they got these guys going to rep shy of failure. We can probably surprise that they trained pretty fucking hard. Yes. Hard sets. That is some of them to failure. Yeah. Okay. As far as rest time's went. And this is a big limitation of a lot of volume studies. They actually rest for at least two minutes. It's a long fucking study, bro. That's a long study for a graduate student. The clipboard was there for a long time. It was supervised by a student in the conditioning professional. So it's another thing. It's like, oh, if you're not being supervised, maybe you don't train quite as hard. Yes. It was even supervised. Yeah. In fact, even when as far as to control for diet. So they measured dietary intake both at baseline, halfway through a study at the end of the other study, for all groups to look at whether or not they're in differences. And essentially, that was similar. So it's not quite that rare. The three groups were one group that remained at 22 sets of quads per week through the whole 12 weeks. So that would look like doing four sets of squat, four sets of leg press, and three select functions twice a week. Five selects. The second group, story at 22 sets, and then added four sets every two weeks. So that would, they would add it sort of a cross the board. So we would add one set of squat, one set of leg press, one still extension, and kind of go back. Kind of almost at squat, got it. So overall volume is distributed evenly at four sets. The same thing of, because at our PL out of the stuff, we do weekly set manipulations. This would be the rough equivalent of adding two sets to your muscle group, the training per week. So that means that one set per session, yes, in the per week, yes, or week. One set per session per week, because of two sessions. Okay. So that's really like a very mild increase in volume. For sure. So 12 weeks. Meant potatoes. 12 weeks. That's crazy. Right. Oh yeah. So one group stays at 22 sets, one group added four sets every two weeks, and the final group added six sets every two weeks. So the first group stayed at 22. The second group progress from 22 to, I guess, this case that would be 30 something. 30 something in this case. And then the final group went all the way to 52 sets per week for an average of three sets. So they only trained for 50 to six per week for the last two weeks. That is great. Excellent. And so automatically, if you read this study as you should be training with 52 sets a week, you've misunderstood the entire nature of the apparatus. That's some shit we used to get a lot back in my proselytizing for MRV days, where it's like 20 sets a week. You can't record from that. I guess, I don't we do that in my last week and then I deal with. So definitely a difference. And they all, they started all at 22 sets a week, which is like, I'll say high reasonable. Yep. But then they kept going. That is correct. Okay. So when did the first subject die in how much muscle the values in group number three? Well, from fact, the dropout rate was lowest in the highest point group. And the only injury that occurred and resulted in a dropout, so participants stopped the study was actually lowest one group. So as far as people claiming that higher bodies will get injured, that's where we're at the very least we don't have compelling evidence from these studies that that would be. Yeah. Uh, what I'll say is if it's okay, if I paint my own little bullshit into this, uh, you don't have to agree with any I'm saying. Well, if you my interpretation of that is like, yeah, shot up Mike, there is absolutely a theoretical basis for saying, doing too much work over time will get you hurt. But it certainly doesn't present itself in, uh, obvious definite. This is going to hurt you way, especially in an order of weeks, usually in order of months and years of doing too much. And often like, it's not your muscles to get hurt. It's your joints and connective tissues. And if you're managing good technique, et cetera, you may be a little really crazy volumes and actually never get hurt. Uh, will you get great results though? So how do they results go? Well, so they measured hypertrophy of the quads, obviously, so it's the most frequent interest and they also measured one group maximum squad. Interesting. It's very standard exercise science, just a little bit. For the heart, since squad is like, in the exercise science side, yes, absolutely. Per that real quick question, what was their rough relative intensity? Was the sets of how many reps roughly are they doing here? So they varied between sets of six to eight and sets of 10 to 12. Six to eight in the first part of the week, 10 to 12 in the second part of the week. Oh, beautiful design. Good job researchers. Yeah, some variations. I'm like, you know, amazing. Yeah. So hey, what they've found for strengths, broadly speaking, is he adding four sets per two weeks group, so the moderate blind group. And the higher blind group, so a better outcomes in one of Max and the squad than the 22 set group. And these groups on average were doing about like 10 to 15 sets of squats a week, if not a bit more sometimes. So we're talking about relatively high volumes of squatting volume and overall quad volume increasing strength gains, which is relatively novel. Previous studies on volume and strength gains, generally find there is a positive relationship between how many sets you need per week for a lift and your strength gains. Yeah. But it's a bit more moderate. Yeah. And a peak tape is off. Because hypertrophy keeps going for a god knows how long. It's the strength we kind of understand. Like if someone's a case should I do 20 sets of squats per week for strength. And be like, I think I'll be keeping it to 10 to 15 at the most. And that seems that's not just me making. I'm numbers. That's actually evidence based recommendation for strength. I think if someone tells you hey, evidence based 15 or more sets of squatter venture done with per week is a good idea. And like, where, which study are you getting that from? Have hypertrophy different story? Y

we talked about nutrition yeah and some of the the massive feedings like those are the studies that you have a hard time getting people to commit to a subjects because there's so many that eat so much food those are hard those those have an adherence issue because those are brutal you know just take some pills or drink a supplement and you know maybe you can tell it's there hopefully they've hidden it so there's no placebo effect but take a study like okay we're going to we're going to overfeed you consistently for the next three months and you know you get drop out from gastric distress you know all the things that happen when people just don't want to bulk bulking is very difficult yeah so you do like a true bulking study and you do this in a scientific context where you like tip like the way that it's done obviously with coaching most of the time not not almost does this is that you add calories given the feedback you're getting how is the person strength changing how you know you don't want to gain like three pounds every week you know that's too fast yeah you know almost every situation let's you're like you know you're just putting on water like in a few days after a shower something so you tie treat things you you adjust things you know in a very individualistic manner well if you're going to test a condition in an overfeeding study like that you have the the question is if we take this very specific approach and apply it to our sample from this population of highly resistant strain body builders what happens and can we say that if we add 2,000 calories to their caloric balance diet that they get X amount of muscle growth and we've also added an extra 100 grams of protein something like that so everyone has to do that and for some people they might grow like weeds they got good genetics based on you know how far they are along their lob diminishing returns spectrum like I had they grown you know only 10 pounds since they started they have a lot more left in the tank because they you know really have an air push to food before maybe there's someone who's already put on 70 pounds you know and for them to get two pounds of muscle is like just a miracle so you end up with the scenario like the like the studies that we've talked about here it's also in one of one of those one-on-one or two one-on-three where they the first study they looked at frequency of training and they saw those no difference it mattered two or three or five times a week and they looked at the individuals and some people did better with higher some people did better with lower some people just grew like weeds some people didn't grow with either so you're answering a different question with those group studies as opposed to what might work best for the individual so so anyway as far as the protein goes I think I lost my trade-a-thon at too many times it's an original question I'm just taking it all in yeah so oh as far as yeah your question as far as the central amino acids once you get to the maybe like you know 10 or 15 that's what you're going to get in a protein dose of you know maybe 60 something like that 50 to 70 you're already at a protein dose that's that's plenty to maximally turn on protein synthesis I got you where we want to rise talking about this whole body protein synthesis idea and the limitations of the studies because there aren't studies that just show like what if we just massively bulk someone's lots of protein while they're training you know there's like there's the studies that we talked about but that's just about it there's like three okay so the essential amino acids in a dose of you know let's say 15 grams that's plenty to turn on protein synthesis and almost all situations if protein breakdown is very rarely measured it's methodologically very difficult to do so that's kind of the assumption is that it always is about one third of the protein synthesis I believe that's the number that I've read is that they sort of based on like two three studies that they just sort of presume that's the case it's sort of that sort of presume that's a constant but that's not been in in skeletal muscle but it's not been assessed regularly across a range of the protein intakes to know what the true protein balances there's just kind of underlying assumption so it's hard to say whether you know if you took in 25 grams of essential amino acids if that would have a differential effect versus just six like on protein balance that's what matters you got breakdown in synthesis so whether you're in a positive scenario positive protein balance or negative protein balances what matters so 25 might be you know that's good insurance you know there might be the effect on breakdown I don't know so that's why body voters do this they you know they they figure out you know what might make sense and they just add a little insurance they take a little extra the course in terms of protein with healthy kidneys and this scenario the calories are minimal if you go from let's say 10 to 20 that's an extra 40 calories something like that you know it's not a big deal it's probably not going to hurt you except maybe in your wallet so it's not a bad a bad thought but the data aren't there that that I'm aware of to dig in and say oh yeah like when you you don't get started having a massive effect on limiting protein breakdown until you get you know up to 20 grams of essential amino acids okay and the thing is you you don't necessarily want that because you want some protein breakdown and some stimulus for protein turnover so that you can continue to have the remodeling from your workout the difference would be off season versus trying to limit that breakdown pre-contest so I still think that the protein we know this pretty solid we need to get whole protein and someone's dieting down they're in a chloric deficit there's even a pretty cool so short study from Stu Phillips group where Ash knows with women and there's only like four weeks maybe but they loaded them with loaded them up with like oh guys was it three three or four grams per kilogram so higher than that like 2.2 is sort of the upgraded the range that comes from various ways of looking at what you need when you're training in terms of protein but they were dieting down they're in deficit and these women actually grew muscle while they're in a really severe they're in calories a day it was like hitting it was it was it was really wrong I could look it up real quick but yeah it was a rough color deficit so the whole protein still a a better choice you know unless you get like unless you feel like you know you're you've got you're being blessed by unicorn when you use essential amino acids it's supposed to whole protein um then yeah the whole protein is the way to go it's just what your what your body set up to to metabolize it's what's it's what you know the system needs in terms of all those amino acids there's just there's very little reason and this goes for also like studies this is in my book and on the article on John site it's just to like try to soup up your protein source was with more protein with a start with more essential amino acids if it's if you're if you're taking an vegetarian protein that makes sense but you've got a whole protein a complete protein with good amino acids score then protein digestibility corrected amino acids score let's say that's what is for a long time been sort of the main way of evaluating protein value if you've got a good score you've got a good animal source of protein then you're not really doing anything and you're taking it off yeah you're not really doing anything you're kind of like um you're splitting here is like what if I took in 15 grams away protein and then I added like six grams of yeah it's look hey I was thinking it already you know like what did the advantages well it's the advantages could be a placebo effect just like ooh I got to be the evil scientist like I could together this perfect pre-cont or pre-training ritual of this this this this this this I only do this I got every supplement known in mankind I had a someone message you had to form to like to be a few weeks ago now and he's like I need help like there's almost like you know he stood up at the meeting he said you know my name's John and a bodybuilding supplement addict you know yeah I mean the business like I'm really like you know you're like exactly that kind of phenomenal source yeah you know there's literature suggests all sorts of things can be effective so you start with that you know yeah that and like that and next thing you know like holy shit I'm spending just like a lot of food and both of those exceed my rent like what's going on here I've gone overboard so I mentioned this in regards to just supplements in general like like heart care supplements those sorts of things is that if you look at like so let's take you're gonna take burbery and curcumin and risveratrol and you start adding all those is eventually end up having overlapping mechanisms so kind of a plan so you're with a whole protein source and essential amino acids if I take in way protein which has essential amino acids in it and then I take in essential amino acids to get essential amino acids is this like she's just taken where way protein or just use the right amount of way protein yeah well because it feels cooler to use a bunch of little things but you do got to run and you got to watch out for the fact like I'm just you know it's like I'm I'm using a nail and I'm using a screw you know and yeah both do the same needs of you know they're basically holding the board down you don't need the use both types fair enough influence fair enough yeah all right listen so I know you had a couple of the things here that you'd picked out from the the previous episode we one of them was elevating the bed during peak week I know we talked about that not too long ago had down tilt is there anything you wanted to to brush up on with that one I couldn't remember because I talk about these things you know we did yeah we talked about it not too long ago we did a whole segment of on it but about you know what I've got one that I didn't I didn't mention to you it related to left ventricular vs gives me left ventricle hypertrophy and it was from one of our patreon guys not sure if you have anything on this and if not we could always come back to it but basically he had found he had some mild left ventricular hypertrophy six four two sixty so he's a big dude and he's been doing bodybuilding for the last 20 years the doctors told him that it was minor and that it would be expected for someone to hit a size blood pressure while on cycle has never gotten extremely high 140 over 90 in the past but now he's been using a little bit of cialis at times five milligrams and he got his doctor to put him on tell us martin and he said that his blood pressure is 105 over 70 and he adds at what reading should someone cut back on blood pressure medication assuming the person feels good and doesn't get dizzy. I always say a question for his doctor. True yeah so it's the interesting thing is that I don't see this mention to us so it's like this is a big barriers repeating just like he mentioned he's got it like a bigger person should have a higher blood pressure. It's typically what you'd see if you look at like you know you can imagine the blood there's some variability across species but the blood pressure in an elephant is going to be a heart of the blood pressure in a mouse. You're going to you're going to you're expecting those things you know so there's some scaling with the body size it probably scales with body surface area or something like that but in terms of the tissue what we're concerned about will couple things you got your kidneys and then you've got also the theleons as far as cardiovascular disease and those sorts of things that are associated with having high blood pressure. You don't want to be if you if you have larger person it doesn't mean like I use a truck example you know you get an F 150 you get an F 350 and they're going to have different size leaf springs and different size suspension on them because there's a bigger truck. If you're a human that's 100 pounds versus a human that's 300 pounds it doesn't mean you get kidneys that are cooked differently like the the two different trucks have different size leaf springs. You still get a pair of kidneys that there's going to be bigger kidneys but the working parts in those kidneys the glomeruli are going to be the same and the filtration in the glomeruli it's going to be the the same the Bowman's capsules everything else that goes into the how the kidney does its job is going to be the same and the end of the union that you have generally speaking it has you know very abilities because of their genetics but you still got human and the theleon tissue in your vascular chair and so one of the issues is that you can just stretch your kidneys out of the high blood pressure kidneys are they're sensing this and producing running in the part of the running the angiotensin system a dosage room system and also if you're someone who's got high blood pressure and you've got shitty blood lipids part of the mechanism whereby you're going to get a claw or atherosclerosis is that you've got more blood pressure driving the blood through the system and you've got these lipids if you got a poor lipid profile you've got little you call them like you used to use the term microtairs you've got inflammatory process that can happen there because the blood's constantly rushing through the vasacature and the cells and all the components the proteins are any of the inside the blood is banging up against the inner tube that vascular endothelium within the blood cell and you can get plaque plaque he streaks laid down there which can then basically become sort of kind of a scar so to speak you get infiltration with macrophage you can find some really awesome figures online demonstrating the whole mechanism is there involved there but the greater the pressure you can imagine which which hose is going to have the greatest wear and tear it imagine this hose is pumping concrete let's say so there's you know it's pretty rough which's coming through the hose a hose that is under high pressure or hose that's you know just sort of like pumping out an easy and easy great yeah so the higher the pressure the the greater the stresses the physical stresses and in that environment of inflammation being generally inflamed and the wrong kind of lipids in terms of those those fatty streaks being laid down you end up with a scenario where you can have a clot formation you have an ants cardiovascular disease when you get you know there's actually the sort of craziest pictures or studies where they've taken um they use macaxe they use other primates not humans and they give them an atherogenic diet you can look up like macac or you know simian and then atherogenic and you see like literally like you know the the controls have like they look at one of the arterial vessels the coronary vessels and the controls look like this and then and maybe there's like it may be a little thin streak like nothing there as far as atherogenesis and then the ones in the atherogenic diet like you know the basically what humans who die on macadons and and typical you know standard American diet it's like a little bit of a hole for the blood through yeah they've got some major inclusion there that's where you get that you know as she and your in your heart so anyway he's a big guy he should have hired lip pressure because he's just because he's bigger but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's okay to have a higher lip pressure because he's still got the same vascular endothelium that other humans would have so lowers got to be general and the that epidemiological data tell us this without it out it's so variable though is to whether someone's going to end up getting atherosclerosis or be at a risk for a heart attack based on their blood lip and those sorts of things you don't I've looked for this and almost I'm not going to conspiracy theory here but I've looked so many times to try to figure out statistically and maybe someone out there has has found this was a study that I've just missed or review or something if you look at like your major factors for cardiovascular disease so being overweight, high blood pressure poor lipids family history would have you family history's going to take up a big part of this but if you eliminate that and look at the things you can your controllable factors as they're known what percentage of the variability in risk for heart attack or a cerebral vascular event a stroke deep vein from brosus what have you what percentage is accounted for by those factors so can we say you know if we know these things we can predict 50% of your of the variability in risk among individuals I think it's a relatively small amount there's a lot of which just happens or we're not quite sure why who necessarily it's probably genetic you know if you're crappy crappy diet if there's things you can change and the extent to which can change those varies kind of like you know why do some people grow so well as bodybuilders well they've got genetics for it there's a bunch of things go into it you can take any two clients to put them on the same diet and like you're going to get highly variable results from individuals so back to his question then the main thing with low blood pressure is going to be your risk of passing out you know I have to look this up but as far as I know there's you know as long as your your blood pressure isn't a physiologically functional range I'm thinking speaking out not as a as a doctor but as a physiologist so I'm sure physiologically functional range then meaning you don't like like I had a I had no friend years ago who used to have low blood pressure she'd have she'd have low blood sugar too but everything was kind of low and probably because she'd like work all the on the non-drink anything especially get dehydrated because she didn't want to go and peek because she was so busy you know yeah yeah yeah yeah the situation she's like she I think she's working at one point behind a desk and she literally was only customer service person there yeah so she literally should as my as my mentor Dr Dudley would say it sometimes I want passing the hall you know we're both kicking asses doing this thing and I'm doing my thing and I'm like I said what's happening doc he's like to busy to take a shit I love it because he says it to mehrewent you know and sometimes there'd be like you know students walk by her on tour you know and they'd be like I'd say what's all right and that's what I said I said hard Dr Dudley and he said I said that's Dr Dudley he could be my teacher and you could see some of the students be like like oh fuck yeah I'm going here I like these people yeah some of the parents were like we're paying for this yeah I think that's in state tuition you know anyway um so as far as low blood pressure goes you know that's that's probably you know my blood pressure tends to does it tends to run like yeah like a hundred over sixty okay um you know something like that like actually even it's even it was like 80 or I'm once I took it and I was this was when I was probably at least 242 50 yeah and I was measuring my own blood pressure which I'd done for years but I was preparing for a lab exercise this lab measure my own blood pressure while is writing an exercise bike at rest and and I kept on measuring it and I'm like the damn cuff is broken just the right size this is the big cuff I need this cuff and my blood pressure was like seven over 45 oh really crap wow and I was I wasn't like you know feeling like a film a woozy or dizzy or anything like that so he's probably probably okay but check with his doctor that's he mentioned a sea Atlas um and like my anger one of the things you know with biagro why is it actually you know causes that's one of the side effects particular is low blood pressure people like you know starting to faint that sort of thing yeah um during I mean the only I can think of other sort of throw out is that if you I haven't seen this as far as resistance exercise goes but there are data showing the overall being exercise training doing endurance training reduces your risk of cardiovascular obviously you know most of the risk comes from just getting out of the couch potato category you know and just being you know recreationally active and not being somewhat of just you know Netflix and chill with you know take out or whatever of time yeah but once you want your exercise that's a stress on your cardiovascular system and there is an increased risk of I saw that's depicted once in a years ago in a in a paper and like the drop the day the risk let's say the risk is cutting half on average you know for someone who's cardiovascular who's endurance exercise you know runner so they might have it's on on average show 24 per year they might have they might average at like 40 or 45 percent the risk except when they exercise the risk goes up you know to above the average and then it drops back down with the overall 24 hour average is less okay so that's good if you do if you do like leg press and do a valve they've measured blood pressure like blood pressure it's like 400 over 200 holy shit at the femoral artery yeah which is not typically where you measured but it's you know it's represented what you get to break the artery relative of speaking so yeah you get super high blood pressure so there's a risk you know of a of a cardiovascular incident you know by him by exercise training so he's taken a sea out of to bring it down I don't know you know I have to see like mechanistically I don't you that may bring his blood pressure down like some degree during those lower blood pressure points during his workout like between his sets but during this all out go for broke set you know like a deadlift or a bavarore and that's what you're doing about solid if you're breathing it it helps substantially but he made that the sea out of this may not be doing anything in that regard you know during those times haven't seen that study directly because because it's sort of like um and it's analogous to you know taking in carbohydrates this isn't this isn't this is a whole story to this but you can take in carbohydrates while you're exercising and and there's some data that suggests if you're doing endurance exercise you know it may slow the rate of glycogen use but if you're doing all out exercise like that's don't for broke you're just calling upon that glycogen because the glycogen is there doesn't matter how much glucose you have in the system they're just you're gonna use the glycogen at the same rate so if you're if you're doing like a leg press or a squat and you're you know and you're holding your breath and you're just going after it your blood pressure is going to be high maybe it's instead of 400 or 200 it's 390 over 185 or something like that but it's still sky high this sea out of this is probably made no difference potentially during those high risk moments of during the exercise section I don't know I'm guessing it probably is completely overridden by the fact that you've got all that weight on your back or you're moving all that weight around and you're holding your breath doing that that's how it's so he might if he tends to that'll sell you know he might be be best you know pay attention just to that as you're good breathing as far as bringing your your blood pressure down as opposed to you know taking a drug like like Seattle sir Viagra yeah he also he was using the blood pressure medication too yeah Thomas Harton yeah that's you know that's that's a strategy obviously that's Victor Black has made that very very very well known you can you can use ARB blockers as well I don't know if that's good you're any during the workout if that's one of the that's a side effect too of your blood pressure going too low on those so you have to look into that but as far as he's as far as he's being you know physiologically as long as he's in physiologically range and he's not not blacking you know talk to his or getting dizzy or what have you had haven't talked to his doctor about that okay I he did he didn't mention what he is on or off the tell the sergeant did he you know what he might have let me see he really quick because it was a long message I think he did no no oh wait he says usually he was 140 over 90 okay yeah blood pressure on cycle was he said yeah he said my blood pressure went on cycle doesn't get extremely high usually 140 over 90 and then he said I've convinced my doctor to put him on the medication to help hopefully reverse left ventricle hypertrophy that's that's what is overall goal is here he said to possibly not that to change so I think they made a good decision based on the blood pressure if he's got I he did he probably had an echocardiogram done so to to know I don't want to you mention that at all but so you know you look you guys look at his his ejection fraction from the echo you see there's any issues there you know that would be the kind of the the problem you're running into it's normal to get you've got an overload stress on the heart from training from your breath and just the fact that your blood pressure's going to go up it's totally normal to have some thickening of left ventricle from resistance training that's a normal adaptation to the deal depends on how much it it is and what you see with someone who's got a pathological thickening there is that they've had the chronic blood pressure elevation and they've got poor ejection fraction so you've got pathological functioning of the heart you can junction with the thickening as opposed to a positive adaptation that's just helping the means as hard as has adapted somewhat to the the high blood pressure stresses of the training and it's it's normal and so far as that goes you know that's far as I know there's nothing there's no adverse consequences to that normal amount but that's kind of the thing is like you need to look at the echo and echoes can end up being you can get different numbers you know there's different ways to estimate the ejection fraction based on the images and I can't remember the details there but that can give you different values I've had clients corresponded with people talk with John about this a good bit you know back when he had his heart attack and trying to figure out like we know what's going on because he had some and I can't remember the information but he had some times then when you know he's like what's going on you know with his ejection fraction and trying to tease that all out and he was like asymptomatic yeah I hope no issues whatsoever he was he was like he's like I've got clearance now everything was good things are getting better he's going into the gym and they just buried people you know even say it that was like yeah we trained man like I'm just going like he's just kicking ass yeah so yeah there's there's so many details there that I can't even like sure I can't even take much of a stab at without having you know an echo to look at and I can't interpret those things legal anyhow but yeah sounds like his doctors you know they're on a getting the one 40 is sort of the breakoff point you know the 140 over 140 over 90 like he sort of at the you know border line even beyond border line hypertension for he was and now he's back down to you know 110 over whatever he said so that's that's good to me I'd be happy with that personally what about Nick Wary's with us competitive eater Nick Wary one of the best in the world he's he was asking about our our jwana he said is that possibly a nice adjunct our juniors I know this supplement but he said I think that it's been shown to increase left ventricle ejection fraction yeah it's that's a himaly wellness um himaly herbal supplements go to one as heart care or our our juniors is in heart care um yeah I was actually funny enough because I have some in the other room and I was I thought about putting a post up I mentioned that to somebody came to ruin yeah it all kind of the consults and any all kind of blends together but that's a great that's it's in my book actually if you if you buy the um the PDF or the or you just go to the references in the back dig through them there you go yeah that's a great supplement if you it's kind they've got like multiple versions of their website but you can find the scientific documentation there it's it's a really good supplement yeah heart um kind of credit chain card of tone oh yeah one of the lot of people use for blood pressure that seems to work pretty well yeah it's been around for forever um so as far as our juniors has some effects on life approach teams too so it's a good it's a good great good supplement for heart remodeling um I've heard from Dante that you bickwin all or coins I'm cute 10 could be really beneficial um I started experimenting with it and I started running it at what I think it was kind of a higher dose because I've seen people using it like 100 to 200 milligrams up they say up to six for some things and I started about a month ago this experiment with 400 milligrams of ubiquitous and as far as like long COVID symptoms I feel like it's actually been helping me about a month and now like that and the injectable alcarnity or like the two I out of all the supplements I've been experimenting with this past year I feel like those two so far have been really helpful and then there's another um what is it he suggested it was a stronger form of uh curcumin stronger but it didn't super buy it I guess starts with an m oh um yeah but anyway I've got a conchining article yeah I've got it I've got that on order so that should be here in the next couple days I'm going to try to ramp that up to throw that into the mess with I get out of it yeah I just got a question um actually just an email question people find me all sorts of ways they said any questions and I have you know multiple corresponds is going to about co-cute 10 because it's a free because it's an antioxidant but it's also in the mitochondrial chain so um yeah has sort of multiple functions and the thing is with in your situations got um the thing I you know we talked about or one back and forth is that you know does this work like cysteine or vitamin E or vitamin C what's that is at Mariava that was it oh right yeah that's a name but yep um and yeah it has going to have free radical quenching um actions and you can run into that situation where you sort of limit your the stress that you're trying to vote with training by using co-cute 10 but it's all a matter of how much it's and what rate it's getting used up so you've got this situation you know if you're looking at like D-dimer and um you know things that are involved with inflammation and clotting and like the scenario with your long COVID like people are just untangling that we don't know what the house going on there necessarily yeah so yeah so you you may have an elevated need for quenching free radicals your antioxidant status maybe categorically different I think it is like just just to mean just as things that we've talked about like that you know the relative E's or difficulty which you go through your average day yeah is substantially higher than it was before this happened oh yeah you know so like all sorts of things and I don't know how much you shared on the podcast but it's just imagine someone yeah um because you ain't a complainer that's for sure but it's like imagine like if everything like also you got a hundred pound you know a weighted vest on you know and you have to run everywhere you know it's in the rock like you and you recognize that that's there you know it's like I'll kind of go to the grocery store like it's going to be like you're in your you know you're before like the the light at the end of the tunnel is the contest almost there you know like that three week out period we were totally dieted down which is not close enough to contest you're getting excited and like everything is just like monumental it's like I got to get up and go to the bathroom oh my god what if I want to do that's hard that's stressful yeah during the stressful so you may have a higher a higher need for something like co-cute 10 you know in your case especially because of it's it's it's rolls in an energy transfer and the heart is a heart is just such an energy badass it goes all the time it's constantly active you know it took until the end you know and it's it is an oxidative machine if it take whatever you feed it they they do like one way that's the hardest study it is um with an isolated heart model where they they take the heart out like a rat you can use different animals to rat us what I've seen done and they take the heart out and you can feed it like um an artificial blood basically and you can give it glucose you can get it lactate you can get free fatty acids get it ketones get it give it anything that's got a carbon chain limit and it will oxidize the shit with that motherfucker no it's just it's just it's like it's like military multi-fueled vehicle you know the one thing about like the pockets of the vehicle you could put you know chicken grease in there and motor oil and gasoline and diesel fire the it doesn't matter it just you poured in it will use it you know it's kind of the heart is so your heart even despite the fact of the hearts you know amazing like heart your heart is part of what's going up what you are trying to evaluate and get up to speed here with your scenario so it makes your heart's getting more stressed than the average person yeah and just by nature like the one of the primary sources of free radicals is super oxide radical so if you look at the energy chain you look on transport chain and um ATP production oxidated phosphorylation and muscle cells you've got electrons that are being moved around this electron transport chain you have oxygen that's being used up and you've got watered being produced and there's about like on average I think it's like a three to five percent kind of air rate and that you get some sort of get sort of like a packing air you know like Amazon's pretty good they don't even have that much of a rate but everyone's small you just get the wrong thing you know it gets missed deliver what have you that happens with in the mitochondria and you get an electron loaded onto an oxygen and you get a free radical that needs to be quent so literally exercise this is one of the ways in which exercise is increases free radical stress and stimulates the need for in this case thinking particularly about a mitochondrial biogenesis is that you need that stress comes from this air in oxidative phosphorylation you make free radicals the system is ah shit we need this is a stimulus for having more mitochondria because obviously we're going to be making more free radicals that means we're making more energy at a faster rate when you bore mitochondria you also upregulate enzymes like catalyst and superoxide disemutase and glutathione peroxidase all the enzymes that are involved with with free radical quentions your your body adapts but you're also using up the endogenous free radical quentching molecules that you can't produce things like vitamin E and vitamin C vitamins you know in co-cutin is right along in there as a as a as a has multiple functions but right in there as a free radical quentcher so you there's just no doubt my mind or how much but you or someone who can certainly benefit from having you have a higher need I believe for antioxidants in your diet or coming in some way shape or form so it doesn't surprise me whatsoever given the way all your sort of past converge to energy production and stress free radical production that the co-cutin would be helpful for you without it out that makes total sense man and that's kind of what Victoria was thinking too that's exactly yeah yeah yeah she was thinking as well and that both of those things would help the coins i'm cutin and BL carnitine they'd both be a benefit mm-hmm yeah anyway we have anything else here in our our list Scott you had mentioned YouTube factoids but I wasn't sure if we're going back yeah no it's just kind of a simple a simple thought so sometimes you know YouTube is it's a it's a free for all a comment wise of course and we get lots of awesome comments and questions and but sometimes people say oh this is the answer to this question that she didn't even answer for what have you and I don't want to know like personally I like to know where that information comes from so that's someone I've seen this extra couple times and it happened on one of the videos I was digging around some old videos looking for questions for today and I saw a couple times where people said oh well this is why okay but I have no idea where you found that because I haven't found that and I've looked so if you have a scientific factoid yeah you know this is does this I would love to know where people found that just so I can dig into it and like it because in in my quote unquote line of work you got a backup as Dudley would say you know show me the data yeah you know if you're going to say that this does that or this is metabolizing to that or we know that this you know this happens when you do this and it's a very you know science it's not like well I have found this to be the case it's like this this is a biochemical process well there's going to be some science somewhere that came from absolutely no and if you if you just say you know I've always heard that this is the case like okay that's cool because that like that's totally but if you say it black and white if you have the the data if you have a paper back it up it doesn't hardly ever happen and in the science world actually as I've mentioned many times before if you don't cite things cite information they can be considered an academic integrity violation oh not to properly yeah literally it's it's not the same but it's a long line to plagiarism vision you're making you know unsubstantiated statement you just need to say like give a source you it's okay to make an air like oh I thought it was in that paper or that paper like the paper could be fraught with errors you know with the least you're saying you know we know that when you do this this happens and you if you back it up with the paper that was just awful that's you know full holes and really doesn't very well substantiate what you're saying and at least you said you know this is what you know this is the source of this information yeah if you have no source like okay well I'm not kind of like try to track that down because I've looked and I haven't found that so I just loved to know so that's just a request to a viewer and everybody you know but YouTube seems like that's that's a kind of a common common theme yeah yeah I don't know I've got one more here Scott this is from our live feed here and he also said it's kind of long so if we want to skip it I get it he said from Anthony he says I am simplifying a lot here so please help me out NAC allows the introduction of 16 in the neuron thus producing glutathione this happens in all body cells but I will focus on the neuron so far so good while 16 enters the neuron so glutamine glutamate also exits it and tithers to the m glue GLU to not sure of the name a receptor specific to glutamate that is uniquely an inhibitor receptor having activated the m GLU to now the glutamate is unable to reach the adjacent what's that word there synthetic synthetic synthetic space synaptic space okay and ultimately excite the neuron cells as a cascade of non excitement this should be extremely relaxing and allowing for beneficial sleep in my correct can you can you kind of go over what he's saying here because I'm not sure I'm trying to read it and understand it at the same time so I don't feel like I'm doing a good job here yeah I mean I have to see where he's this is this would be actually a great example of where he just is information because he's not sure the name of this receptor okay so so he's just sort of remembering this so basically he's asking about if entity will system provides a source of system that has an effect in the brain the glutamate receptor that would lead to someone being more relaxed to be able to fall asleep again so the thing that's so interesting about brain research that I found is that it's almost we're still we're still sort of in the dark ages a little bit in terms of looking at neurotransmitters and things that bind to receptors because so often people are not paying attention what areas the brain that takes part in so it's kind of like it's kind of like I'm going to take it's looking whole body for what he's in this versus the muscle protein synthesis or looking at you know we see this effect in bone so it must happen in muscle this way or it happens to skin you know like you've got different structures in the brain that are responsible for the extent to which you're awake you know your emotions like the all the various structures the limbic system for instance so it's going to depend on you know where where in the brain these effects are happening I don't know about that particular receptor what he's referring to to be honest like that's I have to go let's see he posted something else here let me see he says insure any c is a relaxer slash sleep promoter via this mechanism of anti-excitement of neurons haha I know that I might have made a massive explaining that no no I totally got that yeah it makes sense no I I understood this question so I'm but I'm he just reported to help me because I didn't get it yeah I got you got you got you okay so yeah it's it's a good question so here's this that's sort of my take on like the science and like how come well can we take that mechanism of binding the receptor and extrapolate that to basically the conscious level of perception you got to know where it's happening so can we take an effect on skin cells and extrapolate that to muscle cells not necessarily I see but you can you take that effect on receptor at the receptor level and extrapolate that to brain function not necessarily I don't know where he's pulling that information from because I don't even I don't know what you know about that mechanism for which receptor exactly he's talking about per se there's so many receptors there's finally receptors in the brain for neurotransmitters and find who things are transmit neurotransmitters they didn't know they were all the time it's like it's more the more we find out we know the more we find that we don't know which is just beautiful but here's here's the bottom line whether there's one thought before I get to that you know and a single cysteine like it's a is an antioxidant it does there are some studies showing it has has those negative effects if you take large doses on muscle growth the way that way around that potentially is timing so if you train in the morning you set in motion on those molecular signals for the muscle growth you initiate it all everything you might be able to take something like this at night and not have an issue yeah it's got like a 10 or 12 hour half life or something like that I mentioned in my book I note the value there so maybe it's six to eight anywhere it's not it doesn't you don't take a dose of anosylisistine it's not hanging around for days or weeks so there's some times that you could do to get around a mega dosing effect but the other proof of this in the pudding is this will make you feel tired really do you need to know necessarily that it's going to do that because it's actually can you get anosylisistine they could that was taken off the market because no it was never take up the pudding no yeah no never take it off the market it not yet at least the FDA is making a push to take it off the market and make it a profit you know only and so because Amazon wants to be politically correct and wants to be good so the government and be a little bit it took it off of Amazon but you can still get any see everywhere okay okay I didn't know not an Amazon but just not on Amazon you know this is my best guys all right keep on yeah the show out of it as an American you should you should let's see we get this one taken down let's just all people I know someone who works for Amazon anyway give them the finger for me about any okay well yeah I'll tell her in German to go screw herself yeah there's some really funny ways to say kiss my butt in German yeah can you name one of them right now yeah it kind of twitch so I can can speak about sports and scrub for me I'm off that what do you said you mean you can kiss my ass crossways and by making a spiral you look my butt so it's kind of like that too it's pretty it's very visual so but you know not saying you're like you know by a bottle of you know or like a big packet of an AC powder and like down it and see if it knocks you out yeah but we could take the dose you know try it I don't know there's variability as a extra weather having taking with food or with food increases absorption or bioavailability so you know he might try try taking it like a night when he's you know hasn't eaten for a while or in the mornings when he's not going to train where he might have a nap you know it's Sunday you can take an apple on a Sunday don't miss the podcast of course but could do it that way and test it out and see if it has an effect you know on on on a sleep you know not potentially you know bad thing if you're going to take you know something like that not a bad time to take if you train early you take it away from your training and helps you sleep the help should through through recovery you know sounds like could be a pretty good deal but I don't know it's not but I know I don't know of anyone who's said you know I love to take the AC to the system but it makes me tired yeah yeah I've never heard that and I think you're getting to a I think an interesting point here that you you you've you've find things out just simply by just by experience and and that people would say across the board like like you could take like p5p on the other hand and be like hey I find that it it helps me with rest whether you realize it or not it's like you know you can start drawing those conclusions just by taking it if that makes yeah I don't know yeah yeah no you like literally you know that's you know there's so many things to me there could even be biological to the visuality there you know some people like a dash of hydramy benadrill yeah you know that's a lot of people real the amount of one though I know people you know it doesn't take making they take it because for the allergies and I like to just plug them like I would be able to do I mean I wish it would be better but I should be long and bed asleep because that's not made to some tired so yeah so that that's that's something to consider you can go and look and see find those papers that they haven't been retracted or would have you on they should report side effects hopefully and you can see if some moments or fatigue is a side effect of dosing that because I don't know what those as they used and any of that research but that would be way to look and see if someone else has reported that because I haven't heard of that before but I like you digging in like way he did that's very very cool you can see you get so deep in the rabbit hole you're looking for it's like it's like it's almost like you like you go to your electrical panel you start checking your breakers and like you call the electrical company it's like come by lightning come on like did you try and switch it's like oh yeah that's fine it's just taking you out you know because what the research is saying that's a solution on a danger yourself yeah you know just try it out well with that said we should get out of here scouting know you it's Mother's Day as we record this you've got some stuff to do you got plans for the day I'm going for this for the day too so yeah in any mothers out there happy Mother's Day to you thanks for watching yeah Victoria's a dog mom so happy dog mom I will I will pass that message on to her guys go to be white OBB coach dot com you can find Scott's book over there you get the hardcover go over to don't go to Amazon go to you can go to Barnes and Noble it's there too isn't it yes Barnes and Noble yep and you'll see a Amazon today you'll see a picture of this amazing dog trying to get my finger there rusty you're seeing the picture you're seeing up he's there when that front someone asked you know if that was my if that was my Tinder picture I saw that I saw that I'm like no Tinder's the only dating site I have not tried there's my boy yes there he is because that's that's not what I'm not at all what I'm looking for but I may have used that picture on a dating site who knows I've tried the wall strike strike strike well with that said to go to trunutrition dot com you can use our code think which somebody mentioned in here yeah you can get E a's from trunutrition they've got a couple different things they've got like the flavor D a a's or you can get like I go the just raw bulk method which you got to understand they don't taste good E a's are not easy to flavor but you can flavor them yourself with some crystal light I find that works out just fine and you can you want to mix it real thin anyway a lot of water a lot of water was you would use some ties to the right yeah yeah they do yeah that works by the mix is better yeah I think that yeah they have the instant ties and then they also have like a like a product E a plus it's called and it has like a really good mango flavor so you can go that right if you want and of course go do supplement source dot c a in Canada where you could buy an a c or e a c you get whatever you want over there it's Canada land of the free kind of and effort and yeah there you go all right guys we'll see you soon thanks got

Well, what do you think monsters do? They do monsters think they do monsters there Eddie cone oh my goodness the goat Can we get Eddie to join us can we get Eddie to join us for five minutes? All right, so we want to sit down It's gonna You know like in a camera the goat for Eddie the goat Hey, tell his wife come have a seat. You're welcome to get Not a guy she doesn't want everyone to know that she's married me You got five minutes go play the field out there It's not my Amazing Eddie cone. What's your guys? It's great to have you man. It's been good to see I've seen you like three or four times as we kids So far haven't fun wandering about aimlessly are you are you yet that stage where you like why the hell am I still here? Only when it gets crowded on Saturday right the rest of the time it's fun because you're around all these cool people Right anyone that would really know me knows about powerlifting and isn't a fucking idiot Yeah, who do you still like you run into your old competitors and guys are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I love some of the old school My people are still yeah some good conversations with Sean Sean Ray, yeah, and Johnny Jackson Oh, yeah, it's great. It's great. Yeah, we went through all the same stuff Right the real real hardcore dirty ass gyms and just training your fucking asshole off and the stuff we did Enabled everyone else to learn off us right. Yeah. Yeah. No, no I know a lot of ballia because I I read your Wikipedia which is all fast But when was your last meet? 2007 2007 and is it is it did you set technically you set up? 170 world records they say 71 but there's so many records that I rebroke my own I really didn't give a crap about it. Yeah, I just was out there for me Yeah, right as long as I could get better I kept getting better and that was it That's all I cared about yeah warm and up with the The final lifts of some of your the competitors in the class ahead of you back in those notes my last warmups were higher than their lifts Yeah I remember that's a legendary story as he was doing warmups in the back Yeah, with him he had to go out to the platform to finish his to do his last warmup because they have enough weight loaded in the back Yeah, that's true. I think my last warmup was like 892 and I walked out there without my shoes tied or anything like that just did you just did your rep And then what does that do you imagine that I come out to do mine? I asked him to take a hundred off. Yeah, so I could jump in and do my my hopeful Green light squat now power lifting nowadays deep. It's pretty I mean it's grown yes immensely incredibly all over the world all over the world and the women coming into it Like back when you were power lifting how many chicks were in the gym chalk and early as many the first time I went to Australia To do some seminars they had their nationals over there and that was the first time I saw women's only day and it was packed And they all got a long fine in a lot of the women trained a lot of power lifting stuff because they liked the way it makes To a place and but them right yeah, and then they start competing a little bit and it's all the fun for them That's all I know it gets you know a girl's day Yeah, shit. I know it seems like I mean with Instagram now like do you do you sometimes scroll through Instagram and you're like How are what is power lifting become? As long as judging is okay. Yeah, I love all of it. Yeah, because you're you're like The cement floor that all of this has been built on and there was great guys that came before me I mean I first I I told you the story of when I first met Arnold because I tried to do body Well, I came up to his chest. I was like shit. Yeah, I'm gonna try to be Franco right and then Franco with the strength stuff that he liked I tried to grab a tweet straight where's that and I saw Kaz lift on TV. Yeah, I was like wait a second You could be that big that strong and not have to die it and pose on stage I'm gonna try to do that like the hardest part was for me was probably trying to get a tan Yeah, but in that what right when I started power lifting I just freaking loved it I was like a doctor what I knew that was my stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely how long how long did it take before everyone else? Like what was it very first jam you started power lifting in like here what you call years or It's old Chicago health club that ended up turning in the ballies And then from there I went to a garage gym with some people remember the movie Rudy. Yes I and his brothers garage out in Julia Yeah, and then I went to Pods gym Yeah, that's what I'm known for mostly quads and now I left that a little gym called lances and just in this Right down the street from where Chicago lights I explained in the basement like when Rocky went back to Russia Yeah, like like remember the old you have been to Metro Flex gym over there. Oh, yeah, so you know You bump into something you need a tightness shot What what at what age and what point I mean? I know it was really early, but when did the other lifters around you just go oh Shit your different your different well my first meet was in 1980 when I was 16 I was a very light 165er and Four years later in 84 when my first World Championship said one 81 really four years. Yeah, that's insane So I'm pretty fast How many guys like back in the day when you went to the world so many guys were there? We all they're from the other countries. There's tons of lifters right a lot of countries They don't have all the sports saturation that we have in the US right so choices of what they do So a lot of them a lot of their countries the government backs all the sports even power If you can a little bit left or power left or something yes, yes, so they all whoever's not gonna lip-aclifting We'll probably do power lifting right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. You're not gonna go to your official Olympics Well, it's like the craziest country that you went to lift in like just the most unique experience Russia Russia back in the way you pack did you 3000 seed auditorium in 40 minutes now really be sold out So really what year would that have been like you went to Russia or was it still Soviet? It was still Soviet still Soviet. Yeah, that's not Russia. Yeah, that's old school us us our US It's all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was very very cool But that first meet they ever had that I competed in they had a lip-aclifting bars and plates Yeah, so on the way down you're shaking like a leaf praying to God that nothing happens I made so many deals with God that day that just for me to be alive. I'm part priest right now How are the guys there? I mean, were there anybody you could communicate with them? Yeah, sure they speak English Yeah, and they had people that did speak English. Okay. Yeah, okay, and how are like the competitors there that you talk? They're all great. Yeah, everyone's great They're always nice, but you know the Russians will find a way To beat you to people with records, you know hook or crook They will find a way to be on top That's a very wise. Yeah, they probably say the same thing about us Yeah When you say find a way you mean they're blasting music outside your hotel rooms. You can't get it pretty much Yeah, yeah For their you know the old trick. I think I think I think there's some famous hockey players that used to send like Pukers to the other teams rooms and stuff like that Whatever it is still lost It's still lost Yeah, whatever it takes or the other guys lost with a smile. Yeah When did people start calling you the goat? I don't even know do you remember the first time you heard it? That was 85 the year 85 was a second world's yeah And I went from 181 to 198 to 220 yeah the only time I moved up was weighed with when I got to lean Right, and then it didn't it felt dangerous Okay, yeah, because like remember a John Fowl Paul Fuchs Yeah, he was getting ready for a contest. That's the right idea He was still too lean. Yep. Yeah You could I remember that shit and I was like no way when I when it felt dangerous I just went up a way class. Yeah, so you would get to point you out of nothing muscle that you had to go up You have some back and go with that. I tried to get fat. I just couldn't eat enough I could never eat enough that's insane Do you feel like any of the new guys are feeling more inspired? Just to kind of take people back for a minute We talked when we had you on the show about how you did a lot of bodybuilding exercise Is a new try to train like every muscle with the back So you were doing bent over rows and bodybuilding exercise Yeah, and you basically looked like a cross between a power lifter and a bodybuilder and maybe a little WWEWF mixed in there That's especially with the craziness, you know, you feel like there's been any type of like a Resurgence of going more for the look that you had besides just to see it wasn't The reason I did the power bodybuilding stuff was because I didn't want to have a week this anywhere Yeah, no matter what exercise it was I did not want it to be weak, right? So I figured if I got everything strong all around I'm gonna have a bigger platform to lift off of the pace Right the problem now a lot of guys do so much only squat pinched at lift that they forget the fact that there's gonna be weaknesses Oh, yeah, like all of us have to say a different strength and weakness is here in here Right, but if all you do is squat pinch and deadlift in your strength go up this high that big gap in between We've got to show it up. It's gonna show up in a snap crackle pop and your body or you won't Make any progress anymore and you'll be fed up with it and you'll say all this routines socks and all this stuff when you sock because you didn't do what you're supposed to Right bring up all you wait So that was my off season high bar closed stance squats because I was strong my hips and back So it was all quad stuff deficit deadless, benching with my feet up in the air everything that I could do harder that would transfer over I did right I would I would like train like a squat or a high bar squat a deadlift a deficit that lift a bent row stiff like deadless shoulder presses Dips in clients close grips all the same way that I trained getting ready for a contest all the way down the triples No kidding. Yes, I have a triple on a dip. Yeah, so all my I got strong is hell on while you're doing so there's no weakness anywhere Why no I describe it like you know you see the guys over there with the suits to armor Yeah, yeah, so wherever you hit there's a chunk of strength and muscle right so you're gonna last longer What I love that you were obviously the first one to think that all the way through to did anyone Start asking you like why are you wasting your time with this or now or in reverse say why am I not doing this? What should I do if they did I didn't pay attention to them? Right I was in my own world I just wanted to get better so as long as I could get better I kept going right I just got better a whole bunch of different times for a long time Yeah, that's what the guys don't realize that every time you get that every single exercise a little bit stronger You'll be building a building a bigger base to build a pond right and that's what they don't understand You take your time. Yeah Like you're not gonna be the greatest bodybuilder in the world if you don't take your time If if all's it was taking a whole bunch of drugs and pumping all the time everyone would be mr Olympia all the time right it's not that you got to put in the time in the effort and a lot of people don't take the time to do that anymore Yeah, it's a race. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want I'm thinking Ron Remember we did that that reaction video to Tom Haveland. Oh, imagine he's awesome. Yeah, that's what we had to go down with us. What do you think of that guy? He's amazing Josh Bryan helps him. Yes, and I helped Josh Bryan since he was like 15 years old Okay, he's the call me he stole my number from a friend of his friend of mine His dad and started calling me when he's 15 years old He's a good student and he's taken a lot farther even than I did wow, but he's he's great And he does a great job with Tom Tom just a freak how leany is it still benches like 650 and yeah It was a crazy shit with what I heard is it appears to the cow all the time It's a lot of rush. Yeah, yeah, yeah crazy, you know, but he's a super nice humble guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah What when you come to the Arnold now? I mean how many of these have you come to? I think I missed two years in a row and I missed the very first one every other one I bet but other not like 30 years. Yeah, I know kid You look I get to see you guys. I get to see all kinds of cool people. Yeah. That's my choice to see Yeah, right and I decide where I go and who I hang out with so it's always fun the people that'll come up with me Our guys that are like all tattooed up Have piercings and look like the ruts your refugees as society those are the guys that I love and I trust more than You know what I mean You know what I mean they're not like all made up and show and all that other stuff. They're just real people Yeah, I like that. Yeah, what do you think you're watching that you know He saw Thor pull a thousand sixty on that like play. Look at nothing Like nothing but that was the second attempt. You didn't have to take a third that was like I told him I go they could have added fifty or hundred pounds. Oh, yeah, well, what do you think monsters do they do monsters think It wants just there. I mean what do you expect? I told like you got to watch it moved I was like Look at it was four o'clock. Yeah, I was really easy like a thousand six or something Yeah, yeah, what's your favorite thing to watch here? Do you like you know the strong man that someone's dead I got the mic running to straw man. I like it all if I can be close I'm not gonna sit way back in the crowd and right me the concert No, yeah, yeah, I don't want to do that and my favorite thing was just to walk around and mingle Yeah, and get grabbed when you're walking by and there's a road chair Better than they get to sit down There you go with with all the with all the ladies all the all the ladies powerlifting There's no ladies that like me maybe women but no lady okay I'm just gonna say does the there's a wife ever have a laugh if like a young girl wants a photo with you Oh my god, she has fun. She'll take the picture. Yeah. Yeah, she'll rip on me and make jokes about me to the girl That's amazing I see oh my god your hands are big my wife would say yeah, and we're not everywhere Yeah, she has a good raise great she doesn't let you get she she competed for Norway on the national team when she was like 16 years old Oh, no way what she holds over my head is she went in her first powerlifting meet six months before I did Wow, oh she got you forever So she says while when you've been lifting as long as I have yes Then you learn things that you learn some things. Yes. That's amazing So she's been with you through all this yeah, and you know she tried to sort of travel around with a bunch of guys And national team and see and how guys are idiots So there's not like to get over on her either. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just worse from the same era She knows everything about all the old body builders and even like old little poems that were muscle and fitness and all the nick names of all the body There's and yeah, that's pretty awesome. Yeah, hey Ron one other thing if you were I know you were talking about stem cells a while ago If you were still considering that you should definitely talk to Ed as me because he's a guy I thought it was a lot about it. I first went to Columbia and added them yeah, then I went to the doctor a deal con That's very popular now. Yeah, is that you by Dubai and Low's cobbles Mexico. I went to Low's cobbles last year. I was okay, and he did see bum. Yep, and I actually talked to see bum and I talked to Who's the other bodybuilder from Canada over there? Oh? Yeah, or Ben Arab Arabish. Oh, what yeah, I thought I talked to him too and They both been having a lot of good things happen Right, so when did you go twice? I went to Low's cobbles four years ago and I went or no last year And I went to Columbia three years before that. What did you notice? Yeah Clarity of thought first. I need that dude You get a IV of 200 million stem cells you wake up the next morning and you swear to God you're the smartest man alive You can hear a pin drop there all gray matters gone It's like that's a holy crap your clarity of thought is out of the squirrel and how long does that last? Still to this day. He's a genius. It's grown your way better for a We have no idea way better forever and like those you know the Meshcomolar, whatever is I always say yeah, yeah, yeah, those those are good for like an IV or in the joint Yeah, and then for like soft tissue injuries the doctor con caught me a fat stem cells are really good for soft tissue injuries Okay, and then I had which is really cool. I had what they call implant placenta in each side of my abs There was an implant that dissolves over time right and then I had a big huge monster Fala stat and shot stuck in my cell What do you get the smallest that but that's to be seen yeah, yeah, I think it's more like you know I don't know how good it is or You or they have to up the dose if you weigh a certain much okay Yeah, for a regular person, I think that's the proper dose Okay, for a trained athlete that already has muscle. I think they they have to go a little bit higher Yeah, but it's getting better and better this doctor con He goes everywhere in the world learning where the best the harvest the best stem cells like a friend of mine So I'm in Dubai last year a friend of mine from Australia and Dr. Con said no don't do it now do it next year. We're coming out with a new new Generation stem cell that's gonna even be even better. No kidding So then I know the guy is like not money hungry. He's out to really Sure people yeah, no he's like genius Because you don't like it's West when he was at Swiss yeah Eric Serano yeah Serano got up there to the mic and started trying to read off his phone trying to Let's see what this guy knew and Dr. Con was incredible right on top of these two He's young. Yes, he is yeah, well, you know a couple years ago at the Swiss Can canacan you know Dr. Ken Ken was supposed to come by he was he really he texted me He was with Eric and I but I told him it was busy. Eric still talking they didn't want to come He can't understand Eric anyway But Dr. Ken told me how intelligent Dr. Con was yeah, so me and some of my buddies went out to Los Cabos last year Hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get some joints done. Yeah, I got in in my shoulder joint A big huge shot and in both shoulders and then three little injections all around it With the fat themselves the difference themselves all right. Yeah, and now I think they're pretty much healed now. I work on the dysfunction because they were so dysfunctional for so long That even though you're healed your body doesn't know how to work properly Yeah, so now I've been working with Dr. Andrew Lock. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's Swiss and he's one of the best guys. There is When you say function like you had no rotation or no, it's like Terasure arm when you're injured your body will fail to find a way around that right it up Yeah, you create a new pattern that's wrong right, but you have to teach your body how to get that right pattern back and use the muscles in a way that you're supposed to again Or you'll redeem it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'll never feel good again Yeah, you can't feel it right. That's why well get that page on crank Scott, we gotta go to see the best themselves We gotta get round some stem cells. We gotta do it's just bodybuilding goes to lost cabos for just five dollars a month You can save Ron Bring cat under this get that page your little white boy.

So at least a couple of times a month, you'll get to see stuff early over on Patreon. Thank you guys for all your support. Guys, we're going to talk about, we're going all the way back to basics today, carps cycling. It's kind of a really, I think, a no-brainer. When you're coaching 12 plus hours a day, carps cycling is just part of the vocabulary. But let's take it all the way back and talk about it. What would be a good way to break into this, skip? Or answer. Well, I'm not skip, but I can, I can certainly go. I'm not going. But I think every single diet, whether it's a contest diet and obviously the diet has a component of carps cycling in it. The second question is the rare. Unless you're just the rare person that eats the same five or six meals to a tea every single day, which I don't think that's a very, very way to do it honestly. Because I think there's a lot of magic happening with cycling your calories in general, in terms of your metabolism and effects on left in and other secondary messengers. But, you know, carps cycling, I think what we're talking about mainly is in a dieting sense where you might psychopogram in some lower days, lower carbohydrate days, and then follow it with a certain number of high carb days. And how you set that up, there's no, none of us as coach, as coaches could say, this is the carps cycling need to plan. What happens is your coach starts you with something. Something that makes sense, right? And then they read and react in monitor and make changes. So for instance, I might start somebody on a three-low one-high. So let's just say, you know, a 200 pound body builder, they're deep in their diet, we switch to a carps cycle, and we're doing say 3, 200 gram days, and then on that fourth day, they're going to bump it up to 400 grams of carbs. And then we start the cycle over again. And as a coach, my job is to monitor and see, okay, A, or we lose in body fat, and as a scale going down, B, are they getting flatter by that third or fourth day, eliciting the need for a higher calorie refeed date, that that high day, or do I need to make some changes? Do I need to go to say four low days in one high day? Do I need to do something like three low days and two high days? Do I need to drop them all the way to like 10 low days, and then just one super high, super compensation refeed day. Probably similar to like an old fashioned skip load, right? So I think there's a million different ways you can cut it, but basically it's exactly what it sounds like. You're cycling, your carpahydrates, and thus cycling, your calories. And that pretty much, I mean, we can go on in the next time. All right, next question. Yeah, exactly. No, it's actually a really good overview, because I completely agree with you. If you had, you know, 20 trainers, good trainers in a room, and you had them lay out what they might start a client with, or a carp cycle. You're probably going to have 20 different approaches that are exactly the same, almost certainly. And one of the things that is different with my cycling, or my dieting is because I skip load typically on a weekly basis with my clients and myself. So as an example, the first couple days after a skip load, those are going to be in not all the time, but usually can be lower carb days, because you're riding off of the carbs that were stored from the skip load, of course. So, and there are a couple things that I might do a little bit different than someone else in the sense that a couple things that stand out are, I do like to have higher carb days or higher carb intake on non-training days when either myself or my client may be training earlier in the day, the following day. Because, and Andrew, you know this, because we've talked about this quite a bit, I'm not as big on carbs coming into a workout, like a pre-workout to me, or pre-workout meal doesn't necessarily have to be all man have to make sure I have carbs. And I rely more on the stored glycogen versus circulating blood sugar levels. So, and there are a lot of variables. So, if any of my clients are listening, oh gosh, you doesn't do that to me. There are other clients who are listening, going, oh yeah, because that was me. So, there is that individual component, and there's a lot of variables that go into, as you said, Andrew, whether that's going to be, you know, 3-low, 1-high, 5-low, 1-high, a skip-load that is considerably higher. And whether that skip-load is clean, whether it's more, you know, polky-bo-high-rise, you know, type of a load or if it's, you know, 5 guys, because you're depleted me further into, we had Nick on the last show, talking about the sometimes when he loads, he'll go, or when he does high-card days, if he's not filling out from that, then he may end up with a, you know, burger and fries or something like that to help to compensate, to be able to get more calories and more cards into. So, there's a merit of different ways to do it. We should probably give an example. I mean, you gave some examples of, you know, 3-4-low, and then a high. But what are you doing? Are you keeping Andrew? Are you keeping the same? Food sources, but then just increasing on that one day. So, maybe if you know, rice may be the predominant carb, then you're just increasing those carbs with rice, then on the higher carb, right? Yeah, that's a really good question. So, yeah, typically like, and this is how I start out when a car comes like, I typically do like a 3-low, 1-high, right? And literally what I will do is just do more of the same foods they're eating on that high day. So, this is where it gets variable because when you have a new person, right, or a less experienced athlete, you kind of have to spell it out a little bit more. And as Skip has taught me, sometimes you literally need to explain every little detail, because sometimes I just say, add in 200 grams of carbs that day, and they might read that as 200 extra grams of rice. How dark? In that case, they've only really added, well, well, we'll say, that's where I'm getting the option, because I do find that with more experience athletes, or even as you get deeper into the prep, I might say, okay, add in a 500 grams carb day today. And they might say, well, do I need to stick with all my rice or my creamer rice, and I'll say something like, you can pick and choose the carbs you do, but just be mindful of what you think I would tell you to do. Meaning, you can't go to five guys and eat fries for your carbs. But if you want to incorporate, yeah, you want to incorporate some English muffins or rice cakes or a little bit of fruit or some jelly on the rice cakes, or some of these other foods that you haven't had that are still, you know, within the confines of just carbohydrates, right? But what I feel like it gives the athlete a little bit of freedom and a little bit of, um, a little bit of mental relief in picking some of their own foods. Now, keep in mind, there are some people that are like, nope, I want you to write it exactly what you want me to eat and I'll eat that to a tea. But I do find that about 75, 80% of athletes, they do enjoy, and I feel like they get a mental boost, just with that little decision making, of what carbs are adding, even if they're sticking to extra rice or cream of rice, they're getting the pick where they want to put them. And I think that's an important component as you get into the prep because where I might want to put my carbs when I'm having a higher carb day might be very different than when someone else's appetite tells them what they want their carbs. So I do think adding a little bit of that variability, letting the athlete choose is helpful, almost in the same sense that a free meal gives, you know, it's not as, it's a morale, it's a morale boost, yeah, exactly. And okay, you know, so I had some, some factory waffles or I had some, you know, English muffins or I had some toast instead of just all rice. Just that little bit of mental boost might give them everything they need mentally, energy-wise to get through the next hard week of dieting. I've got an idea, I'd like to throw out there, and this is, let's say this is an example for somebody that I might work with, let's say they're a gen pop person. And I'm sure you guys rented this too. I've worked a lot of guys who weren't following a fixed plan and they come to you and they're like, hey, listen, I want to buckle down. I want to start following a diet, I want to get in good shape. And a lot of times they can need a good amount of food to start out, right? Like if we just put them, you can take a guy that hasn't been following a fixed diet, you put them on a clean plan, right? We just got plenty of carbs, plenty of proteins, got some fats in there, and he's going to start making progress out the gate. And an example of what I might do for carb cycling is, let's say, let's say he's a whatever, to 18 to start. And we put him on this fixed plan and just through cleaning the diet up, the next week he's like, we'll say he drops seven pounds or something. We'll say he was two 18, now he's, you know, two eleven. We're like, holy crap man, you dropped a lot of water. He says, yeah, well, I was only eating fast food before this. And all of our minds were probably thinking, okay, we could probably ride this out for a little while. You know what I mean? And there's no there's no target in date. We just want to get in better shape. We could probably do this for a little while. And I'll keep riding that without doing a carb cycle for a period of time. And I might go one or two ways. If he starts to get to a point, let's say we get six weeks in and he's still losing fat. I might say to him, like, hey, listen, do you want to, we might address it maybe a month in. How do you feel? Do you want to cheat me? Because we're not on a time frame. We could probably add a cheat meal in. Let's say he doesn't want to, though. And we keep riding that out and eventually it stops. At that point, if he's feeling good, he's like, yeah, I'm not super hungry still. And but the weight isn't moving anymore. A way that I might carb cycle is taking that normal day and turning that into my high day. And now I might just reduce the carb a little bit and turn that into my low day. So let's just say he was eating a copper rice with every meal. Maybe we're going to go to like, even maybe it's even like three quarters of a copper rice with every meal or maybe we we removed a copper rice from the last two meals. And we say, okay, here's your low day. Let's follow this for two days and then go, or three days and then go back to that high day. You know, back to your normal day, like boom, now we've got a carb cycle, you know? And maybe he's making progress like that for a while and then that slows. And then we say, okay, well, let's go to three low days and then back to your normal day. You know, and eventually you get to that point where it starts evolving, you know, and you you might start needing more than just the normal day. Now we're like, okay, let's add more carbs than, you know, for that high day. I'm just trying to give an example of what that might look like for an average person that's just off the streets, never followed diet plan. I don't, I don't, let me ask you guys this, do you start somebody out on a carb cycle? If they weren't on any kind of a fixed diet and they come to you or you like, out the gate, we're doing a carb cycle or what do you generally just try? Like personally, I try to get a gauge on like what their baseline is going to be. You know what I mean? I'm creating non-treating day plan and going right here. I'm being another way. I might leave it. Yeah, right. That's something that we're saying. Like, yeah. Yeah. I might even leave it though. Like if, if in the case of this guy, I might even say, let's just leave that be another example. Let's say, train five days. I might say, okay, yeah, eat that same food even on your non-training days. Let's say he's still lost eight pounds or nine pounds at first week and I'm like, well, we didn't need to pull anything out. We're kind of saving those cards to play, you know, save the good cards for later. And then what he doesn't need to change is then maybe the next step could be that cycle of saying, hey, on your non-training days, let's reduce the carbs and now boom, it's, you know, a cycle of a sudden. Yeah. I'm on a good two direction. If someone lost the like seven or eight pounds in that first week, yeah, I would take that as, okay, we probably cleaned it up, crept on a fat side of their diet, especially if they're eating a lot of fast food. Yeah, seven eight pounds is pretty extreme. I don't know why, but yeah. Okay, but no, but in that example, what I would actually, what I would actually start doing is trying to go the other way with food and start building it up. Yeah, I would take that as an opportunity to install like maybe one high day like, you know, either on, let's just save or, you know, crepts and giggles, you know, on a leg day. All right, yeah, I had an extra 75 grams of carbs on this day or something to that effect and see if we still get the same response. Because I would love, I mean, I mean, we all would love to keep building the diet up versus pulling away. Yeah, still get me getting a weight and a fat loss response. That's the ideal situation is when you can add little microchanges of food and they're still dropping. It means their body is just saying, hey, we know we don't need to hold on to this fat anymore. Let's just liberate it, use it as energy. That's a ideal situation for me. Yeah, real world, I think if somebody was, I used that big number seven eight pounds, I might actually, if it's four, then then I would probably do exactly what I had said. I probably wouldn't build it up, but if they were to able to lose a great deal, then I would, what I would probably do is even say, hey, we could probably plan a cheap meal in sooner. Just the way I like to work with somebody who is a non-competitor is to say, like, hey, if we can give you a break once a week, then I would rather do that for that the longevity factor. You know, and I mean, of like, let's do something that you can stick with. You can still have that Saturday night with your wife or whatever. You know, and if we could work that in, is being part of the cycle. Let's keep it the same. I don't want you to eat pizza one, nine, eight, and a burger the next, but we try to pick something that's going to be pretty similar, and then that's going to be every Saturday or whatever we have that load, you know. And I don't think seven eight pounds in a week for someone who just came off a fast food diet, is really all that dramatic considering the amount of sodium too, because typically when someone starts a new diet, you know, especially if they've been eating like crap, they're also taking in a lot more water and a lot more fluids like they're supposed to versus, you know, when you're in fast food, you don't really care what your fluid intake is. So the water retention and holding water with the higher sodium for fast food, I mean, for those who don't know, and I would assume that everybody does, but fast food or food prepared in most restaurants is going to be pretty high in sodium. They want you to come back and buy their food and visit their restaurant and even a chicken breast. If you go to a restaurant and you eat a chicken breast, you know, this is the best chicken breast I have for you. I don't know why I can't make chicken taste like that. You didn't put extra shit in it because they want you to come back and they're going to put in put those things in there, or they're going to cook it, sous v, which is the way to go. What is that? You sous v? Yeah. Oh, sous v is it. Look, if you're going to make chicken every meal, you buy a sous v for 3,400 bucks. What you do is you sous v basically is, and some of them make correct me on this, but I have the basics down. It's essentially sealing the chicken breast or the meat, which a lot of restaurants do even high in, you know, even stakes things like that. They'll sous v, they'll put them in a bag, they'll put them in water so that, you know, obviously there's no water getting to the meat and they cook it to a specific temperature and then they move it to the grill and then they cook it or they chart and then they serve it. That will make the best chicken breast. Now, when I say the best, maybe not the best, but it'll make it juicy and it'll be consistent every single time. Yeah. It might not taste in for else, still taste like chicken. It'll just be like really moist, you know, good chicken. Yeah, but the water content is big with the flavor. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I don't know how many times my chicken ends up. That's why you have to do it pretty much every meal because if you cook it sous v and then you reheat it three days later, while it's still going to taste like crab and chicken. But if you have the time to be a people, that's why I always laughed and said when people were doing the, what was it? The air fryer or the ninja or something like, you know, as we'll get sous v and spend the extra money and make it taste really good because the air fryer, dryer, chicken just fast or just as much, but it doesn't. And they're always so small. The portion you can cook. Oh yeah, it was an all that big. But anyway, I don't know where I was going with that. I was on the fast food and then I got to the sous v. But anyway, that's the way to go. I think math. Did you guys did you guys ever use the, um, what that was a call? Don't take out it on, got me into it like years, like 20 years ago. It was like, you took the chicken breast and you put it in parchment paper and put it in the poster of it. And these two things came and like heated the sides. No, oh, like a peneer, peneer, peneer. No, no, no, like you put it in like a toast. George, for years. I'm not a buddy building 101. I had to put it in the parchment paper and it like kept the juices in. And I remember because I was dirt poor and I was living in someone's home gym at the time. And I didn't have anything. I had a microwave and I had a small little tiny fridge and I was living off Deli Turkey and Deli Rose Bee for most of my meals and oh, right. Not even cooking. It just cold. All right. And it was some of the best progress I ever made. When you when you boil things down to simplicity and that's all you have, it's almost easier. But he talked, I was working with them. He taught me, he got me to get this thing. I can't remember. I don't even think Amazon was around that. So I must have went to Walmart. We got it. Yeah. Yeah. It cooked. It made it juicy chicken, but man, it just took forever to cook it. So when you wanted to cook six times a day, it was such a pain. But I don't know what that was. I'll look it up. I'll see if it's, I'll see if they still sell it. Right now I'm blessed. I have Rachel cooking my chicken all day. She cooks. I think Tornys been making this. Does she? Yeah. She cooks all my meals. My beef, my chicken. She gets my, my, what do you call it? Sue, she grade tuna that I eat two meals a day. Yeah. But you know, here's the thing. She's getting busy with her coaching. I feel like I'm going to have start cooking my own meals soon as it's going to be. You're going to forget. You're going to forget how. Yeah. So is there anything else? I mean, I know this is just like a surface level. Hey, this is how you start a car. I got a question. Just get, I got a question. So, yeah. Yeah. Let's get when you get a nobody and you want to start them on like a skip load. You get a new guy. He's a bodybuilder. He's experience. He's eating, you know, four, four to five thousand calories a day. But he's like, hey, his get. I want you to prep me for the show. We're 24 weeks out. You know, how do you start them out? Do you do like a, you know, a training day, non-training day? Do you do like a base diet? And you immediately go right into the skip loads. That first week or give me some insight on that. Yeah. No, it's not usually skip loading right away. Now, back in the day, it usually was. And I had 95% of people respond well to it. And oddly enough, even guys who are carrying a lot of body fat that one guy comes to mind. I know he won't mind me using the same mechanic banks would always come to me 80, 90, one time closer to 100 pounds over his weight. You know, let's get blow to him right from the first week. And that guy would lose just an absurd. It was one of my better transformations over the years. And we probably prepped. I'm thinking four or five times. And every time we would just pull in, it got to the point where it's like, bro, like, you're just going to continue to come to me. Like, just to challenge me. Like, next time it's going to be 120 pounds. But it was crazy. But I have found over the years that it's still better to get them. Let's put it this way. It's not necessarily than it wouldn't work, but it wasn't necessary. You might as well run it three to four weeks. I mean, I just started my cut face. I went five weeks before I did. And the only other thing that I've changed is I do tend to start the the loads, especially if we're on a timeframe. Like, if it's proper something, a little bit cleaner. And then break into heavier foods as we get in, you know, where the signs are saying, yes, we need more calories. Now, one thing I won't typically do is I won't have high carbs. Sometimes I do, but not very often. I won't have high carbs days on top of a skip load. Because the skip load is almost always weekly. So as an example, if I'm not a client loading on a Sunday, it's not likely that I'm going to push up calories on a Wednesday or a Thursday. There are times. I mean, every situation is individual, but it's not terribly common. Usually we're running and I get the calories established during the week and tweet, it's still a cycle because there may be training versus non-training, you know, things like that. But even for a leg day unless the leg day is late in the week, an example would be if they were going to train legs on a Thursday or Friday and they're deep into a prop we may push up. But then you have other variables like whether they're going to be intercarbs, whether there's insulin being used, things like that. So as an example, I may load on Sundays, but I train legs on Friday. Sometimes I still will push up another 55 grams carbs on a Friday, but their may or may not be insulin in there or reasons that I don't want to risk being hypos. So I will increase those. I remember I was training arms on Fridays, legs on Thursdays in a cut and I would not go hypos on legs. But if I didn't come straight home after training arms on Friday, if I stopped at the grocery store, I'd be sweating before I got home. Oh yeah, you know, hypos. And that, you know, I want to say it's a close call, but you start to get the sweats here like, you know, get out of my way. I need to get my food sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, two, three weeks. It's usually three, three, four weeks. I want a depletion. I want a use for that higher could because it's not even a higher car. I mean, it's a skip load. It's a substantial, you know, there's there's far more compensation going on with the skip load than there is on a high day. But I'm not against high days. I mean, I do that with some clients to it. It really, I know people who listen don't, yeah, so individuals, so individual, they like those black and white answers. But this is a situation where you just really can't do that. We're given answers. I think we're talking about this topic based on what we do to large majority of the time. Yeah. Well, even that skip load for the one person is going to probably change, you know, through the, through the, the diet. And I think the overarching thing with, with a, a, a carb cycle is that, and the way I try to explain you to people that aren't familiar with it when we do it is we're depleting you down to pleading you down to pleading you down then loading you up. It's, it's a process of, and the way I see dieting really is a, it's a series of depleting and loading, depleting and loading. Absolutely. You know, and it gives you an opportunity to see how somebody's going to look. Well, think I'm not even sure about skip. But we probably talked about a hundred times before. When you skip load, do you skip load into the show? Is that what you used and asked to load? Not always. It can be, again, there's a lot of variables. There's variables. Here's the biggest one. Do you have to make weight on a Friday night? Oh, yeah. And how big are you and how depleted are you? Because if you're a big boy and you're making weight on a Friday night, you have to compete Saturday morning and you're really depleted. I mean, it's a lot easier to fill out a middleweight in that time frame if they're not ridiculously depleted. Versus, you know, a heavyweight who is really, really depleted. Then it comes into, well, there's basically, I was just talking about this in one of my clients just about a week. There's three main ways I used to load. And I won't get into too much because that's not the topic, but I do want to put this out there in film spill, which we all know because, you know, even Johnnie's film spill method. I've used that forever that goes back to the longevity video. And that is, that doesn't always have to be clean. That'll depend on the person too, but it's loading earlier in the week and then cleaning it, you're basically filling up, it's filling and then you're cleaning up the mess for the last couple of days when I say, I'm basically just subcute water and then you're going into the show, dry and harden full. But to do that, if you're at the top end of a weight class, good luck with that because you don't want to have to factor in the weight of that point, you're going strictly on condition and what basically is going to be your best look despite what you weigh. So if you're close to the cut off, that's not going to work. Then comes number two, which is making the weight and potentially even drying out to get under the weight and then loading and when you load on a Friday night and Saturday, you also have to be very, very careful to make that process efficient. You got to have enough water in there because if you're already dry, you can eat a ton of food, but digestion's going to move real real slow when you're not fully hydrated and you're not going to be storing glycogen at a very efficient or optimal rate without enough food too. And then the third one is one that I use for junior essays, which I can't get into right now, but it is radical and it worked and if I could have gone on stage almost 19 pounds heavier when I took those pictures, I would do it. I have not replicated that since oh nine, it's in the back of my brain if I ever get on stage again, but a huge, huge gamble because you either nail it and you're just riding, you know, you're on cloud nine or you fail miserably because you were off by 10 hours and you look great on Sunday or you look great on Friday. Let me ask you guys both a question, with your refeeds, you have athletes or clients increase their their sodium intake purposely. Always. I am going to think that the main sodium is just a horrible idea personally. I just don't think they're hand in hand. I'm not saying I'm not saying cut it, but I'm saying, you know, just using simple math, but simple chemistry, knowing that to make glycogen, you need to have extra sodium, potassium, you need to be ace all that. So it would be who of you not to make sure you're adding a little extra salt. At least, absolutely equal to the amount of the carbs that you're adding in. Like if you're, I know it's impossible to target figure out the numbers, but if you're a 2000 milligram sodium per day person on your base diet and then suddenly you're doubling your carbohydrate intake, well, guess what? You're going to have a hard time synthesizing glycogen if your sodium levels aren't up to par. You don't say anything with the water because you mentioned the water. That's another key thing. People think, oh, I'm going to carve up and still stay dry. Well, you can still look dry, but you still need to add water in there to get the glycogen going into the muscle, to get the carb. Yeah, we're going to do muscle, we'll make glycogen. And I think it's a lot of what we're seeing, you know, back in the early days on the messenger boards when people would look so crazy on Sundays. Everybody's like, oh, it's carbs. A lot of those guys had plenty of carbs. They just didn't have enough water and they didn't have enough sodium. So then it hit the next name and they're like, oh, man. I look at this picture in the elevator because elevator lighting was always so good. Elevator lighting, boutique lighting, like high-end shoes you go to the Jimmy two store, great. Oh my god, you want to take pictures there. And bathroom, hotel, not, it was put to high-end hotel bathroom lighting, not super eight or anything like that, but high-end hotel bathroom lighting. Those three places will get you in the best lighting. Skips back on the shoes again. Always on the shoes. I was by sound. I would get an illustrator saying that my mic is real low. It's a little bit more, but I haven't noticed it. Okay, I might have rearranged it between our episodes, maybe I'll turn it in like that or something. This isn't the normal mic that I work on. I can see it's probably a little bit low. I'll fix that post-production of its an issue. Thank you very much, Matt Sharp. I got another one for you guys. How about this? We got a question, Andrew mentioned we should we should pull this one. We had, I'm going to grab this screenshot. This is from the group. Which grip for lat width? Nags answered this question and he said yes. That was his answer. Crafty, crafty. Yeah. I don't know, I'll go to the right side on the neutral narrow and the left side on the left. I'm going to pull it like this. Then just do the next episode. Absolutely. Yeah, that. I think this question comes because back in the day, body building folklore that if you wanted to get a wide back, you needed to use a wide grip. You sure wanted to add more detail to your inner back. You needed to go with that close grip. And I can't remember who it was Dr. one of the science doctors that's in the body building posted studies years ago saying look the grip width doesn't matter. As long as you're not doing this ultra wide grip and you're not doing this two fingers touch in each other grip, somewhere in between the activation of the lat tissue is almost exactly the same. So whichever grip you feel more comfortable with, I think you got to look at your wrists and your elbow health because sometimes people do certain grips and aggravate the wrists. Like I don't know about you guys, but when you step into the old fashioned chin-ups, those would kill my inner inner elbows. I don't do those. Yeah, I don't like the, you know, I don't know if you guys can see me. Yeah. I personally prefer a shoulder width neutral grip. I just feel that connection the best. It's what I've always gone with when I do lap hold downs. That's not to say that I don't do some slightly wider grip hold downs if the people I'm training with want to go in that way. But I just think that you go with whatever grip feels most comfortable for you. It's not going to affect your width. If you go super wide or super narrow, just go with what works for you. Yeah. Now there was one trainer I won't mention his name who was very particular about the grips. In fact, putting a red circle with a line through it saying that anything narrow you do rub. This was just absolutely ridiculous. Because you know, we live in an age now, especially on social media where they're, you're stupid for doing things that, you know, a trainer doesn't believe you should do. So again, I don't want to mention any names. I could say, be a jerk and say, you know, but his name rhymes with, but I won't even do that because I don't want to give many attention. I agree with you, Andrew. I don't think there's a grip that is necessarily bad. I will say this. What the trainer was trying to say, but his rata mentoding gets in the way of his ability to explain essentially the nuances of he doesn't get into the details of why he just matter of fact, this is stupid and don't do this. It's a range of motion issue. So yes, the back is still working with all these different grips, but the reason I think I'm just giving my opinion, why it's a weird thing to just give an opinion in that, say whether something is stupid or right wrong, but I'll try it. The old school Arnold, you know, where the wider your grip, the wider the back, the reason in my opinion that that is is not good or not great information, because it reduces the range of motion. If you have a really wide back and a wide clap, then a wider grip for that person might be more beneficial than someone with narrow clavicles and narrow back like myself, and does not have the scapula coming out with his huge range of motion. I always tell my clients that if you're just outside of shoulder width, that's typically going to be where your elbows are going to, because this is a elbow game. What happens about the more the elbows, their range of motion, just judge where the movement of the elbows from full stretch contraction, retraction, pro traction, all that. So if you just outside of the shoulder grip, you're going to get the best range of motion. Does that necessarily mean that that's better than going slightly wider with even like a mad grip? No, it's a different stimulus. It's slightly different. Real narrow. If you have for someone who has narrow clavicles and poor range of motion for the scapula, then going in closer and keeping the elbows in front, I'm going to do this. Here, there we go. Yes. The elbows in for someone who's narrow like, well help the scapula to come out and forward much more so than someone, then if I was wider. So that is beneficial for me. As an example, say, a pullover. That's a really good movement. Yes. As I'm narrow. Nero or more narrow, lap posts to the front are a pretty good movement for me versus a wide grip, because I get a better range of motion that way. And the more movement you get through the scapula, typically the more or the harder those muscles are working around, essentially underneath your armpit or around the scapula. So it still comes back to, and this is why I like what Mike said when he said, yes, his answer was yes. Use a variety of grips. I'll go on record and say my favorite grip, but good luck finding it for chins is, and I don't think it was on that, which hammer strength typically covers almost all their grips or all those grips for variety. But I like just outside of shoulder width or just at shoulder width or just outside. But it's an, that one in the middle might be it, but I can't tell because it's too de obviously I'm not standing underneath it. Yeah. Yeah. This, okay, see the lap, sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the the inside grips, there it is. The inside grips that come out and they come, they like neutral, right in the middle, it's kind of neutral, but then they flare out. Yeah. If those were straight across, I would use those as an undergrad. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Does that make any sense? I like that. Look at that. I could see that. I could see that. I can see that. They do have a mag bar. It's not very common, but that is an undercageary to turn those, you can turn most them around. If you look at them close, there's subtle one will be slightly under and then you just twist the wire around it slightly over. I like an undergrad, but that's an individual thing for me because I'm narrowclavical and I don't have a lot of range of motion through my scapula. I always get on my wife because when she does lapels her scapula come out and they round out and I'm like, I've been trying to have 40 years on it. So yeah, I could have such a better back if I could get my scapula to open like that, but they just genetically, they will not open. It's like they're, I don't know, like there's fibers, cartilage in there. They just will not let them come out. So that grip for me is a pretty damn regret, but then you get into the hammer strength that has the same, you know, the lap hole that's out and up in a bug that's under grip can't use it. It does not work for me at all. So there's the individual component. You have to play with that. Nick said in the segment we were talking about with training. I think it's a great, great point. You have to find those exercises where you feel that you're able to activate the muscle that the best that you can and that is a very, very individual thing. That's why it's a trainer. I find it difficult sometimes to say, no, you must do this exercise. You must do this exercise. That's not always case provided that your mechanics are sound and you're actually doing the movements mechanically. You've got to see if you're using a machine. You've got to see it correctly. The bars coming in or the hands coming in allowing for the best range motion, not everyone is going to feel those exercises the same and if you're not able to feel them, if you're not able to activate those target muscles fully, then that exercise is going to be that good for you at all. I've shared my idea so many times on the pull down. I'll just say skip. I like what you said with keeping those elbows in, that's what I found work good for me. If I get too wide, then I just start, I'm a scoot over so you can see me. I just start going like this. I'm pulling down like this and I'm just hitting the terries. I'm not getting into that lad at all. I found it was training from home, letting my ego go. I thought about the way the pull over worked and I thought if my elbows were to track the way a pull over, the way a pull over tracks, I'm coming down like this and that works for me. So I'm going to hold it either shoulder width and come down like this or I'm going to go to that close grip and pull down like this. I'm talking to the solar plexus basically and with that, I was able to grow my back big thick and wide contrary to what Arnold told me. You got to go wide to get a wide back. And a cue just for anybody listening. If this is not resonating or you're not fully understanding what we're talking about, no matter the grip, if you're doing a lot while it goes with a row, too to be honest, but it's a little bit harder. At least with any lap pull, think of trying to touch your elbows together. If you're on a chin and it's an overhand grip, take, I wish I could and let me say it's this. It's turning, it's that subtle elbow. Yeah, there's in. There's in. I can see what's in from a leap FTS made a video about this a couple years ago and I hit him up in media. It was like that is the best cue and he was I actually did it too and one of my Instagram where I would do it and I was very dramatic about it at the top. It was like a warm upset and I would hang or in the stretch position and then meet with snap both elbows and I'm on my chest. That old video. It's like a visual. It's like that. I do the exact same thing, man. They've cross-lead a good cue that he uses. He said for him he wanted to make sure that his elbow was under his hand. Oh yeah, definitely. That's another one. Because if you watch, if you have your clients do videos, you want to see lap holes from the side so that you can see how the elbow and the wrist are tracking because remember you're not the way all pull from our hands because our hands are attached to the bar but that's really the only the wrist shouldn't be taken into consideration the wrist placement. It should be the elbow position. It's always elbow position. It's elbow position damn near everything you do with your upper body. We got a couple other. So I don't know what the deal was but last episode it would be two episodes from the time you guys saw this. I don't know why the comments were shut off. It was some sort of glitch with YouTube because I went back and like I shouldn't have to turn them on. When I upload, they're automatically on and then I had to go back in and manually turn them on and then they shut off again. We only got a handful of comments unfortunately it hurt the viewership of that episode. So I'm gonna do my best but you know we only had it that one time. I blamed Skip. They saw his name was on the show. Exactly. And so we didn't get a lot of questions that said we need all your guys and questions. Whatever you got throw them on us and we'll tackle them. I've got one that was left on Patreon and I already asked Ron and Dusty and I shared one of my stories. I'm gonna I'll I'll fill a little bit while I bring this up so you guys can think. Ron and Dusty and I we already tackled this one but we got a new group here. I want to hear what YouTube have to say. The question was, has anyone ever said something to you during your bodybuilding career that lived rent free in your brain for way too long like a judge, a coach, or a training partner? I shared a couple including including my first contest, a guy told I made a I should say this on beat and it's just bodybuilding. I had made a post saying, oh my god, I was so excited. I did my first show. I can't believe I placed second place. That was so close to winning my class and the guy who won the overall DM to me and he was like, you didn't even come close to winning. That guy who beat you, he spoke to you. You weren't even remotely. And like I wasn't saying like, oh I should have beat him. I was just saying holy crap. I beat like six guys. I'm blowing away, you know. And then it's a more about the other guy. Yeah, what was the question? When the scorecard came out as the rest of the audience knows if they heard it's just bodybuilding, I lost that show by one point. So there's that. But that's a nice silver lining for sure. So I tried to give you guys a little bit of a fill here to think of something. Oh, I've got one. Oh, I didn't need to fill to you. It's a long time ago, but I don't want to I've been talking about that for quite a while and you run it. Andrew. What does Kip say about you that you haven't forgotten? He did tell me to sit down and shut the fuck up what I asked to be on the river. That's right. I didn't say it any like that, but those weren't the exact words. But what's the theme coming to your other post? I think that was the delivery. I mean, to be fair though, I mean, I was what 19, maybe 20 years old, and I thought I knew everything. Well, I didn't, I didn't act like it though, but internally, I thought I was smarter than all these other guys. You know, like, I knew all these awesome prep coaching. I knew what I was doing. I knew I did a bodybuilding show. Did you guys know that? I won my class, you know? No, but like, I would probably say it was, it was all I'm actually getting big and I pulled you guys as before, but you know, I posted some of my first pictures ever. And it was weird to post pictures back then, right? Like it was a rare thing. And I had like a pretty good off-season after my first contest, and I posted my progress pics. And I just remember the first comment was like, wow, you look good. You're getting ready for that 100 meter freestyle swim or what? Oh, and then the other guys like piled it on too, like, he looks more like a backstroke guy, you know, it just, you know, so I didn't post on that side any longer for a good number of years, but that's, that's one of them. The other one is, you know, every year it was in these are good people that would say this, like, man, like his structure is just so good. If he could just put on five more pounds, well, guess what? The next year I showed up with six more pounds. And then it with the comments were, man, his structure is just so good. Uh, 10 more pounds of muscle. And they just kept on going from there to when I was like, 240 one year, it was like, man, if he could just put on 15 more pounds. It didn't really like. It didn't. So I'm, okay, stop, it's stuck with you. It's stuck with you. It's stuck with you. Yeah. But I'm also very realistic about genetics in the sport and you, I have a great structure, but like the ability to put on muscle, like, oh, if you, if you just start eating and training hard, you know, it's like, guys, I've been doing this since I was 14 eating and training hard, you know what I mean? So I always had a very realistic view of how far I could go and maybe it held me back some because, you know, I feel like all of us were kind of dreamers in a sense about how far we can go with this thing. I was never one of those guys. I was like, oh, I'm like Nick said in the last episode. At 17, he knew he was going to make it to the Olympia and he was going to be Mr. Olympia someday. For me, it was like, I just want to get his biggest jack as my genetics will take me. And I had a very firm understanding of science, a very firm understanding of, a firm economics and a little bit about pharmacology at that point. So I just do that all the things that go into bodybuilding, it's more than just desire and work. It's more than just, you know, work ethic. There's a lot of factors that have to come into play. So I didn't necessarily bring me down in such a negative way, but it was a little bit of a, of a nudge, I guess you could say. Sure. And when Nick said that about, you know, knowing he was going to be Mr. Olympia at 17, I knew I was going to be Mr. Olympia at 15. I'm not trying to beat him. I was saying he was 15, but the thing is it took me about another six years before I realized, I don't think this is going to happen. This is not going to plan here. So I'm saying that what I really mean is, I don't doubt that he knew or thought he was going to be Mr. Olympia. I don't doubt that because I was in that position when I was younger too. It's just that there are thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of kids who feel the same way before they realize what their, it's kind of like the NFL or baseball. Yeah, it happened up with me too. We have a lot of times we have a, we're disillusioned into what we, like, we don't, we understand what we want, but we don't understand what it takes to actually get there. And I was fortunate enough to realize early on that it wasn't going to happen instead of holding on to something that was like you say, Andrew, I'm realistic. I understood the genetic component of it understood that, you know, I mean, I remember when I said I was 15, it was 16 or 17, I realized, oh, I got to make a lot of drugs. Okay, well, I'm already in three years. I'm already invested. So I might as well, you know, that sort of thing, which I laugh about now. But no, the situation happened for me was very, very clear. It was the one things I've written hard for two articles about it. Zame was Steve Jones and he was a pretty good bodybuilder in the Illinois area, but we lived in Michigan, of course, at the time I grew up in Battle Creek. So Scott and I had kind of come from the same area about two hours apart. And we're going out the Y Center and, you know, I was in a probably a life beater or something when I was 14 or 15 years old and I was just in their train. I didn't think I was huge or anything like that. I was just in there just train. I was just was training hard and doing what I thought was right and reading the magazines and everything else. And you know, I had what I thought was pretty good pump going on and I went over to the water fountain to get a drink and this fucking huge jackdood Steve Jones who was standing there and he was standing there with this just clown dude who had those 1980s, I could see it like it was yesterday and he has a little bit of a gotten super tall. He's like, you know, 6465. This guy ended up going on to be a borderline professional wrestler. Okay. The reason I say borderline is because I went to school with Rob Bandam, Rob's a cow's king and dang me and they both went obviously everybody going to drop Bandam and they were both saying when they were teenagers, we're going to be professional wrestlers and we're like, oh sure you are okay, whatever, but we all trained at the same gym, everything else in Cherishet, you know, Rob ended up being a pretty big guy in the wrestling world. Anyway, these two are standing there, Steve Jones is Jack Dries only like five, six, five, seven and walk over the farm and he says he goes and he usually fucked with me but this time he was seriously goes looking pretty big today, Ken, because you know back then everybody called me Ken, because you know that's my name and I looked at him and I was like, really you think so and I looked down and he just busted out laughing. He goes, oh no, in the other guys like, you know the big goofy guy, because at least here's the thing, as much as it bothered me, it was a jack do, you know, so I was like, yeah, I cared what he thought, but the goofy ass guy standing next to him, I hated the guy with a passion anyway because he was always just addicted to me in the gym, I was always in his way, you know shit like that. So, and I just remember looking at him looking at the target going, you know, because I thought I'm gonna get my ass kicked, I mean what the hell, you just totally embarrassed me and humiliated me, you know, even though there's no one else standing there but me and these two other guys. So I ended up walking away, feeling like a, you know, a schmuck. So I went and I did drugs for 30 years and I got his biggest I could fuck that guy. I could always, it always stuck with me and it's something from my teenage years that has always been, you know, in the, like you say, living rent free, it's always been in the back of my mouth. I even wonder about things like that to this day. What? Like if that didn't happen or if this other situation didn't happen, would I be on the path that would the answer is easy? Of course not, everything in our paths, kind of sets us on the path that we have moving forward. Some of it more than other, some of it less than others but it very clearly impacted me if I remember it what 40 years later? I want to add one thing though because you said you brought up the example of like, you know, football player, baseball player. The sad thing about our sport is that there's a guy who could not have trained until he was 25, pick up some weights and by the time he's 30s on the Olympia stage. Like, where's like, like, the, the, the professional sports like football, basketball, whatever. Like, you saw them develop in the farm, you know, in the high school leagues, then college and whatnot. So you know that they're going to be who they are. But like, say for instance, like Andrew Jack, you know, anyone who he was two and a half years ago, now he's a top five Olympian. He just came out of the blue zone, lived in some weights and now he's one of the top guys in the world. That's the thing on our sport. And it's different. It's different. It's, you have to have a very, um, trying to be a boarding. You just have to be very realistic with yourself and understand that it's not your, your, your, your results are not necessarily a reflection of your efforts compared to other people. Right. Yeah. Because you might work twice as hard as that guy. It's just he's got better genetics than you. Yeah. The cool thing with what we do though versus baseball and basketball football is you're going to be like you said you're going to, you're going to know early on whether you're going to really excel at those sports, which is the point that you're making. But here's the cool thing about bodybuilding is even if you're mediocre at it. And I'm right there. I put myself, so I'm speaking about myself. Even if you're mediocre at it, you can continue to do it even for a long time and still continue to get better. Maybe not Nick Walker better, you know, between shows and everything else, but you can still continue to progress. And you know, it provides, you know, outlet it provides if you want to call it, you know, I want to say it's not self worth itself. A steam, it's things that it's something that I carry that fortunately I've been passionate about and I've enjoyed doing, otherwise I wouldn't be training for 40 years. I'm right there with you, man. But it's the same. Yeah. And I think that it's a cool thing that you can carry that in later into life versus there's no way I could swing about with that throwing my, you know, even guys who are good, you're not going to be swinging about very hard after, you know, your late 30s or into your four. It's just not going to happen or pitching or that sort of, you're just not going to be able to do that. Even at the elite level, they're done by 40, but you can continue, you know, the, the braidies and the L ways and that sort of thing. But you can continue to do this as long as you're physically able. And if you know what you're doing, if you're relatively smart, you know, you stake in sister with you continue to do it until, hopefully until they may be before they put you in the ground. And you can keep doing it competitively for a long time too, as such. You know, it kind of irritates me when I hear guys figure out that they're never, or they decide they're like, maybe they've been even tried and they're like, I'm never going to be a Nick Walker. So live and compete, I'm never going to turn pro. It's like it's not, it's not about that. It's about doing the best you can, you know, and, but it is to a lot of people. It really is about that to a lot of people. That's the thing. That's not what's we're never, none of us would ever said, well, you know, I'm not going to be a braidies. So I really don't want to do it. Yeah, you know, I'm not going to be as good as trail day of a site. I don't want to do that. That's just an odd, it's an odd question. And here's a question for the future that we're not going to know the answer to today, but because I feel like what we're talking about our generation definitely feels that way. But a lot of these newer Instagram guys, people that are in there with the tripod, it's like, are they going to still be doing that 20, 25 years later? Like, we are. Yeah. And that's what I always question. Our generation, I know, I don't like to make this about the kids or anything. But our generation's, I think it was incredibly, and still is incredibly passionate about the lifestyle and about just being a bodybuilder. And that's why I don't like to say, oh, you don't compete. You're not a bodybuilder. You can't tell someone that they don't compete that they're not a bodybuilder. That's just silly. That's your main definition of what a bodybuilder should be. If you live the lifestyle and you consider yourself a bodybuilder, you're a bodybuilder. Even if you suck your bodybuilder, I got no problem with that. I'm not going to battle you on that. Correct. I hope nobody would battle me on that. They're a judgment. Tell me I'm not a bodybuilder. I'm competing 12 years. Not a bodybuilder. I'm not a competitive bodybuilder. You may still be, but I'm not now. Okay. You know what I think though, Andrew is that maybe it's more popular now than when we were younger. So maybe some of the, like, a lot of the guys who found it may be found it for the right reasons or maybe they got into it and then they discovered the right reasons. And so a lot, maybe more people, I don't know if more people can stuck with it. You know, the older generation, the younger generation, you know, I bet that some of the guys along the way are going to discover some of the rewards that we were talking about. And that they'll still be the ones to stick with it. The guys that really figured out they're still going to be banging it out in 20 years. You know, I just hear, because I've had these conversations with people and I just kind of like not go home. Yeah. Some of these guys in the gym where, you know, they're like, well, you know, I look like this and I only got third place at Nationals. Like what? They want me to put like on another 10 pounds. Like what am I going to kill myself for that? Yeah. So you're that too. Like I'm done. You know, like it's not worth it. In my mind, it's like, well, then bodybuilding isn't worth it. Like the lifelong aspect of bodybuilding. You're really just chasing the quote unquote plastic trophy. Yeah. I'm with you. Well, now that we sound like a bunch of old guys, I think that's a good place to wrap the show up. Eat your vegetables. Stay in school. Oh, that. Do I do drugs? You know, I'm just going to go there.

I think we've got a couple of Patreon questions. We're going to take questions off the livestream, but selfishly I have a question for Skip because he is the resident malanitan expert. And here's the thing. So we were talking about malanitan on muscle mice. And Scott said he feels like malanitan has a strong benefit of fat loss for him. Do you see that skip? Well, I don't know because I've been on it pretty pretty pretty much straight for I don't know. I do think there is. I don't know to like to what degree it helps. I think it's not exactly like green tea. I remember one of you used to do the green tea thing and you had to have green tea in there because you know fat burning properties. That's miniscule. But you know it's not exactly clean either. So I think there is a benefit. I will say this though just to piggyback off this because this is important. It just came across this and I didn't believe it. Even though I respect the person that I saw posted this information, I still wanted to do my due diligence because I don't believe things very easily. But there is evidence now based on studies that say that malanitan too will lower your calcium score. That's what Carl the Dorm was just talking. I wasn't going to that's who I heard it from and I just wasn't sure because I do respect the things that and I thought I got to check on this. Not because I didn't believe it but I'd never heard that before. I had heard this idea there but I'm glad you said that. Oh you did. I didn't check it. Now I didn't do a deep dive but I was like, I'll be there. This is okay. There is something here. Now how convincing it is. I look. I've said this a million times. And you know what's this big. I read studies and I need some type of an app to translate the big words. I can't understand them. Like I need to pay someone to like edit it down and give it to me in layman's terms. So and I think I have a pretty good vocabulary but that is not something that I can do. I cannot give it a language. Yeah it's really it's over my head. Well I'm glad that you say that because a lot of people I think in our industry would just dance around it. Pick up a few of those keywords. Oh we lost the answer. And he's like I'm out of here. Pick up a few of those keywords and then start you know using him in conversation as though they're experts in the field. Yeah. You know what I mean? There's there's a lot of that. But we do have a bunch of literature questions. I was curious. I'm thinking about I'm thinking about getting back on the planet and I haven't used it in years man. Like literally years. I was thinking about the nasal spray. I know they've got it that the amino place which shall not be mentioned on YouTube. He's back. Oh yeah. He just stepped out for a second. You're back. Something just something disconnected the cable with my microphone. So I was trying not to pull away from the answer and just come back and launch a lot. Yeah yeah. We weren't going to let you do that. You guys make a deal out of it. I'm like. Oh and you're out. We had a bunch of listed questions already popping up in the live stream. We're going to see what we can get through plus. I know we had a couple from Patreon. We had a few from the last show and guys who are watching this like the edited final recorded version. Leave us questions because we're going to need questions for the next episode. So load us up plus all your comments, all your likes, all that stuff. Those things are super helpful to us. They definitely make a difference. I see the statistics and when you guys comment more, when you like more, all that the show gets shared more within the YouTube algorithm. So I appreciate all of you. We'll just start with an easy one. Wood massaging or using massage gun on your injection sites be helpful. If you have a knot, would it help to disperse the oil better? I mean, yeah wood, but I don't know if you necessarily want to disperse the oil better. Here's why if you did happen to have an infection, you do not want to spread the infection out over the rest of your tissue and then it gets in your blood stream faster and then you become septic. So if you're sure, and one of the tests you can do is you can start taking your body temperature. You have a fever, like a day or two later. If that's not the case, then you can probably rest assured you just have some inflammation and whatnot. I guess it's okay to do it, but I really don't massage, you know, what do they call it, PIP or like bad injections. Honestly, I could say I never really have bad injections too. I think you got to pick your carrier oils correctly. You got to pick your sources correctly, but theoretically, you could massage in it, maybe. I would actually be more apt to put a tens unit on it to try to like confuse the nerves from that pain signal. That's what I mean. It works. When I get dry needling, I always tell them, stay away from my gear because I don't want you messing with it. Or even cupping. I literally told them, like, don't cupping. You're going to pull all the gear out of the muscle and you started laughing at me. I understand you're a doctor and everything in your good friend of mine, but don't be a jerk. I remember I was going to say episode of Muscle Minds where we looked at half-lifes of a test sip. And one of the factors is what muscle you put it in and when you trained that if you were to exercise after say putting in an adult muscle, that that test is going to dispersal out faster than if you were to put it in a glute and sit on it. You know? Good point. Let me add something real quick because I think this is important and I've had a lot of clients benefit from this. One thing that I do, I was going to say do, do. One thing that I do, I've started doing it within about the last year or half is, and I need to be careful because if anybody hears this and they go, that's a good idea. At least reach out to me so I can explain it better. I take because I preload my syringes at the beginning of the week. So what I do is I leave it as much air as I can in it. When I get ready to take my shots because I always do bilateral. It doesn't matter what. If I go into adult, I'm going into both delts. So I have two pins. I will not be sore or swollen or different. I have a symmetry, OCDness issue with it. So what I do is I take, I'm going to put my hands at, I take a bear and I have needle is a little bit higher and I run it under a hot water out of the faucet, but it's just like a kind of a low stream and I run it over the barrel of the syringe and I rock slowly rock the, and I do this for about three minutes. I rock it back and forth a little so that it can mix and it can kind of be dispersed, even leak as I'm OCD it probably doesn't matter. And then I lie the syringes down on the, like a paper towel and I pat dry them and I, so my thing then I inject. The reason I do this is because I live in Florida and everything, you know this too, and everything is cold. Like air conditioning or anything else. So that tends to make your carrier or carrier oil a little bit thicker. So it makes it a little bit thinner. Now I'm not saying microwave it so don't do something stupid and then come back to me when you're, you know, or, or, or, or, it just it turns it up a little bit. It takes the temperature up so that it's thinner and I'm telling you I have my injection sites and soreness has gone down from a 7 to a 3, 4, 3 probably and it all the difference in the world for me personally. And I don't know, I told you guys a couple of years ago I had horrible, now it's longer than that. It was back in 2020, but I had horrible injection like I couldn't come back to that site for like a week and a half. I used to get that massive information no matter where I went that I started getting good gear and never had a mess in the world. I'm going to go on record and say that that whole thing that you describe skip while completely logical and awesome. I would never do that because I'm just too lazy. I would rather sit there with pain in my shoulder than take the time even though it's only two minutes. I'm going to tell you I've done literally exact same things get literally two of t the exact same thing. I've also used a hair dryer because you go in the bathroom, take the hair dryer but you got to be careful because you could really heat that up with a hair dryer. You know what I mean? I just heated up fast enough that like you if you dump it a couple times you could see how fast it's moving. You heated up for 10 seconds and then you watch it and it's faster and then I know the viscosity's lowered enough. I've got to it. I've been done in a long time. I think like your hair dryer better because I always do thing I don't want water. And at the plunger I don't want it around the needle even though the cap is pretty tight and everything else. I still you know you never know. But that's why like I don't I've never told people like do the water thing because for that very reason you know because I don't trust them I trust myself you know or take the risk but I don't want it. Yeah tell somebody else to do it. And I've done it for quite a while and I don't have any like any I haven't tested for high arsenic levels or high floor like I'm injecting fluoride from tap water or something like that. Yeah. All right how about this one? Michael says uh thoughts on PPC 1-57 and TB-500 together for plantar fasciitis um had it for seven years and been through several doctors and PT's nothing else has worked. Absolutely I would use it but I would actually look at your footwear because I was having really bad plantar fasciitis for like maybe not at seven years but maybe I had a good like six months stretch and then I went and saw a PT that recommended I get these like dorky ass a6 like old white guy walking shoes and that's what I this is when I was still working the floor on you know working the gym you know 10 hours a day or whatever and honestly it cured it within like four days I feel like I had relief within four days just by wearing these like particular a6 so my point is is that you gotta get your foot mapped and I think you gotta get the right either in-sole or the right type of shoe for your foot. I like the sense of that. I don't know what the question was because I was distracted by conversation that was outside of this podcast. Well I'll say this so plantar fasciitis I think that BPC TB would be a temporary solution that if the foot improving your footwear could potentially be like an actual potential fix you know what I mean. Do you agree that the footwear is far more important than a lot of people give credit whether you're tining legs whether you're doing cardio even on your feet at work and things like that if you're like an e-r nurse near on your feet for 12 hours these things are but I always use that example though I don't know why but anyway vitally important and I think a lot of people pick their shoes based on how they how cool they look. Yeah I decided not to do that but I've always gotten like these I always there was certain certain I like to the old Metcons like Metcons and I turn around can we all agree they just look like crap they just don't like they're going like modern alien looking weird stuff I went literally looking yesterday and like I'm not gonna buy any of this this is horrible horrible stuff. Yeah I bought some brooks they're like super basic black shoe with black sole brooks and they're comfortable as hell like I put them on I didn't have to get used to them my foot's not like falling off the side because it's too big for the Nike's and stuff like that you know I'm wearing most of the time I'm wearing these shoes I got off Timo dot com you know like if that I would like to do their 10 bucks and I originally got them so I'm like oh shoes that I'm just gonna play outside with the dog with I don't care if they get dirty and I'll beat up and then I'm like wearing them I'm like these actually feel really good and they're they're kind of perfect for training in and so I've been wearing them every day to the gym they're not special to just all black but they're 10 dollar shoes so all you guys out there with $250 Jordan's eat it. We need Dr Joe on here he's a podiatrist and he's always got something to say he hates my crocs for instance because Ron and Dusty give me crap about having crocs it it's like my slippers you know around the house and and he said like people who are wearing crocs all the time that's like the worst thing for your foot basically really yeah one of the common questions we get asked by you guys is what would you do differently with your body building if you could go back in time given all the experience and education I have today there's a number of things that I would have done differently one of them is that I would have started using college and sooner college it is one of the few supplements that will actually rebuild connective tissue it took me tearing my super spinatus in 2021 to get with the program I use true nutrition's hydrolyzed beef collagen I get the unflavered version I pay for it myself just like you guys do I use 20 grams a day makes it into my coffee it's totally unflavered you don't even taste it plus I use 10 grams of their micronized creatin. Creatin has been shown to improve brain health especially for the aging brain I need that and of course you know we've always know about the muscle building effects so this is my morning routine every day and I'm encouraging you guys to do the same. Use our code thank for savings plus it's the only way for them to know that this advertising is being heard otherwise they just think you're some random dude that click that an ad. I want to point out because it looks like I think it's step in I don't know if I'm saying that correctly I'm sorry if I botched it but he says guys turn pro and then never compete again and it's strange and honestly it's not that strange because turning pro and being good and competitive on the pro level are two very completely different things like you can squeak by and get a pro card especially if you're like a light heavy or even like a heavyweight well if you maxed out your body building progress is a heavyweight that you know little under two 25 what you're going to get on stage as an open at like 230 maybe and you're going against guys today that like the average weights like 250 to 55 for these guys on stage now and they're still looking pretty so it's not that weird that guys don't continue to compete after they turn pro because for a lot of them the goal is to make it to that pro status and then to say hey I've got this next stage of life that I'm trying to get to whether it's family business work and just knowing that like you're not going to be competitive and you open like I squeak by and got a master's pro card right as a super heavyweight I had maxed out all the muscle like it probably put on you know there that for the compounds I was willing to take and how much I was willing put into it there's the way I'm going to go stand next to you know theoretically a big ramen you know like are you serious you know I mean or even like a very low level but good pro like people are realistic I should say if you turn pro usually you're very realistic about what your successful chances are and I don't you know just credit anyone for saying hey I did my thing I got my pro card I'm yeah hey yeah it's a little bit stressful yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah very generous a good example exactly well that too and he's like you know what I got to the finish line I have no mad respect exactly exactly I got one from the from the questions from last week and it's one I can actually throw up on the screen here skip that 90 gram postworkout shake interested talking about it do you have your clients doing this same thing and then open up to all three of us what is the the highest you take someone's protein per meal yeah I was just using the 90 gram when I say 90 gram 90 grams a protein just as an example of if I have the other meals that 60 grams a protein that I would increase it by 50% postworkout so as an example if I you know I might be doing 50 grams per meal and my postworkout might be 75 grams it's typically not the number it's a 50% increase usually for the vast majority of my clients not straight across the board nothing's ever straight across the board you know with anything that we do but I would say certainly the majority of the time and if I have to cut it back then I'll cut it back but it typically will be like that the large majority of the time yeah if you know I wait I don't know how you guys do it I wait out my powder I don't go by scoops and it's just something that the scoops are close but once you start to get into you know like a postworkout that's 120 grams of protein powder that's not going to come out exactly with the scoop ratio or the scoop measure that's not going to work very well and it's a lot of it's a lot of protein powder it's quite a it's quite a drink I can't really say yeah I can't really say that I have like a protein requirement like anything it depends right like if if someone comes to you and they're eating a lot of protein and you think it's helping them then we'll probably do it or maybe a little bit more I had a guy this year though that was eating and he's a big boy you know 280 we've got him up to like 305 now before we started his prep and he was eating something like four 20 now like it was like 480 or 490 grams of protein a day right but his carbs were like 120 grams a day and I'm like there's a distribution that's just not working there and it was in his off season so my first move was to easily pull 100 grams of protein and add in 150 grams of carbs and yeah that's his conditioning stayed the same if not got better while we pushed him up to you know we added an extra 25 pounds to his frame before we started his prep he's probably was easier to eat for him too you know what I mean that's a lot of guy I mean we've had um um who do we have on was it dusty or who we have on they're telling us that who worked with Chad Ron big Ron sorry big Ron and he was telling us about how you know Chad had a meeting 12 ounce protein portions six or seven times a day that's just not feasible long term I mean I don't I don't think people can really visualise or do it unless they've tried it to put 12 ounces of protein on a plate and then another you know 300 grams of rice and then to repeat that two and a half hours later and repeated again two and a half hours later like most people would tap out after that first day or they wouldn't even get to that six meal so the diet has to be feasible like the diet has to be obviously we're pushing things we're challenging people with food but like the diet has to be something that someone can adhere to regularly to continue to see progress if you write this ridiculous plan with with 500 grams of protein and it's just not something someone can stick with and they're not going to make the progress they're going to move on to a different coach yeah and if it's a short term you know if it's for a period of time and it's just a phase to you know change up the diet and everything else cool but you I can completely agree with you I would not want to be my digestive tract I would not want to you around me quite frankly if I was going to put down that amount of protein I think there's also tell me what you guys think of this I think there's also this this idea that when you're getting lean oh I can't cut my protein because you know I'm going to lose muscle something you're taking in too much protein and you get those ratios on the wax that's protein stuff and the carbs are real low you gotta look look put it pull some protein for you yeah I mean just pull it and see what happens you'll be surprised no one's going to walk away losing a bunch of muscle now yeah now I find that's actually a great move with women like if they're eating somewhere in the 160 grams of protein and they're dieted they're just stuck and they can't lose often times we'll literally pull 30 grams of protein out and replace it with 30 or 40 grams of carbs and just what they start to get some movement on the on the scale oh yeah you know I have a client that two things one is the when come all met um uh Chris Aseto that was the first thing Chris told him Chris what I don't even think they're working together but Chris looked at his diet and he said I'll you're eating too much protein pull that back and he pulled it back in all of a sudden he just started getting peeled you know there the match made in heaven from there but um I have a client who had a genetic kidney issue kidney disease basically growing up so and he needs to be and he came to me like not doing a bodybuilder diet at all okay so me like now trying to get him out of bodybuilding diet I'm terrified of adding too much protein with somebody who has kidney issues but he sees he sees his kidney doctor a couple times a year and he's doing blood work he can like threw out consistently and we've slowly increased the protein over time but I was surprised to see how much progress he could make with much lower protein than I would have put anybody on it was actually like a cool experiment for me to get to see this where we're doing like four ounce portions you know five times a day and I'm like oh wow and we're still we're still growing and then guess what we reached a point where we wanted to then tighten up later and it was so much easier to tighten them up when the protein was already lower than I would have traditionally gone with anybody before yep 100% must be half here we got a bunch of stuff I saw one that was about to grab but I guess I'll just hit this button because I how about this one um um arbs what do you guys think about tell me certain in terms of reducing blood pressure how long should it be taken to notice the first effects I think it's overrated do I do for blood pressure and I think that's why I think the industry gave it too much credit at first and it became popular but I think it's remaining popular more because of the positive effects on the left ventricular size I know that's why I keep it in and I only run it at 80 milligrams but if I have I admit I don't have you know high pressure issues if I did I would be going to something else I have not split my dramatic impact on blood pressure it'll impact it but it's not it's not it's not it's dramatic or is impressive as I thought what do you guys think I would say it's 50 50 out of it really works versus if it kind of works um and I would also say that it usually takes like two two and a half maybe even three weeks before you start to see the blood pressure number really start going down it's not like you take a dose and then you go check your blood pressure next morning it's not like a beta block and it's not like a beta blocker but also to touch on the point I think it's it's stood the test the time in our industry because it doesn't really have a lot of negative side effects that some of the other compounds that we would use like beta blockers or whatever else to lower blood pressure does and it has other benefits you know helping with your blood sugar helping with insulin sensitivity so I do think I guess I just haven't really seen negatives with it yet so and I'm sure some point some point we might you know we might find oh it's leading to this or oh it's doing that but I mean I think a bodybuilding group is a great population because when we find out about something everybody jumps on it and everyone starts taking it and so we have a pretty good quote unquote clinical trial going on right now and I feel like it's been around four maybe getting to five years now so I think we're going to be able to see if it stands a test of time but careful when you careful when you label this is science though because we're going to be reminded by at least a few of these pounds that up up in the you know the troll the YouTube that this is pseudo science it doesn't matter which you know we we do these experiments on you know for long periods of time on our selves and our clients have seen the data if you will sorry I'm loosely I'm trying to you know that's why I did the air quotes which I guess you can see that it's already sorry to I'm upset you about this kit but we don't have a lot of trolls that join our shows in fact you've got a bunch of really cool people hanging with us now don't definitely have the show no definitely I'm talking about the comments afterwards though when the video is posted they can you know skip the lovers come out of the woodwork sometimes I can't take it I can't take tell Miss Art and I tried and I I'm a weird person just flat out my body is super strange and I I couldn't handle it I started it one twenty yeah I started it I thought you were just going to brush up that sorry yeah yeah I started it at twenty and I didn't really notice much of anything so I went higher I figured I'd start with the lowest those possible right went to forty and I started noticing just like everything was like my ability to feel anything emotionally was just like going away like my interest in life was just going away my interest to communicate with people was going away my wife noticed it right so I stopped it and I felt just kind of crappy too I felt like something to my body was wrong and I felt very lethargic blood pressure was fine so I'm not seeing any changes there I stopped taking it and then I come back and I was like well you know what I really want this to work so I started it again just at twenty and a few days I started noticing it at a lower level this time like it was probably happening the first time but I didn't notice it you know what I mean but just the twenty I was running as I had it doesn't I'm not feeling good I'm feeling for so I've got three bottles of it sitting behind me yeah I can't give that away so anyway I got three bottles of it that I can't use now yeah but I've only talked to one other person that had an issue that was like that but everybody else seems to be doing great I have a weird thing with certain medications I think that like my side of kinds are different I'm I'm planning to get some genetic testing to see how I process stuff because it's not normal it's interesting let's see it's took my injection last night I warmed it up under the faucet easy injection how about that's good should I cycle my carbs when bulking or just hammer the carbs I had to say it that way what are the benefits and disadvantages of both I think we just kind of talked about carbs cycling and the last episode didn't mean yeah yeah I definitely watched that episode yeah what else do we have here do you guys see anything that came up let me look over it or other questions because I think I'm missing some remember there was the life insurance one too though oh yeah yeah let's go to that let's go to that so we we had a good friend that is look interesting getting life insurance he uses P. D's I know he's not a competitor any longer he used to compete and you know he's concerned because he does use some level of gear when I say some level of a it's a level of gear I think he's doing like TIRT plus at this stage of life what do you think skip I know you've had experience with this yeah I am my quick little story was I got my in-run round of 04 03 something like that and I was speaking with my brokers right after shell because I wanted to be as lean as possible so that my BMI was because you get different tears for you know basically what you're your payment is going to be and I wanted to get it as good as I could but I told him I said you know I will have some things in how extensive is the blood and urine and everything else and he said it's pretty extensive but if you let them know what you're doing you know as far as supplements and everything else they take out any consideration so I waited a few weeks for you know gear to kind of you know start to come out and I listed everything and they did my blood and they they just literally did not they didn't even give me a crappy tier or a big payment they just denied me and I was like that sucks so I'm like you didn't tell me the truth here like I went with what you told me to do so I spoke with him and I said listen you need to beg them give to give me four weeks and I want to redo and they said they wouldn't because nothing could change I could and I said just do just just give me the four weeks so I ate like crap which is a normal person I made sure I was hydrated I took none of my OTC supplements and was already obviously I had another four weeks coming off the show for you know gear to clear and I kept my portions low so my BMI I might wait with stay low so my BMI was good and I got tier two payment you know level and got into a really good life insurance policy pretty pretty good size one with a pretty good payment you have to be very careful to make sure that you have it's it's just so important and they will deny you for even sometimes OTC supplements so you need to be very careful and this has been a while doing any wrong I would assume that the testing is even more significant and more advanced now you know if you tell them you're not taking nicotine and they take a hair they'll catch that like from four months ago or five months ago and yeah and you deal because of course there's you know they assume that you're smoking but still even if you're not you know like with myself with a nicotine salt it's not tobacco it's just nicotine salt but it is if I were to take a test for that then they would assume naturally up he's a candidate for heart disease or mouth cancer or whatever form that he's using when that's not specifically my case but it I could be denied for that yeah very very care because it's I mean life insurance isn't just a really it's not about you it's about your family it's about your kids it's about your wife and it's a it's a big deal and I was glad that I did it when I did because I was in my young my early 30s and I had to actually check my term because we're going to buy house in the next couple years and I thought wait a minute what if I what if my term is coming do and it's funny because I've never bought a house and had to think oh when is my life insurance do you're going to die now person yeah it's very old person we consider like I might die I'm going to make sure my wife can you know it's going to get paid out yeah you got anything on that one Andrew it's not really my specialty honestly I mean I I would just detox off everything and become a normal average person do tons of cardio make sure my living enzymes are doing makes just make sure my blood work was perfect and yeah I'm not going to do a basic rudimentary you know see the neck and a go digging and they're not going to test you for gear yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so what I would do I would do cardio to make sure my blood pressure was gray and I would just do all the things to make sure yours I'm things we should be doing anyway honestly but I would just make sure that I'm not using any compounds that would affect those things that would make my blood pressure higher or you know affect if they do a full CBC my liver enzymes or my HDL cholesterol friends my LDL cholesterol I would just make sure I was in as good you know blood work shape as I could be yep yeah I'd go with that and I think like I couldn't I was looking for questions skip but did you mention anything about like BMI because I think they still go by that as well oh they they absolutely they always will that's stupid benefit to do that it is stupid but it is to their benefit to do that oh and it's just like they're like we don't really care we just want to charge you as much as possible because you know we're gonna have to pay out on some of these yeah yeah yeah if you guys do you know what your BMI is like where you're at or what range you're in because I at last I checked I was more of a Leo B still yeah what I'm I am I am obese but when I'm in the off season I am more of a Leo B's but I'm not you know I've said a many times before I'm not big and I'm just not your bigger than yeah I'm not an average size body builder I'm not a bigger like I walk around the oh my god he's huge that doesn't happen yeah just to you're in a string tank top I would like that picture you post the other day and then everyone's just right you get a good idea where to where to where to that come from yeah all right I think this one isn't gonna be as exciting as a body by burns once it to be but so maybe we should maybe we should come up with like a second version of this question but he says what are your favorite foods for carbing up before walking on stage I mean honestly I kind of look clients tell me what they like but if you're asking me personally it was either nutrient bars rice crispy treats with peanut butter and salt I think that was usually it and if we're talking about like right before going on stage they did that that's what it was but up to that point typically it was just your typical breakfast of chicken and rice before you know two meals of that before you know on showday and even like though for a lot of people sometimes I won't have me at anything until they do just that backstage carb up because I want their stomach to be as flat as possible and it's like if you if you didn't have to suffer to make weight like you just walked in and you made weight there's not a lot of carbing up that needs to do to happen I know a lot of newer clients or newer body builders think that there has to be this like magic you know that they're gonna sometimes like look 200% better and it's like what what we're bringing is probably what you looked like last Saturday just a little bit drier maybe 5% fuller and a tan you know like you're not gonna walk out there looking like Ronnie Coleman I'm sorry you know but because you ate the right thing yeah yeah like we we can't transmogify you like in like you know five minutes or even two days I like I love that reference that's a count as an absolute factor thanks I think I've seen you use it a bunch too I do I have tried to transmogify programs you know that's right yeah for nine competitor yeah nine competitors but um because I'm a die hard-given up span anyway I think that the distinction is a good point and it's actually something that I've had to do and will actually do if I ever get back on stage as I'm gonna have to be very very limited in the amount of food that I take in but in the past something that always worked really well you just have to make sure that it's not too much is the McDonald's sausage egg and cheese biscuit because and my thing is more it's not about like needing a bunch of carbs it's the combination of there's some carbs there's a bunch of fat and there's a bunch of sodium and sodium if anything will have much of an impact on you's very very quickly especially for vascularity which can give the impression that you're a little bit drier than you know and you will get a little bit drier but it's not gonna be dramatic in an hour it's something like that the problem with that is it's individual because you never want to put something in your your system that you're not gonna tolerate very well so you know if you have some type of glutinous if you have some type of just a lack of tolerance for that specific food it can make the the show kind of rough and not very not very fine. Don't be run into the bathroom every five minutes. Right exactly exactly you go out on stage and you turn around to a back double buying you go up you just took a shit like an hour ago because I can see the toilet running on with hamstrings you know what I mean so no it's not a very good look I do get a kick out of and I know this is cheap because I don't like to you know talk down about other trainers but it is funny when I because we all see the shows you're like you know they'll be looking at them like yeah eat half a banana and then they eat it and they come back 10 minutes so you know oh that did the trick. Yeah you know you're pretending that you have an eye for something that you just don't nothing was changed in the last 10 minutes and you're gonna give yourself an hour there's not gonna even an hour and there's not gonna be much of a change that is gonna be obvious now it could be something that you noticed that is subtle but believe me when I say the judges are gonna go oh yeah oh yeah he's on he wasn't an hour and a half no yeah it's just a silly thing and I appreciate that you're feeding a client that confidence but it's kind of a it's a bit of a lie well to your point though because because you just said the timeframe right like nothing you're gonna do in this 30 minutes or an hour is gonna make that much of a difference but how many times do we see guys that come out for the morning show and look vastly different better or worse for the night show because they've had and some of that's obviously the stress and the cortisol going down because you did the thing already and now you're just out there for fun etc but oftentimes it's because good coaches they're like okay we have this look now let's play a little bit and see do we need to get you fuller do we need to so then they can use that information for two weeks later when you compete again okay we just need to move this timeframe back about eight hours in terms of what we're feeding you so I think you know yeah I think that's that's the way to do it yeah and I completely agree and here's a lot of thing too if you're listening to this near competitor and you go oh I'm not in the running you know after pre-judging or you know I'm not gonna win this show and you know all the judging is over please don't think that going out and throwing down a bunch of food because you're like oh it doesn't matter anyway it may not matter to you but it does to your trainer because your trainer wants to know if you can get fuller if you can get drier if you're gonna spill we a lot of times it's like okay there's a lot to learn between pre-jet for the trainer stamp and for the competitor too but the trainer wants to learn what can we what how are you gonna respond to these changes before the night show that can be huge huge invaluable information for the next time you get on stage so don't just dismiss the afternoon and be like oh I'm not gonna eat it I don't feel or now the one thing that will make a huge change is fluid you want to see a change in 15 or 20 minutes change your fluid into increase your fluid intake because sometimes a lot of people have enough food in them but they don't have enough fluid and as soon as you put that fluid I'm here like oh my god like this is this is dramatic this is changing quickly yeah yeah we had a question about supplements for crones oh and I also wanted to mention I remember being backstage one time at a state show and this guy what we're pumping up for the night show and he's like oh yeah I knew I wasn't gonna do anything so I had a burger in three beers put the man's in putting down three beers I know yeah I don't know the set it from beer we should have Jose Raymond on because when he got his last pro card because he got like three of them basically when he was last one he was pissed drunk like him and our other buddy Matt Puglia went out the night before just have a drink to dry out like like a lot of people do a glass wine or you know like I was like I like to do a shot of vodka because I didn't use a lot of dioretics and whatnot but he won drink turned into two two turned into four four turned into them stumbling into the bedroom and four clocking the morning and he told me the story he walks out there and gets under the lights and was like but he was bone dry and he was I mean Jose Jose man he's he's got one of the wackiest physique you'll ever look at with the straight yeah he does he just hands down you know one of the best athletes out there so rest of us would look like shit and embarrass ourselves yeah I can see like I'm just gonna get hammered I can see like a family guy uh skid of this where he's out there posing and it's like what he thinks is actually happening versus what's actually happening. All right so Crohn's in Supplements for Crohn's or anything we can think of that could be beneficial. I would say more than Supplements it's food choices yeah you need to find yeah you need to eliminate the foods that don't work from you and just because what I find is this people with Crohn's we get their diet set and then whether it's for a free meal or when they have some variety of variability they pick a food choice that they know when the past hasn't worked for them and it sets them back for like four to six days because their stomach is just so it just means you got to take that food and put it on the shelf and literally lock it up never go back to that food again but in terms of supplements you know it's hard to say because is it an issue with like is the mecocial lining is that the issue okay aloe vera glutamine zincel carnazine stuff like that oftentimes you know a lot of times we see people with Crohn's they have very low levels of B12 animals of iron low levels of vitamin D calcium so that's where doing lab work and looking at those values that might not necessarily be attributed to Crohn's because I find a lot of gastroenterologists don't pay attention to that kind of stuff making sure they're not deficient in those nutrients and then potassium magnesium zinc like you gotta have good levels of those beyond that you know it's dealing with flare-ups you know that's what stands out on the blood what stands out in the blood panel if you're B12 as well would depend so like several things I mean you're you're you're already W could be high you're you're which is your red blood cell distribution with I mean there's several values but which one are you going with MCH okay yeah so so right on your CBC that one is like just right there in your face and where did I you know where I picked that up Scott we were sitting there talking when it's with when Serano and I was like oh hold on a second and because I did not make that connection he was matter of fact it should be right there at 90 and if there's a boar yeah if there's a big variance there then that's a that is a 100% B12 issue that's like oh yeah your MCH is low and your RDH is high you can 100% attribute that that to B12 being an issue if your RDW is low it's actually not a bad thing I mean you have very uniform blood cells so you know you don't bring B12 into the mix but honestly you gotta have the right it's kind of like making a soup right you gotta have the right combination of like your vitamin B your vitamin D like all these things they it works synergistically with the others they help your thyroid if your thyroid's in dysfunction that could lead to digestive issues so there's just so many moving parts and that's where I think trainers and coaches are getting a lot better today at understanding that relationship versus just being like well your labs look pretty good but there's some things that are low on here but I don't really know what that means so I don't know what I think what I think something that trainers getting better at too is understanding that blood work is a puzzle it's not oh this is at a range oh yeah that's at a range too it's looking at how it all fits together and sometimes there may be added components that are not at a range but they're close to being at a range that need to be factored into because it all fits together and you go oh this is what I see and I know I've done that myself over the years where I see connections and things so it's bigger than just whether there's a flag or not you have to fit it all together absolutely what about uh where was this one what do you guys have thoughts on I think we might have talked about this yeah I believe we did super draw for the last week of prep we did that whole thing on orals yeah so I think the Casey Schloss back and check that one out uh Gamboni Law he says great show guys uh any thoughts on work or life stress affecting calorie expenditure even if amounts remain the same I feel like stress increases expenditure and stress in strength decreases okay yeah stress increases expenditure and strength decreases thoughts I think you can go both ways though yeah and also ruin your appetite but it can also get you amped up and hyped up too so I think I think it's more dependent on the person and the stress level and just the how the how the what the entire situation looks like and I've seen uh boys lean he's certainly pictures we're talking about body fat level he's in oh get Gamboni Law who is that what's his first name do I do I know him? why can I um zilfer he's yeah he follows us on Facebook I always know him as Gamboni Law yeah okay it's and it's bad that I can't then I can get the name off um is he a lawyer or yeah and off yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good good thought yeah he's a lawyer yeah yeah um no I mean stress can absolutely decrease your clerk expenditure because when you let's say your liver stress right well what happens then you're getting more t-vo-t-vo-t-vork converting to reverse t-3 so you have less t-3 so your metabolism is drop completely and females this is like one of the main reasons why they just stall out all the time you know like cortisol goes up cortisol is made from a steals from progesterone so progesterone's are tanked they're in a state of estrogen dominance their liver gets clogged and then they're having less of a metabolism boost because they're making or they're converting less t-4 to t-3 on top of that they're having digestive issues typically when people have digestive issues they're having lower caloric expenditure as well so it's it's kind of like a merry-go-rounder problems there's not like one cause it's like there's like these things and there's all these different entries onto the ride and trying to think out of finish this little metaphor you kind of got to just grease the wheels and you know if something's wrong over here it can be affected that it's like anything with with what we do you know we're just talking about the blood work thing it's very similar to that but I find that stressful more often than not decrease caloric expenditure versus increase it you what he might be thinking is that he can eat more calories when he's stressed but that might be because it's running through him because his gut is yeah his gut is just pushing it and he probably going to the bathroom more I use the analogy of the 440 or even in 80 versus like a steeple chase is a called a steeple chase when they have to jump over you heard all then they have to jump over a little pond or a puddle or you know all these things point is you have yeah all these hurdles it takes you longer to get to the finish line and you just running with no obstacles in front of you it's a far more efficient process when you can eliminate those those guys what are these messages that you sent me injure these are just questions like some of the things I saw on the side here that I pulled out and sent out okay I already done one or two of them we've done one or two of them okay I didn't see for Michael Devereau do you think that Ronnie was the cause of a lot of physique imbalances and injuries today because people tried to train do you think that was the okay I said he said was the cause of a lot of injuries and imbalances today because people tried to train the way that he did especially in the back department what do you think I'm assuming Ronnie Coleman my answer you guys already know it he didn't cause any problems the anybody who trained incorrectly or poorly or too heavy whether it was influenced by Ronnie Coleman that's and that's on them that's just yeah but let's see let's use an example of your your college kid you just got exposed to bodybuilding and you ran into your first Ronnie Coleman the cost of redemption tape and you see him slang and weight right or even here's a better example someone like Branch Warren I think it branch too so I think I'm okay that's I just got to move weight you know like every kid everybody back then Andrew you know everybody back then was slamming weights around just like right whether it was good for their bodies or not we just have to try to do you know I did the same thing so what I'm saying is when that's the when he's the best bodybuilder so you want to look at who's who's the best and how do they do it I think I think Michael's point is I think he agrees with us too is that Ronnie could have contributed to a lot of guys who don't have his genetic capabilities training in a certain way that might have held themselves back whether his creatinization counts as that kind of thing I can agree that there is certainly an influence there's no question I'm just saying I don't want to blame Ronnie for poor mechanics or he's too heavy away that's all you can also say the alternative though that Ronnie hyped a lot of people up to try some things that they wouldn't have normally tried yeah yeah that's true too you can't keep working a lot lunges what happened had it not been for Ronnie Coleman seriously how about we get a couple more and I've got some too from the previous episode so I don't want to leave those guys out oh this one was for me I think kind of he says hey Scott he says the first video that I ever had listened to from your channel you were talking about prison and jail workouts and interviewing a guy who had been to prison can you go over any of that episode and why you may have done it I just thought it was a good idea like at the time because I was fascinated by I was trying to think of ideas I was doing this like advices radio it was called like advices stories and each one was a different topic and on that episode I had like three guys four guys that had been to prison John Romano was one of them and I would have done it differently today if then then how I did it before because I put John at the end because it was like the grand finale now I would have led with John you know what I mean versus seven he sits through 45 minutes of one guy told his story about how he found protein sources in prison another guy told his story of how he did his training another guy had a story of seeing seeing a dude like his training partner he said he was training with these two younger guys and he has like these two younger guys that you know they they just come in and they were in a gang and he's like you know and I didn't want to get messed up with gangs but I figured you know they want to train with me we're in the gym we can train together one day I come in and it's back day and they're just over here like just doing something different they're like curling and just standing around I'm thinking of myself whatever you guys do whatever you're gonna do I got a train back he said 30 seconds later somebody else walked in and the two guys went over and just started shanking that hell out of this fourth guy I mean it was like oh so they were yeah they were waiting for him he was like you don't want to get tired out they want to be a little yeah yeah they were they were not trained and they were just pretending to be there you know well I'm gonna shank somebody I want to do it with a pump I want to look good well I usually get my pump while I'm shanking you know what I mean but it was it was a fun it was a fun episode I did that one I did one about eating disorders and people talking about like disorder eating a bodybuilding we had a doctor bodybuilding yeah bodybuilding general yeah yeah we had a yeah we had a doctor on there we had people who had needing disorder we talked about like the disorder eating the happens in the sport um we did a bunch of cool little stories it was more like an NPR type like uh expose what's that woman that goes she gets embedded with these different groups like she got embedded with like the Mexican cartels she got she oh yeah yeah she's been on broken and she's gotten bedded with like um I don't think she did like sex traffickers but she got she gets into like these fringe groups and then like somehow she gains their confidence keeps them their their faces and names you know very anonymous but gets as real as the story as you possibly can yeah it sounds like it's kind of like those little exposés yeah yeah yeah was it are you thinking of the um the not trafficked is that the the show you're thinking of that's it I think that's it that was a good one that was a good one you know what I'll tell you what I'm gonna be completely honest when I started bodybuilding you know I came from the world of photography right and I left photography and I just was like I don't know what I'm gonna do now like this is what I went to school for this is what I've done all my life like art and I'm like I'm not gonna do that anymore I just lost the interest and I got clean and then I started lifting and when I started getting into it I'm still on the outside I'm not part of bodybuilding yet I'm just a guy who likes exercising now and I thought to myself I want to get involved in the sport to the point where I can start documenting it one day where I can infiltrate bodybuilding and be a part of it and then show other people what it's like and I kind of feel like it's kind of come true in a way you know what I mean yeah no for sure for sure yeah those are good times sure I'm really excited that he that he went all the way back that far you know what I mean it's been a long time it was like 2016 that show came out would you find Andrew so I see your does Andrew still recommend the fog map diet so I think someone might have seen like maybe one of my detox recovery plans because I do recommend highly when if there's digestive issues going on or we're in a detox phase or even a lot of times post show where I want to get digestion work in a hundred percent again I will put them on a very low-fod map plan and really you know will pull away explain everything for anybody that doesn't know what low-fod map is yeah honestly all the foods are listed if you go to www.ibsdietz.com I think it is there's all the guys who put the WWE WWE in okay why is this HTTP that's why that's why that'll be www um no so you know greens good red is bad but you know basically fod maps are you know for the fructo oligo malto saccharides I think I said all that right but they're particularly type of carbohydrate source that long story short they're not good for your gut not good for your bacteria necessarily yeah that's it okay and so you know my version of it is look it's closer to more like the Mediterranean diet but we're gonna pull you know dairy and way products you know we're gonna pull caffeine we're gonna pull all the foods on that list like for example there's a lot of fruits you can't have you know like bright bananas or uh certain certain types of not nuts certain types of vegetables you can't have a lot of the process foods that you certain weeks you can't have you can like for instance if we're doing bread you can do a sourdough bread but you can't do most of the commercial breads that are out there so anyway the idea here is to reduce that population or that that food group to reduce you know poor gut populations and to eliminate digestive stress more less yeah like the green list here that those are all the vegetables you can have it's still a really large list it's not like you're stuck eating chicken spinach and just rice you know which is what honestly most body builders are eating anyway right so it actually and during that time frame I actually have people increase their variety of foods usually so I give normally I give like macros I might give them guidelines but I give them like macros really and they can pick and choose the foods they eat um during this time period because we might stumble upon a food that they just digest really well that I hadn't thought of using before you know oh you can eat kangaroo oh yeah yeah yeah but but but you know the main take home is that like most body building diets are almost completely fond map like to begin with you know unless you're eating like like white bread toast several meals a day or you know some of the fruits that we're talking about like certain apples certain certain bananas and stuff but overall you know you're just trying to eliminate that portion of carbohydrate from the diet yeah how about this one question for the next show how would you set up an effective mini cut currently six weeks on tier T weighing 97 kilograms what to do a mini cut for six to eight weeks to drop to about 90 92 kilograms during this period staying on tier T and trying to maximize insulin sensitivity I don't know I mean it depends what do you eat right now yes right exactly I mean it's I mean like any coach and anyone that says okay eat these five or six meals with that limited information they're they're what you call it a cut and pace coach right so like we need to see what you're eating are you eating you know 150 grams of carbs a day and 300 grams of protein or are you eating 100 grams of protein and 400 grams of carbs and having you know two or three cheat meals a day first up might literally just beat it eliminate some of your free meals right off the bat you know and you're gonna get a really good bird boost right there so like anything we always say this and it's annoying but it's true it completely depends yeah yeah just like if you're gonna start to die at period right like if you're in an offseason and then you're it's because that's pretty much what you're doing right like I mean that's what a mini cut is it's not anything different at least it's not for me at least yeah I mean I think a lot of us now like we build the mini cut into the regular diet in a sense of we don't we just don't ever want you to lose insulin sensitivity so yeah you know we might you do it like I'll typically do something like two weeks higher one week pulling back you know just in a cyclical fashion and that might be okay on that pulling back week we're gonna pull 75 to 100 grams of carbs out depending on what meal it is or meals those are and we get that response there where from track in their blood sugar okay we were creeping up to 92 now we're back down to 84 85 right another two to three weeks high and then we'll just kind of repeat that process over and over again we got a fun one here and I think this comes from us talking about the advice of stories and by the way prank no stories was not with David Johnston he wasn't in that that was a different program that was beyond driven radio with David Johnston how about this one top convicted bodybuilders of all times we're killed for a kid who or till fox or till fox oh true that one was always that one was always there was always some questions with that though but I agree yeah that's true what was the story again did he I think he murdered his his his girlfriend and her mother yeah yeah but yeah but I think there was some shady dealings with the police involved with that so like do I think he did it yeah but like I don't know there's I remember reading in the flex magazines back in a day and then this and that and just like this isn't a clear cut case I don't but I never came ever wrong you only maybe what four or five years ago and I was fascinated by some of the things that didn't come out years ago about it and I was like wow there might be more to this than what's right here on the surface but great tightest he's up there I mean you know we stopped growing the trunk burnt the car it was he just he ate that and and oh yeah she obviously got trouble she's in touch with but I don't she got she got she had out of like two or three years yeah she was she didn't spend very much time he took the bulk of that and he's in for I think ever and ever had a lawyer right I mean I'm sure he's up for parole probably in the next ten years but because of what it was 15 years ago maybe oh and let's not forget he mentioned the next one too the killer selling oh yeah other Sally exactly selling me oh yeah and that was a big one to me because that was so long ago I mean that was just like oh my oh my god he got to be kidding me what was that early 90s I mean I was barely twenty twenty one twenty two years old I think about that one two is it's like wait a minute like he repeatedly beat her and raped her and and all this other shit oh well it's okay he has right now her yes he assaulted her and she depends herself she has enough and he comes to beat her and assault her again and she's had enough like to me that's like standard ground like yeah she was within her rights you know what even if he wasn't coming to beat her on that very moment there was enough pen up shit stuff there that and he was gonna do it again eventually I think she should be completely exonerated I don't know why she spends so much time in jail honestly I don't know either I know I had the question watching it and you never know how accurate the documentary really is I assume it is yeah I don't know any better I wondered it seemed to me that there was some a little bit below the surface there was quite a bit of jealousy that it might have even been and I'm reaching when I say this but that it might have been like you know what you're just not gonna leave me like this is not gonna happen but you know I don't know yeah I wouldn't know yeah Dave Crosslands on that list he's not a not famous bodybuilders but Dave's on that list he's told the whole story he was a fugitive from the law he was he was in Spain and like fleeing the country he was in he wasn't he lived in Canada for a while but when he was he was in Spain and he had a story of like he thought that the jig was up that this is it and that he was going to jail they had him get out of the car and they saw a kid there was like a handle to a weapon underneath the seat and they like got him out of the car they had they weren't speaking English they refused to even though he's like I knew they would speaking English and they like hands and everything up and you know down on the floor on the ground all that cuffed him up and then they pulled it out it was a kid's toy like club and that's the reason and they knew nothing about him and they let him go but yeah that was really history Dave Plumbo he's another one who was addicted he did some time and a lot a lot of people john did as well john remodel he was on the show told us whole story yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah I thought I had something here oh I lost it completely lost it I saw one and it was gonna grab um oh Kelly spent nine years in prison that's what it does he just sounds right yeah that story was probably the biggest one out of like our era you know yeah oh man that I mean that that made like fox yeah and that was I mean they were just they were like yeah we're out had to talk I get the fun the hardest I mean it is important I get my done every two weeks but if I was on the lamb I don't know if I'd do them uh skip one or you come back to Colorado that was a question oh yeah I don't have any family in Colorado anymore I had to have you know friends some good friends but we travel we go to Milwaukee and I would feel guilty going to Colorado when I could go to Milwaukee and city kids so our trips are almost exclusively to Milwaukee these days but I would love to get back out there I do miss it it's beautiful and the food and everything is it's it's it's great I do miss it not enough to go back but I do miss it very fine memories of Colorado speaking of Colorado did you guys see uh the documentary uh breaking Olympia yet not yet not yet it's worth it it's good that's what people have been telling me I want to watch it I you know while I really admired Philheese physique throughout his career I kind of thought he was a dick but yeah a lot of people did it is yeah and I don't think he helped himself during his career but you know you kind of leave with a more personal side of things and you're like you know it must be hard to be the best guy in the world going for your fourth and then your fifth and then your sticks and then you know what I mean like so it was definitely a good documentary I enjoyed it a lot it's only like the five locks and it's on the rhyme yet it's like five locks and it's done it's done by universal studio so it's a super professional it's not like a no offense generation iron type I didn't know it was out yet when did it come out it just must be just just like just like a two weeks ago or something I saw a day in Solomon promoting it you know the I debut was totally behind this whole thing too they were they were up and up so great interviews with Jay and Dexter you know all the guys from that you know coming up what's his name who's his nemesis uh that's really on now before that big guy from a big black guy with the ponytail oh okay I think said guy no Kai yeah a lot a lot of good stuff yeah I don't bicycle pose I mean come on that's kind yeah yeah my brain wasn't working for me he's down here in West for all he was he was trying to train it redcon but I don't know if he's still here anymore yeah oh skip you still doing the one week on one week off no I'm in Pratt now and everything it did work well but it didn't work as good as I thought I will tell you this though and this is important it certainly worked every bit as good from just a result standpoint not psychologically but from a result standpoint of training every week I really was surprised by that it I just didn't gain I couldn't continue to milk the freshness like I would get after training you know five six weeks maybe even seven weeks then take a week off and then come you know come back you know ridiculously strong and stuff like that so it did work but when I got into this cut phase after the first of the year I shelved it I psychologically it's a very very difficult thing to do that was a where it was an interesting experiment um have you interviewed Dave Pulumbo he yet it's been a long time though I just talked to him at the Arnold and uh I worth we're talking about trying to get him over at it's just bodybuilding at some point I want to get him out

He told me that one of the things that he always had in his head getting ready for the Olympia because he would always be training through like July and August in September in that gym right. Yeah. And he said the hotter it got in August and the worse it got because it got up to like 120 in August and they're just training in that gym. And he said that every time it got worse like it would inch up a degree, you know, you're getting into the hottest days of summer, he would just sink good, good, good. No one else is doing this. Yeah. I want the conditions of this to be as horrible as possible. I want these workouts to be as as difficult and unmanageable as they can possibly be and then that will make me ready. And it was just a mental thing. Like you just wanted it to be so brutal and hard and that when he got on stage, he knew and had done more work, right? Yeah. And so that was just like as a man, he did that over and over and over again, you know. So did Ronnie. Hey everybody, it's just bodybuilding reacts. That's the handshack. Scumming now in myself, figure out a part of it. Remember, like share, subscribe, comment and I am mutant.com, born hardcore, get your 20% off. Dusty 20, big Ron 20, get your all in, get your ISO surge and everyone should get on the gear. Scott, what is up for reacts today? What classic video are we watching? We have the entire, we're not going to watch the whole thing, but we've got the entire branch, we're an unchained DVD from 2006. We're going to skip through some of this. What do you guys want to see Branch train today and we'll fast forward to that? Oh, Dusty can pick. I don't know. I think Branch, you got to see like Chester shoulders because he's just his shoulder. Check. Okay. Like his chest is, literally, I think of stakes on his packs. All right. Let's go into Chester way. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I mean something years old. Still exactly. Yeah, we're going into Chester. Oh, perfect. I'll just bring this up a little bit. I can't get well then. So in 2006, when he shot this video, he had one a couple of smaller pro shows and he'd been eighth and 12th at the Olympia. But he hadn't won the Arnold yet. So this was pre- Arnold wins. Wouldn't even be a pre-count. What year? He won 1112. Let me ask you off. Well, pre- Arnold. Yeah. And his first, his second was in 09. So this is a few years before he goes to the O and gets that famous second to J. Yeah. So this was still, this was still kind of up and coming Branch. Branch wasn't the top five guy yet. He was still a J back in the day. Yeah, chills trainer with J. Yeah. Look at that same more, right? Yep. That's what I'm like. Wait. Wait. Wait. Everyone said it. Oh, everybody said it. Guys, you're still saying it down at that gym. Lightweight all the time. That's also a three-plate warm-up for anybody who's playing. He's just right to that. I don't know if we missed him. He's getting, but also, most people including me, like just can barely touch a chess with a bar on the incline and Branch is like sinks it into his past three inches. Yeah. He was actually getting that. The full stretch of a hit your spine, I think. Yeah. One thing I got to say about Branch, because Branch and Johnny, well, I can't, I can't say for sure, but I know Johnny's like this, but I think that Metro Flex guys are kind of like this, that style of training. Training partners have to be able to lift the same amount of weight. Oh, because they're right. Right. They don't have to bar. Yeah, like, like, if you say, you want to train chess, they're like, you can't train chess with me. I use these dumbbells. Like, really? Like, it's sort of that mentality. Like, you gotta be able to keep up on the weights to not just the intensity and stuff. Like, you know how, like, I mean, I've trained with Nadi guys at Wade 170, they were great partners, because it was all about the effort and spotting me and probably me being selfish as a competitor there, there for me and all that stuff. But that Texas at old school, like, it's that old school, you know, 100 degree heat, just Texas attitude. It's like, there's three plates on the bar and they don't come off. So, like, if you can't do this with this, you go from three to four, by the way. Yeah. There's nothing between three and four for those keeping score. Yeah, right. No. There's no conversation. But there's no prep set of, like, four reps, you know, that's in fashion right now. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's 10. 10 on everything. I like this. That belt. I always liked that red, white and blue belt that he had. I thought that was just really cool. And yeah, of course. Okay, turn the volume up. Very America. See, we got here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to say that at crunch next week. Do it. Oh, Dave. There we go. Hi, I'm back. What I love about watching this is it still blows my mind that people can't just say, don't worry about how branch trains look at the results. He never tore anything in the gym ever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a funny part. So it's like, I don't care what it looks like. He was missing nothing. So the only thing it, you know, the only good news for me was I knew if I were to do that, some of my joints would end up in the corners of the gym. But other than that, that was the only reason I never tried it. I just couldn't do it that way. I mean, oh, that guy heavy really quick, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but even though he can't do his main reps, he's not allowed to do less weight. Right. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Played off. Right. These plates only go on. Well, that's you. They really do because you don't take them back off. You walk away. See? I forget his training partner. I forget his name. I, I seen interviews with him before. Do you guys know who that is? Yeah, it's J more, isn't it? J more. Okay. I couldn't remember. Is that his last name? Yeah, that's it. This is where the plates go by the way. Just smashing into the ground. Which are they're throwing them down on purpose. Yeah. I don't agree. Yeah. We're going to flat now. Yeah. And Brian Dabson, he's all for this run. What if I came to your gym and I started throwing plates around. Let's just take a check them on the floor. What you do on your last workout at John Iran's gym? Yeah. That's about business. Yeah, what you do is to prepare his up to you. You probably have a very polite front desk staff member come over to you and go, we're going to have to ask you not to do that. And yeah. But then the second time you did it. Look, he put it to me. He can't reach that. No way. I can already tell. He's going to need an assist in the problem. He's going to be pissed. I knew he was going to be pissed. I knew he was going to be pissed. Fuck dude. Yeah. This is just a warm up. This is just a warm up. I'll put it back down. I'll do it. Yeah, he's going to adjust the lights too. It doesn't mean I'm sick too. I don't know. Is he going to leave there? No, I see. Look at me. Oh, no. He's going to leave there. Now, see. Look at me. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was bothering me. That was a nice guy. Yeah. He was going to do that. I knew him. I was like, oh, wait. That's too high. You don't see his arms. Kill him. I forgot how intense this was to watch him train. Also look at the time between sets. Oh, yeah. Like you guys said, it's like a hundred degrees in there. Oh, worse. And that gem. Plus you're breathing through dirt. Yeah. Everything is bad. It's like mad max. There was a gem. Imagine the gem in the mad max world. You look over there's like a guy with a gas mask doing curls and then there's a guy over in the corner welding something. And there's a chance. Well, there's nothing. Yeah. Yeah. There's branch with chains around his neck. You know. Yeah, chains around his neck. Yeah. Chains are like part of the like they're part of like the fashion. Yeah. People just have chains. Like just draped on them. I do love the pace of this workout. There's a warlord executing people in the parking lot. And branches just tricking away and you ask him, what do you think of the warlord Outsuddy's like, ah, I paid attention. Yeah. He wouldn't see their locker in the house. Yeah, it was a nice spot. Yeah. I remember branch telling me when he was up here last year when they did that gasping at our gem and we like hung out for a couple days. Yeah. And we were riding around in the gaspan. The nice fan they toured in. We went up to Grouse. Grouse Mountain. We took him up to the top of Grouse Mountain and showed him around. It was really fun. But I got to like chat with branch quite a bit. And he told me that one of the things that always had in his head getting ready for the Olympia because he would always be training through like July and August and September in that gem, right? Yeah. And he said the hotter it got in August and the worse it got because it got up to like 120 in August and they're just training in that gem. And he said that every time it got worse like it would inch up a degree, you know, you're getting into the hottest days of summer, he would just sink good, good, good. No one else is doing this. Yeah. I want to. I want the conditions of this to be as horrible as possible. I want these workouts to be as as difficult and unmanageable as a compulsory and possibly be and then that will make me ready. And he was just a mental thing. Like he just wanted it to be so brutal and hard and that when he got on stage, you knew no one had done more work, right? Yeah. And so that was just like, I was like, man, he did that over and over and over again. You know, so did Ronnie, so did Johnny. So it's fine because they're also training the moment of the day like, yeah, when it's doing training the most like the coolest point because I really not. This is all I do for work. I'm like, all right, so mid nights when I train cool. Yeah. Dusty brothers own fan again. That's weird. So he did for played in clients and now he did some for played flat bench. Long enough to stop long enough to drink some water through the bottle at my ground before this, don't pick that bottle back up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's never going to get big if he keeps going to that level of failure. It's not going to happen. Don't mind about the RIR. We're going to vote for RIR. We're going to vote for RIR. It's not going to happen. Don't mind about the RIR. We're going to vote for RRI. I like that. Is that on a shirt or something because it should be that should is it is now. I like that one. Everyone's in a while. I'm happy with something I've done. I'm like, I'm like leaking my sweat all over him. I got four reps as my goal. There we go. One, two, two. I was like, oh, there we go. Oh, that is shit. You nailed it though, Ron. I would have never guessed that. I'd have been like, hey, I can't really do this. Can I go down to a three to quarter? Yeah. No. No changing plates. My hand sounds in my hand. Someone's calling somebody. I'm getting some sort of call here, I guess. But we're not answering him. I was like, what are we here? Maybe it's branch. I'm not quite sure what that was. Yeah. That's just a room. Yeah. He just had to move that. That's definitely one of those moments. So even in that gym, I would have to be like, yeah, I'd have that out because my train partners were here. Yeah. That would, you know, it would have been cleaned out for me. Unless I hated the guy. Right. Brian's like, can you guys not throw shit on your videos? Not actually throw. Brian actually probably loved it. Yeah. See the rack. See how the rack has no dumbbells actually on it. Oh, yeah. I'll just on the ground. Let's convenient. Yeah. That's just like normal. That's just totally normal. And then branches like, oh, these are right where I put them. There. Well, that's what happens when you only use the 190. So, right. So now I think there's a bit of a range allowed on the dumbbells when you train with these guys, but not a lot. We'll see if J uses the same dumbbells. Okay. We don't have to. Because you don't have to like, tell you thing off. Grab different ones. Right. But there's still that philosophical rule, you know. K, use the same dumbbells. We're training together. Man, just keep doing this. The way he presses it, she's just so freaking angry in that movement. Yeah. It's like so aggressive. I still looking at that bar that's laying on the ground half up on a bench. Oh, yeah. Crazy. That was absolutely true. I'm going to put it on it. A tripping hazard. This is a classic 2006 move after you get the, you know, pump going. Then you peel off the pump cover, right? Yeah. You got to get the pump going. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Same dumbbells. Oh. Boom. Dumbbells were made of something different back then, because they will play. It's not as wondering. Yeah. Especially because that's like, that's like a quarter inch mat on a cement floor. Like there's no dumbbell floor there. Like you get it, you know, and Jim's got his. Oh, he got that nice dumbbell. Power. You know, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're as if you threw them. They would literally bounce into the mirror if you did that. Yeah. Oh, look at these big boys. That's what I have those, those horse stall mats in my gym. I like them here. It's for the basement. There it is. Horse mats are great. They're heavy as shit though. Oh, they are. That's the one thing. Yeah. Realized. What costs so much money in the gym is the flooring. Yeah. Those are 200. They're 200. I feel like it's like, that's the, that's the thing with like branches training. That's how complicated it is. It's like, well, we did four, play it in climb. So then you got to do four, play it flat. And then you got to do 400 pound dumbbells. Oh, 200 pound dumbbells. You got to do 400 pounds on everything. You know, let's see if we can call cemetery. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So that's eight. Oh, 170, maybe 165. Plus, there's looks like there's maybe something smaller on the end. So plus things. Oh, yeah. There's a couple things. There are like 190s in or something. Yeah, eight. And it looks like a five on there. So maybe those are like 180s with the handle. Yeah, I bet that's what it is. Two, three. And we've got these good wraps too. Yeah, touching the chest. I always like the way he, the style he pressed. Yeah. The angle of his elbows. There you go. What was he going to do for this? One for trauma. Yeah. What's that dust? Yeah, I don't know what time he was. What was he getting ready for? I mean, he's obviously in pretty good shape here. Oh. Was that his heaviest set? You think or he's going to go up? Oh, shit. Is he going to go up? Let's see. I'm going to just roll it forward a little bit here. Oh, one. It's going to the round three, four, five, six, seven, eight, same dumbbell. So he did a couple sets with them. I mean, look, a line he is now too for pushing this hard in that heat. He probably lost like three pounds of water so far. Since he got to the gym. There we go. There we go. Oh, drops that time. Oh, there you go. One tens. Yeah. And they look small back in pairs and you know what I mean? When the one tens will look small. I'll just leave those right by the other ones. Yeah, they already put away. There they go. They landed right where they go. That's amazing. Oh, then we get into the classic here. Oh, yeah. There we go. The necklace sets. Now, you know, I think I think per Bernal told me a story about the chains on the neck. Really? And how that picture like just unexpected. I think per Bernal's a guy that first took a picture of branch with the chain around his neck or something like that. I can't remember the story. All right. But anyways, it just went. He remember him saying like it. I can't believe that's one of my most viewed photos of all time or something like that. Just how crazy those pictures went that he had. Because they were in like a flex magazine or something branch dipping with chains. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, because that it became a thing like for people at local gyms. They would, but it was like that time. A little one. Yeah, it's like five pound chain. What's like Donna's choke color. I remember I was at a gym that had big chains like that. And we were training chest and the guy was training chest with. He was like, hey, it's easy. So he puts two of around his neck and then he's just staying. They're going, ow, ow, ow, take it off. Take it off. Now I start pulling the chain off because he's like a panic. He goes, take it off. Take it off. Take it off. I start taking off. He had these huge pinches on his neck. Like the chain like it is neck real hard between the links. Like it was kind of loose when I set it on him. And then when it it pulled down it like. And then I want it like pinched his neck. He had these big purple stripes on his neck. He's like, jesus fuck that hurt. That's that. He's like pussy. And then he's guys just putting them on their bare skin. Because I would ever, you know. It's probably all kinds of dead skin trapped in that chain. No one cares. Oh, very clean. I got all over them. So every night. Who that range? It's even my chain. It's even my chain. You can't go less chains. Yeah. You can't go less chains. But look at him. It's apparently working. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's why that's always my argument with everyone. Like are you going to say that branch would have had a better career if he trained differently? Yeah. And I mean look at J2 training with you. Yeah. He's getting a third of the reps. Yeah. But they're just as far. Just as many reps in reserve. So we're good. Yeah. It's negative. Exactly. I can't remember. I mean, this is still in the days where everybody was doing like one body part per day kind of thing. I can't remember if Branch would train just once a week per body part type thing. I think he just went chess back legs arm shoulders. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like what everybody did wasn't that back then. If you got real crazy, you might do like a ham day in a quad day. Yeah. Real crazy. I feel like shoulder day is kind of a non workout day. You know what I mean? Right. It's not like a lot. There's really only, you know, if you're going to do it. You know, you're good pressing movement. That's like the only compound. Yeah. And then the rest of the day got like side laterals because of cable rear delts. Yeah. You know. Other than full. Oh, I love the crossovers. Let's check the form on these. All right. That sure is so soaked. So I like those crossovers. I like the most muscular crossovers. So it's feel good. Oh, crunch crunch. You just lots of tension. And you got your body weight. You know, so you can, you can brace with your body weight because you're pushing downward. Yeah. You know, you don't lose anything out the back and I was just hated getting the weight down. Oh, God. These branch get fancy some functional training. I'm taking some course stability with this exercise. Look at these fundamentals, boys and girls basically cross foot. Base arm ross. Pretty much. They're just in jumping jacks after this for the tricep. Calestetics. Um. You know you're just going to failure at this point. Class. Just burning the house down. See, I like that. I'd a client do push up to the other day for chest finish chest. Yeah. It's good. I felt like I was like a drill sergeant suddenly. I mean, okay. Like your time traveling. Time traveling. Yeah. Everyone in the gym staring at us. What are they doing? It's a thing you've got. It's client doing. It looks like he feels down to the other side. Yeah. There we go. So after this, he does the one arm sideways hammer machine stuff. I think. That's off camera. That's off camera. Yeah. So what are the exercises dusty? What were the fancy exercises for chest? We had incline barbell. Flat bar. Flat dumbbell. And then she brought over. Dipped. Chain gifts. And then most muscular. It would cross overs. Yeah. This basically deposing class. This is like deposing after the workout. Yeah. Just a pump. Oh, super set still. Oh, God. And the gap between that super set was really short. You know, it's a good. It is a fast workout when they literally. There's no editing in this video. Yeah. It's almost like a higher workout. Yeah. Yeah. Real time. Is it only a 40 minutes of battery? That'd be enough. Yeah. I think it was eight extra minutes. All right. Let's go. Oh, he's so thick. It's incredible to see what he was able to do with this physique. I mean, he looked great as a kid. You know, like he had a different physique when he was young. But to think how much muscle he put on. Some people were like, man, you were just physique, you know. I don't see that at all. He became literally branch worn. I love that. I mean, he ruined his physique and he won multiple Arnold's right. I can't even limp yet. Right. Okay. I still remember, man, that 2009 Olympia, he came out first on the finals. The posing routines. He came out first. And oh, no, sorry, prejudging. He came out first. And I was just like, oh, man. And I just remember every single person after him. I was like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. And it just went, no, no, no, no, no. And then J came out and I was like, oh, yeah, okay. That's a problem. And then every other person, nope, nope. I'm sure a shit, second place. You know, any happened to run into the quad stop, J. You know? The best. Yeah, yeah. Do you just run into J, you're into the DJ? I also love when people say he doesn't have good shape. Yeah, look at that. That's him as a junior. Yeah. Also check what the hairline is a junior too. Yeah. He's like, already. He's like, he's like, done already. Yeah. He's like dusty. He's like dusty. Exactly. Immediately. I still love the story about J doing the junior, USA, as or whatever. And he went one heavy weight, but he didn't win the overall. And he called Chris after the show. And he's like, hey, I, I won the heavy weight, but I didn't win the overall. And Chris goes, oh, Jesus will be. And he goes, oh, this, this middleweight named Branch Warren. And he goes, oh, well, you must set the best legs in the show. And he goes, no. No, I did. Branch. Branch Warren did. So yeah. There you go. I love that. Look at that. Damn. Yeah. We, I found that video by the way. We'll have to watch. Find it. We'll work that in one day. The, the branch versus J video from when they were kids. Yeah. Awesome. Just a noble shit guy, noble shit training. Just, it was such a fun era that whole, you know, there was always like branch and Johnny. We're like always just over here in the corner doing their thing. And everyone's like, either you can do that or you can't do that. You know what I mean? Yeah. It was always the feeling like it was like a certain way of doing things. Or like, oh, that he does the branch, the branch. More, oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was like, yeah, the attitude to everything. But great guy. Fund to watch that old segment. And who knows, maybe he'll see this and he can, you know, come on the show and give us more insight into, you know, those different areas of his career that would be great to have. That would be cool. That'd be really cool. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's just bodybuilding reacts. We even enjoyed ourselves. Once again, Dusty Han Chau's coming.

I've sought a kept half an eye on bloods and people that run a cube. And I have without seeing people with low-eachedogen on a cube and no other reason for the estrogen to be low. So from that, I have to assume that the cube has an anti-eachedogen effect. But I have also seen people who are in the cube where their e-suggestion is elevated. What's up guys?

Dave, we're back. How's it going? Okay. You gotta bring, I know it's early. Well it's early here. We're recording like this. We're doing the morning guys. Wake up early. So I can hang out with Dave. You got to bring the energy Dave. We're doing YouTube. You gotta talk with your hands and stuff like that. You know? Do I have to? Sounds like that. Yeah, yeah. You gotta feel like way too much. We're excited. You know? That's what we do. Yay! Yay! Yay! Hey, what's up guys? Yeah, like that. Alright. Today guys, we're gonna talk about a bunch of gear. That's what we always do. But, and I have a special favor to ask of Dave later in the episode. Okay, go. But I'll get back to that. I'll get back to that. So if you guys want to take part in the show, then definitely comment below. You guys filled us up with questions for the last one. Just comment on YouTube on the latest episode of the podcast. We'll next time we do the show. We'll get to your questions. That said, Dave, you're going in for a procedure. Next week. So we're gonna have to take a week off, aren't we? No, I'm going in and I'm Friday. Now we have a lot to go. We go. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Alright. Well, there's that. So listen, we had somebody ask us, and it's just kind of a vague cycle question. I figured this would be a great place to just jump in. He said, a test, pre-mo, EQ. Is that good to go? Is that a good cycle? It's a vague question. You know what I mean? Just overall, is that good to go? I think the problem with that is potentially going to be, who of a suppressed East region. Hmm. So we were going to dive into EQ at some point. And I know that there's a lot more people talking about potential, estrogen-suppressive effects. Can you tell us a little bit about what your experience has been with that, or what you've learned, what you've gained in recent times in that situation? So from a science perspective, my understanding, and I haven't had a super, super big look at this. So my understanding is that EQ produces a metabolic, there is a very powerful antisuggestion risk only produced in a small amount. So there was a lot of original when it came forward, probably, I mean about six months, maybe twelve months ago, there it came forward. EQ may be East region-suppressive. There was a lot of people that were very mixed on it, and whether this metabolic could actually in the real world impact East region levels. Yeah, I think it was more placed in the big deep dive on it a while back year or so. Since then, I've sought a kept half an eye on bloods and people that running. And I have without now seeing people with low East region on EQ, I know of a reason for the East region to be low. So from that, I have to assume that the EQ has an antisuggestion effect, but I have also seen people in EQ where their East region is elevated. Now, obviously, there's no testing on whether the compounds that people are ringing are correct. So I don't know if the elevation ones were EQ or whether it was some testing there, or vice versa. All I can tell you is that I have seen a occasion where EQ has worked as an antisuggestion. And it's actually, Master on is a similar one where I've seen Master on lower East region levels, but I've also seen only act as a swim. And where Eastern levels actually be quite high where you'd expect the person to be suffering with Eastern related sides and their report in no size whatsoever. So yes, does EQ have an antisuggestion potential? I would say now, yes. Is it widespread? Doesn't appear to be boards? We come back to that. Are they genuinely using EQ? I don't know, because obviously there's no testing in any of this. There's only the blood testing levels. There's no drug testing levels. Yeah. But yes, it would appear to do. So there is the possibility that if you're going to run Primo, which most definitely is anti-Eastogenic, and EQ that you may over suppress East region. I could see that. I think so I have I've seen a little bit of this. Now, any more, though, I've tended to run EQ lower lately, the last several years. And I think part of that might be a lot of the people that I'm using it with are newer guys. Guys, they're not at a point where they're ready to take multiple grand cycles, right? So if we're doing 600 tests and we added in 300 EQ, I haven't noticed anything with that. Where I'm going to say, oh, yeah, that's going to smash your estrogen. You know what I mean? But if we were to get that EQ a little bit higher, let's say we did 600 and 600, then I might be a little bit more concerned. So I guess what I'm kind of getting at is I think that the dose is going to be one of the factors that we have to look at here. I know that a lot of guys lately, they've been tending to want to run their test a little bit on that lower side. Versus 20 years ago, you know, test is best was the main attitude and start with test and build everything off that. Now I'm seeing guys that are doing like, you know, maybe 300 test, right? In 500 450 EQ, you know, and then another 300 pre-emote. So if you had a cycle like that, I'm feeling like sure, you might get more estrogen suppression. But if you're doing like 600 tests, 300 EQ, then I'm not as concerned about it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, obviously, the dose specific, but I was just basically on all the compounds being the equal dose. Then the venue could potentially run into low-extrogen issues. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess I'm just trying to take it a step further because then then I'm asking myself, okay, well, how do we apply this in real life? And how could we potentially avoid these things, right? You know, how would we go about avoiding a problem? And I think that that's where we get into the dosing. You know, what do you think would it be a dose that might be safer on estrogen, not completely leveling it, say low-dose cycle with those three compounds? How low? We're saying, let's say somebody who's maybe done a couple cycles in their lives. And they have kept it around, you know, 600 milligrams, 750 total, and they're looking to step it up a little bit in this third cycle. So I do two grub of test. Well, you said step it up. A little. I said step it up a little, Dave. That is a little. Um, okay. Probably, I'd probably look somewhere around the 400 tests to 250 EQ to 250 creamer. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. I think there'd be a bad thing. I think there'd be a bad thing. I think I think, from a point of view of cycle progression, I try and keep it a gram or round it. Yeah. Total. I think that would be enough. We have, uh, somebody in the stream, he says, um, I run 500 tests, 500 EQ currently with 0.5 ADACS. Monday and Thursday in his E2 E2 is 45. That's state side scale in it. Yeah. So that means it's a little bit on the little bit on the outer range and but not much. Like that's totally acceptable. Heck, if you had a 45, even a T RT, I like I wouldn't say we needed an AI for that, you know. I'd consider that to be a decent place. Hmm. Depending to where is test level, where's your free test at in total test? That'd be my next question to him. How's it going, Dave? Yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's probably equivalent to about 180, UK, um, which, uh, I would probably have run it a little bit lower, but it would depend on the individuals, personal sensitivity to each region as well. Yeah. I'm just trying to think, um, yeah, a lot of the pens were at the point in his test level as well, because, uh, then I'd have a real fine deal of how much the AI digs is affecting it. Right. And then, because some eyes to the EQ was having an impact. Yeah, yeah. All right, let's see what else we have here, because we do have a bunch of them. You guys freaking left us a bunch of questions. By the way, if anybody in the livestream has any questions, we're hanging out just at the Facebook group, we're recording this at the Facebook group. If anybody wants to join, um, we, we do a lot of stuff over there like, poke fun at Dave and the group. Oh, he says, uh, let's see. So he tested out it, uh, over 1500. So it's, it doesn't give him, he didn't get an exact reading. He just topped it. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, he topped it out. All right, let me see what else we have here, though. And by the way, guys, if you're new to our content, we'd love to have you along. So, uh, you know, subscribe, hit the bell plus comments and likes are huge. That stuff helps us a ton. Uh, if you're watching the show, if you're getting kind of value out of it, then please leave us a comment and definitely hit the like button. Thank you. Um, so Scott likes comments and likes what I prefer, cash. Yeah. All right. Uh, he says, uh, hey, folks, I always have low HDL. Can this be genetic related? Whenever I take gear or not, I always am between uh, I always like it. I've always been between 0.8 to 0.9 um, Enmal. I take 550 tests in HcG, only cycles. Um, LDL and the rest of the biomarkers are absolutely fine and within range. Based on what Dave said in the last episode, does this mean that I'm going to have uh, heart issues due to low HDL? Right. So the first thing is it doesn't mean it means there is the potential and there is a very big difference between those two. Uh, it is definitely not absolute. It is definitely not different, definitive. Um, but there is the potential of an increased cardiovascular risk. Yes. However, your HDL adalctoration is not dramatic either. Um, 0.8.9 is not super super low. But it is low. Um, test only would definitely produce that amount of suppression. Very easily, particularly on doses of 550. Um, it all depends on what HDL support you're running uh, in order to try and combat that. Uh, sometimes HDL support has to quite aggressive and even then, it's not necessarily going to keep on top. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, the UK at the moment is all pretty now. It's all pretty moment. Everybody just wants to improve your own mass. Um, I mean, obviously there's a test based there, but I see low HDL levels on a regular basis and even with quite substantial support, we're talking, you know, a grammar such as burger, like 34 grams of acrylic oil. Yeah. And various other mechanisms like polling therapy, they still can't get their HDL into range. But the thing is you build up that HDL in between cycles. So you have a buffer so that when you go on cycle, it inevitably is going to come down. But because you've built a buffer, it doesn't get as low and to the point where it's creating major risk. So, you know, I don't start thinking you're going to drop dead in 10 years. I'm going to heart attack that is most definitely not the case. Um, and as I did say, when it talks about HDL, that the science around it is very disputed. Yeah. There is a lot of argument about how impact in it is on hard or not as the case may be. I know somebody who springs to mind who has continually had low HDL in every blood test with a dump for them. Um, and as far as I'm aware, his last set of checks, he came back. Perfectly fine. So there will be people that naturally are lower in the same way. There will be people that are naturally higher that will occur. And the risk element is debatable. But my old point of view is I would rather err on a side of caution and try and prevent it because I'm not having to do anything super super complex to present it. It's just a bit of supplementation. Yeah. And then find out it wasn't needed. Rather than not bother than find out it was. Yep. I would agree with that 100%. I'm right with you. I can tell you my personal experience was that for good 18 years while competing and pushing hard, my HDL was 25. Okay. Flat out it was 25 forever. You know, bringing it up to like 40 would be ideal, right? I just assumed okay. This is just where I'm at, you know, and and everything else is looking good. My house is looking, you know, pretty solid overall. That said, coming off cycle basically long term now in just running TRT. With the case in a little spurts here and there, maybe a little injectable debuff for a few weeks here and there. My HDL is at like 40 now and it's just holding solid. So I did have, you know, there was a point where I started thinking like, well, is this just genetic? You know, before I ran a lot of gear, we consistently, I didn't do a lot of labs. You know what I mean? It's like, you don't normal person isn't just walking around doing labs all the time. So I wasn't super aware of what my HDL would have been. All I knew was that while I'm cycle, I am off cycle, cycling on and off for a decade, I was at 25. Come off cycle, not at 40. So I did have that potential though there was a period of time. I just treated wondering, hey, maybe I'm just genetically low. Now I was just for an out of gear. There's it. Yeah, and that's it. I mean, but don't be surprised if you can't get it above a certain level. Why you're on cycle? Right. Yeah, no matter what I did, man. Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me in this light, but just make sure that when you're off, you push it as high as you can. Yep. Yeah, I'm going to agree with that. Okay, we had another one here about, uh, let's see. Okay, yeah, yeah, I like this one from Venom. One, two, three. He says, great show guys. Scott, you guys touched on this a bit on the show. What's thinking about competing again in the master's division? Not trying to get a pro card, but uh, do you think just doing my TRT and bringing in some far, farmed grade var for the last four to six weeks? What's a face for to be a good enough look? Um, I'm really trying to keep on the safe side. I really, I just really am falling in love with the idea of prepping again, but not so much the gear. Now this guy messaged me actually with this question. Oh yeah. To which I answered, um, I just said that the inclusion of anava would help with muscle preservation, but I don't see it being very particularly dramatic on the look. Um, I don't think he's going to get a huge amount out of it from a prep point of view in the sense of muscle mass, but it would help with preservation of the muscle that he does currently have. And obviously I don't know where it's physically, so I don't know where it is from a point of view of competing and and standards. But, um, I mean at the end of the day, if you enjoy the process of prep and you which means you are mentally or disturbed and unstable and you're putting in an asylum, but if you enjoy starving yourself and covering yourself in marmite and standing on stage in your underpants, then, um, enjoy it. You know, does it matter then what you present as long as you present the best version of you? And if you stand there knowing that I've done this on just TRT or I've done this on just 40 milligrams of unavail. You're not going to get any medals without nobody gives this shit. But apart from yourself and you can take pride in yourself that you got to stage with minimal drug use and you present the package you presented. It's not going to be compatible to the guy stood next to it. He's been hammering a couple of gram in the off season and, you know, a bagload of trend to get on stage. It isn't compatible, but that isn't the issue if you're just doing what you enjoy. If you're competing for the pleasure of competing, then that's the bit the important, not the where I placed and how many drugs he took and how many drugs I took, that becomes inconsquentially. It's really just the process that you're enjoying. Yeah, I've got a few thoughts. I'll share to first one is that every time that I entered a contest prep and throughout the years I've worked with a lot of people helping them do shows. People enter the contest prep with one idea in mind. Oh, yeah, I'm going to keep it conservative this time. I'm going to keep the test slow. We'll just add in that 25 viral last four weeks. Sometimes as a coach, I've had to step in and say, hey, are you sure you want to do this? Because this isn't what you said three months ago. But people start getting competitive and whatever you were thinking about doing, then you want to double that and then you want to add into other compounds and then you say, hey, I'm doing all this work. So, you know, let's add in this this and this if it can take me further. So, I'd have to say watch out for that competitive nature, because I think you can get yourself carried away. I know I have and basically everybody I've worked with, there's some point or another, is there anything else I should be taking? You know, I don't care how much you're taking, what you're taking is anything else. You know, we want that edge. So, there's that. Second thing is, I mean, cost to benefit 25 viral, for last, what do you say, four to six weeks? I mean, realistically, virus going to be, it's what's an oral, it's 25 viral isn't much. So, I wouldn't expect much damage from that. But then, like, cost to benefit, what would, what would that be compared to say 300 mast damage wise? You know, and I mean, cost to benefit wise, is it that much more detrimental to do eight weeks of 300 mast going into the show? Because personally, I would opt for that. I know Skip, he loves var and he loves it as that finishing touch compound, whereas Andrew and I both agreed in Nate Spear was with us. We all agreed that Winnie has just, in our opinions and our experiences, a much more like nasty, grainy, drier, harder look. So, I'd personally go with Winnie over var in that scenario. I just thought that conversation with somebody was morning, and when you look at the action of the drugs, Winnie off his far more for a last four weeks than vados. Yeah, and that's what I've seen in my experience. But I wonder, how bad off are we? Let's say his test replacement is high in. Let's say he's doing 200. What if for that last eight weeks, he bumped into 300 and had in 300 mast. That to me, that's still a pretty mild overall cycle. You know what I mean, 300 test 300 mast for the last eight seconds into the show. Are you encouraging this gentleman to take more? Don't say those, don't say those words. Don't say those words because that's not like that idea. Explicitly stated he doesn't want to use a lot. Well, what I'm asking myself is like cost to benefit, how damaging is that? I don't see that as being like the end of the world. You know what I mean? Like I don't see that as being taking big risks, you know? No, I think the thing is there's a danger there as well. And we use this opportunity about this and that we rational risk to the point where we see no risk when in fact, it's always it's. But I think there may also be an element in this particular case and the gentleman can definitely messages back if I'm wrong here that it may be a little bit of a case of it's not just the risk element, he just wants to do it whether using 300 mast is safe or equivalent of a low dose of anava from a health risk point of view. I don't think that's so much is the issue, which way he is mentally in the he wants to do what he perceives as being the lowest risk. And naturally most people, if you said 300 megamast 40 megamamava, which is the lowest risk, most people are going to say anava. Most people are going to go that route as if you asked them to pick which was the lowest risk. Whether that's correct or not is irrelevant, it's his personal perception of the risk he's taken. So I think that may be an element to this as well, that it's not just the reality of the drug risk he actually poses to himself in what he chooses, but more than mental perception he has around what he's doing risk wise. I guess kind of what I've seen lately in the last few years has been, it's almost an opposite effect. So you mentioned that and I agree with you 100% that we go into things and we make ourselves believe that there's zero risk. I almost feel like people are trying to people feel like if you did a real cycle, if you were to actually get big, then you're guaranteed to have health problems because of that. Because I have worked with people that we've done things moderately, we've been conservative, we checked labs all the way through. They've never been actually big big before and when it actually starts happening and things start coming together, they get a freight. I've seen that happen people nowadays it's a perspective that didn't happen 20 years ago. They start going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I kind of want to back off from this. I do want to get as big as possible, but then they start they start associating poor health with actually reaching their goals. You know what I'm saying? Well, I think the other thing as well is as you start to get bigger, there is that period you go through where you carry your weight badly. And there's a bit of a adjustment to extra muscle mass and there's a period of that settling. And I think that often freaks people out as our shit, I'm super unfitting now, I need to pull size down. Not, I need to do a bit more cardio and get fitter so I carry this weight better, they automatically go, I need to and that's not necessarily the case. Don't get me wrong. Yes, all things being equal, the bigger you are, the more strain on the body, the bigger issue are created. But you can offset that by making sure you're functional at these bigger sizes. And I think a lot of people panic before they get the opportunity to actually correct that and become functional. I've seen a lot of guys and I've worked with guys like you said they get to a certain size and it's like, oh, I'm uncomfortable. I'm struggling to bend it's like, right, get your cardio to do this, do that, get functional. Oh no, I'm just going to drop size. Well I thought you wanted to be big. I thought you wanted to get to a size where you would be impressive. Right. And now you're panicking at the first hurdle of it's a bit uncomfortable. And the reality is if you're going to push a 150 pound above your natural body weight, it ain't going to be comfy when you first go there. You know, it takes time for you adjust to that weight. Yeah. Agreed. And it takes work as well. I mean, he's one of the reasons. The one of the big shifts we've seen in strong man is this increase in functionality at higher body weights. And we now have a lot of strong men that aren't big static powerhouses, their mobile, their functional, they're running around at 200 kilos and they can jump and they can move and they're very functional and that's where strong men's got. I think that's a result. That was a result. Their fits are in healthy authority. Yeah. All right. That was a good question. Good topic. But yeah, get away it out for yourself. I guess at the end of the day. How about this one? How do you prevent existing gyno from developing further? Once you have it, is it more likely to keep growing? Also, is sensitive, nipple really a warning sign that it's further developing? Can it develop without this symptom? Thanks guys. And he said, happy Easter because he commented this on Easter. Happy Easter, by the way, Dave. Did you guys do it like an Easterlycon? Anything did the bunny come? I worked. Did the bunny come to your house though? No. The bunny didn't come? No. I'm going to have to have a talk with Mrs. Crossland then. Did Mrs. Crossland work too? You guys just, uh, guess we're there in the office? I worked too. So don't don't. Well, the problem we had was it was a burnt holiday on the Friday and the Monday. So we had to spend satty running around collecting blood from various clinics to get them to the lab because we have no other way of getting them to the lab. Oh, no kidding. So you were kind of like the Easter bunny, but you were collecting blood samples basically. Oh, that was folks. What was the question? I forgot. I can't remember. Gaino. He said, um, yeah. Yeah. So generally what happens in the process of Gaino is you get information. That information causes sensitivity. That's where you get the itchy feeling. If that information isn't dealt with, then you start to develop the actual tissue. Once you have established Gaino, yes, you are going to be predisposition to get it worse. So you are going to be slightly more sensitive and your risk of increasing does increase. So you do have to be a little bit more guarded in regard to how your manageries should do and protect yourself from Gaino. I don't believe, but I may be wrong, but I don't leave because of the information that you will get progressive Gaino without getting sensitivity. But I'm not fucking, I've been proven wrong so many times. There's, there's every possibility that there will be someone out there who's grown a pair of absolute full-blown double-dits and it's just walk out when they're in there. Yeah, and just and never had any sensitivity whatsoever. So, but in general, it's information sensitivity first, then it's time to submit the tissue. I believe that once tissue is formed, you can get the information anti-sugarov simultaneously because you've already got an existing growth there so that can increase without going through an information stage first. So yeah, I mean that's basically where I'm at with it. I mean the idea would be surgery, but that's not always successful. I've seen a few people have surgery one more recently and they still got very large swellings post surgery that don't seem right at all to me. But they are responding to certain medications we added cable in because we weren't getting anywhere without an yeast for a total which I found really straight. I've this has been really confusing to me. I really don't know what the hell's going on. So, is yeasting wasn't particularly high? He's supposed to have all the gland removed, but the swellings are significantly larger. I mean we're not talking, you know, we're talking big. Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah. And then no joy. Proacting wasn't particularly out of range, wasn't really concerned about it. And so we put in cable and that seems to have had a really positive effect on swellings, but his issues had been in range, it just just didn't make any sense to me whatsoever. I really find it an odd one. But we're able to check other forms, other issues like astron. No, fortunately we're not. We're stuck with E2 which, which yes, there is that. I mean we've tried a combination of A-decks and Nova. Yeah. He didn't seem to have any impact whatsoever. A very mind. His test levels are not pretty. Yeah. Okay. So, everything sort of out. I mean, I was at one point convinced there was some sort of infection going on. About as soon as he took the cable, the swellings dropped significantly. I'll tell you what, I think that there are far more cases of gyno than people think. And when I say that, I mean, some level, some tiny amount of growth. If you were to check everybody build their out there, even if you don't see it, there's been some level of development. Even if it's very small, even if it's unnoticeable. And once you do have that, then you are going to be more sensitive in the future. But I still, I still do think that I'm with you that you're, you're going to, you're going to feel symptoms before that continues to become a problem. I think that once you've, once you've got it, you're going to be more sensitive. And then the key, and this is regular situations. I'm not talking about your specific case, Dave. But once you got it, then you just need to be more careful moving forward to make sure you stay on top of it, make sure that you're vigilant. You know? Yeah. It does require more sensitive management. Once you've got it, yes. So I don't know who this is because it says Facebook user. It says Guy Noe for Natural Guys, as well. So I had Sudo-Gina Commastia as a kid. All right. So I didn't even know what it was. In, in, in fact, it wasn't until I got into bodybuilding that I, I recognized. Oh, wow, I had Guy Noe as a kid. But I, I noticed like, I just remembered like I'd have, I'd put a shirt on, and it would brush my nipple and it would hurt. And sometimes my nipple get real sensitive. And the, the males on my dad's side of the family were like, heavy or chested too. So one of the reasons I actually got into bodybuilding was I was like, man, I don't like the shape of my chest. Because it like, I had like fat down on the lower part of my chest. And I was like, I want to get in shape. If I were to do a bunch of bench press, then that will make my pack look the way I want it to, you know? Lo and behold, it did help. But I just had a fatty deposit. Sudo-Gina Commastia, though, there's no gland. So I got fat development, but I didn't have any gland issues. I don't have any swollen glands. And that happened as a teenager from natural testosterone level. So yeah, you definitely can get it as a natural guy. There's no question about that. I ended up getting LIPO when I was like close to 30. I got into bodybuilding and, and I saved up my money and I was like, you know what? I just want to get this sucked out of my chest because it really had changed the way I felt about myself. It wasn't expensive. But if you do, if you do have a gland, you need to get that cut out. And generally people want to go to a good plastic surgeon. If you go to your general surgeon, they're going to see that as a tumor. And this is going to be a tumor removal surgery. Like they're doing that to protect you, to protect your health. They're not doing it for aesthetics. And you can end up having issues with the look after work. Versus a plastic surgeon is going to remove the tissue. But then they're also going to contour the pack. So you're not going to have like a crater where your nipple once was. All I took from that was Scott used LIPO to prep for coma. I should go back, man. Let's get sucked out of the lower back, crush the abs. I'll tell you what I did notice Dave, when I'd get in shape after that. Like a decade later, I didn't compete for like another, seven years or so. But when I would compete, my chest would get in shape first. I would see striations in my packs long before I had striations anywhere else. But it was worth it to me. You know what I mean? It was worth it to me because it really affected my well-being and stuff. And as a kid, nobody tells you about that stuff. You know what I mean? It's like nobody tells you about those things. And the 90s are just like, hey, just live with it. It's just part of being a kid. What else do we have here, Dave? Okay, so guy who's doing TRT. He says, doesn't matter if your test is dosed at 250 or 350 or 400, assuming he's still using his actual dose. No, I would say the only thing I'd be wary of is I'm always very wary of test doses when he start the claiming to be the round the 400 mark. Yeah. Because generally that high-level concentration is going to hurt like fuckers. If you did a full meal. But as long as you lower your volume to accommodate for the higher concentration, then you're taking exactly the same dose. It makes them a difference. But undoubtedly, I'd be concerned that anything around the 400 mark is actually not dose to what it should be. And I would generally go for a lower dose test as a TRT product because you've got more chance to be correct. Yeah, I'd agree with that. We had somebody the livestream say, I had a buddy when light heavy weights and overall back in the day using 300 tests in 30 var. He built his base years earlier on much more. But he looked damn great at the low doses that he prepped on. One thing I didn't add is it's all going to come down to body fat. If you get absolutely peeled, then you're going to look great on anything you take. It sounds like that was a case with this guy, the light heavy. David, would you do a flat barbell press? Where does the bar fall on your chest? Above or below the nipple or right on it? More or less on it. I would just wait, depends on what part of the pack I'm wanting to focus on. Really, you would change that? So yeah, I mean, if I want to do incline on a flat, say it for argument, say, let's say I've got a chin, you know, because obviously I'm in poor old England that we have no kit and no electric and no running water and we still shit in a box down the bottom of the guard. I thought that's the lead list over there, but I never wanted to offend you by talking about it. Okay, yeah, wow. So, you know, it's fascinating. I trained in only had one bench and that was flat. So if you want to do an incline, you want to just barbell to the neck. Yeah, you could get a rock. You could get a rock and put it under the bench, Dave. So you just benched the neck to get your upper pack. But yeah, no, I would generally aim for sort of mid lower sort of nipple and lower third of the pack. That would be sort of where I'd hit my bar. Yeah, I mean, you go lower than that. I think it's too polished in price. It dominated. I also like to keep the elbows wide as well. Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm like above the nipple bottom third of the pack somewhere in there. But I think a lot of it as well is I think this is where a lot of people go or don't spend enough time doing this is to play with movements to discover where your sweet spot is. Yeah. So you get a moderate way. Something that you know is enough resistance to feel but it's not over taxing and then you, you know, you go right, whether I come here, what have I come here, what have I tracked there, what have I put me over there, whatever go out and inch on my finger grip. And you play around until you find the spot that really hits it and then they are, you know, you just use your brain and your body's feedback to work out where you need to be. Yeah. Part of the reason I bench the way I benches because it doesn't hurt my shoulders. You know what I mean? It's like that's a big factor right there. What doesn't hurt? I mean, I used to be really weird with Benching and I ended up carrying over into all sets. Not all, oh, sorry, all exercise, not all sets. When I go heavy, like on my heavy set, my first rep would be a half rep. And that was because of the torn peck. There's so much scar tissue in my left peck that as it came down, I could feel it pulling. Oh yeah. So always a bit nervous. So the first rep was a half rep. Then I went back up then I'd come down and touch. And I wouldn't count that first, right? But it would be almost like my staging rep just so I got the feel and then I'd go. Yeah, look at further. I ended up starting, yeah, I ended up starting doing that in Scott's, when my first squat was a half rep that I went full depth on the second one. And I got that ended up creeping into a lot of exercises, but it was actually born of the injury to my peck. I had something here, had a big favor to ask you, Dave. Okay, you want me to read something, don't you? Yeah, yeah. So guys, here was my thought. I feel like Dave could be really good. If he could just, if he wanted to, he could start doing evil. Although you guys would still need your blood worked on, so he needs to keep doing that. Just basically he could retire and he could start just like reading books on tape, but you know, for audible stuff like that. So there's a book in a movie that I've never seen or read, called the Hobbit. Have you heard of this? May, how? Yes. You may have. I was wondering, would you do me a favor? Can you see this here? This is the first line. This is the first line from the Hobbit. Can you, can you read this for me? Because I'm, and I'm going to just sit back and I'm going to pretend like I'm just like relaxing. I've got a half hour off and I'm going to, maybe I'm going to read it for a bit. I'm going to listen to my book on tape as read by Dave Krosslin. In a hole in the ground, they're lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and they knew they smell. No. Yet a dry bear, some de-hole, with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat. It was a Hobbit hole and that means comforts. That was good. That was really good. What do you think? Are you solved? I think you're being sarcastic. No, that was really good. I mean, maybe we got to look a little more base, a little more base to your voice. We could do another take and I think we could even get a better but just as a dry run, I'm fucking solved. That's all I got to say. Okay. Well, on that part, you owe me a hundred pounds for that reading. Actually, we probably, we probably owe the people who have that book. I think we're going to get demonetized now. We also had another comment. I could see Dave with a double-headed battle axe if he takes up the mid-eval doing. That way he doesn't have to run around that much either way. No, what I want is I want the axe, where he's an axe blade on one side and he's a hammerhead on the other side. Oh yeah. So I've got both sharp and blunt attacks depending on who I'm buttered. Okay, because you spin it around, right? Yeah. Do you have your big hammer in there somewhere? Still? Do you keep... No, make millions and it won't monster gyms and monster clothing? Yeah. It is now in his possession. Oh, no kidding. You gave it to him or he stole it from you. Yeah. No, no, I love it to him. I was a president because I knew we would appreciate you and get it for it. That was a very nice of you, Dave. He has like a Hora museum. Oh, really? Bainey film, I'm a member of Illya, so he's been added to that collection. Guys Dave was in a movie. It was a German film, was it? Yeah. It was in a short German film. We should revisit your television commercials again. We haven't done that in one time. Your appearances. Yes, I was in the man with the hammer. Yep. And that was the German film. And then I did something full, Lemme say, which is still available on you, shape. We did watch that one and that's where you were like running around and stuff. Yeah. And then obviously there's my two films. Yeah, of course. But you've done other stuff too. You were on there's a... Oh, the pig might have rowinook. The pig might have rowinook. Although you didn't get a good look at Dave. You just saw this big opposing figure. And that was released in the U.S. I saw that. But there was on travel channel. There was like another commercial. It's not like audible. It was something... I can't remember what you were doing in it. I've thought there was the readly odd what I actually did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, readly. I wonder if we could find that one. That would be a good one. I should look for it and we'll bring that up guys. If you can think of anything the best one was the bounty advert. No plenty. So the total, the batch, the kitchen tissue, kitchen top. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder if I could find that one sheet. That got banned. No, it got banned. I can't find it anywhere. Oh, why did it get banned? Sexual in Uganda. Oh, really? Yeah, it's because Dave had a moody helmet and one sheet needed to polish my helmet with the kitchen top. Okay. Honestly, that was the biggest laugh ever filming that. Because we must have done 50 takes because every time we did to take someone cracked up laughing. Yeah. So the guy in the ad sheet is a Spanish guy called one sheet because it only takes one sheet of this kitchen top, the clean and premise. How do you hold down a set? Let me, let me just go to YouTube by you tell the story. I'm going to look. How do you, is it like J. U. A. N. Yeah. And he's accent sounds like he's a put on Spanish accent. It's not that's how he really talks. Okay. So he, they did a series of adverts. And one of them was how tiny Dave has a moody helmet. Okay. And he stood facing camera. I'm dressed as a bike and I've got a bike a helmet under my arm that's got basically a lumbar bird shit on the front of it. Okay. And the wheel me in on this platform and it was so clunky and an amateur issue. But it was supposed to look like that. It was supposed to look really stupid. Yeah. So they wheel me in and the rope pulling the platform broke. So they then had to lay on the floor and try and push me in at a camera shot. And just everybody just crack up laughing constantly. And then he says, this is my friend, tiny Dave, even tiny Dave has a moody helmet. And it only takes one sheet to polish Dave's helmet. And every time he delivered this line, somebody in the crew pissed themselves laughing. We got to find him. We just have to kept and then we couldn't do anything for laughing. Anyway, got banned. And I cannot get a copy of it anywhere. I've tried. Guys, if you can find that, the one sheet, with Dave as a bicycleist, right? That's what you're saying. Like that kind of bike or? No, no bike or bike or mobs or bike. I love a jacket. Big helmet. Oh, about. Okay. Okay. If you guys can find that, let us know, send it to me, make the alley dites at Gmail or send it to Dave. We got to get that on here. We got a couple more questions. Has it been covered on he said, D and stuff. And it draw raises blood glucose. Right. Now this came up in, where did this come up? Might be on the page. That's where I got it from. Yeah. Yes. So looking at there seems to be too, too, almost opposing sets here. When you look at research around antibiotics, generally they will lower BG and increase insulin sensitivity. I thought it was the weird noise. Hang on. No, no, no. Just listen. Okay. Okay. However, with the case of anobotanodrol in diabetes, it has the opposite effect. But there are studies that show an increase in, because I actually bought a study on the page that showed an increase in BG sensitivity. Okay. Yeah. I've always heard the opposite the antibiotics will lower sensitivity. Interestingly, so I'll tell you what. I mean, but if you're seeing research, there's that. I spoke to him. I've a look on the page. I'll take a look at it. I spoke to a client who has type one, former client, worked with him in the past. And I asked him what his experience has been. And he said that he noticed the opposite effect. And he said that NPP was the biggest standout that he found that he was getting a lowered blood sugar. Yeah. That's what the research I was looking at stated. Yeah. I've always heard and thought that antibiotics would interfere with blood sugar. But I'm not saying I'm right. You have to look at the, uh, I'll pull that up. And that would be a good question to get Dr. Scott to weigh in on two, I think. We did get asked that a while back. And we never, we never dug into it. Yeah. I mean, I had a quit look and there was, there was definitely data around worsening people with existing conditions. But there was, there was a study showing an increase in insulin sensitivity with the use of animal weight. Okay. Okay. I believe. And I pulled that, I pulled that study on the page. So if you pulled that up, and hopefully, now you've got me thinking, did I, did I fucking make this up in my head? No, no, no, I mean, I, I'm taking a word on it. Let's, let's, let's, uh, let's come back to it at some point. I can't pull it up at the minute. Why don't they? Um, because people don't want to see me just sit here as scroll down. That's what you know me. All right. Does anyone use a mouth guard for sleep apnea? If so, what brand do you like? This is from Brandon over at the, uh, the Facebook group for Think Big. He says, I'm not big enough to need a CPAP yet, but I was told recently that occasionally I stopped breathing and gasped in my sleep, hoping a mouthpiece will help some. I think it needs to get a sleep study done. Yeah, I've never had any experience. I went straight to a CPAP machine. So I've never had any experience. Um, to, um, to the mouth guard. So I don't know if they're any good. Yeah. Here's what I noticed is I thought that I, I, I'm much like him, I would occasionally wake up gasping or I'd occasionally snore, but it was minimal. And then when I got tested, they're like, oh, yeah, no, you, you woke up like 250 times in an hour. You know, like you just don't, you don't know it because you immediately fall back to sleep. So it's like you just come into consciousness and back out and you're not even aware that it's happening if you have sleep apnea. If it's bad enough that you actually wake up gasping, those are like the worst moments, the absolute worst moments, but generally there's going to be other moments, you know, that that you don't really register. So I would say a sleep study would be the route to go. And if you need to CPAP, then that's more important than just for bodybuilding. You know, that's for your health as well, right? I've got that study by the way. Okay. What you got? So it says Oxymethylone emelorates insulin sensitivity in maintenance, he medialisers patients. And it looks at it and it basically says that patients by increasing skeletal muscle function is stimulated in myocyc glucose, of Jacob Metabolism, through the use of Oxymethylone, HD patients treated with short-term oral oxymethylone showed an increase in insulin sensitivity when compared to the placebo group. Okay. The way I'd always understood it was that even if you have, even if the pancreas is releasing insulin, that the antibiotics will trigger the liver to continue releasing glucose. Okay. I believe there's some action around the gluten-corder-coated receptor as well. And S-S-S-I-B-G, but I'm not sure exactly what that is. We could have a look at Eve, you want for next week. Yeah, let's do that. Let's do that. Remind me. Dave? She's an odd question for the new Game of Thrones, prequel. What for? The fat. I'm bastard of the city's in the corner. Dave, you've got to be nicer to yourself. I am nicer to myself. I'm just honest, that's all. I'm very nice to myself. I'm having a ginger coffee. It sounds terrible. When I just drink regular coffee, that's a ginger coffee. Does I have like ginger in it? Or is it for redheads? Yes, Dave. Dave's just looking at me now. I feel uncomfortable. We've got one more. We also have Uncle Dave's advice for the day. We need some wisdom. Scott, do you have a neighborhood watch scheme where you live? I don't know why. Just one. All right, one more. He says um, question for the podcast and the audience. Oh, okay. Have you guys ever experienced the feeling of warmth, heat while taking gear? I don't mean compounds like it's clean, DNP, crazy stuff. I mean regular basic gear. In my case, I'm currently on 450 tests, 400 EQ per week, and I feel as if it's summer, and it's actually not. Outside, it's about 15 to 17 degrees. But when I go out wearing a sweatshirt or jacket, I still feel like you'll go outside wearing a sweatshirt and jacket because he doesn't feel like he needs to wear a heavy coat, basically. He's hot all the time on cycle. Yep. Yeah. Yep. My wife didn't, my wife just turned the heat enough in the house and just used me as a radio. Yeah. You ever noticed, you can, if you close the door, like you can heat the battery up overnight. Like you get like hot and musty, especially Dave 350 pound man, it would be like having like some sort of one of those anabolic, um, myhosted and negative cows, the big, the big bulls all beefed up, you know? She, she used to actually complain. I made the bed too hot. Yeah, I've heard that myself. Yeah. So yes, it does my friend. Don't worry about it. It's an increasing your metabolic pathways, your metabolism of everything, an increasing energy turnover, which has a side effect of generating heat. Yes. So wisdom of the day, Dave. Oh, I haven't really got any to the, you can't, but you're just, you're filled with wisdom, I know. You're really, really, really pleased to meet today. You've just uncle Dave's advice, you know, this is, you, you have one thing that you need to prepare each week, Dave. Other than that, you just show up and then you blame me with anything goes wrong. I'm lucky you look here, show it up today. Why? I don't know, just, you know, I just, I don't know, I'm just, I've got a soul recently, Miller. The people in this year, Dave, by the way, and we did get a lot of messages to people saying, like, hey, we hope that Dave is well and covers from his, his personality, so, so, just, just, just, just for this, into context. A lot of these. The procedure I'm having is actually as a procedure, very, very simple, it only lasts 20 minutes. I'm in hospital for a total of four to five hours. That's it. The procedure's not particularly complex. Yes, there is a risk of infection post that needs to be monitored. But, over the, that, that, the, the, the problem element is whether this bastard machine starts firing or not. Because if that does, then it starts to impact me quite significantly. And we won't know how the machine is going to read me until it's in me. You don't want it to fire, right? No, no. If it fires at stage one, I'm not allowed to drive for a month. If it fires at stage two, I'm not allowed to drive for six months. Let me ask you a question. Real, real talk. That is it. But, will you, will you actually not drive for six months? That actually can I? I would, I would find it very difficult. Yeah. Um, though I must admit, Boss Lady would probably be very strict on trying to enforce it. Yeah. Do you have to hide your food? I would find it. I would find it very difficult. Yes. There's no denying that. I don't for one second pretend that. But, so, the, the problem is potentially just getting a thing tuned into me, which can take a bit of time. So, we are above that. It's, it's not something I need now. It's something they want in now. So, it's ready for when I do need it in 10 years time. Um, so that's, that's a, please guys, though I appreciate the, the concerns I genuinely do and thank you for them. Don't stress, it's nothing major. Honestly, it is not a big deal. As long as I think doesn't start firing afterward. Well, that just makes it really inconvenient for me if it starts firing, because we start firing stage two. That fucker. Yeah. Yeah. Can we try it just like once? Is there an external button that I can press sometimes? Just try and keep on doing. You can fuck. You can fuck about with it if you put a magnet in there. So, we can, I'll get a magnet, we can play around. Get a good couple strong magnets and here we can do. Um, and the other inconveniences that this is as high as I can take my arm. I'll do it on this arm, but it's my left arm. This is high as I can take my arm for eight weeks. Jesus. Get your sugar, your cardiot. Yeah, but it sits in a pocket. They create my left back. So, and the wire goes from the machine down into my heart. So, if I lift my arm, it lifts the back and then pulls the wire, the wire will get moved out of position, because it needs to seat and root and obviously flesh the around it scar tissue all the advice. So, you're going to basically be a cyborg. I'm aiming on it. I've always wanted to be a cyborg. Yeah. I think that's a very wonderful. Yeah. I would happily lose this wrist at the moment. It is give me some shit today. Really. Dave's advice. Let me think. You can't say keeps winning. Why? Yes, my default one. Can't say it. He said it so many times. I didn't even know about that movie until you told us. And then I cut, you didn't know this because you never watch our show. When you actually did that one, I cut out, I got that video and I cut out the part where that little fish says that and I added it into the show. It's the best advice I've had given on any film in the history of mankind, isn't it? Yes, it's win. It really has been a nice. It's simple, but it's true. So, there you go. I don't even have to tell you this. I may have done this in passing. I'm old. I'm losing my memory. I think I'm going to see now. So, I forget your shit very regularly. Blame it under deck. Yes. Blame it under deck. You'd definitely. What was what's decker? Who used decker? What? Dave used to be a bodybuilder. Yeah, he did the movie. That's why my dick's so small. Ah! The... everything in life has a cost, has a price. It's always worth taking the time to make sure you understand the cost. Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything we do. There's no free anything. There is a price somewhere long-line. You may not immediately or directly pay it, but come a day where it's due to be paid. Yeah. Yeah, I'm with that 100%. So, when you're looking at things and you're trying to make decisions and this is about anything, the old adage of it, the deal is too good. It probably is. It's true. Everything has a price. Yeah, I go with that. And where we usually come on stock is where we agree to purchase whatever. And I don't mean purchase with money. I mean purchases in time, investment, effort. Whatever we do. Yeah. Without fully realizing what it's going to cost as long-term. Yeah, I'd go with that, man. There's no question. So, names are just financial. So, names are the other words. Yeah, yeah, no. Sometimes it makes sense. It's otherwise. And I find the only other thing I would also say, and it's a very old saying is don't put off for tomorrow what you can do for today. Very old saying, but very true. If you have the time and you have things to do, do them. Yeah. Because the sooner you clear your sheet, if this shit does happen to it, the fund and next day, you're not still trying to do with a crap you should have dealt with the day before. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. There are two things. Yeah. Yeah, but I'll work with you today. Probably about 10 reports. So, it's not too bad. Two submission reports. Review and finalize a police report send out. And I think that's... Orders from Kenologue. Some water, some water, canologue. What's Kenologue? It's a... Heavy-vid drug. So, you do one shot and then it stops you getting heavy-vid all year. Oh, no, Kenny. Is that for you or for a client, customer? For me, but it also works well with arthritis as well. Oh, no, Kenny. Let's go do now. So, you had just little bits and bats really, a few clients, bits and bats and stuff like that. So, it probably another four hours. All right. Probably tell me about seven or seven. Yeah. I've got, uh, I'm just getting my day started. So, after we get done, I'm going to do my, uh, my check-ins and edit the shows. Keep things rolling. We've got to get you on, um, we've got to get you on, uh, it's just bodybuilding one day soon. Are they allowed? Yeah, we wanted, we wanted you there for a long time. I didn't think I would come up to standard to be on such a steep slope. Yeah. We've wanted you ever since the start day, since episode one. So, you see, when it comes to think of bodybuilding media people, you have, Scott Stevenson is like the penthouse. He's the top floor. He's the posh stuff. Okay. He's smart. He's a smart guy. Yeah. Then you've got the bodybuilding nerves and the other one. Well, bodybuilding nerves doesn't happen anymore. That shows over. Oh, okay. I don't have another name as it is shows, but you've got the other one we'd run and dust in everything and that's like your midrange, good value for money, high quality product. And then this show is like the basement where it's all stuff from two seasons ago that nobody wants. You can buy a full wardrobe for a pound. You know, this is where we sit. This is, bargain basement, everything pile. It's like when there's still selling cassette tapes at a service station and then they'd like 25 bands for 30. You know, because that's the other end of all. That's this show. Yeah. That's the show. Well, it makes for a good crossover. We got a funny comment, actually. I think I was trying to say it and it didn't come out, but somebody said it for me. Remember that picture of you and Ron and Dusty and Christmas cabbage together, this one here? Somebody said, Dave looks like a kid from the Make a Wish Foundation. I do look very special needs. I can't even argue with that. That's why we love you, Dave. You have a good sense of humor. You can make fun of yourself. That is definitely a full blow show, boss window-looking fucker that's a shout out. Well, we got to getcha in that show. So the guys are going to Kologne. I'm not going with him this year. It was not invited. But then again, though, I don't feel like I really connected to a lot of people at Kologne. The German audience and the England, excuse me, the German and the European audience, they were different than the UK people. They're like a little bit more standoffish, versus UK people were like, oh, hey, Scott, what's going on, man? I love the shows. In the US, they're like that, but even more. You go to Europe and they're like, oh, hello. Yeah, what's in that product there? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, have a nice day. By the way, I like your podcast. They say it as they're walking away. I'm like, why don't you just leave with that? I didn't even know you knew who I was, you know? Oh, yeah. Um, my reserve. I've never been to Feebo. I saw what I've wanted to go. Yeah. But at the same time, I'm not sure if I can cope with that much bodybuilding. It's only one room about a building. The rest of it is like, dude, we would have so much fun if we just went there to just go and walk around. I, in fact, that would be like a solid fun day. I wouldn't want to go back for the second, third or fourth day. But if we just went there for one day, we could go to the bodybuilding expo. And then there's basically like, you know, the Arnold is this in the US. It's huge, right? And that's just one building, one room. The, the Feebo is like multiple rooms just like that. But they're all different. So like we could go to the gym equipment, why didn't go look at all the machines, go get some lunch and then go to the other gym equipment, why didn't we go to the gym equipment? That's what I mean. It's all sort of bodybuilding issue. And I don't know if I can cope with that much bodybuilding. Yeah. So I'm going to have a day in this week. Oh, yeah, yeah, you mentioned that. Yeah. So we drive up for a day, um, seven hours a day. And then we've got the show on Sunday and we're doing a stand at the show on Sunday as well. So they're low key for us, point of view and not pointing anything up or anything. Okay. Are you guys doing labs there? Yeah. Yeah. What's it doing? Let's, uh, and then the weekend after we're in Glasgow for the PCI Scotland. Oh, okay. And when you guys set up something like that, will you do like bloodletting right there on the spot too? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. We, we, we generally for event like that, what we'll do is we'll take a few runners and we'll just screen off round the chair so it's semi-private. Yeah. Um, we don't bother with 10 or that side of things. It's too much hassle for the venue and it's too much hassle for us to be quite fair. Because it means taking a van where we can just take a, oh yeah, we've ordered our new. Stund. Oh, really? Yeah. Custom built no stand. What do you mean? Like what's a new stand gonna be like that? Oh, God, don't you? It's right. But it's like the background and stuff, like the booth. You're me. So, so yeah, what we're doing, we're sticking with our lava inflatable. Okay. But what we've decided is so the big, big tent, the two, the two, TD 10, it's just, it's just too big and it's too impractical. So we're, we're getting rid of that. Complete, we're gonna sell that. We're keeping big red because it's still a good tent and well known and recognised. We have a white box that's for me as by for me is that we use for small events to create a clinical room. Okay. Yeah. And then we're getting a new stand, but we're getting stand elements as well so it becomes modular. Stand on, man. Yeah, so I know that sounds a bit weird. So what we're gonna have is we're gonna have a main stand part which is gonna be like six by four. Yeah. Yeah. That's really not for me as high. Yeah, and three and a half meters high. But then we're gonna have, now that will work for the Arnold's because we can't afford to go any bigger than that at the Arnold's. But then for like fittings where we get more space. Yeah. We've got over elements that we will then fit in that extra space that becomes sort of modular. And then if we're doing a small show, we can take one of these modular elements and put it at that show as a part of marketing piece. And there's all sorts of mud stuff we're doing. But it's all a bit fun. It's all a bit of a laugh stuff. It's not serious stuff. Okay. Well, like the sounds of this. So all being well because fittings mantis are in five weeks. So all being well they're trying to have everything ready for fittings mantis. Okay. That's fantastic, man. Well, I hope that it works out in time. And yeah, guys, go to evellblutonalsys.com. You can get your lab work done by Dave or show up at one of these events. If you're in the UK, you can literally, you don't even have to make an appointment, right? You just walk in and be like, hey, Dave, I need to get my lab's checked, right? Not the events. Yeah. We don't do any booking system at the events just turn off. There you go. Plus like vitamin IVs. You guys do that kind of stuff there, too. We do. Yes. We do. Yeah. You need to book if you're going to a clinic. But if you're going to one of the events, not the chimney vents, all that expi events, these holes just walk in. You go to www.trudetrition.com. Use our code, think over there for everything you need, high-quality protein powders, carb powders, and basically at wholesale prices, use our code, think to get additional savings, strong sports nutrition. You're going to need to shop at strong to help out rich because Rick had the the pectare, which I don't want to put the picture up. You showed me the pectare. It's all down as arm is purple now. But he's going to need to pay for that surgery somehow. So buy some strong products to help Rick out, right? Yeah. And he's not that good at sex. So he can't work it off. And supplement source.ca for our Canadians. Guys, comment below with questions for the next show in for another episode of the D& Stuff podcast. Guys, we'll see you soon. Thanks Dave.

Yeah, and Agua Boys, by the way, is not prescribed to anybody. It is not really serious. No, it's not FDA approved, right? It's a veterinary drug. Let's get that. Hence the name, Equa. Equaim. Four Seeds. And Abolki is 100. Andogenic is 50. So it's a trying to broke far from a point of view of low sides. Yeah, definitely 125-37. So slightly less immediately stressful. It's slightly better on the metabolic side if you want to use those markers as guidelines. And I would say that actually reflects when you're using it. Deca's issues are instantaneously physical. What's up guys? Welcome back to the podcast. With Dave Crossley and I'm Scott McDaley and all of our programming is brought to you by you. The people of Patreon. Thank you very much for your support. We've got a couple of Patreon questions today. Leave questions over there. I'm going to put up a new thread after I record this show. We are brought to you by evalblutanalysis.com. If you're in the UK, well, you're on gear, then you definitely need to get your labs done. But you should get your labs done anyway, and you can do that through Dave at evalblutanalysis.com. We are brought to you by Strom Sports Nutrition. Check them out in the UK or the US for great health stacks, especially if you're on cycle. I'm taking the thrombo max right here. In fact, I got to take my thrombo max because I forgot to do it already. We're also brought to you by SupplementSource.ca for Canadian to have great deals at changeweek. We can turnutrition.com, use our code, think to get 10% off all your basic bodybuilding supplements. They have high quality protein, creatinine, and interworkout, stuff like that. Dave, you look terrible, man. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? My day yesterday started at 5am. Okay. Fair enough. He ended at about 1am. What happened? What happened? I started again today at about 5am, so this month. Did you get a rate for me? No, one is rather tired. You know what? I even got some new car parts today, and I'm not even excited about them. I'm not tired. Oh, geez. Why? What did you deal? What was so busy about yesterday? I took it up early and started crack onto work because I had to drive to Oxford at 10am. Crack on. That ended up being 6 hours to get down there. Then it was like 3 hours of work, turn around, come straight back. We nightcloses and everything else that seems to happen in this country now. Got home, just after midnight. That's a sort of few things for the winter bed. And then I'd get back up and try and crumb two days work in one. So at this point, I'm in bit. So we can take it advantage of Dave and his weekend state today. There will be a lot of yawning today much more than normal. Alright, well listen. I've got a topic for us. This was based off of a listener question over on Patreon. And we of course have all of our listener questions. Dave, we have a lot of listener questions today. The topic is aqua poise versus nanderloin. That's an angelone period. You could call it, you know, daca and pp. Aqua poise versus nanderloin for muscle gains. I think it'll be an interesting conversation because I know you stand in one side of that fence and I stand on the other. Yeah, so I mean for anybody who's new. You're an angelone fan. You prefer daca any day of the week, right? No, the table will do hate it with never use it. Oh, so you're I'm an EQ fan personally. I found that for me aqua poise was an absolute game changer and there's a lot of people who agree with me. But here's a deal, man. First time I ran it, Dave. Yeah. Five milligrams of anava. That's all you have in it. Let's tell you ever need. Yeah, well, we're talking for parkour body building purposes here. This is not here. All right, plus seven milligrams of. Yeah, no, I mean, I think if you looked at the two drugs non scientifically and just looked at how you feel and the progress you get on them. Yeah. They do seem to be very, very similar in how people actually feel, you know, in a sense of muscular gain strength gain and everything. I would say, personally, that underlone is the slight edge for my metabolic point of view over EQ. EQ has some immediate disadvantages. One being, well, ones are positive and negative, which is the estrogen side of things because it is a very impressive anti-estrogen. There can be a little bit too much so. And the other thing is a blood thing, but having said that, the decor is much more impacting from a health point of view long term. So you've got the value of ask of the risk with Deca, you've got the memory issues with Deca, and you've got the immediate which seems to be more common these days and never used to be. It's the mental health side of things, more and more people are reporting depression episodes with Deca, which no one ever used to mention. So I don't know if that's just because they didn't say anything or it didn't happen or what I really can't. Or it's just that there's a big, a pool of users now, so you get a more broad spectrum range of sides. I don't know. But so yeah, I don't think. I personally still lean slightly over towards Deca, but if I'm being serious and not taking the piss, I would say from a natural results point of view, the drugs are quite similar. I mean, one of the downsides of Deca is, it is a bit slow. It is a bit of a long term. It's not back at our EQ, it is a bit slow. Yeah, yeah, it is a bit of a long term. And obviously you do have the fast act in version of MPP with Wendell and if you want to go that route. So there is some variety there, you can play with. So I mean, but yeah, to me Deca's got the edge, but it's not huge. It's not huge, and EQ do offer some, just offer some unique little properties that can be very useful, depending on the circumstances of which you apply. So let me ask you this, do you know offhand or do you maybe have notes somewhere about the anabolic androgenic ratio of both EQ and Deca? I know that I'm just dropping that on you. I thought you might have some more. Now I can then your computer. I can find it very quickly. Okay. I do have. I mean, I'll memory. I think Deca's 50, and a genie about one third, you won't fall in anabolic. So it's actually quite an attractive profile that way. 50, androgenic. So testosterone being 100 to 100. So half is anrogenic is testosterone and then one point five times as anabolic. Yeah. It's not that literal, but it gives you a guide. I mean, originally the profiles were originally the profiles were doing on just these androgenicity compared to its own anabolic potential. Okay. And then the chain, all doing rats as well. Then they changed it was prostate was the undergenic effect, and a muslin that hit was the anabolic effect marker. And originally it was like one to two, one to one point one, and it was, you know, anabolic against anrogenic within that compound. And then what they said is they wanted a better sort of comparison for actual overall strength of the drug. So that's when we start getting the high end numbers. Okay. But it's widely recognized now that this is just a rough guide and straight retekin as a literal comparison. It does give you an idea of what you're looking at what sort of you've played and that way without drug. Hey. Well, he's with a fox. Bolden on the side of the neck. Here we go. So anabolic is a hundred undergenic is 50. So it's attractive profile for a point of your flow sides versus potential. Yeah. Uh, I found an angeline. I found Aquapoys to work for a couple female competitors that didn't do well with DHTs. I've worked with some girls who, in fact, you know what I'll tell you what man, something very interesting. Dave, one girl that I work with long term now. She, she never produced a estrogen like she always had low estrogen. She had been on the pill since she was just a kid as a, you know, she was raised as a dancer and, you know, highly controlled menstruation and all that. Uh, as she was a child into, you know, so you come off of that. She never produced good hormones. She never responded well to, um, and of our, we got her on a really good hormone replacement program now. And believe it or not, man, now she's doing great with just a low dose of, I think it was like five milligrams of anava that we're using at the time. With a bump in the test up just a tiny bit, but her, she's done in the past before all that. She had done really good with EQ as a growth compound with just a tiny bit of test mixed in to, you know, I, my VQ and the decade are generally well told by females. I mean, decade was being prescribed to women for decades. Yeah, and Agapoi's, by the way, is not prescribed to anybody. It is not really clear to us. It's not FDA approved, right? No, right? It's a veterinary drug. Let's get that to the end of the name, Equa. Equime. Yeah. Voices. Yeah. Yes. Um, but you know what, it's, I mean, uh, Decorate 125-37. So slightly less immediately stressful, slightly better on the metabolic side. If you want to use those markers as, as guidelines. And I would say that actually reflects when you're using it. Decorate issues aren't instantaneously physical. EQs issues are a little bit more instantaneously felt like not instantaneously, but they are off the time period of usage, where as decades physical impacts are more long-term development of issues around the heart and memory. So, yeah, you know, I would say that those, those readings do actually sort of, fairly well-pun out in the reality of what the drugs do and how you react to them, but you're the very comparable. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I just got me thinking about Equa Poison. I got a, I've got an idea for you. No, here's an advanced idea of cycling wise. Just through my experience, um, you know, fourth, fifth cycle, sixth cycle. Okay. So a third or fourth cycle I did test in deep off, right? I'm going way back in the memory bank. This is like 2005, 2006. Did test, excuse me, test in decad. Yes. 1976, come on. Yeah. That's actually the year I was born. We were not. Um, so here's a deal. Test decad, right? I've talked about that. Then just higher dose, all test, terrible side effects with acne from that. Then from there, I was like, well, why don't I try EQ, test EQ. I was highly disappointed at, I think I had done in the past 500 tests, 400. That got it now. I'm doing 500 tests, 400 EQ. I wrote decad off for a number of years after that. But then later, I came back to it and I dose it high. And when I dose it high, I got tremendous gains off of it down the road from there. And when I say height was like 1.25 grams of tests, 800, 700 EQ somewhere in there. Then down the road from that, I recognize, well, what if, and here's the mind-breaking idea, what if we combined them both together in the same cycle, test with high dose EQ and a small push of NPP for the first eight weeks? I loved that cycle man. That was my all time best growth cycle. I was surprised he was fucking 2 and half-gram again. I'm kidding, just about, I think like, yeah, that was my highest dosing. That was for sure. I think you can do that less though, and I have with clients swapping the dosing down and even changing the ratio. Some people they might do better with, you know, Deca. They might do great with it. I'm thinking to the Deca with a little bit of EQ versus the other way around. Yeah, and I would say that from a progress point of view, if you're looking for a drugs from a progress point of view, they are quite interchangeable. And if you don't get on with Deca, because it makes you feel like you want to slide, you don't want to get up and on it. Yeah. Then EQ would be a viable alternative on the same pitch. You know, if you struggle particularly about where high hemoglobin, because you've got overdrive in factors, and the EQ is to struggle breaks the camels back with it. Then Deca is equally a good alternative either way, just obviously you do have an East Asian management concern with Deca, which you don't have with EQ. Well, you do, where it's the opposite end of it, where the EQ is about East Asian being too low, rather than adding to it, which Deca does provide. Yeah. But yeah, no, I do think they're quite interchangeable compounds from a point of view of what you're getting out of it. You know, when I look at drugs, I look at the goal of the individual, right? Then I look at the drugs that help achieve that goal, right? So I've got a list of drugs, and I've got, this is what the person wants to achieve, so right, well that's no good, that's no good, that's no good, but that's, yep, yep, yep, yep. Then I look at the environment in which I'm pointing those drugs into, so this is the person, variability for adherence and communication and their health. So, you know, someone's got very high levels of body fat, therefore high levels of rheumatase. You're probably going to lean away from heavily rheumatizing drugs, because you know it's going to be an absolute nightmare to manage. If someone's got to fiercely pat me out already struggles with a hemoglobin, well that might knock EQ off the list then, but an oxys off the list then, because we know they have a drive in those areas. And so that's basically what you do, you start with this big long list, cut off what doesn't suit the goal, cut off what doesn't suit the person or the environment and then what's left is what you're building a cycle with. Yep, I don't know. There can be a few ways of doing that. And I think one of the things that you need to remember that when we talk about putting into the environment, it's not just like the physical structure of the person or the physical properties. Or even just their health markers, it's also them as an individual, you know, how good are they at following a diet, how good are they being able to understand what their experience is because we've both spoke to people and ended up needing an hour and a half conversation to just get to the bottom of what the actual symptoms are that they're experiencing. Because they're not good at telling you what's going on. So, you know, if it drugs got complex management, you want someone who can deal with that complex at the end of the point of view of feed you the information you need to know to be able to manage that. So, yeah, there's lots of factors that play into it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what would be the, so one thing I've heard you say before is, is that the problem with DACA isn't the side effects the problem with DACA is the management. How would one get into if they were using the antrolone, how would one get into that in manager properly. So, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that are, there are some side effects that you need to be wary around stuff like the heart implications that DACA provides. But that is a long term thing, and very much not only a dose exposure, but a length of exposure related issue. So, that can still be managed by limiting, you know, the periods of time which you expose. So, DACA does two, two primary issues with DACA, well, three. One is DACA transport proteins, which results in one low mood and two high-productive. Right. Offset that in the first place by taking P5P, former B6, which increases DACA transport protein. So, we have an excess that's start with, which means the reduction then is not significantly impacted. It's what you, you like to start that before the cycle. Well, there's the reason, it's much easier to build that up when things are not being suppressed than it is to try and recover it when they're already suppressed. I like that idea. So, imagine it like a rate, you know, it's easier to get off early and get ahead or get a lead than it is to try and come from the back and catch up when you're a late start. Yeah. So, it's an area. Obviously, if P5P isn't enough, we can move into stronger drugs like care, we'll go to the end of the next. Yeah. Which are, don't mean agonists. And then the other thing is estrogen. Now, it converts at a rate of 20% of tests, so it isn't as much as test, but it does still convert to estrogen, so you just need to factor in that your region levels are going to be slightly higher. And as a result, you are going to need more estrogen management. That would be on that. The rest of it should be fairly steady, because it's not going to give you particularly high BP. Unless you don't manage the estrogen and therefore get water retention, but that will be a combination of the test and the decade together rather than just decade, decade, so much it says, only 20% conversion rate. So, actually, it's quite a lower, romanticizing drug on its own. A lot of people get hung up with progesterone, progesterone generally raises in a cycle scenario because you create stress. It's not particularly vein because the drugs and even it does what you're going to fucking do. Yeah, yeah, I found this bike's very slow. This is also natural on is that if you can control estrogen, you're less likely to have any other side effects than hormonally. That's the number one thing I've always done. Yeah, trend as well. Yeah, same with trend. Yeah, I mean, trend as some issues in a variety is, but you know, it's, it's, it's, but decade generally is, is not going to be hugely impacting on inflame in the body and that sort of thing. Obviously, it's quite supportive of collagen synthesis, so it can very often help with joints and support there as well. And, you know, for a drug that doesn't have a new under a huge hydrogen level, it has a pretty good effect on strength too. Yeah, which sort of defies its profile really because you'd expect to high hydrogen to have good impact on strength, not a low hydrogen like decadereus. But it does have a good binding of the energy which helps with it being an underlant. Yeah. All right. I wonder if there's anything else we should cover on this topic. I guess at the end of the day, man, like I found out for myself, hi, Dekka did not work well for me. And that was just, I had to, I had to run Dekka to figure that out. And it is a matter of trial and error to determine where do you fit in, you know, and that you discovered for yourself. Dekka was great for you. On the other hand, he found EQ was great for me, so we're both examples of, we're both examples of like the right doing the right thing, which was completely different for each of us. Yeah, I mean, look, what the drugs do is completely predictable. All right. This is what the drugs do. They do it every time they do it the same way every time it doesn't change because you're unique and special. Well, you may have to change. Yeah. What changes is your sensitivities to the effects of the drug? Nandrolones lowered dopamine transport proteins. Right. So they increased production. They are Eastogenic. They do convert to East Georgia. That doesn't change in any person. He still does that thing. But the severity of the impact or the amount of change will vary depending on the environment. I eat the persons, their sensitivities. I wish I were over to his, they produce. Yeah. You know, what are they like for dopamine levels in the first place? So, yeah, what, once you know, learn what the drug does. Then when you go into experiment with a drug, which is basically what we're doing a lot of the time, because you don't know what it's going to do in you, because you've not used it before. So you don't know how you're going to react to its effects. Right. To least you know where you're looking. You know what areas you need to watch. You know what areas you need to be concerned with. And you might just be super sensitive to it. You know, and one of my big advantages around using Kiev, but also in a way, a big disadvantage was that I didn't really cat problems with them. Yeah. You know, I could tolerate them at high doses pretty well. So as a result, didn't stop me using high doses where they've had a felt or had major issues. We saw the thing, it would have probably curved my use. He's quite significantly, because I'd be constantly having to deal with a problem. Didn't have that. Did not problems. Yeah. So take your time guys. You know, we talked about your first five cycles in that last episode. Just take that up. You could you could take this information apply it to that. I'd say try one at a time see which, which works better for you. And day by the way, that episode did not do well. Like people didn't want to hear the first five cycles, I guess. Like it just, it wasn't bad. Like we still had all of our normal listeners and everything, but like it didn't really like jump up or do anything special in the YouTube algorithm. Yeah. You know, if you don't put try it in it, nobody wants to know. Yeah. We can't wait them all. I guess. No. But we did get a lot of nice comments. We got a lot of nice comments. People were happy that you were here. Why? Hello. I wanted to do something different with my true nutrition advertisement for today. And here's the thing, I just got our order in Victorian, we pay for all the protein that we get. They don't send us anything for free. And that's because I've believed in true nutrition for 15 years now. I've been using them ever since I contest prep. They have some of the cleanest, best quality protein. A lot of times I use the team skip, but here's the deal. I'm going back to the pure way isolate. The pure way isolate. It just processes so fast. This is my favorite flavor. Chocolate peanut butter cup. But if you want to try just like one pound at a time, you can do that just sample it. I've never had the cookie butter. So I'm going to try the cookie butter this week. I got a big old bag. A pea protein isolate for the wife. This is what she likes to use. And here's the thing. They're just about wholesale prices at true nutrition plus they don't add the flavor in when they weigh it. So you get like legit one pound of protein. And then from there they add the flavor after that. So every one pound, I think it's like one point too. I'm not sure don't quote me on that. But hey, here's the thing. The true nutrition is a great quality protein. They believe in us. They advertise with us because I literally asked them to. And if you use our code, think you'll get some additional savings plus. Of course, that's like voting for our podcast. So thank you guys. I hope you enjoyed my, my impromptu ad. Goodbye. Where's Matinsha? Drop in logs? Drop in logs. You saw the logo. It was put in the Facebook page. I'm Darth Vader, son of Tyler. Same drop in logs. That was good. All right. Listen, we've got a bunch of listener questions. And you know, we try to make the content you guys want to hear. So comment below with your questions. We have a bunch of new people to who found us through the, The, you know, shit episode or ginoshik, depending on where you're from. Johnny Shake. Yeah. Jeno Shake. So comment with your questions plus comments like so that stuff helps to boost our programming. And if you're new here, we'd love to have you along for everything we do. So hit that subscribe button, hit that bell. And there's a hype button now. I don't know about this hype button Dave, but if you hit the hype button, if you see that hype button, hit that hype button, because it'll definitely help to hype us up. All right. Jake. I definitely need some serious hype to know. You do, man. You look like you're still in your housecoat. You look like you just woke up. But it's halfway through the vibe. You leave my fluffy alone. It looks like a housecoat, Dave. Leave my fluffy alone. All right. Listen, so Jake, who's one of our long time viewers listeners. He comments on every episode. Thank you, Jake. He said, uh, I've got a question for the next show. Uh, I want to do my first comp at the end of next year. And I imagine that I'll probably use trend. If I, as I haven't used it before, would it be worth running for six weeks at the end of this coming bulk to see how it affects me? Mostly mental. I was thinking 50 milligrams Monday, Wednesday and Friday of trend A's. So if that doesn't go well, it will clear out quickly when stopped cheers. Hey, Jake's with us right now. What's up, man? You know what? Yeah. I think because he's going to be your first incident. I'll be your first introduction to the drug. Introducing it four or five weeks out from a show. He could transform you for Zika, could also break you. So it might be worth just having a dab also. You sort of get to understand what trend can do. Yeah. And like realistically, if he doesn't, he also doesn't quote unquote need trend to compete. I think sometimes we get it in our heads that we need certain compounds. I've literally had two guys win pro cards without using trend at that show. Or I've got for that matter. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a very effective drug. But it is a costly one in a lot of ways for certain people. And none of this is necessary at the end of the day. Yeah. You know, you don't need, you know, there's a whole world of natural competitors who build good physics and complete drug free. So we don't need them. Obviously you get more extremes with the drugs for a point of view of size. So you don't seem to get extremes in condition. That does still seem to be very firmly rooted in the world of natural for some reason. You can get pretty fricking peeled, man, on gear. Oh, you're not saying you can't, but I generally notice that the standard of condition within the natural's is better than it is within the assistant. I think it can be depending on the level on an average. Yeah. I see this. You only have one card to play as a natural. That's getting the best shape you can because you're not going to out muscle anybody. You know, like, you're, nobody is going to be massive, massive. Oh, sconce at all nice, skinny little shit. Oh, oh, I mean, you know that. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Oh, yeah. But here's the thing, like, I mean, I understand. Yeah. So if you take a PED, you're going to get that advantage. You don't have to take anything, but if you do, you're going to get an advantage. So there's that. I don't think that you necessarily need trend to get that ultimate ripped peeled look. If you think that you can do the exact same thing without it, it would just take other compounds. Yeah. I do think it helps. I think it's a great tool. I think that you're going to get a lot out of it. It might even be easier to do with it. Yeah. But you don't have to. No, no, no, no. All right. What about this one? Good. He's got in David and he experienced her knowledge around Nejala, G-H, which is the long lasting growth hormones supposedly dosed once a week. And if it's benefits to run that in what to expect, for example, save effects as Gina trope and et cetera. Main reason my question is, lack of access to Gina trope and serostim, but can get access to firm under Jalan 24 milligrams, pens, love the channel. I've won client that's using it. So I'm not that or fail on this. We did look at this some simple episodes ago. I've won client that. No. I believe even the pharmaceutical research was concerned with insulin desensitization due to the long acting GH. I think that was the major concern that I've been brought forward through research was what was going to happen when insulin is in stiff-to-levels. Just because you've got this sustained elevator release at GH going on rather than the peaks and troughs that you would see through any other administration. Beyond that, I don't know anyone that's used it in the real world you do, so I'm going to sit this one out and leave it up to you. Not a lot to report yet, man. It's been a little while, but you know, and I asked him this morning because I saw this question and you know, I said, well, what do you think of this overall? What are you noticing out of it and he was like not much? So, and I think he's using four milligrams per week. Is that just because the peak dose isn't getting there? Is it because he's just not creating a peak level with the study release? I'm not sure, man. I mean he's using, so he could take it higher, but you know, we're off cycle right now too. He's been using, I believe it's four milligrams per week, which is not a a a a sloppy dose of GH overall, you know, and he already had been using, I think, three units of regular, you know, one 91 GH. Because obviously with a regular GH, you're going to get this high peak peak and then drop off, you know, this is what you get. Yeah. So with the slow acting, you don't get that lofty peaks, I'm wondering if that's the difference in the driver. Because we see this in gear, a high peak, does stimulate more animalism, but it also stimulates more side effects, which is why we don't not to bother with it. So I'm just wondering if it's a serious situation with the GH. Yeah. Well, probably take the dose higher, but so far we haven't seen any issues with what is it called, whatever. That's what he's doing. That's what I said. So he's doing it and he stopped and so he's still doing the fast acting as well. Yeah, yeah, we added it on top of it. We haven't seen any kind of major changes in water retention or anything like that. He's actually doing his best every, he held a lot of body fat and it was one of those guys that long term, like no matter what, we just got to keep focusing on fat loss. You'll grow in the process, but you know, and he, we got him down to a keto diet and now we finally have built him up to tolerating carbs really well. Had we had this many carbs in the plant initially, he would have just gotten fat. So he's doing well and we're getting ready to go into his first like real offseason where we can actually increase calories. Ever we've been running it for a little while, but I'm not as a coach. I'm not seeing anything different. When we add GH and usually or if we doubled the GH dose normally, I would say like, oh yeah, I see something. You know, or I have a guy that gained 10 pounds in the last few weeks, you know, switching GH's. He was on a GH at the F4 IU, switched to another GH and all of a sudden he's like, hey, my hands are feeling numb. And I'm thinking to myself, I wonder what his old GH was. Was it even good? But now he's up to you know, so I think I'm not seeing anything weird like that. You know, there's no symptom side effects, no reflection on the scale. So I don't know, man. Hmm. What about this one? Thoughts on test EQ in premo for a bulk will it crash my E2 too much, generally high estrogen, but with no sides. Thinking of starting a 20 week push phase with 300 test 150 EQ 150 premo and slowly increasing as I go. I think that too together is probably going to have the estrogen on the low side, yeah. Definitely at that dose. I think you need a little bit careful there. Plus if you don't have issues with high E2, I eat doesn't cause any problems then why would you be worried about lowering it? Yeah. I mean, you know, if you're not getting war retention and you're not having problems with body fat, I mean, high estrogen support, if a good lipid profile. So it's actually not a bad thing. You're going to benefit your growth to have a good amount of estrogen in your body versus crushing it. Yes. So I say, I be careful not to treat numbers. See this a lot. See a lot of people get blood work done. See results and treat numbers without considering, well actually, am I experiencing anything negative from that, you know, is that causing me any issues? And management is definitely one of those areas that people often treat numbers instead of looking at the whole picture of how they feel, how to perform and what else is going on. You know, if you need to, it's a bit high, but you feel great. Everything's working down stage. You're making good progress. What change? Just leave it. Yeah. Now, the only time I would is if we were dieting and his estrogen was real high. Let's say that like on the scale of whatever up to 40, he's at 110, but he didn't have any symptoms at all. He's like, I feel fine. I, and we're dieting, then I would definitely bring it down, you know, a little bit. Just take the edge off, but I'd still be okay with keeping it out of range. What if he's dieting? I'm far loss is absolutely textbook. Would you still bring it down? Would you leave it then until you saw it in the show with it? You know, I might break still bring it down a little. Yeah, I might still bring it down a little bit. Not, I wouldn't, but I wouldn't crush it. You know, let's say he was at, let's say he's using 500 tests and his estrogen is at 110 and 40 is the top end of range. We'll say it's 110 and it 40 is the top end of range. I might end up saying, but no symptoms. I might say, hey, let's just start 0.25 milligrams of a Rimmid X twice a week and see what happens. Maybe we're going to see a little bit of water retention drop. Maybe the next week he checks in and it's a faster drop than I'll know. Oh, yeah. So he was holding a little bit more water than he had been. And I know that that's not enough to crush him. He's probably still like 70, you know, something like that. Yeah, no, just wondering. All right, most of you have here Dave. We're doing good, man. We're getting through a lot of these. Can you please explain DHA to seven Keto DHA, like 25 milligrams of DHA versus 100 milligrams of seven keto. Do you have any experience with those with with seven keto DHA? No, it's not that good from what I recall. Do you remember when it got real popular for a minute, probably like 10 years ago, like all of a sudden people are like, oh, seven keto DHA. I believe it's like a synthetic derivative of DHA. It does not. It's so DHA is a precursor to estroin and testosterone and seven keto does not turn into, it's not a precursor. So you're not going to get the same benefits out of it. That would be my thought. Yeah, no, DHA is very useful for females for bringing up adrenal testosterone production. If they've got low of arid. Yeah. Yeah, I think seven keto was like marketed as a fat loss agent. I don't think that I've never seen it being super beneficial. I've worked with people who ran in and I couldn't tell a difference. You're the training question for you, Dave. Last blood work came back with ALT and AST at 80. So our range is more like down to 30. Yeah. And I have heard of other trainers say that ALT, AST is reflection of training volume and creatinine is related to training intensity. Oh, and his creatinine was up too. So what are your thoughts? Yeah, I never heard that intensity aspect. No, it's not intensity based. ALT is present in muscle tissue. So it's released when you exercise. Volume or you can train high volume, you can train intensely. Whatever there's a significant difference between the ALT released by even former high-affinote, what can I do? And I don't think he's ever been studied. There are a few studies on the elevation of ALT from exercise definitely. And general liver markers in general being a doltrate at true exercise. But I don't think there's anything specific around intensity versus volume. But yeah, one of two reasons ALT goes up because it's released from muscle tissue. Yeah, because your AST, yes. AST tends to go up if you far or look in the wrong direction. It's a bit of a shit leather marker to be honest. It's a fucking old goat for anything. But ALT will also go up because your liver is processing the waste that you've produced from exercise. Now I would see a mechanism of action here that if it was intense, they would potentially be more waste over volume is training. So I could see that being a potential to increase ALT slightly more. Creating will elevate through high protein, dehydration and exercise. The more muscle you have, the more creatinine you'll have, which is why traditionally when you look at an Afro-Caribbean blood, than you do the creatinine, EGFR calculation, you actually times the EGFR result by 1.2. Because Afro-Caribbean is in to have naturally more creatinine in their bodies, and therefore it's naturally elevated in the first instance. Anyway, again, yes, the more intense the exercise, I would argue that you are likely to see a potentially greater creatinine reading. But I wouldn't have said there's a specific difference between volume and creatinine. It doesn't creatinine will still elevate with volume training as well. It's not like it doesn't change with volume and only trains with intensity. That's absolutely ball-ups, you know, it will change with either. But whatever training causes the most stress on the muscle, therefore it's going to cause the greatest amount of creatinine release. And with you on that, and I would say this, we did an actual episode, what your doctor doesn't know about your labs as a bodybuilder. Something like that was Scott Stevenson, I should find that in Lincoln in the show, because he explained all the basic things that bodybuilders are going to see that are off in their labs. Since ALT and AST, things like this are going to, and your kidney values are going to be off a lot of times. We're looking for a trend, so maybe off a little, but it's consistently off. It's not continuing to rise, like if his liver values are at 80, and then next time they're at 100, and next time they're at 110. Then it's like, well, let's look at that. But, you know, if they're 80 now and then they're 40 next time, and then 80, the next time and 40, the next time, I think he's all right. You've also got to be consistent with, or very aware of when did you train the first? I've heard 72 hours is the bass. Yeah. Oh, more. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you train, say you went to the gym seven a.m. and then take a little test at 9 a.m. You would probably come back as having kidney failure. Okay. You'd probably be in the 40s in EGFR or low 50s, but quite easily if you train with any level intensity or a very level of muscle, you'll probably be in the 40s. So it can be significantly adulterated of results. Generally speaking, if you're a trained individual, having trained within 40 hours of the test, and the general cough regifier is 60 anyway, and I would still work on that. So if it's below 60, I'd be saying, right, retest, either ghostly, starting to see. Yeah, so a few. That'll give you a different reading, right? So a more accurate reading, to set and see. Yeah. Do you guys see that one? Yeah, we do. Yeah. I do the ghostly, starting to see, or I do a four day rest and retest, getting these. Um, crowning is a bit of a crap mark of a kidney function, but it's cheap. It's readily available, and in an untrained populace, it obviously is quite reasonable for detecting early signs of kidney problems. But in a trained market, it does sort of become a bit useless. So you just get used to it, common sense. Yeah. Just a great comment here from DGP Holy Hangar Nade. He says, uh, because we're talking about how the villainization of AI, he said, I think a lot of the demonization comes from, he gives me a few studies that looked at post-medipausal women with breast cancer, where their estrogen was crashed long-term. This is a standard care. This is a standard of care for stopping estrogen feeding cancers that said a hundred percent of the side seemed to be effects of low estrogen, which had been really hard for some people to grasp. The AI and pharmacology, the AI, doesn't cause the sides such as brain damage, cholesterol, issues, cardiac issues, etc. They just crashed E2 and maintained that crash long-term in those studies that found the issues. Control E2 within normal physiological levels doesn't seem to cause any of those issues, or the issues of minimized, because you're keeping your E2 around the normal physiological level just out of range to the higher your test goes. Thus far, nobody I've engaged with online has pointed to a single issue or study that shows a symptom that isn't just a symptom of low E2. Pre-mode-masti-Q to control E2 seems to almost counterproductive since you have all of the sides of the compound. Plus the possibility of unreliably controlled E2 crash E2 in getting the sides a low estrogen. So basically, the problem is the mechanism, the problem is the result. Yes, thank you. It was a very well stated statement. It was, and I appreciate the contribution. Yeah. Right. General steroid question, guys. And I'm sure one that has been asked before. Why have no new AAS been invented for so long? Is it the equipment required as so advanced that it requires too much corporation and farm of funding? I would have figured the science was well established and the decent UGL would be able to. I don't know. Another carbon atom to a nanderlone molecule or some shit. Right. So let's just your typical UGL is A individual or a small group of usually a couple two three individuals. With a PO box. In a building or a shed or a carriage or a shipping container. With a very minimal amount of equipment. And it is a very minimal equipment following awaits and measures recipe. Yeah. That's your lab. That's the technicality of it. They may get certificate technical because they use more sophisticated equipment from a point of view of automation. But the actual science element of it, raw powder, X amount of that, X amount of benzol. It's a matter of that. Carry a royal. Sticky it again. I felt it. She'll be in a vial of fog. And obviously development of drugs and changing atoms on that is quite sophisticated. The reason science doesn't do anything with it is because why? I think it's a developed, drugs are developed to mat money. Primarily. And secondly, to treat illnesses. But primary to mat money. I feel like it's supposed to be out. I feel like it's supposed to be out. I feel like it's supposed to be out. Why don't we get him to buy the machines and make something new? You could do it. Is making good cash. Yeah. But you know, farmer. The farmer industry. And it is an industry. It is a business and you gotta remember that. They will look at developing drugs for illnesses. And if there's enough people with the illness because it's financially viable for drug development cost billions. Yeah. A lot of bigger fish that they want to fry and make money off of. And it takes you and you and new version of Prima Ballon. Exactly. It takes years. If not, you've got to develop the compound. Then you've got to go through clinical studies. You've got to go through animals studies. Then you've got to go through human studies. And you've got to go for large population trials before it even hits the market. So the farmer industry when it comes to drugs that we'd be interested in, particularly for muscle building. Probably the golden drug at the moment is some form of reliable and controllable my starting in a bit. Yeah. They could do that. That's a billion dollar drug. It's a trillion dollar drug to be fair. There are companies working on it. They are trying to develop something. And that that goal is muscle waste these conditions. Most of the waste these diseases. Yeah. Things like AIDS as an old fashioned one really has to suppose these days. These days when they're to run a, they even when you're to run a test recently with muscle wasting from using GLP meds. Right. Okay. Yeah. So that's a massive market for farmer to look at, which is why certain companies are investing in millions of millions of dollars it takes to try and develop a drug. So I think if you see any development in size gaining drugs, you're going to see it on one of two levels. You're either going to see it in my starting suppression or you're going to see it in gene manipulation, which I think is the overall way that you're looking. Yeah. I guess I think they will be the next two jumps with my starting innovation probably being the first. And then gene manipulation coming maybe a decade or so later. I'm not quite sure whether I will be there, but I believe they are not further on than we probably realize. But you know, antibiotics that there's every compound currently needed for human health problems because that's what drives the problem. Well, they tried, I mean, sorry. They tried. They tried. They, I mean, sorry. We're not that long ago. That was fairly recent time. None of that proved to be successful the way. They went into be able to create something that was like an antibiotics to ride, but didn't have side effects. Yeah. It was all the best. And they found out that that wasn't the case. Yeah. Every some failed. I thought the irony of people jumping on sums and research drugs is the sums that available in the market to place are old failed sites. I didn't say experiments. And here's a thought too. I'd be happy with them just getting back to making all the stuff they already have. Like let's, let's get back to making the normal stuff before we, you know, if we can figure that out first. Can we have a good farmer decouplease and a good farmer parable with a good. Just make good ones that those first and I'd be happy. All right. How about this one? Oh, he says that it's a time sensitive question. Fighting father time is his name. Question for an upcoming show. Hopefully soon I'm three point five weeks out from my local show. And I've been running one milligram of redda. Transition from 7.5 weekly. Yeah, I know that's a lot. But really no sides. I can't believe he had no sides at 7.5 milligrams of redda. That's a lot. I am planning on cutting it two weeks out. And I've come in early 5.5% body fat on Dexa at five weeks out and probably deserve some amount of suffering to improve gastric emptying. What are your thoughts to early not early enough or just right? Note that Google tells me the median time to maximum concentration of redda is between 12 and 49 hours after a subcutaneous dose. Redda is designed as a once weekly injection enabled by its long half life of approximately six days. That in itself is a big topic right now. People are talking about, you know, you're not going to get the complete benefits of redda if you're doing small daily injections of it. You're not getting that big bowless effect. And yeah, so that's a whole other topic. But yeah, so cutting this out, I mean realistically, he's only on two now. I wonder if he's doing my thoughts. Yeah, does he have gastric issues? Is it? Yeah. Is it still because he said he had no sides at 7.5? I see. Well, that's the point. Last sides at a fraction of that on two. I don't see any particular reason to get rid of it unless he's causing some form of stomach distension through through transits. It means slow and things be literally backed up. I don't see why you would need to get it out. You know, if you're comfortable where you are, you're holding a flot stomach. Then yeah, just, I mean, you could tape it down a bit more if you wanted to, but I don't see any reason for drastically getting rid of it. On a side note, redda. See more and more people report in anxiety. Really? If you see anything like that, yeah, quite a few, actually. Not crippling, but definitely present. That one, not one. And I've been using it for, I call it long term now. What sort of doses? Two milligrams. No, these are generally at the higher. And so five, seven point five. But I even, a couple people that just don't know, milligrams and said, no, I felt the anxiety. Never, no, I haven't heard anything like that from either clients that I work with or listeners of the show. I guess, let's ask our listeners, too. Do they, they heard anything about this? I'm seeing. I don't know if it's a little bit of a, you know, sensitive. In fact, one person that was reported isn't sensitive in the slightest. In that essence, you know, I mean, it's generally very mentally robust. So I was quite surprised when he said, I'm going a little bit of anxiety, which he said, I just wonder what else is going on in his life. To me, that would kind of be like, hey, I'm getting anxiety from using insulin or metformin. No, that's what I'm saying. He in particular, I know is particularly stable. Very much in control. That's why he, and then I've had a few other people say the same. I've had a few people question, does this course some mild anxiety, because I feel like my anxiety is increased slightly. And like I say, yeah, you've got to watch the person, the environment, everything else that comes with it. And it's very easy to go. It's a drug when it's not. It's just circumstances, but it's been enough people for me to start to go. Hmm. I got a minute. Okay. Yeah. Let us know, guys. I'd be curious to hear what you have to say. In, hey, on that note of the, this big topic that everybody seems to need to weigh in on now is, you know, should you split your dose up versus take it once per week and all that. Here's been my experience. I initially started with twice a week. I think no, excuse me, every other day shots. And then I went down to two times a week. And then talking to Victoria about it, because she brought that idea up. And this was back in April, May, about how, because you're not getting the high peak that you, you know, you may not be getting the full effect from it. And then since then, there's been people talking about that it's just the drug isn't going to work properly. Or you're, eventually it's going to not work as well if you continue to using it more frequently. So I went to once a week. And the only difference I noticed was that it seemed to wear off faster. That by or not faster, it seemed to wear off by the end of the week. I had a strong appetite-blending effect first few days. And then the last few days, my hunger would greatly increase. Dave. No, so about, by day five, for what, I've, similar people say by about day five, it's, it's, it's, bolxt. And unfortunately most people take it on a Monday, so when they really need it, which is the weekend, okay, no game, what's your fan anymore? So I've, I've experimented with every other day, two times a week and once a week. I would say that two times a week for me is fine, and that way I don't have to remember to take it more frequently, but I don't see a problem. I would say, figured out for yourself guys, like see what works for you. I think sometimes, man, with stuff on social media, there's something, there's something, like we just come up with these ideas that we're trying to throw out there, like, everything you've been doing is wrong. I'm quite literally, it is some idea, starting front of a camera, and I'm, when I'm liking front of them, like this, and go, like us, can I say? It's like us. Yeah, what can I say, the mix me stand out with no real background of what they're talking about, just, well, everyone says, yeah, I'll say this because it's different, and it'll get me noticed, and it's like, there's nothing behind it, you just, yeah. Yeah, well the guy who said this stuff initially is Trevor Guy, he, he's CrossFit guy, right? And I've actually followed him for a long time. What? You follow a CrossFit? Yeah, yeah, so he's really great with mobility exercises. You know, it's all, can you just moving your legs? I'm not just moving your foot, can I? You dirty animal. Oh, Dave, oh, yeah. Here me out, here me out. No, I'm telling you, there you go, there you go. Here me out, Dave. So he's really good with mobility stuff, right? You got a shoulder issue, he has a huge library of great videos that I have suggested to clients for years now. And then I don't know if like maybe he just did all the stuff he could do with those movements. But then he started seeing himself, he started doing it like he changed his videos, because I subscribed to him. He changed his videos. And then they were like these like, like, how can I put it, Dave? They're like, I'm going to give you like a mentorship type thing. Like we're going to talk about like how to live your life and shit like that. And I don't think that those videos did really well. So then he started becoming a peptide expert. And now all of a sudden he's making these bold claims about peptides. And he's presenting, it basically it's a rebranding. It's a YouTube rebranding is what it is. Yeah, I like the guy a lot. Great mobility stuff. And I've a lot of my clients have been helped from a buy him and his ideas over the years. And helped me really understand like when I tore my super spinatus. It has stuff helped a lot that said, I don't think he's an expert, Trevor, if you're watching, come out bro, you're not an expert on it. That's a great opportunity for me to talk about that next breaded treatise. Yeah, I mean, I had a message yesterday from the guy who's my socials with all this to videos she wants. And this stuff from there that's deliberately kind of a virtual because she knows it will get traction. And it's like, yeah. I'm not ready to say all of me. So yeah, I mean, yeah. I'm not just creating friction for the sake of it. But it kills, it gets traction, it gets money in the bank. And that's why people do it. All right. Anyway, he's got in-dave. Any experience or not? Oh, that was the New German question. I guess I screen-capped that twice. Scott, you need ink. Get sleeves. You are very pastry whites. It a pale non-decrative format. Should I get decorated up? Get sleeves done? Yeah, I'll do some designs for you. Okay. Hey, you're a good artist. You're a good artist. You do a good at drawing. Yeah. You're going to take a time. Really craft something nice for me. Right. So the deal is, you can't look at it until it's finished being tattooed. I don't know if I trust you on that one. I wouldn't. No, I couldn't do it. If somebody was filming, I'm not that cruel. I could build in something small and something small. Yeah, the only you know about, then you pointed out to me and be like, if there's a dick right here. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking of paradox, but yeah, you're pretty much a guy. Regardless, you age, I take four I use a night. His late 40s is generic. Compared to farmer grade, what is the equivalent of this? Two point five years. Should I up the dose? Oh, he's on the ditch. He's difficult. It depends. I mean, there's some pretty decent generic GH's out there, but I wouldn't have said, Well, would you say, gee, genuine is probably half the dose? Genuine? On average? Yeah. No, man. I don't know. I've seen some incredibly well-dosed underground GH. Like, I'd say that some of it. In fact, now I'm going to go back here to the, oh, God, might have been 2011. Bill Lewell and did the underground anabolic sky? Do you remember that? Well, this, this 13 of, well, he has the anabolic reference guide. But then he did one of just underground labs, and he tested all the brands. Yeah. Oh, what? No. And in the GH section, he tested hygytropin, which is like a generic, I know they tell you, like, oh, it's used in Chinese pharmacies or Chinese. The original highage was quite good, actually, the original one, the gleam. So that was pretty good. It tested out as being more pure than some of the farmers that he tested. And I've seen Keith from parabolic had shown me some labs that were done on Farmer, that was not quite as great as you might think. Like, it wasn't bad. But compared to with everything we're doing with testing now on some of these batches of underground GH, like, there's some pretty clean stuff out there, man. Hi, Dose. Are you used to like hunting them? Uncertain was really until they stopped selling it? I didn't know they weren't around now. I thought they were. No, they're still around. They just stopped selling to the public, which was around the clock. I used to just email them and say, I want some in order and then send it here. They fucking really had that. Is HGH an insulin really needed to compete for a 60 plus year old classic physique amateur athlete? I'm looking to compete in Master's Nationals July 26. Frank Zane never used it. No. I think all it's never used it in that era. No, not so. Frank wasn't really now on for his large bulbous muscles. Was it there? There is that. I mean, he was incredibly tall. He had a credible physique, but it was much lighter than his compadries. No, you don't. There's plenty of people build decent muscle mass. And presented good physique without insulin and GH. It is not a requirement. People think it is. And these days, it's almost become like the standard nowadays. I'm going to start going to the gym. So what did my cycle? My GH, my insulin, my metaphyl, my metaphyl, my metaphyl, my metaphyl. And I've got me under the mic of the TV for it's like, fuck, get it gym first. Yeah. Also, this is first. Diding goes like insulin in GH. I wouldn't consider to be heavy movers for getting into contests. It has shaped fact. They're much like in addition compounds. I do think there could be some great benefits to them, though. You know, I think they can be great, but do you absolutely need it? No. There's plenty of people that don't use either. And there's plenty of people that will be at that show that aren't using either. I mean, I could see GH in it as a tennis just so that I could see GH in an old competitive being. Beneficial in other areas as well, not just in condition, but in general well being and feeling okay. Yeah. Um. Too bad away. Do you know anyone that's dying in the insulin these days? It was a little bit of a fabric for short period, wasn't it? Yeah. I still have a lot of my guys who are using insulin. Through a cot. Yeah. Yeah, for the cot. So it's a lower BG and force better for. Well, we're still we're using it for driving carbs into the muscle around training. No, yeah, but it was there was also the. If you use insulin, it'll love look glucose levels, forcing more fat metabolism. Yes, so there is that. Scott Stevenson went into that at one point. I believe that stress hormones may go up in that process too. Right. But if it was anyone that because I haven't had anything on that for a while, so it was just. Andrew Barry has talked about it more recently. He's still up for that. I here would be the one place you're talking about like fasted cardio with insulin. Yeah. I know that I remember Jordan Peters talking about it on muscle minds years back. The place I could see it being beneficial is if you had a massive cheat meal the night before. And you're waking up to do your fasted cardio, but your blood sugar is still super high. You could knock it down faster with that. That's where I'd use it. But for the most part, if you already have low blood sugar, it would be like an as needed situation. You know, if you already had low blood sugar, then there's there's no need. Nice comment here. I'm always bored when doing cardio except for when a new podcast for you guys. A debol episode would be cool. Appreciate it guys. Should we do another debol episode, Dave? Oh, one condition. What's that condition? You dress up as a debol. How do you do that? Like what does that look like? You have big, big tablet costume on. Just a face sticking out the tablet. Could that be, do you remember the blue heart? Yeah, I could just get like a big blue heart costume. Hmm. That'd be cool. Watch the podcast every night after work. I finally have a question. Since March, I've been on various mini cycles. Started with 225 test E and 300 massed probe for eight weeks. Dropped the probe and just did 350 test. For another eight weeks, then dropped to 250 test for eight weeks. Now I'm on 200 test and 140 massed E with three milligrams of redda for the past five weeks. I am a TRT user since the age of 32 and 36. Now what would be the best course of action for me going forward? I want to get as lean as I can, but not lose size. Go back on to your team. You've been on 29 weeks? Yeah, that's a start, I think. You know, take a break. Yeah, it's a big swivel. Yeah, retool. I lost my glasses yesterday. Yeah. Yeah, these are me reserve ones. Do they work as good? No. No. I got these glasses. I dropped them in the woods, I used to. Oh, and they'll all look off the boat. Hmm. Wait, you were telling me how you had to work and work yesterday and do all this driving. I had to go, I did because I had to work in the morning and drive down to the boat to clear it out and then drive back and then work. Oh, okay. No, see. Yeah, you see, you were going to try and be slid. You were out on the boat, Lyle Giggins. No, it's fucking worse. Sun tan in, hanging out, laughing. No, it goes, it's gone off the sail. Wait, what? It's gone off the sail. You're selling your boat? Yes. What? Long story. Okay, yeah. We have to tell you that at some point. I'm with you though, the guy should probably take a break, man. Hmm. You know, re-tool. You could still do everything he needs to. Yeah, maybe re-tool, hold weight. You could still tighten up a little bit. Don't die it hard during an eight week break. Plan your next cycle from there. And keep in mind, he's afraid of losing muscle mass. If you have your testosterone supported and your diet is good, you're, you're, you've set your diet up so that protein is high. You're losing one pound per week, two pounds per week. It's going to be a real long time before you have to worry about losing muscle. Not good. It's gotten gave day as the best day. That's another comment from Bob. All right, couple more. It's David's, it's David's got there. Oh, we're about out of it. We're about out of time here. I didn't realize that scar tissue guy head, rotator cuff surgery ran a bunch of gear. Dr. pulled out a brick a scar tissue a couple years later. Can you talk about scar tissue and antibiotics? This dude Eric Marchowitz. He was a developer of some of the seven keto pro hormones that were popular. He was the guy who made them. He lives near me. We had talked about this years back. He was like, man, a lot of these girls, they end up getting acne on cycle. And they're all running anover. And then their face gets all scarred up because the anover sending increased collagen as it repairs. And I was like, huh, that's an interesting theory. I remember I've saying that. The scar tissue, I mean, the main thing is right down. So, D tissue would, you know, it'll break it down. Yeah. I don't really know much else you can do. You can get castrication from frequent site use as well. So that's another thing that needs dispersal and breaking down. You'd have to be careful post surgery. You can get increased thickness of your scars with growth hormone. You can. The other thing would be stretch in as well. But that should be part of your rehab program. I think when people skimped a little bit on the stretching side of rehab, I generally find they end up with slightly more scar tissue than those that go through the program. I'm going to make sure the stretch is out. Make sure that the work in the area. All right. We've got one more here. This is from Patreon. He says, uh, question for drugs and stuff. And I understand if this isn't something you and Dave went to cover for the purposes of testing. What is the average clearance time needed for common steroids to not receive a positive test? Depends on the steroid depends on the half life depends on the environment. It's something I don't like getting involved in, not because of the moral side of it. I do sort of think that gone. There's plenty of stuff you can do that you can use gear for. Why can be in an area where you go? Well, you should just quite widespread as well. And there's, there's, anyway. Also untested events that are not necessarily natural, where it's more of an IQ test than anything else. Now, having said all that, the reason I'm reluctant is, is more from the case of, I wouldn't want to give the wrong advice as subfuck a fail. The red gate is at that. Yeah. My own astounding is, fast actors six weeks, this. Um, slowest is three months plus dependent on the compound decaris. The tour is lead long lasting. So it's trends like 18. Yeah. Oh, trend trend as long? Yeah. Trend as long as it seems to be, now I'm fucking indestructible. Um, but yes, and obviously your environment as in things like body fast, or flight that, did you know, there you go, is, is this, this was something I learned when he used to the military work. So what are you used to, yeah? Lads used to go on one leave and smoking cannabis in the military is a big no no no no no UK military right, you get caught someone cannabis you got. You get really, they, oh, if I hear you. Yeah, and it's actually for his well. Wow. So Lads would go on for leave, right? And they, if they had a better brain cells about them, they'd go on for leave. Um, they'd obviously eat loads of shit and put way on. The smoke a bit can't have been said to begin to believe. So it had cleared their system by the time they got back. And got a pissed essence they walked through the door. Yeah. And that was pretty much the standard thing. Let's go in back at leave, right down the CDT, you get pissed tested. So, the, like they caught and on was the cannabis will actually sit in fat cells. Right? So what was, what they realized was that if we test these focus two weeks later when they're back doing PT and eating a diet and they're losing body fat that they've gained on their leave, they may put one, huh? It may release the cannabis packets and the system. So guys will get caught two weeks later having positive, don't negative two weeks before because of the release the cannabis packets and the system. Yeah. I don't mean as in getting stoned, I just mean the metabolites. Right. Right. Yeah, that's wild, man. Yeah, I, I've worked with people who've had to worry about testing a few times, but it's not something I, I really get into. And there are things you can do like you were saying to try to clear things faster. But yeah. I don't know enough about it to be honest to advise on it. I think that's right. Right in the message chat messages, whatever, do not come on this show, cast in dispersions and tell in stories and lies like that. I did not smile. Yeah, there he is. Roy, he says, uh, saw Dave at PCA British where I was competing and he actually cracked the smile. I thought it was a lie. I didn't. Dave, you feel better now that we did the show at least like you had a rough day, but at least you got to hang out with your body for an hour, you know, and like have a real good time. You feel better now? Yeah, amazing. Way, what do you do? You got to get change out of your house coat tomorrow? Maybe. You know, put on regular people clothes and stuff? No. I'm going to show a day's young man's and troll up naked through my garden singing. I got a question for you. So I texted this to you. I was watching a slow horse, which is a great freaking show, by the way. I want to watch this about horses that don't run very quickly and slightly mentally challenged. It's about MI5 and these rejects from MI5 who are really the people who end up saving the day. Anyway, the guy who was like the whole first desk at MI5. This crazy stuff goes down. All of their systems get shut down. All the power goes out. MI5 is like blacked out, right? And he says, well, fuck my getty aunt. And I texted Dave and I said, Dave, is that a saying in the UK? And you said, it is. What the hell, where's that come from? I haven't got a clue. We have lots of weird scenes, particularly local ones that don't make a lot of sense, but sound alright. What's another, what's another local one that you have that's weird? Oh, yeah, he'd be braided work. Oh, they called that an Easter egg. I can't, honestly remember me, I'll have to, um, I'll do something to try and think of something that brings you some complete people like. You guys catch the Easter egg at the end. We're wailing said, oh my fuck, my getty aunt. Why is that an Easter egg? I don't understand this Easter egg thing. I don't know what it's, it's a reference to something else. But I don't get it. I'm probably being extremely thick, but I don't get it. I'm sure one of our knowledgeable listeners better to explain to those parents. The term Easter egg, what is it? Easter egg, what is it? It's a chocolate item, you eat an Easter. Yes, it is. It's also something that you have to find, right? So you're not going to catch it. It's like a little hidden, it's a little hidden gem. Dave, you're supposed to find it. Super market. I don't know. Easter eggs, see em. The Easter bunny brings them to you and you have to, Easter bunny is dead. I run him over. Dave, this is guys, this is what I deal with every week. Dave, what are you going to do with your car parts? Put them on my car. Are you going to do that now? Like, are you going to get to it now? Are you going to, I'm worried about you. That's all. Don't you want to jump in for yourself. I'm going to go sleep. All right. Do you have any advice for us? Yeah, sleep.

Before we get into that, Andrew, you were out at Tampa Pro. I mean, that was kind of in your backyard. But you're going to do some traveling this weekend. You're heading to Dallas too. But what was going on at Tampa? Did you get to meet new listeners and how did everything go, man? I'm going to tell you, if I met listeners, I have to apologize. It is a whirlwind. Like from, and we actually, even though we only lived 25 minutes away, we stayed at the Host Hotel from Wednesday through Sunday just because to go back and forth. And I had five athletes in the show. Nice. Yeah, it was just a busy weekend. Let me start off by saying, I made a major mistake. One that wasn't good. You know, you tell your athletes, when you hear about like coaches like their athlete, missed their class and you're like, oh, what an idiot. How did you now have her in on stage? You know? Well, so this is the first time I've ever seen them move wellness to like right after bodybuilding in the any amateurs. And typically wellness is right in Fort Bikini or towards the end of the show. Show started eight o'clock and I told my wellness girl first time or two, be backstage ready to go at eight thirty. You know, have you drinking hand all the stuff, the preparation stuff that we have. I'm big, just be ready to eight thirty. Yeah. So, and I was like, I'm going to get there right at eight thirty because I'm upstairs looking at my prose because I had four four pros that were going on right after that. Okay. I come down. It's eight thirty and she's standing there and I'm kind of looking around. I'm like, where's the other girls with big glutes? I don't see any. Like what's going on? So go to the expediter and I'm like, yo, how long do you think till wellness girls need to start warming up? And he's like, well, they were done 15 minutes ago. And I'm like, is one of those like hits you in the face. I'm like, oh my god. Now, luckily, there was like seven girls that were in that situation because, you know, they had hair make up points and stuff and, and, you know, typically you don't need to be ready right at eight o'clock when an amateur show starts because wellness goes later. Is it? Is it? Did they change the, they did something weird? Yeah. Yeah. So they did something weird and they're like, well, we told people those casual events at the athlete meeting at at seven thirty. It's like, yeah, I'm not going to the athletes meeting when I'm running up and down, you know, taking elevators back and forth to people's rooms to look at them, you know. Yeah. So anyway, they did let them, all the girls walk at night and they actually did a re-judge, which was nice. So, oh, you're kidding. Yeah. But because of that, when I make a mistake, I'm going to do everything I can to, to make it right. I told her, hey, I want you to have the full experience. There's another show on Saturday. I'll be there for you. So it's here and forward. So I'm going to go to a show, an amateur show on Saturday. This is after, now tomorrow, I got a cut to plain to go to Texas. Oh, it's a safe. Yeah, go to Texas. Dallas. Yeah, go into the Texas Pro to peak a first time figure pro, getting on stage for her pro debut. I'm going to make it through pre-judging for that one and then catch a flight back to Orlando for the amateurs that the mistake I made put it that way. But no, Tampa Pro was good dude. You know, I had, my master's guy, Brandon Alexander got second place in the 40 plus. He looked excellent. His best look by far, he was up. I think eight or nine pounds from when he turned pro at North America's last year. And the same condition. And then on Saturday, I had a wellness amateur and then two pro bikini, my figure pro, in her pro debut, got fourth place, which was excellent. And then Brandon also did the open pro, open body building. So okay, to say it was a lot of lack of sleep, lack of meals. I think I lost about eight or nine pounds. If I look like a age like seven or eight years, that's why I did. Yeah, I mean, I saw you fight your dog with YouTube. Yeah, he goes with us everywhere. You know, he is a service animal with an asteroids. And he goes with us everywhere we go. So he was backstage with me and kind of hangs on my side the whole time. So I mean, full supported that you're getting more eccentric like skip as you age. And I was like, oh, yeah. So genuine that you know, did see me. You know, I, I, I hope I wave back to you. I was in the zone just focusing on athletes all weekend. Like we do when we're out shows and stuff. So well, hey, at this show, there is one person you have to meet. And I told him to look for you. And that is our very own UC summa. Matt Marshall will be doing his second show of the season there. He's already there to him and Kate Denonzo both flew out. They've been training at the gyms going to destination Dallas. They said like 24 of the 26 open bodybuilders were there at destination yesterday. It's it's looking for getting credible man. He saw Jordan there and said, everybody is looking, you know, lights out. So this is going to be a massive, like if Tampa was big, this is going to be a massive show. Tampa was good. The first call that was excellent. You know, Jordan Hutchinson. Yeah. And my mind, I thought he won both pre-judging and finals. You know, some people thought Samson looked a little bit better at times. Samson's been talking. I'm sorry. Quentin, I'm going, I'm going to my next point. Yeah. Quentin's got a better shape and structure than Samson does. So if he has the ability to put on the tissue, you might be looking at a Mr. Olympia. Just he needs to put on like another 20 pounds, like Samson did a couple years ago. And he might be that guy because his waist is just non-existent for an open pro. And now so the listeners were telling us too, in the comments that he did, and it's just bodybuilding this week, that he did his own prep too. Like he did his own diet, that his own peaky nailed it. Sounds like it. Yeah. I was watching some of his YouTube videos and I thought, man, I think this guy's out of shape. And I'm always happy to say when I'm wrong, you know, because we just want to see the best body builders on stage, right? We want to see everyone peaked, looking 100%. And I was just looking at some stuff going into the show and I'm like, I think he's behind. I don't think he's there yet. But now he was in shape and it was a very close show between the two of them. I definitely agree with the judge into decision. But the cool thing is we get to see a rematch this weekend. So yeah, it's going to be incredible. Hey, speak it real quick, speaking of being wrong. I think we got some bad intel. We had like the worst picture of Joe that we could have had in that show in our last episode. So he looked absolutely incredible on stage. Like we watched that. I know it's just bodybuilding this week. That posing routine posing was incredible. Condition was incredible. The dude is absolutely massive and he nailed it. So yeah. That's another one where I'm happy to say we were wrong with our projections. Because again, we just want to see like we weren't, we don't have any dog and if I we don't we don't we right malice towards anyone. We just want to see the best bodybuilders in the best quality show possible. And honestly, he probably stole the show in terms of not going to say newcomer because it wasn't his first show. But everybody was talking about him and everybody was talking about him. This guy could be second or even first. If he had maybe since slightly different structure from the front, his side shots lights out smoked everybody. His rear double people were walking around. He was like, this is the best back in bodybuilding. Yeah. You know. And he was dialed in. I think he's coached by Justin Compton. And okay. They did a great job. Yeah. He looked incredible. So this upcoming weekend, though, man, I am freaking pumped. I'm excited for Matt. You know, I'm excited for him to get to do this. So we were in that position. I showed you as picture of the morning injury. He was just like, we're not doing anything different. I don't think there's any reason to change anything. You know what I mean? It's like, we can ride that in all day long. Also too. You know, yeah, go ahead. I was going to say the picture sent me his skin is thin. Like paper thin. So he's in the great condition. I wanted to give a shout out to to I.B. Pro Jason Low. He listened to the podcast. I've got I pulled up one of his videos. So he was at Tampa. And now he is going to be at the show this weekend. And this is posing routine from last week. It you guys realize, too. He was a men's physique competitor initially. And then he's like, yeah, I think I'm going to move up to classic. I'm just like, yeah, I think I'm going to move up to T12. Any had wrapped a last year talking to him at the Olympium, man. So he's apparently gone to that arms. He's got the kind of arms like an only dream of. Oh, yeah, right. He always had those arms to I think. He's one of those guys who probably had like crazy arms since a team. He was a teenager. You know what I mean? Yeah, he looked great. Yeah. So shout out to him. Here's that look at the arms in the shot. They get almost looked like a photo shot or something doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. That's like the night after the show I had a or the day after the show. I had a burger and fries in a nice cream. And I went into training just to see what I look like. And then in those things are full blown. Yeah. Incredible. So anyway, you're still going. Yeah. I'll go ahead and say we also have another listener, Mike von Roz is making his protebio out of Maine. So okay. That should be cool to see. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. That'll be awesome. Shout out to him. And shout out to everybody else. Any of our listeners and staff who are making it out there. Look for Andrew, pastor, him, bother him. He'll be there at least through prejudging. And then you got to fly home to do the I'm on the street. I'm on the street. I'm on the street. I'm on the street. I'm on the street. I'm on the street. Yeah. Because it's a two day show, right? So I'm going to be able to watch classic 2012 and figure. And then I think wellness also. I'm not going to get to see open unfortunately. Because I got to fly back out to Orlando. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Well listen, we do have a bunch of stuff. I know we had another physique critique. We had a bunch of questions. I guess I could jump straight into that critique. All right. So Jake says this. He says, hey, Scott, I just wanted to say, again, how much I love the shows. They've certainly become my daily staple in prep. Current physique shots. And here's some details. So he's 24 years old. 228 pounds, five eleven. He's in classic physique. That's his main goal. He's also going to do open at the state show for fun. He's five point five weeks out from show one. Current cycle. He says can't include if you like. This says 300 milligrams of test E per week, 700 milligrams of mast E per week, 70 milligrams of trend ACE per week and 20 milligrams of wind stroke every day. No GH because I'm trying to make weight, LOL. He's also on two milligrams of redda per week, 60 milligrams of clen every day, 25 T3 every day, 125 T4 every day, five milligrams of Eohin vine and 400 micrograms of SLUPP332. He's been training since he was 14. Let's see. Do do do do anything else we need to go into. I think that about covers it. I mean, bring these pictures pretty mild. Yeah, overall for a sample. Yeah, yeah. I agree with you, man. Check this guy out too. He looks pretty good. Yeah. He looks like good condition for five weeks out, right? Yeah, what shows you doing? He didn't say state level show. Oh, okay. Wow. That's the question. He'll do well. Yeah, he says first show is the state level show. So I'm assuming that means he's going to do. I think he's Australia actually. Okay. Oh, you know what? Because they're starting, I think they call it season B. Okay. Like, you know, over here, I was just on the, on the, I call with one of my Australian clients last night who coaches a lot of people himself and he always says like season A, season B. And I'm like, what does that even mean? And he explained it to me. Like, over here, we've got in the United States, there could be 10 different shows going on around the country or meet or more even. You know, sometimes there's two shows and Florida on the same day. Yeah. Whereas over there, all their shows are, they start like three weeks out before their nationals. So you have like your, your local show, then you have like your regionals. And then you have like your national pro qualifier shows. And okay, that would say this. It's, it's really hard in other countries to turn pro because like an Australia, like one guy gets an open pro card. I think per season. So I think it's like two two open pro cards per year. And then okay, there might be a couple, it might be a few more classic pro cards. But it's like, you know, over here, you feel like someone else turned pro every other weekend. It feels like, you know, which is a whole discussion on its own. But yeah, he looks really good. I like that front double. Yeah, yeah, I think he's going to be great for classic especially. The conditioning is looking on point. What would be any critiques that we have for him? Can you keep going through the pictures? Yep. I wouldn't use that for your last bread. I wouldn't do the leg flare on the last bread necessarily. What would you do legs to more together? Like I would do straight on on this one. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to see how that looks. The only thing is his legs might overpower his up on the wall. Which is exactly what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking. I don't know. Maybe that's why he's got his leg kicked out. I would just tweak posing a little bit. I think he can make himself look more muscular here by see if we don't see the back shoulder much. Okay. You can tell he's got a nice pack. A nice nice set of packs. Yeah. And he doesn't even need to rotate his body. It's really just he needs to push that left shoulder a little bit. And we're going to see that back pack really balloon up. And we're going to see the silhouette of the front and side delts. And it's going to make him appear like he's much more wider up top compared to his waist. Yeah. So just like nitpicky little tweaks to his posing. But yeah keep going. I feel like that's a standout shot form that rear double. I agree. In classic that's going to be really good. Yeah. I would say don't let your glutes get any bigger though. Yeah. Yeah. He's an example of a guy. He's probably one of those guys. Like, oh, I never did glutes. I just, you know, squatted. He's probably that guy, you know. I was the opposite. That's the old one would say he got that thing on him. Pretty balanced. There's nothing. There's no glaring weakness. Yeah. Yeah. I like that shot a lot. You can get a little bit wider in his front rear relaxed with how he's where he's positioned in his elbows. Okay. I think you can open up just a little bit more. I was telling like own your space. You know what I mean? Like like, you know, like at the Olympia where you see guys kind of like crowding into each other to try to, you know, maybe take some of their space. Yeah. Go one of that mindset so that whole square is yours and no one's going to be crouching about, you know, you know, you know, you're discomb back fire when, and next thing, you know, the arms are way up to the side and then yeah, you know, you're riding the Harley or you're riding the chopper or something. But I think you can open up a little bit more and it's going to bring his lats out a little bit more and balance out compared to those quads. Okay. But solid physique solid physique. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to tell him, let's some send us some pictures when you're like a couple days out. I want to see if that's going to be lights out nuts. Yeah. Is it five five and a half weeks? Oh, the first show. Yeah. So that means he's doing another one. You know, yeah. Yeah. He looks good. Great. It's good. A couple of nice really, really nice classic shots in here too. That's a great pose on him. I like that. Agreed. Yeah. And he does have a very classic look. I and I could imagine if he just has like I'm just looking at this pose here. He's going to obviously continue growing or or maybe not he said he needed to make what he needed to not use growth so he could make weight. But I'm just thinking like what would that look like with like five more pounds up top? You know, it's just going to get more dramatic. The more muscle he puts on. Well, that's the thing with classic, right? Because like you might barely make weight five years in a row or four years in a row, right? Yeah. But you just find that you get more and more conditioned, right? Yeah. Because like he's not going to have a balloon up off season. If he's already a cap, but he's going to stay in better shape and he's going to focus on quality tissue. And then every year he gets into shape for his contest, he's going to still make weight. But he's just going to be a little bit sharper every time or he's going to have to dry out just a little bit more just to make weight before filling back out. Yeah. Jeremy, if you're listening, which you probably are, that could be an option for you, too. Then man, look at it that way. He made weight at 194, but it took everything we had to get him to make weight. And he really doesn't have room to add another 10 pounds. But hey, I'll tell you what, my first show. I was 178, middleweight. My second show. I was 172, middleweight, dramatically leaner, number one. But I was bigger, much, much bigger too. And I realized, oh God, I have a lot more room. That I could grow here, still, in this division. That was the last time I did middleweight, but after that I went to the late heavy. Honestly, the scale is like the scale weight, the, when someone's like, oh, I'm up 5 pounds scale weight, but you can't really see it. Versus someone who nailed the same weight, they have the previous two years, but you can see a dramatic improvement, like the last got wider, the shoulders are more capped. So there's a lot more than just like the number on the paper in terms of like development. Yeah. Because like I said, he'll probably end up being, what's his cap is like, 192 or something like that. It might be 192 on stage for the next three years because it doesn't make, he can't grow it. And let's see somehow magically grows another inch. I mean, that's a beauty of classic though. It really forces you to think about how you're gaining weight and how you're gaining muscle. Yeah. Or you just put on 20 pounds over the next two years and then you do bodybuilding. There's that. It's like a sound of good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He really, like you said, skip. He really wasn't using a lot, was he? Yeah. All right. Let's see what else we had here. Oh, by the way, too, I could probably find these to pull them up. It was fascinating talking to somebody about seeing some, some GH testing. And there are some brand name GH products that have been tested recently that are coming back at lower purity than what we're seeing in some of the generics. And that would kind of, it blows my mind a little bit. You know, to a degree, I remember Billu Allen, William Lewellen doing the underground antibiotics guide back in, I think 2010. And I remember him testing out Hijitropin as being more pure than one of the farmers. You know, and I know that yeah, the makers of Hijitropin say that it's used in Chinese hospitals. I don't buy that for a minute. I'm sorry. Maybe it is. But, you know, I see it more as being for bodybuilders, you know, Hijitropin than being like, it's just the way I see it. But that's yeah, well, I was going to say that, uh, ansemon from a couple years ago, that won't be being used in medical institutions, I believe in China, if I'm not mistaken. So okay. And it's an underground, in our sense, it's an undergrad. It's not a Pfizer. It's not a, you know, yeah. So it's not one of the big brands. But yeah, they were, they were seeing this. And anyway, I saw some some reports, though, of like we're talking like 85% for some name brand legit pharma stuff that was being tested to know, shake. That's disconcerning. Yeah. But I also wonder though, are they, where do they get that pharma grade stuff from? Was it direct to the pharmacy? Was it direct from someone who was prescribed it versus because the counterfeiters aren't counterfeiting, you know, black top brand or whatever, you know, red top. So they're not counterfeiting that. They're counterfeiting Sarah Stim, Nordadrope. And I've bought in plenty of stuff that was not, when you start to really look at the packaging labels, you're like, oh, I got burned, you know. Now, I'm not saying there's not growth hormone in there, but it's not the growth hormone produced by Pfizer or EMD Serano or one of these other companies. You know, I know someone that has, that does their own GH. Okay. And I want to talk them into, not coming on the show because that would just be stupid. But I mean, fill this, we're having a conversation about this because he believes all the generic, so just garbage and he thinks they're fake. And I'm like, hey, I've changed my mind. I used to be Sarah Stimmerbust or, you know, Nordadrope and her bust. I think the protein sequences that the peptide sequencing, the people who people are doing it today is at least or almost as good as what pharmaceutical companies are doing. And I keep remembering this 60 minutes special I've watched, maybe 15 years ago on the efficacy violations of pharmaceutical companies like where lipitores ending up in a, you know, a diabetes medication or so, you know, from cross-contamination to poor purity results. This was a 60 minute special where they talked about where these companies were failing in terms of label claims and whatnot. So, yeah. You know, just because it's made by big pharmacy company doesn't mean it's free from false. I mean human beings are operating the machines at the end of the day. Yeah. Okay. So here's what it was. It wasn't that huge of a discrepancy. I don't want to pull them up. I don't think there's anything on here that's identifying, but he told me I could use them, but make sure there's nothing. I just, I don't want to make sure I'm not missing like his name, so I'm not seeing it. Yeah. I'm going to throw 15 milligrams, tested out to be purity of a 95.7% with a 13.39 milligrams in it. Really? So, slightly underdosed. And then in Nordotropin, 15 milligrams pen being tested out at 93.8% pure with 14.1 milligrams in it. So, someone's got some sprain to do. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So, anyway. I thought that was really fascinating. And then there's one generic that he had that he was getting tested. It's 15 I use and it tested out to be where was the purity on this one. I can't see it off hand. I don't see where it's written on this. The four mats a little bit different. But from what I recalled looking at it before, it was super clean. Like it beats them out. Yeah. I mean, I'm seeing like 99.7% and 99.9%. And overdosed instead of 15 milligrams, it's like 15.4%. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So, I spoke to Keith from Parabolic about this. And I asked, well, what's the difference between, you know, like some of the, like, made in China versus, you know, some other products that are available both these places? And he said the main issue he's seeing is some of the made in China stuff is actually overdosed in a dangerous way. At times. He said he's seeing them being not dose correctly in at times. You might be getting more. Which it might not be that big of a deal, you know, if it's growth hormone, but if it's like some of glue tied or teeth or, you know, anything that would be like, you know, I don't want to accidentally take twice as much some of glue tied. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, we all know someone who had massively overdose clumbutoral. And they take what they think is like 60 micrograms. And they go to the gym and they just cramp up nonstop. And they're having hard palpitations and stuff. So yeah, I mean, some things you do not want overdose. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, accidentally overdose clumbut. Once. But that was honestly my fault. It was a mistake I shouldn't have made. Did you do that before, Skid? Yeah. Yeah. We all have. Well, technically that one wasn't my fault. It was a ready cat. You guys remember ready cat, right? Yeah. The big masking tape, blotter things. I don't know. They were all taped together. And it was supposed it was mislabel. It was 200 microgram clan with a milligram of ketatifin. Okay. So it was labeled as anovar. Oh, sorry to shadow no. Copy that. I can't remember. Think of their bar. Well, and here's the odd thing was I was borderline, tachycardia, but falling asleep from the ketatifin. Yeah. I couldn't keep my, like in the car. And I'm like, something's not right. Like I don't know what's going on. I barely keep my eyes open. But I had a heart rate of like arresting heart rate of like 170 low 170. Yeah. So, you know, you know, me. I was young. I'm like, well, getting lean. I don't know. Yeah. I was actually very concerned because I knew that there was such a contrast between my heart rate being so elevated and then couldn't keep my eyes open. Yeah. That's not good. No. No. It wasn't good. Didn't take me long to figure it out. And he was very like, oh, my god. Like I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah. So he's something more shit. And it was the only time I ever had a problem with the guy or anything that I had gotten from because back in the early days, I just didn't have the money. Yeah. I had young kids and I wasn't going to, you know, I did. I had to have his gear. I'm sorry that you, you know, you're going to have ramen noodles for dinner for the next seven days. You know, that thing. And it was just starting the business. So everything was going on at the same time. And early 2000s 2000. I want to say it was 2002 getting ready for the Northern Colorado because it was a following year that I competed with our against. I'm filled with the Colorado state. Yeah, because in 2003 he showed up to the Northern Colorado. Everybody was talking about it. And they're like, oh man, it's going to be wicked seeing you go up against. Still, I'm looking at Phil. I'm like, I know what I look like. They're going to be no battle between him and me. Like what are you talking about? So it was kind of an odd thing. That's when Phil came on the scene 2003. Yeah. Guys, body building is really expensive. And if you're ever going to run that GH, you want to run, you're going to have to put together a budget. So check out truenutrition.com. Not only are they a supplement retailer, they're also a manufacturer. They create a lot of the product lines for companies that you are very well aware of. So literally we're going to cut out the middle man, go straight to true nutrition, get some deals, and you'll be in that growth before you know it. You're huge. I don't know if they're going to like this promotion, but I feel like you guys, I feel like this is your vibe. I think you guys will get it. Use our code think over there. Obviously, that helps to support us, gives you a little more savings and helps us to put these shows out. So thanks guys, let's get back to the show. All right. We've got a bunch of listed questions. I'm just going to jump right in. And by the way, guys, if you want to leave comments, comment with questions for the next show. We'd be happy to take them. And if you're new here, we've got several shows that come out each week. We'd love to have you along for all of them. Hit the subscribe, hit the bell. Big fan of the show. I have a question that I'd love to get an answer on. Can a compound in DMSOB absorb through the skin? Can I apply a compound in DMSO to the muscle I'm training to get benefits or would it just go or would just using it? Sublink or do I need to just use it? Sublingual. Please answer. In 750 test 500 EQ 200 trend E along with three I use of GH before bed and 10 I use fast acting insulin. Pre-workout injected into the muscle group that I'm training to get better results. I got to try to show off my brain here for a minute, Andrew. All right. Go for it. But I need you to correct me if I'm wrong because there's one subtle nuance that I might be off in. And I'm asking. I'm not pretending that I know. But I remember back in the day and I don't remember much, but I'm really good with numbers. Either the compound has to have a lower molecular weight than 400 to go transdermal or the DMSO takes, I mean obviously it's the vehicle that helps take it transdermal. But if I remember correctly, I think the compound has to be less than 400 molecular weight. But it's the compound, not the DMSO won't take anything transdermal. It has to be less than a specific molecular weight correct. It sounds right. I mean, that's one of those things where have you put anything DMSO on your body in 20 years. Well, I know that when you're using DMSO you need to be is the same with testosterone cream. You need to make sure that you don't have the other end and you're toothpaste, soap, different things. The skin has to be clean. But I'm pretty sure, I'm not questioning the molecular weight of 400. What I'm questioning is whether the compound, if the molecular weight is not below that, it won't take it transdermal through the DMSO won't take it through. Because remember there was flowjiles too. We didn't like the smell of that made you smile. I saw that. You're like, yeah, I've ever thought that's back in the day. We were going back. There was a nostalgia moment. But the flowjile didn't stink. Where the DMSO was like, yeah, this is not cool. There was no where to. Yeah. Why is it? That was a thing back then. It really was. There was all sorts of talk on the boards about transdermals and people were getting pre-aproharmonies and stuff. And they were like, oh, I'm going to do a transdermal application or this, whatever. You know, anyway, I wonder if the guys who are our ages at that time were looking at us, the way we look at some of the younger guys that are trying to do things that are like quote unquote stupid. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, let's do that. There was also didn't have that academia or really, you know, like, There was information from the message boards, but there wasn't information from like, I don't remember it from studies and all this. I mean, we've gained so much information. That's why it's so exciting, really, when you think about all the things that have become available in the industry. I mean, just I'm focusing on the industry just because we're focused on the industry. Here's tons of information in every industry. But if you see that and what has played out in the access information that we have gained and just last 10 to 15 years, what's the next 20 years going on or the next 40 years? It's just crazy. I mean, it's like we're going to get to the point where in 30 years, we're going to know exactly how many sets we have to do exactly the amount of, you know, gear that needs to be taken, the exact amount of sleep. To formulate this this optimal black and white package. It's like we wouldn't even have jobs in 40 years doing what we're doing because it would be like follow this blueprint and it's just all laid out specific to your yeah to you. Yeah, that's where I was going to come in. I think oh yeah, you put in biometrics and some data and I'm wondering if in the future we're going to have the equivalent of a 3D printer that you step into that amplifies muscle response or growth, you know, on the in the muscle tissue. So in the same idea that you can 3D print something you can 3D print muscle. Yeah, what are we going to know about things like milestone or the things that we don't know about why we respond to GH and you know whether I GF levels are directly related to whether you respond to it or not. I've always said I don't think that it stops at the IGF level. There's far more to it that we don't know about otherwise, you know, just the simple argument of well then why would there be much difference between. And so in farm grade and in generics of generic, so raising your IGF levels the same, I mean, obviously, the argument of purity and everything else we have all these arguments. But I think there's just I think it's there's more there underneath the surface that we just don't know about and we can only argue about what we know about. Yeah, I think we've kind of crossed a threshold though like I think we've peak. Now, is a lot of the younger generation is trying to find a way to cut corners. And obviously, if some of us say, hey, you can cut five years off your career and or put on five years of muscle in a year, we all would have done a bad foot and figured out how to do it. So I think back then, at least, and I know we're going to sound like old crumogen, but we never tried to escape the intensity or the hard work aspect of it. If you can't see it. It's completely agree, but I think, I even argued that this generation doesn't really like the journey. That's okay. That's where I'm going. That's exactly where I'm going. Like the amount of knowledge we gained from being mediocre bodybuilders that just had a passion for something far surpassed, I would say, like a guy who turns for out 23 and goes to Olympia by 30. And I'm saying, the knowledge we gained and all the pitfalls and all the roadblocks we had to bust through. And what I see it now is like, I see like these videos where these guys are making training videos. And there's no intensity. It's like your reps are crystal clear perfect, but the intensity is like at a two. And so I'm wondering if that's what's lacking. So as we're getting these developments, as we're getting technology, as we're getting academia and all these things, all these tools that we didn't have access to 2015, 10 years ago, I'm just wondering, I've tried to think, is the journey like the journey is the thing that gives you the appreciation and the satisfaction of it. You know, even if you don't reach the goal, which, okay, we all start out the goals. The Olympia will after one or two shows you realize, okay, I'm not going there. But you have something in your mind's eye of like what I can get to, you know? I think the journey is a big part of an Andrew because I've worked with people that are far, far more gifted than I ever was. And I've worked with people who are even better than them. And sometimes the people who have never had to fight for it, who just, and I'm not going to say they were handed it because they're people who put in hard work to get where they got, but they just rose to the top, no matter what they did, those people, most of the time they didn't have the heart for it when it did get tough. You know what I mean? Or not only that, but they just didn't, I just feel like there was a lack of appreciation. Like, man, I do anything to get a pro card at one point. You know, like anything, you tell me like, well, Scott, you can't sleep, but two hours, every night for the next, you know, 16 weeks, I'd be like, if I can get the pro card, you know, obviously that's not the way it works, but I would do it, you know? And some of these guys are just like, but I want to go on vacation. And I'm not the poster child for this. I mean, really, when you break it, when you break it down, I mean, really. I've been doing this for 41 years. I am mediocre. And yet, I can't explain, like, explaining or defining passion is ineffable to someone who doesn't have it. So if it comes easy, and I'd even argue that the next generation is bigger because they aren't training as hard. I swear to you, we kind of talked about that with us. The Nick Walker up. I just, I look at it. I look at it. I'm old school. I understand that, you know, we have it programmed in our brain that we need to force this adaptation. But what if the adaptation is so much easier? What if I have been sitting here, spending my wheels training my ass, or right along with a lot of other people, too, all of us, and not recovering well enough, maybe recovering at 20% of what I could have been recovering. Now, that doesn't mean that it would put me out in Olympia stage tomorrow. But then you have to factor in the injury, you have to factor in the CNS. You did the beating down of your body for all those years. Point is that me being mediocre and continuing to chase it and being as dedicated. Even though I said before, the ROI is not there. It took me 41 years to figure out that it's not there anymore. I mean, fuck. Sorry, that's not going to be the part of the, you are the poster trep. That's what we love about you. It really is. But then I get the questions, you know, I get this one cat who trolls the F. And unfortunately, this one did get me. So if he's listening, he wins this one. But my wife and my kids had T-shirts said teams could have had a collage of all the years, you know, because of the finality and everything closure, if you will. And had all these pictures on it. I didn't notice it first. I talked about when I went over the competition and how I felt about the competition and the, the, the, the, um, prepping everything else that my daughter came in backstage when I came off stage. I was backstage. She came in and I was at I love because I was sitting down and I saw like the, the t-shirt was it. Even though I had seen the t-shirts, it was in my face. And I saw that it was a collage over the years. I hadn't put that together. And it, there comes the cathartic moment. And it just made me, and it made me upset emotionally. And, and I looked up at her and I said, please understand that I'm not emotional because I'm not going to make the top five. I'm, I'm upset because it's done. And then I realized it's kind of funny. I realized, oh shit, I better pull myself together. Everybody's going to think I'm, you know, emotional because I just got my ass smoked. Yeah, yeah, right. Right. And I'm like, oh, okay, I'm good. I'm good. I'm getting the hell out of it. And, you know, because you know, you think of those things and you never want anybody to think that and this understands situation. This cat comes with me and he posts three or four times on this video that I just put out Friday saying how much of a loser I should have felt to because my family and brought my family into it. You know, your, your kids and your wife are wearing, you know, a shirt with your pictures all over it. And you get your ass kicked and you're taking 20, well, a 20 IU of GH every day and your physique sucks. That's sort of, it is just like, God, let me, let me address that. What does it say about someone who's saying that who doesn't have a support system there to watch someone do something passionate that they love that the, the, the, the, the, the the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you can walk out that door. Hang your, hang your trunk up and say, you know what, I've got the support system here for the rest of my life, no matter what. Yeah. And it's easy for me to process that part of it. But then when you have somebody that comes after it involves while they're trying to beat you down, they pull in your kids and your wife, it's like, what kind of a piece of shit can you really be and how miserable is your life? I would be like, thank you for highlighting the real mistakes of my life that were there to with me for this moment. Thank you. Yeah. And it took me a minute and that's what I came to. But boy, that first initial, you know, you want to be, it's like, I just wish that person was six inches on the other side of that screen and I would be going through that screen after that. That's an, an understandably. It's a trigger. You know, he's doing it on purpose trying to get a rise out of me. Yeah. So I just got rid of the comments and like that. I'm not even going to address that. In 99.9%, you know, the rest, literally the rest, he was like the only one. Everybody was very supportive and understood and, you know, it was, it was cool. God, those things can hit you. You bring their, bring their family into it. Oh, shit. That's wrong. What am I doing? Trying to try to fight father time. That's all I'm doing. 55 years old. I love what I do. I understand the reality that this didn't go very well. You telling me is, is really not helping your whole life. It's just rubbing it in because if you know, people just wait for you to, the minute, you have a weak moment so they can be like, see, it's like you've been standing there on the sidelines cheering against me the whole time. Hope that I failed. It when I did, he was there to take advantage of you. Yeah, but it sounds like he's acting like you weren't going around saying for the last 10 years, I suck as a bodybuilder. I'm doing something that I love. Right. It'd be one thing if you were cocky. Oh, yeah. I'm going for that. I'm going for that pro card. It's a done deal. I'm looking good. Never once have you said anything to that effect. You've always been very self depreciating about the physique, but not about the effort and the discipline and the passion for it. And that just says more about that guy than it does about you. So yeah, 100% it's still in. No, but I still want to face book and Instagram trying to find his name. I don't just gotta say it. And you know what it is, man. There's always going to be those people out there. There are people who watch the channel who don't like me. And I don't know why, but they, you know what, like, I can't help it. You know what I'm saying? It's funny because people will be like, yeah, it's a pretty like a little guy. I don't know how anybody could like give him a thumbs down or whatever, but you know, we get it because there's going to be people who just don't like you. You rub them the wrong way or whatever. And you know that. I'm not telling you anything new. No, that's what I just want everybody to know that if you want to get me come after my kids or come after my wife and because you know what they mean to me. So you have some idea. You don't really know what it was. It was the guy you beat at the mystical Colorado in 2000. But I'm sure. You know what I'm saying? He's just been quietly following you from afar. Which he keeps little story. More like he never competed. You know, I actually did have that happen once and the guy was trash. I mean, this is years ago, trash really bad on a friend of mine's Facebook page. And I said, oh, you competed in the Colorado and whatever year it was. I went and looked. He took eight and I took third. So I just came back and I'm like, God, it's bad as I am at the sport. And you still couldn't beat me at the 2004 Colorado. Oh, you took eight and I took four. So I said, even though I'm not that good, I managed to beat you. What did you say? He came down. There was not another word. In fact, I'll go so far as to say this. I think these days, I am convinced of this. But I can't remember 100% were friends on Facebook and he's totally fucking cool. And everything is fine. Yeah. I mentioned his name, but I don't want to be wrong. Because I mean, it's cool now. You know, it's one of the things because I'm like a trash guy. Then mentioned his name before getting along. But I think we're friends now on Facebook. Yeah. And we get along and find he's got a great sense of humor. There's a good dude. He's an older guy like me who's still banging and crying and doing what he can to try to stay. Not a bad physique. I mean, I didn't go after his physique. He came after me. So this is what it is. Sometimes it works out. It's satisfying. So listen, I didn't know this on that question we had about DMSO. Keith from Parabolic, our podcast affiliate says DMSO will also carry your body. Excuse me, will cause your body to absorb any bacteria on your fingers, etc. It can be extremely dangerous. So please wear gloves. It can be very easy to get an infection. I didn't know that because I've never mastuated. I didn't know about like things like perfume. I knew that was an issue. Yeah, you mentioned soap and stuff. Yeah. Never thought about it. All I thought about is I remember guys used to take the trend pellets, just grind them up and mix it with DMSO. So you're getting glues and all of that. You did that. I'm not going to wipe my life so I started out for a little bit of a filter. I don't have to filter it. I could get around. I could just rub this alcohol with DMSO and put it on my hair. Just drink your alcohol. All right, so when you had some more questions, you know what we've done this before real matte says Scott Andrew, it would be awesome if you could. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Really? Yeah, he did. What a douche bag. Wait, maybe I messed right it. You got Andrew skipped. No, you did. No, maybe better if you said Scott Andrew, then ask the question. Yeah, just like, don't just, I read it right. It would be awesome if you could do an in depth on a protocol for GH and insulin for maximizing synergy. GH and insulin pre workout. Didn't we do that? I think we've done six of them. Six of them. Yeah, we actually had as expert Scott Stevenson on for one of them. At least if it's not more than one. So I would say probably when I was out, so he didn't hear my opinion, but I'm not given it. I'm pretty sure people heard your opinion on the patient. That's a good idea. I'm pretty sure of this. He's probably, if I'd be, he's probably like I've heard him talk about a way to my, I really don't care. He says anymore. Right. Yeah, he says he's currently using GH before bad and my humalog has been pretty work out. Sickest pumps ever is there a better protocol to maximize their synergy. Let's say no, because he said he's having sick pumps. He's growing. He's loving it. It's working for you. So I would keep doing what you're doing. I don't know. I think there's a different frame of thumb. Maybe there is, but maybe there is. Maybe skip notes about it. But when it's probably doing, you're going to pay me for it. But when it's not a little bit for him. You know, okay. Thoughts on an offseason cycle test. Plus pre-mo plus Deca or test plus mast plus Deca. With the DHT compound counteract some of the Deca dick side effects. Quite possibly. I don't know. I don't think I've ever done a combo like that to tell you the truth. I already talked about my, my tunnel analogy last. Your tunnel. Yeah, the car is the two lanes going through the tunnel. Oh, yeah. You have the tunnel. We'll send you to get a little smaller. There's a one-on-one there for failures. It wasn't a one-laner. It was like when you have construction and the lady or the guy is standing with the stop sign, then she spins it around. She gets on her walk-talkie. Only one way you can go through. Then she talks that her walk-talkie and then the turnips is slow. And then you can go. Yeah, it's just one of the times. You don't have enough room in there for two lanes. You don't have to worry about. I wanted to mention this on the other episode that'll be coming out next. Shortest cycles. Do you guys remember the 21 sustenance in 21 days cycle? And teeth. Did that? Do you remember that? That was like a good thing. Kind of, yeah, kind of. Should you do an amp-day? You do an amp-day. And that's because that's what it all was amps. You know, if you're getting sucked back then. So you do an amp-day, 21 days? I think it was preloads. And you had to use the pin that came with it. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. You would run that and then you would not take anything because you have all the long aster in there from your five grams a gear or whatever. Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah, I'm going to put that one in this probably and now I'm not going to do that. You don't who Brian Mosko, the gorilla chemist, these into those heavy front load cycles where you blast a bunch of stuff and then don't. Right. Feel like I've seen stuff like what's the name of Broderick Chavez, kind of has some thoughts similar to that if I'm not mistaken. I've seen some of his stuff. OK. Not how I do things. Yeah. Let's see. I've tried to ask this a few times, but here's one more. One more try before my surgery. I'm having Gino removed and a belly button hernia repaired at the same time in a couple of weeks. I'm not asking for medical advice. So let's say I want to do everything I can to facilitate a speedy recovery, planning on GH, not sure of the dose yet. BPC and TB. The main thing I'm concerned about is what to do with my GH and test dose? Want to lose as little muscle as possible? I would bring a testosterone down to cruising levels. You're not going to be put into the work for you. So you know, you don't have to be training for at least a month. I would say, you know, with the, you said hernia surgery? Yep. That one you're not really taking any serious loads for about four weeks because you got a brace. And it's hard. It was hard not to reach for the Peter Griffin last right there. Oh, hi. That's I've got a mom right here on my son board. Do you have one? Oh, yeah. Can you give us one right now? I think it's wouldn't be. I don't know. I'm just that serious loads. I could. Yeah, I could not. I actually said taking serious. Which was funny because Scott, it even hit Scott before it hit me. Like I was on the lay thing. This is that I probably wouldn't have caught it, but I'm in your company right now. Right. Exactly. I thought it was, I'll do you just say. So you're saying you're bringing your thought level. I don't know. The mattress keeps low. The mattress. Okay. That's what I'm talking about. All right. Does he want a serious protocol? I don't know. It's kind of fun. I would bring a test down to base levels. You know, cruising levels, whatever that is that you use. For your BPC, I would probably, if you really want to recover as fast as possible, I'd go with a 10-millogram bottle a day for probably 10 days and then drop it down to like 2 milligrams a day. I'd probably do the same thing with TB. Might add in GHK copper and then into that mix and then GH, you know, for units a day. Don't like that. 10 milligrams of BPC a day you're saying, huh? I don't know. So I know you didn't always used to say that. When did this, when did you figure this out? When did you, I'm at very curious. Tell me about this evolution. Well, there are peers to be no negative side effects with BPC, 157 in particular, right? And seeing some friends that had fairly catastrophic surgeries like, you know, ruptured quadricep type stuff. Yeah. And see them bounce, use a protocol similar to that and be able to do leg extensions like six weeks later. And then have full functionality like 12 weeks later and be back in the mixed training. That's where it's coming from. From seeing those dosages for injuries, from surgeries, from injuries that were pretty catastrophic. And you're saying 10 milligrams a day? Yeah. Okay. Because that'll explain, that explains to me then why I think BPC is utterly useless at the lower doses. I, and here's the thing. I understand that it may play out on paper, if I just haven't seen it when I can't see it and I can't, I don't have anything to measure it against. And then you say that that dose is just so high, then it makes me think, okay. Now, if I am in a situation like that, I can try those types of dosages and I can then have a better idea of whether there's an impact. That's a massive asset. That's a huge amount. Yeah. What about digestion? What are your dosing thoughts on? I'm not, I hate to switch, sorry, kind of switching and going down a rabbit hole here. But that's all right. The digestion part of it. It's far as, you know, inflammation and the reason I'm asking is because I'm looking at everything right now for the extension and inflammation. So for like my athletes that have distension issues and I think is related to GI information, we're doing a milligrams a day. And that, you know, obviously it becomes cost prohibitive, right? Because a 10-millimeter gram bottle somewhere between $45 and $60, well, you can't run that every single day. You might as well, you know, it's just too expensive, right? To do that year round. So yeah, I think there's a difference between using for maintenance and using for, like to, to fix something, right? So I'm not advocating 10-millimeter grams a day year round or anything like that. Yeah, I'm saying in that initial recovery phase, 10 milligrams a day of like TV and VPC each, and then for like digestion, you know, and this is where you got experiment between the oral and the injectable and sometimes both, you know, but I think a milligrams a day when you're really trying to fix something that justifies, you know, that probably would be a good question to ask Keith, though, to see what his experience is with them. Yeah. Yeah, I found one milligrams a day to be really good. And I know we started that that as being kind of higher, you know, than what you hear it said, the only other person I've talked to that's talked about high, high dosing like that was Dave Dave Crossland, and he was doing it with IV, you know, in the, in the, like medical setting. So he could run it that way. And I think he was doing five milligrams IV per day. Might have been higher than that, though, but that's, yeah, that's pretty, pretty incredible. And I imagine IV, you're getting even, you know, like a bigger, a bigger booster, whatever, you know, and I mean a bigger peak. You're getting a quicker peak, for sure. Yeah. I mean, you're putting it right to the sore. You're putting it right into the systemic, you know, system versus having to go into through muscle or fat, having to capillaries have to pick it up and then to bring it into the system. So yeah, not that I would recommend people at home who are untrained. I, I can't get behind that. Doing, doing IV. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's kind of like me recommending bloodletting with a coffee hand off the side of your day. I remember that. I listen to that podcast. I can still have people who would comment on that every now and then. I used to IV, like the GHRP's in I for more than. I was saying that. Yeah, I wanted to cut down on the time. You know, remember how you took it and you had to wait a certain amount of time before you could. Yeah. So my schedule was set up. He's like, I just don't have this time. So I've got 10 minutes. I don't have 30 minutes, you know. And I remember one of my clients, I didn't lock the bathroom door at the gym and he comes in and he's like, oh, bro, what do you do? And I'm like, it's not heroin did. I promise. It's not one of those, you know, it's not a wreck drug. It's, and he was like, what is that? And then he's like, I want some, you know, I'm like, yeah. You don't want to get started down this rabbit hole buddy. Let me see what else we had here. I think we had like a couple more like cycle related questions. Believe it or not. Let me see here. Oh, have you ever had a client who was vegetarian or vegan prep for a show? I'm definitely neither, but I'm curious how difficult and different it was. This is from Colton, over on Patreon, thanks, Colton. And he does a bunch of our reels and stuff for us to Greek dude. I only say, only take, I prefer strongly prefer that a client's are going to compete and their vegan or they have some type of special diet that they are very well versed and experienced with their situation. Yeah. Because those people are very good with the substitutions of the foods that they need. They know what they need. It's not as much of a trial and error type of thing. If they're new to it, there are times where I'll be like, I don't think I'm your guy. Not because I don't want to do it because I'm being fair. It's not in my wheelhouse, especially for a competition. Yeah, I've had several athletes over the years. It's definitely not my forte or to more of my preference. We developed like this Satan recipe that was very low carb because the problem is is trying to find protein sources that also don't combine carbohydrates or fats even. So for some of those stretches where you've got to put someone on zero carbs and zero fats, it's kind of hard to do that. So a lot of plant-based protein drinks, a lot of Satan. Now I get along really well with people who are like, I'm a vegan but I do egg whites. Are we good? Yeah, I'm like, 1000% good. We can work. If someone ever to reach out to me today and they're vegan, I would definitely be. I've only passed them on to someone else though. There's a lot more time involved with doing all the macros and figuring all that kind of stuff out. Yeah, just not for me anymore. In the micro's too. I remember, and I'm with you guys. I wasn't sure what you guys were going to say, but I definitely tell people, like, I don't think that I'm the right coach for you when they're vegan. In part of it is too, I don't want you to just be eating the same single-dead source five times a day. And then I've had people who are like, hey, I hooked up with this coach and I'm like, what are you doing? Oh, egg whites, five times. Yeah. No. Okay. You know? I remember working with this girl to help get her digestion on track. And she had been eating plenty of food, but she wasn't eating healthy. Right? She wasn't eating like a good vegan diet. And she wasn't a competitor and she wasn't even really lifting consistently. It was a friend of a competitor that I worked with. And I helped her as a favor and ended up becoming this big hassle in Victoria helped me help her. We got a bunch of lab work done. And we basically looking at her diet or looking at her lab work, she was in like a starvation state of malnutrition. No. Even though she was holding a decent amount of body fat and eating a decent amount of food each day, just because she didn't have, like you were saying, skip didn't have that diet structured right. Didn't know what she was doing with it. I honestly, I think that if you don't know what you're doing as a vegetarian and even more so as a vegan, I think that it's a very dangerous diet. It's a lot easier if you're going to just eat like meats, like a normal people do. It's a lot easier to not be good at your diet and still skate by versus you really need to know what you're doing if you're going to go that route. That's my thoughts. That would be vitamins iron. I'm sure a major thing. Oh, yeah. No. All right. Let's see what else we had here. Thought that was one worth bringing up, which we don't really get that often. I don't think too many of our listeners are vegetarian. Although I think we do have a few of them. I've got another thing too when people are like, well, I'm vegetarian, but I like to run a gram of trend. I'm trying to make up for the fact that I'm not eating meat. I have met people like that. Same here. That's actually kind of common with males that are vegan. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to prove it to the world. I mean, hey, Scott, love this show. Been watching all your content on the channel for the previous 12 months. This is Matt from Patreon, by the way. Thought this was a, here's my question. I have a custom blend, which consists of per one ML. 10 milligrams of superdraw. 10, 20 milligrams of debol, 30 milligrams of anoddraw, 10 milligrams of test no after and 10 milligrams of trend no after all in one mill. He says I have three vials, 30 mil. So about 30 shots worth. What's the best way to utilize this? Get an attorney because you're probably going to be served papers for divorce in the next 30 days. You're like, wrong. You're like, wrong. I'm not going to like that. It's like bra of just talented. I mean, I'm probably going to want to. I'd heal it with that. Yeah. Yeah. I'd check, I'd check, drop. Yeah. I mean, it's obviously a pre-workout blend. Yeah. Health drive. Aggression, strength and, uh, and, uh, androgen, androgenicity. Um, what's the best way to run it? I guess what is your, what is your weakest body part that you need to bring up? I would maybe start there. Um, I, man, I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to sit it up to me to test that. I'll give you my answer in a month. Yeah. You know, 10 milligrams of test no Esther. I don't feel like that's a lot. You know, that's not much. But combined with 10 milligrams of, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's 30 anodero, 20 debo, 10 super drog. It's a combo. I mean, beyond your blood pressure meds, you know, it's like a power lifting pre-workout. Yeah. I'm trying to think like, if you're trying to break through a strength plateau, that would be where these would come through. If you're a power lifter, probably that those last 12 days, you know, a couple of CC's a day and you're going to be feeling like Superman. You can run through a wall. Um, I, in terms of real body building, though, I don't know how much of a real application they have, like, long term, you know. Yeah. I would think maybe at like you were saying strength toward the end of a cycle, maybe you're already really strong. You're just trying to push for some additional strength. In frequently, maybe two times, maybe three times a week, go for the course of three weeks and then save the rest for another cycle. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty workout. Maybe if it's an oil base, maybe an hour and a half, pretty workout. But, you know, I found with the injectable debo that I could definitely get going within 30 minutes. Usually it's always said like the injectable oil bases, oils, you want to wait like two hours. But I, because, you know, water base, like, uh, T&E, instant, like, you know, within 30 minutes, you're training. But I, I found the same as true with the oil base debo. Like, good pumps with that. So, yeah. So, I'll speak here. I think we had maybe one more question that had to do with a cycle or something. Yet sure does. Guys, leave us some more questions for the next show. Leave us some training questions for the next show. We'd like that. We had a lot of fun talking about training recently. Running my TRT cruise of 210 test in 105 DACA. Plan on running a cycle of 600 test 300 DACA 300 EQ in a few months. When the time comes to jump on the blast, doesn't make sense to keep the 105 DACA and make the difference up with NPP or just go with more DACA. I like to overcomplicate things. Yeah, I was like, that comes. Yep, maybe. Like, you know, um, I would, if this was me and I was presented with these compounds, I would just get rid of the DACA and use NPP. Yeah, I like that. That's my answer, yeah. I wonder what's his uskering going to do with 300 test 300 EQ. And then what's going to happen if he has low test and then jumps on to punch an NPP, the same amount, one to one to one. I'd just be curious. I'm not saying it's a, it's a, it's not saying it's like a problem, but it could be, you know, feel great after five weeks. And these days people run DACA 800 milligrams with no test. I know. Say they feel great. So you never know. There is that. You know, you know, somebody asked us about estrogen, like, what kind of, how much estrogen earned it, what type of estrogen should I take, what brand? I think they said. And it's not something I'm aware of, honestly. What brand? I mean, I guess, yeah, I'm confused. I can't remember the exact, but it was like they were looking for the specific estrogen. If I want to raise someone's estrogen, I'll probably just put throw five to 10 milligrams of mentin, like every other day. And that tends to do it. Pretty well. That's not a bad idea. I was going to go the other out and just say that I just don't ever want to give any man, any male estrogen. I just want to change your gear so that you have something that aromatizes. But that's not a bad idea. I would not have thought of the mat. That's a good call. Yeah. Both will get you the same place, theoretically. Five deep all. Or yeah, five deep all, maybe. I don't know. All right. Well, we appreciate you guys tuning in. We appreciate both of you guys hanging out and watching or recording the show with me. And you, I know you have a bunch of travels that are lined up. And man, this is a very busy time, I think, in the season for coaching, isn't it? Dude, I've been to the gym myself. I've been to the gym twice in like 16 days. Yeah. Yeah. It gets like that doesn't it? I don't miss 90% of my client-based being competitors. I'm going to be honest with you. I don't miss it. I still enjoy working with competitors. Not at that percentage, not at that ratio anymore. No. No. I mean, I'm more less competitive and more less not as many competitors as I used to. But I'm in a window right now. And I knew that from the beginning of the year, like every week, I've got stuff going on now. It's, you know, but it's not all season for me. So I'm okay with that. Well, I'm taking on new clients. I kept my client-based at about roughly 60% from the beginning of the year. Because I knew I had two things that were going to be relatively time-consuming. I'm not. Frupped in the new show. So when I finally found that groove and it was getting closer to the show, I thought, okay, I'm probably announced that I'm going to take on more clients after the show. And I've been getting quite a bit of inquiries for the last month and a half from the, I didn't even have to. I didn't really have to say anything. So primarily from the new show, from being honest. And as we're seeing more growth there, a little bit from, you know, from competing. Because, you know, you pick and choose the pictures you're going to put out. Like everybody does, right? And they'll be like, oh, which is a weird thing to me. I never want clients to approach me because they've seen a picture. I want them to approach me because they know of me. They know of my reputation, things like that. Yeah. But yet at the same time, I'm not turning them away. They're so. Sure. It is what it is. So I didn't have to announce it after I was just cool. Mark says, um, I did a little deep all when estrogen crashed with EQ once and was better in a day, literally 10 milligrams of deep all once a week is all he used. Oh, just once a week. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, there you go. Hey, it might be worth somebody to give that a try, you know, if they ended up in that situation, I suppose. Yeah, I hope to think there was still a little bit of this going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Spread out a little bit. Then it probably would have been a little bit more stable. But, you know, be noticed the difference every day. You guys, we appreciate you tuning in. Go to, in fact, I heard that skip is taking new clients. You can go to teamskip.com to reach out to skip. And you, oh, he says once a day, you know, you're going to be a good guy. You can go to teamskip.com to reach out to skip. And you, oh, he says once a day for a week. Oh, there you go. All right. That makes sense. And you can go to bodybary.com to reach out to Andrew Hittme up at ValleyDiats at gmail.com. And of course, true nutrition.com, use our code, think supplement source.ca for Canadians. Thank you to everybody from Patreon and for another episode of Blood Sweat and Gear. We will see you guys soon.

But I still believe this at 85% James. And see it right. So, but hey, if you prep yourself and you're getting these comments, like, and you know what to do, you're not just prep yourself. Prep yourself, rep yourself. And the more you do it, the more you do it, the more frequently, every time an opportunity to experiment, you're going to learn from everything this. We absolutely are going to take it to, I can't wait to see what happens next. Yeah, you know, again, and I can't be put off like, they might, the other mistakes make sure. Sure, there will be, there will be is what it is, it's life. But you know what, only takes man in it at once to get the look that you wanted, which is the one that goes down in history. It's just body building, special edition. It's going to be a bit of a short one because this guy's got places to be. Please do. Remember, like, share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. I am you dot com, get your eyes searched, get your all in everyone should get on the gear. You know how this works. James Hawling's head, the epitome of British body building. Yes. It is awesome to get you man. It is awesome to get you on the show. I was hoping to run into you. You know, these ex-bos are you don't always see everybody, especially when you're in the show. And we're not the type of guys are going to run around and how many people. And the fact you came by to see us is just so fantastic. Well, I knew that I was going to keep something that you free to come and check out with the boys. Yeah. And I found your safety anecdote. I said, there's a few people I need to go see Evan. I need to see Dusty. I need to see Scott. And he's he wrong. And I kind of thought I'm going to drop them. So I thought it's Evan already. That's fantastic. That's my very catching up with you boys. You know what, last night when I saw where you wound up, I, the first thing I thought I was like, oh, we got to get him on the show again. And then I was like, is he going to be on two times or three times and actually went back and looked at all your episodes of the last night. And the last time you were on, he wore no shirt. Do you remember that? Yeah, he was shirtless. I said, we let this show go. shirtless. Got a little hair on the chest. The trap set. It was always like, I was like, what's this? I was more views. It was awesome. It was like, I was like, I was lying in the ball. No, you're not sitting there. You were, it was, it was, it was awesome. I was like, I forgot about this. Fantastic. I think I was on some strong stabby. Just hot. She's like, I just want to throw some. I just want to throw some. I just, you know, just keep it going. So let's, let's get down to business. So we can get this out of the way. Everyone was excited to see you. You've got a lot of people that were really, really pulling for you to, to be at your best and all that stuff. And you come up with a great place. You get to Arnold Classic. How do you feel about it this morning? I feel good. I feel good. I feel like somebody could have said, I did really sleep last night because I was thinking about how can I improve? No kidding. Yeah, I never stopped. I knew it. Yeah, I noticed small tweaks. The necessary in order to be better. You know, I looked at the school called this morning. I was like looking at what the judges prefer. Yeah. And, you know, just to underline really quickly, they preferred the breed jumps look, which was a fuller, more kind of exploded look, which I thought might be actually a little bit too full. Because sometimes that is the case. Right. I watched you out a little bit, make you look so lean. But the scorecards reflected that I was about to look. So I basically just slept last night and I was going through my notebook in my head about what did I do day one versus day two. And how to then take that into the next show which is going to be the UK Arnold. Yeah. Well, be there. And it's just a preference of probably a bit more fluid, a bit more food. Right. I thought the war quite hard for the second day is, you know, we all think of coming on the second day a little bit sharper. It's an improvement. Sometimes for some of the things is not because so there's a debate when they're full because you sit a let's bear. So I'm definitely a sit a let go when the fullness is there. I can pose a lot better and not more confidently. Right. So yeah, last night for me was another day in the office thinking about how to eat out and improve from here. Really, I didn't really set up any idea to check in sandwich. Because I know what to do for another two weeks. So you guys are going to be in the UK in a couple of weeks. Yep. So you know, don't wrong. I don't have a few meals off today. It's a morrow because I have to eat anyway. My feet does require a lot of food. Yeah. But I'll be back on the colored cardio and the training schedule routine or more not. If there's heavy as a can and join it. You've put up that most muscular this morning on each on Instagram and it just. It just looks just packed like it really does. You know when your cram is much rice into a cup as you can. You want to say this. I'll surprise and you'll like take an absmises. Yeah. You got one cookie. Yeah. Yeah. You got one cookie. You got one cookie. I have a little bit of 60 inches. Yeah. But you know, you know, you know, again, we've had this discussion about your times. We're not sure if it's a British body building, the hardcore training, the just genetics or whatever. It is, but that that grainy pack dance look that you you carry and the way you train and the way you inspire other people and then what you bring to the stage. And we're just big fans. We know a lot of our audiences just all about that stuff. They're really happy for you. I think, you know, as we on it's most of us, most of us body build not necessarily for the end result. The stage, not for the feeling of the gym, which is hard work. Yeah. Yeah. It only comes from lifting like a savage like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You push yourself to the limits and what is pushing yourself to the limits. Really is. Yeah. And as heavy as you can with movements and moving and mistricked as you can. Yeah. And that's just like that's just the need of us. We will live by it. And as a byproduct of the house that you build a physique. But I think even if the stage was there or not, all of us would do that because that test in yourself is actually the reason we live. You know, I've always said it's like the stage is fun. It's great and it's really good to help with your career and that, you know, promote yourself and become a face. But even if the stage lights were off and there was no cameras, we'd all be going in a gym every day and trying to defy that. And that's me, it's the fun part. Yeah. I know I'm not sure I'm not a short road and I'm not a flex wheeler. I'm never going to be. But like you guys said, and like a lot of my friends and supporters say, you represent the hard workers. Yeah. You've got that kind of muscle that is. Yeah. I'm just like, I didn't muscle, you know. I'm just saying, you know, my business partner Jordan P is friends of you guys. Yep. He's the same as me. No, we really push the limits of trying to get strong and have fun and enjoy training. And it shows, man. Your legs this year. Look, I've been watching your picture all along. I was seven rows back and just seeing your legs and then seeing your legs compared to other guys. The guys are happy you guys have placed it at you and you are not lacking in the leg department at all. But you're not absolutely in this game. The funny thing is, I don't know if you guys know, but I have an injury this year. I didn't know that. I'm not able to squat for hot sport if it's just four months. You're kidding me. So I've been doing very specific training around it using a tennis machine and never fit my feet. Wow. So I did see you with some of the, the sticky is doing some stiff leg as I think. I've had to literally like, I would have never known. I would never know. Man, this is a bodybuilding that you do. You do what you've got to do to get a job done. Yeah. You train upside down. If you have to. I've heard people put it in our, this show was going to be in three. I was like, sorry. But like, that's pretty, that branch warrant, story is caught off the bone. Six months prior to winning the second round of classic. Yeah. You want to be a good bodybuilder. So I'm, I hate said you just want to mount the fuck up. Yeah. I've got a great gym. I've got a quit and I can use it can help me at least bring a level of quality. And it could be a blessing in disguise because it allows me to put some more emphasis on some of the body parts that perhaps could do the work. Right. So I was like, okay, Jay, just, just use that as an opportunity to then improve. I've very, as we really focus on those things that you've improved in the night. I definitely think on day one of the show. When I was full with the improvements in the upper body with that current in certain areas, which was my objective to share anyway. Right. It's good always be bigger, you know, for sure. But I think I might have put my career where it's more now about the upper body. I can see that. Yeah, just because the cause of our fight peak, so therefore you can, I don't think you can ever have to be in upper body. I always look at like Luke Sandos physique. You know, he was a great friend of mine. He was a little bit top heavy, but it kind of was the look that trying to get up. Yeah. And he was still young too. He was a little bit of a little bit of a time. So I kind of, he's kind of my inspiration for what the fans like to see, what the judges like to see. Because you know, he played Sturden, it's just showed. He did great condition and just at all around the amazing bodybuilder. So yeah, I've got my kind of like aspirations and I still feel like this more that could be achieved. So I just take one show at a time. I'm going to tell you man, you mentioned Luke. And he was the first person I thought of last night. Same thing. We still do. I was the first person I thought of. I don't think I could think of anybody that would have been proud or man. Ben actually message me often. It was really sweet of him. He said that Luke would have loved to see that. So yeah. You know, we arrived here and I was here in 2020 with Luke when COVID happened. Yep. We were actually flown over in the perfect day. Which was quite flashing. We had a great time. But we went to the Kroger store. And only time I really got emotional this weekend is when we pulled up outside Kroger because I remember me a Luke going there to buy his like groceries. Yeah. Yeah. And it just took me back to a moment where I was like, you know, you know, I might get a bit emotional now. But like the realization that he isn't here. Yeah. So yeah, like every show I do to his fans kind of like for there's two people there for really. They're mostly for Luke and my mother like they were like, I have to keep those as my aspirations because there was a time when I, you know, my mother passed away. I considered her gone and then it became hard to understand my reasons for keeping in because I just not here anymore to celebrate the men's or the victories or the achievements. Right. But then then he hadn't realized like, yeah, they may not be here in physical form. But then with you and like like Luke's with me all the time. I got picture in the normal wall in the gym. Massive one. So if I'm doing shit sets and I'm not working on nothing is peer-endowning me like, Jay, if the fucking week is pussy. So you know, I suppose your inspiration just comes from you and it's down to you to keep your inspiration. I'm intended to live. Yeah. So I find inspiration in that and obviously there's inspiration as well in just in yourself thinking, you know, if one further than I expected, they see our fight as a pro. So if you asked me like, make four years ago, five years ago, I always like struggling in pros shows. Then you know, top three is an advantage to win a few and then you know, I'm a classic baby or my. Yeah. Fifth is good, yeah. But you know, I went to bed last night and it's not good enough. But if I take a moment and breathe, it is really good. If anyone else got fit for their pro debut at the Arnold, yeah, I'd be tapping them on the back and well done. Yeah. So you just got to take a step back sometimes to be like, you know what, it's good. It's funny too because if I sent you a message today on Instagram or last night, I can't remember. And I typed a big message, I deleted it and then I typed another one and I deleted it because part of me didn't quite know what to say to you because I was so happy for you and so proud of you and I thought a lot and all that stuff. But then I also know what it's like for people that congratulate you on something and you're actually not happy. I thought, do I send this message? He might actually be really upset and like, you know, maybe he had third or third or third or whatever. Like maybe he had like a placing his head that was acceptable and and you know what I mean and I said, I don't want to send him like this big thing he's got to read it. I saw it. I said it way more than I do. So I just said I just said congrats man. Like you know what I mean. No, no, no, it was a I was happy because for a moment I felt in my feet last night I faded quite odd. It was like fix I did I basically just was a bit too dehydrated. Okay, so I was like, oh shit I messed it up. So luckily in pre judging my points were so low that it kept me in a good position and even though I came back really strong. Yeah, actually was top four in the evening call outs. You looked really good like I said to me, don't doubt yourself. I said you're fucking fantastic like, yeah, he wasn't feeling too good yesterday. I said, dude, you got great muscle muscle. But luckily my points from the pre judging mixed with the finals was still enough that it came out low enough that I placed in fifth and not sick. Because I was at a kid man, I thought you had it bro. I was like, and he said, yeah, he said I messed up pre judging blah blah blah. He's a really good sound by that. Yeah, look at what's in him again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway, I don't even know where I'm going but I blast the situation that kind of happened. So of course, there's me thinking the body better in me is like, shit, I gave up his spot. Because I don't look at what I've done, I look at what I didn't. And yeah, I know that I was 24 points in pre judging with John De La Rosa who plays four for then. Oh, guys. I was here a tide with him. Oh, I see it. And I just hit. So I chose to do something. And it was a detriment to my physical. Oh shit. So I'm just the frustrated guy like, oh damn. Because he's only a simple thing. It's like you choose to go left or right. Yeah. And I chose to go right because I thought the judges would appreciate it. So change. Again, like I said earlier, your physique is displayed best on the certain circumstances where I unfortunately made a bit of a call which not be a place. Just for for it on what's better. Yeah. You can take that into weeks in learn from it. Plus you'll be closer to home. Sure. My plan now is I just pick up the book that I've wrote everything in. And I just look away done and I will try to kind of mirror a day one. Obviously, that has to be so much just because it isn't what you do today. So we're doing it day before as well. Right. You know, there isn't a cumulative effect. So I could do day two and they won again on day two. And it's still what we do the same as day one. Yeah. Because obviously you've done things in place. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a stack up. Yes. And I was just thinking about what's the middle ground between the two and that in order to allow for that to be about look. So. Now, tell me about Branch. How long were you training with Branch at Plano? I mean, it was a week. So I was really lucky to have the great relationship with the guys over in Dallas. I flew out there on the Saturday. Uh, Santa Cop. There were a lot of the issues over there. So she knows that she's taking care of business. She books everything. Yeah. So anyway, I was there some Saturday the week before. And we stayed till Wednesday. I texted Branch and said, if you're a fancy game like a session in, let me know dude. He said, hell yeah. That is absolutely his answer. Yeah. He's not a mess. He's not much to a Monday. And I'm like, uh, that's a good impression. Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, I'm not the adjustment date. You want to do some chances. I sure think, uh, I don't even notice this birthday. But why it was just birthday on Monday. Two. Trish his wife was about to give birth. Oh, he still wanted to drink. Okay. So that's the first thing. The second thing. Even if I just over 50 and I know that, it's a Trish can cook a steak. She's like this. Oh my god. She doesn't mind. No, she's the same as him with the mentality. She's still working. Yeah. I just want to say, I just want to say, you know, I hope my Jesus, like, like, it's a true honor to be accepted into a household, where there's a lot of private things going on, where people don't necessarily need to let you in that door. They have their own life and things going on. Yeah. So it's a feel welcomed in there. When we don't have to be really, really meant a lot to me. Uh, you know, show me his office. The Arnold Classic trophies pick one up. So you pick one up. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's different. Yeah. I picked him up. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. To still think that, he's building my future ready. Like, his part of my, all the events happened now. What's going to determine what's going to happen. So those events are encouraging. And the fact that he encouraged me so much. I just very, very thankful. So we trained on Monday. And then Monday, no, he's like, we were with his other friend, Reagan, who's fucking funny. That's what Reagan left us. That was flat. He bastard. Where's like the most outrageous shorts and socks and trainers. Like, he's obviously got, he's been very well from so pretty. Anyway, they like, put the trains tomorrow. So I'm like, yeah, let's go again. So we did back the next day. Yeah. So we got two days in. And then Wednesday was just like an arm day. So it was calm. So I just wanted to chill. Broch, Trish was during Wednesday. They've not even just drew. She had to see a section put him. It's the, because they had it red. So he's trained with me. He's like, well, he's nice to have. I just started bumpers anyway. So a little bit of arms on Wednesday. So I had two days. It was enough to give me some motivation for this last week. And I do believe, you know, branch is very supportive. He's like, you can win any show you do. And it's just about getting right. And that's the reason I see last night. I went to bed a little bit for a shake. Because I know that I'm still only really probably presenting like an 80-five percent tape because I'm not the best of the people. I'm proud of myself. So, okay. So it's like, I'm still learning and I'm just hard to kind of know exactly what to do. Unless you make mistakes. But I knew that's where you did well was because because you made that decision for, guys, I like this. I know. I know. That's awesome. It's good to see you guys. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, you're the best. I think the, the mistake long term is a huge play because had you done the same thing and not seeing drastic movement. You wouldn't. You still don't know. Maybe I should come and drive. Yeah. Then you do it next week and you drop a place. Sure. Sure. That's, that's what they've done. This is, you're getting data. You know. Data. That's why he said we got this little, little notebook. I physically write it with my messy scrubby angle. I think I could read. It says coded. Yeah. Yeah. If he would ever find my notebook, they would not be able to use my hand. But think it's a physics equation. Yeah. I just think it's a smart way to do it. That's what it's like. It's rice. Yeah. Yeah. Like you say, it's just information for the Goron Board and I know that I've got, I really need to lock in a Doof, you showed it to you just to find my those bits. You know, practice those end days. Well, I, I had people say they thought it was the best you ever learned. Is, is that? I think it was on the stage, but I still believe it's an 85% James. It's the seed right. So, but hey, if you prep yourself and you're getting these comments, like, You know what to do with the ideas. Yeah. You're going to do it yourself. You're going to do it yourself. And then you're going to do it the more you do it the more frequently. It's every, every time an opportunity to experiment, you're going to learn from everything This. Absolutely. You're going to take it to, I can't wait to see what happens next. Yeah. You know, again, and I can't be put off like they might, the other mistakes make sure. Sure. There will be, there will be is what it is. It's life. But you know what, only takes an alien in it at once. Yeah. To get the look that you wanted, which is the one that goes down in history. Yeah. So, you know, this is one picture of like fucking Dorian in 93 or 95. And you're like, the only took it to get it right. I know you're going to write quite a few times. But if you had only got it right, that once you saw that picture, that picture is Let's just know forever. Yeah. So, you know, that's my kind of goal with what it was just to build a really freaking man at one show where it's just like, you know what, that one time. Like, that was an undeniable. One of the best physics to speak. I remember talking to Jay, I mean, he didn't want my stores in like, six and he had pictures from 01. And I was looking at him, I'm just shaking my head and he goes, that picture hunks my life. It was a really good. And he had matched up. Yeah, yeah. It took a lot of money. And as good as it always been, it took eight years to do it again. I think he was putting this crazy. Like, I've had looks that some people, for this show. I've had 30 people for back in 2020, and my last week. Right. Last week was 20, 22 in Italy. Yeah. Some people is their favorite, but then other people, you know, two years before the Europa Pro, then I know it was the best show. You know, there's a preference side. But, you know, some people might even still prefer 01. Yeah, it's the 01. Right. Yeah. I think I might, you want it, those. Right. I think 01. I think it's incredible. Don't get me wrong, but for me, no, 01 is just so streamlined. And I've done it in something about it. That's just amazing. But he's done it. And that picture's there forever. Oh yeah. So that's what I'm trying to say. I want to find out one picture I want to put on the wall in the gym. It exists because he turned up. Yep. Yeah. Well, I know you've got a lot of stuff to do. And a lot of people, maybe you know, you're not going to go see anymore. I haven't really got enough in plan to move and lie. I thought it'd have really killed A. So just once around 10 loads of people. Oh, okay. We felt like we were maybe keeping it. Oh, yeah. Roughly. Well, tell them. The wife knows 20. About about 15. Oh, it's for a lot of friends. Oh, really. Okay. We're like, we're flying in the lock and down. When you sat down, Scar was like, I think he's got five minutes. Yeah. Okay. That's why he's really good that the show is on the Saturday and the Friday because then you have the Sunday to do this and catch up with your friends. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. So I'm happy to sit down and she's really nice. Yeah. We'll set up. And we've had phones on. You don't have to. Yeah. You guys do it right. Anyone that's watching you have to respect and understand that these guys really do guard their way to give you something that's very, very high quality, easy listening, great visually and just like, I watch you guys all the time. Like I always put on the reaction videos. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I watched, you know, obviously the button that's one of those we do. That is on a Ronnie one recently. You did one for me and I was like, sweetly trained them of amph. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. It's funny. Some of these memories. And you guys, you know, you just keep it real and you present bodybuilding for what it is. That's why I'm always going to have a rapport with you guys because we all kind of have the same mental health. We just, I mean, I kids speak for these guys too, but we just love bodybuilding our whole lives. And then I believe all three of us loved it for the right reasons. Yeah. And I mean, and we were all in it for the right reasons I think. And we all continue to stay in the industry for the right reasons. And that's why we recognize people that we feel are like that. You know, and I mean, truly passionate like you said training, even if there was no recognition and all that sort of stuff. Our followers are your fans because that's who you are too. Yeah. The best socks want to say thank you to them as well because I get lost tonight and actually, you know, it athletes meet and I think me and some of the lost two people standing in there. We're in it to a half nine and there's worth every minute. So, so British bodybuilding. Yeah. Let's talk about this. You like I said, you've always been like one of the greatest representations of what I always sort of, you know, I mean, it all started with the worrying and right. I mean, he said this standard and sort of this this mystical sort of, you know, guys training in old castles, old castle dungeons with dragons off to the side behind cages and, you know, just this crazy sort of, you know, middle age type. Like the medieval medieval time training like just this, you know, and I know that it was built up from all the kind of, you know, the young, young, Dory and fan, it just kind of got built up over the years, but there is really an underlying culture of that over in England. And I tell people about it. It's it's real. It's there. You go, you go talk to the guys. You see the shows. You talk to the bodybuilders. And now you and Samson, you know, two of the most popular guys in the world from the UK. Do you talk about representing England together? Do you, does it ever come up or you guys have an inside joke about British bodybuilding? I don't know. When we do talk, I'm very proud of him. Yes. Hey, we turn pro to say, yeah. Oh yeah. I'm actually being in my liberation nationals. Right. There you go. Samson, that's a tie we'll never have. But we got, we have a great friendship. And obviously we're, we're, we're rivals. Obviously he's elevated to be in, you know, very, very successful bodybuilder. But he's always got time for me. I've always got time for him. We caught up this morning. We had a great chat. You know, we discussed everything inside bodybuilding. And you know, the way there is today. And we got his job as a back. And I tried to lift him up. He lifts me up. He's a great person. We're very different obviously because we don't have a lot of time. We don't, they're so trained like the same. I think it's like a whole typical like. You've got Dorian in your flesh. Right. It's like, you train certain ways in its responsive to your physique. I know that I know for example, like Samson, don't you, you're running, you're just running heavy. Oh, he trained a lot more like volumeless than someone like me. Yeah. And again, he's he kind of represents 50% of our nation. The ones that are like him. And I represent the other 50. So it's great because we're covering both grounds. And someone can relate to one or the other. But then again, the mentality is the same. We're both hungry. And the nasty physique. Well, yeah, like, because he's nasty as well. Yeah. He's aesthetic, but he's huge. Oh, yeah. It's a different kind of nasty. Dude, like, there's many nasty, the term nasty like, yes, but what is nasty to you? He's nasty. It's thickness and size and the traps coming on stage. Yeah, man. I'm standing behind him when we're about to come stage. You look at the other traps hanging and stuff. And you're like, this dude's done his homework. He's working hard. The legs, the sweet calves, even. You know, you say it in the tip of your life, like he's wrinkled because. But dude, he's got calves that are like poppin like that. So that's a myth. That's just me being lazy. Yeah. And that sounds like Samson's incredible. But I'm lucky to see him. The whole UK scene, they're very supportive. Like, Sam is a very good friend of mine. Yeah. Yeah, sure. And I get him really, really well. And I respect him. He was kind of a lot of my motivation coming up because he was a huge, he was actually junior Mr. Britain two years before me. Yeah. And obviously, Flex said, time for everybody. You know, he was the first guy to like really come out here and do some damage. So there's plenty of people to draw motivation on from our peers. And now, hopefully I'm doing the same for them. Absolutely. Absolutely. Samson said he said he's so great to see like British bodybuilders actually step it up and do his big shows. Because there was an absence of it for a long time, especially like in the kind of early 2000s. We had a lot of pros, but no one really done anything. You know, no disrespect, but you had like, I think only tried to really have got to the lift, he was Eddie Abu. Yeah. Because he did, he got third in like the Iron Man or something. Yeah. And then other than that, like we've had pros, but he haven't really done much. There's some really good ones like Lee Powell, Lee Powell's incredible. Yeah. I know he made it to the Olympic and John Hotshin. So respect to those. They were early Taylor, Medley. They made it to the Olympic tents as well. Yeah. So we have had some of these just a little bit of a quiet appearance. So it's nice to have like a resurgence of it. And you know what, those guys, they're great because they actually do support us. So not people who share on the kind of three air guys because they think they don't like us guys. But real recognised real. Yeah. So it's like you guys, if they see someone training hard, they do respect it. You certainly that certain types of modern body builders, they don't really have respect for us. Everyone paints that we've approached like, I don't like new school body builders. No, they do, but they like people that train for the reasons they're right. Like you said. So if that's always going to be the case. It's going to, it's going to, for every time, people like yourself like me. The next generation comes off to me. I'm going to show a lot of appreciation and respect to those guys because they're keeping alive what we love. Yes, that's what it is. So yeah. Well, we're going to roll. Okay. Now I'm coming to England next week. We're coming for the UK. Yep. We're going to cherry on. And then when I go back over for Fibo, I got a stop in London. And I want to come to the, the shed. Yeah, I need you over. So oh, yeah. Yeah. So if we can do an episode at your, you and JP's Jim, I would love that. Who would love to come and hang with you guys. And I look forward to seeing you. Yeah. Possilady's going to take a photo of us while we're on air. You're going to fit us all in. Awesome. There you go. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you so much. James this shed. Paulings. And I'm bucking on the game. Get on the gear. He loves everyone. Lo's that line. Okay. Thanks, James. I love having you on. Subscribe, comment, and bring the bow. I am mutant.com. Everyone get on the gear. It's just body building. I'm getting a shot all standing. No, no, no. No, no, no. Thanks, James. Thanks. I love you. Thanks. Bye. That's right. You're going to follow us. Thank you.

to the restaurant, master on trend, when straw. Geat for me. Do I want to add in trend or do I want to add in T3? I'm not a high dose T3 guy back in the day we used to be that was kind of a message board. They 25 microgram then jump to maybe 40, you know, 37, 5 whatever 50. I kind of tap it at 50. If you got to go above 50, you're, I'll tell you what, any future clients. If I push you up over 50, we need to get things going. Things are not going well. What's up guys? Welcome back to Blood Sweat and Gear with coaches. Skip Hill and Drew Barry myself Scott McNalley and all of our programming is brought to you by you. The people of Patreon. Thank you guys very much for your support. We are brought to you by true nutrition.com. Use our code, think over there to get some additional savings on high quality third party tested supplements, all your basic body building stuff. You know, protein, creatin, intro workout, stuff like that. And of course supplement source.ca for our Canadians. They have great deals that change week to week on short dated and label change products. Also, I think that's it. Yeah, that's it. And it's brought to you guys by us. Three people that have basically given their lives to learning how to do coaching at the professional level for years. So I have a fun kind of gear related topic for you guys. I wanted to ask. All right. If you know, how do we work this? If you could only use five compounds for a contest prep. What would they be limited to five? Which sounds like a lot without the gift. You know what I mean? You know, you can only use ten compounds. We don't hear what you're listening. You start off with a quick story because I know I said this before, but I used to personal train right and I had a woman who was trained who was you know interested kind of in what we do. Jen Popperson, but and we're training. She knew I was like two or maybe ten days out from a contest and she's like. Andrew, you take you take gear right and choose the different words, but yeah, I want to flag the logarithm. So I can say and I'm sure she probably said right. Yeah, basically she is. Yeah, and we get to start and I'm like, I'm like, yeah, and she's like, okay. So what like once a week do you like take a shot and I'm like. Lori, I'm on 14 different compounds today alone. Okay, and I started rattling off all these names in her mind. It's like, but you look so healthy. I'm like, I mean, I'm pretty healthy. Like I'm I would match my blood work against yours right now. And I don't think it's that. Of course. Yeah. She was very overweight. And I tried to explain like how and I kind of alluded this to the last episode about how the cardiovascular The clean eating like a kind of offsets in some way shape or form some of the damage we're doing to our organs with the pd load. So that's my quick story. Well, it's funny because in 2020 I tore my glue. I told you guys that story and I had to list all the compounds when I went into the ER that night in horrible pain from the spazmy. And I'm like, how much ink is in your pen? Yeah. But they had the lady from the pharmacy come in and start rattling off. You think she stopped me. She said, is this a month? I'm like, no. Three times a week. That one's five times a week. That one's a year of that type of thing. And it was just funny because it was a, I mean, sometimes we lose track really of what we're doing until we have our in a situation like that where we have to, for whatever reason, rattle it off. So I did have blood work done. Sky. Oh, you did. I didn't look at the numbers. I told you, I didn't want to hear about it because I was five weeks before show. So I said, I don't want to be lectured. I don't want to know what the numbers are. I'll deal with that the day after the show. Anyway, so you see, you see, my his list for us. He says number one test then masked then eight X then clan then wind stroke. I mean, I think you could get pretty peeled with that combo. Obviously it's all about the time. Well, I mean, he did. There's that. Yeah. I mean, that condition. Let's be fair. Yeah, I mean, that's the day we had a couple of things to use using SLU. Like, but could we have done that with just these things. We could get pretty damn close to. Well, it's for 10, you know, you're 20 years old. You just got graduated college or something. You have tons of debt. You don't have a career yet. You don't have the money coming in. So by necessity, you're limited to five compounds. Does that make sense? Because I think we've all been in that boat at some point with our body building careers. It's like, well, rent money or I could buy some GH better buy. I better pay the rent. You know, yeah. Yeah. But I was like, do I feed the kids this week? Yeah. Good food or can they eat ramen noodles for two weeks? I'm kidding. Both of them. That's good. That's good. Can't talk. Yeah. Can we have a little guy kids? All right. I'll go first. Mine's not too much different. Too different from UCSum. But five compounds only. And we're including AI's, Insillaries, all that other stuff. Five. PD's. All right. Just us our own master on trend, Winstraw, GH for me. And yes, I left that on AI because I would just plan on pulling my testosterone at some point to create the dry lowestrogen look. Okay. All right. Well, I won't say E. Kind of nice. We don't have the same list. Good. That's good. But this is assuming that we're running the entire prep versus, you know, always start with this compound. We change to a never compound because then that would be six. So yeah, you can't swap out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was just happy on say I'm not talking about running trend and wind straw from 20 weeks out or 16 weeks out. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm starting to see. All right. I am test. It's got to be that test based master on. That's a master on come on. I don't think I'm going to run testosterone out master is and if we're going to be in here, Andrew. You want to put that on it. I'm going with DHB over trend so I can have it in there the whole time. All right. And because I do love DHB, however, I do love trend more, but I'd rather have it in there the whole. And then of course, wind straw and animal. Now, it was tough to leave DHB. Arguably GH over Antibard. Yeah. I made do that. But you know what, wind straw and about I will leave out things like clan. I can I can die without clan and the red is I feel the same way about the AI. Plus if you look at these compounds, what is aromatizing? Yeah. Not a high aromatizer anyway. So to taper that out towards the end, no problem. Those are my five. I'd rather run seven, but whatever. Okay. I'm going to go with and I haven't thought about this ahead of time. I've just been listening to you guys. Test, mass, wind straws going to be in there. We can run the test and mass e for an extended time test first. I'm going to put clan in there. I find clan to be really beneficial. And then do I want to add in trend or do I want to add in T3? I do like a low dose of T3. In fact, I found T3 to be for me. And I'm talking just like 25 maybe pushing it up as you get later into the prep. T3 for me. Like my body had just freaking responded to it very well. Like it always done really good with it. And I'm talking even like 25 micrograms. So that's a tough one, man. I feel like cosmetically I'm going to look like a lot of people. I'm going to look harder with trend, right? But T3, I do think that I can get leaner. Kind of keep that metabolism humming. You guys, when T3 wasn't in the playance for either, you guys, right? No, but your discussion brings up something for me. I have done one prep that I can think of in the last 20 years without T3. And it was the last one. And I won't go to you. Okay, so that's on your list then. It's in a century. It's in a century. Well, I'll do more than five compounds. So there is that. Yeah, I mean there is that. If I had to choose, I might leave out the T3. I would still stay with my list. But I don't want to do a prep again without T3. Here's my thought. I think I'm with you. I like trend in the prep. I like the strength that you get from it, right? I think that there is definitely something to just the magic of it in that last say six weeks. I might only use it for that last six weeks, maybe eight weeks. And there's something really good about the scale, staying the same, but you're looking harder and getting leaner each day. But at the end of the day, you can you can kick some serious, but with good conditioning. And if you don't need a lot of gear to do that, if you already have in a hardener like master on and then you put windstrile on top of that, like realistically, you should be able to get as nasty, grainy hard as humanly possible without any, without any trend in there. So I'm thinking this through. I guess I'd go with T3. I probably go with T3 over trend. Cool. And I don't get the nasty sides that a lot of people get from here. I sleep like a baby, even with higher dose trend. I don't think I'll go as high in the future as I did this last prep. I experimented if you well with those edges that I hadn't used before. And I really didn't see that benefit. I saw the benefit of the trend, but I didn't see it as the dosing was going up, higher and higher. The ROI really wasn't there. Uh-huh. There's no denying. It's a great compound. I'm a DHB fan now too. You know, I really am after seeing what you see suma did with it. I had used it twice in the past once in an offseason. The crap that I did use it in at that time was like my best prep to date. And it took me a couple more years before I could like, it was the look that was a look that I haunted me for a couple of years. You know what I mean? Conditioning was. But my big problem with it was the pain from some of the shots. I'm still finding it painful now, but I'm using very little so I can tolerate it. It just seems hit or miss man. That's my only downfall with it is that potentially painful shots. Do you get that? Yeah, but if you load enough gear in the arrow with everything else, it kind of goes away. You know what mild information? I'm a don't shot an a guy and it helps because I have narrow shoulders anyways. It helps with the volume there a little bit. It's not intolerable for me. Yeah. And remember I'm doing bilateral shots. So I don't have one doubt that's sore both of them are sore. Okay, but the other doubt would have been exactly. And I don't know if you guys do this or not, but something I typically do is my clients who want to run in the offseason. I steer them towards DHB. I think there's a lot of parallels as far as I don't know what I'm saying. But there are. And it's not. It's almost like leave the trend for the pre-contest if you're going to use it. I don't want to, I don't want, because what's going to happen is you're going to run it in the offseason. And then you're going to want to run it prep. So you're running a lot of trend. And DHB is a pretty good compound. That's why, again, I added in there instead of running the trend because I wanted to run DHB longer. And I don't like to run trend. And I only use trend-nast. And I will not use the other forms of trend. What about UC Sumas comment here? He says, for argument sake, could you use time to offset not having T3, meaning could you use like 3 feeds or skip loads to boost your thigh work right through out so that you can obviously then circumvent using T3? I mean, what are your guys's take on that? Is it the same? Can you mimic the same without it? I don't know if it's the same. I don't know. Both of them are better together. Yeah. We get both feet off of each other. And I'm not, I'm not a high dose T3 guy. Back in the day, we used to be that was kind of a message board thing. But 25 micrograms, then jump to maybe 40, 30, 75, whatever. 50, I kind of tap it at 50. If you got to go above 50, you're, I'll tell you what, any future clients. If I push you up over 50, I may not outwardly be saying it, but I'm a little like, okay, we need to, we need this. We need to get this going. Things are not going well. Yeah. It's to try to catch up. Right. But with small dose, and I'm a different situation in most. The older demographic, we tend to have more of, there's this, there's this thing where we can be ready from the front, but we're off from the back. And it's things like T3, even you'll him be that plays well in situations like that versus, you know, client, client, I always say, client is like melting butter in a pan when it comes to body fat. It's or liquid cardio. It works. It works really well. But for myself and my demographic where, you know, you have that, you're carrying more body fat as you age through your hips to your lower back. So you can be ready for the front. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'd be ready from the front and then be off 10, arguably 10, 12 pounds from the back. And as I've aged, that's gotten worse. And I see it in the older demographic, especially with competitors. So even if you don't have up, yeah, the lower back just does not fit with everything else. The older you get you do typically carry more body fat in those areas. And I can't explain what obviously it's hormonal to some degree because I've never had meat. I can't, it's just as hard as anything else when I was younger, but I couldn't get to the level of conditioning that I can get to now. So it's just, it's an age thing that's shifting of the hormone. All right, I hope that helps out guys. If you, if you want to ask questions in the show, just comment on YouTube comment on the latest episode. We would be happy to take your questions. And that's what we're going to do now is take everybody's questions off the latest episodes, the last ones. All right, if I'm taking 300 tests a week and I'm going to take a load of 25 milligrams of var daily. Do you recommend upping or lowering the test? I'm sorry to that person part again. So he's on just 300 tests a week and he's going to add in 25 var. If he's adding in 25 var should be changing anything, but the test. No, no, sorry. I thought you were going to go to the next episode. Yeah, no, sorry. There's more of a flex of a question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're doing good with the cycle, right? Like if you're doing great with 300 and you want to add in an oral, then you just add the oral in. It's not going to change anything like he's not going to suffer side effects. Like, oh, you got to have more test in there now, right? Or anything like that. Yeah, so more test could be better. Some people are in the school of thought of there's a milligram cap, including oral milligrams. So like if I'm adding 25 milligrams times seven days a week, what is that? That's 175 milligrams. Do I need to decrease my testosterone by a certain ratio to stay at a certain cap that I've heard that argument from people before? Which I want to agree with is what I'm saying. Oh, Gabe sent his physique critique for at the end of the show. I texted him or I emailed him before. We started. He was from Patreon and he he commented, I was like, hey, I love to get a physique critique and I said, Dude, we're recording right now. If you can get it over right now and he did. Andrew, what brand of green tea do you use? You mentioned liking green tea. Oh, dude. Tom's, I mean, from Bigelow, you know, 299 for 20 bags all the way up to, fuck, Evan sent the pony got me on this one. It's a little bitter for me. Um, comes in an expensive, what do you call it? A tin. Ah, I do the much green tea. Do you sometimes. Do you sometimes. You've tried that. Yeah, no, I've done that before. I'm not the biggest fan. I think that's like green tea with like lemon or passion flower flavored in it. So honestly, what I do is I go to the sprouts across the street and I'm like, what's on sale this month? Okay. I'm going to get a few of those. Okay. It all tastes good to me. I like lots of varieties. I do like the Starbucks green tea. The Starbucks ice cream tea is incredible. I never had it. I anytime I go there, I'm getting a cafe in Maricano. So it's like, that's my thing. I don't want to miss out on that. It's just crazy. No, man. Like, we're like, you're giving me half coffee, half water. Just still charge me five bucks. I only do it. We do it occasionally on date day. It's like a thing. We are thing out where we're like, hey, when you get a coffee today. Yeah. Really? Just do this for us. Nyspresso. Yeah. Oh, dude. Don't even get one of those. We got one of those. Yeah. The only thing that my wife wants to drink is bourbon. Well, I'm not a drinker. So I just pay water or a diet. There is going to be no nyspresso or coffee or anything else. It's not going to happen. What time does she start in a day? Usually about times it now. What day of the week? No, I'm kidding. She's not a dog. Yeah. She likes brunch on the weekend. Let's put it that way. And I'm like, it's like noon. Yeah. It's meal three. Like what do you do? One week later, I get to have a few drinks. When we stayed in Australia, we stayed at like four different Airbnb and one hotel. And three out of the four places had an espresso machine. And they just gave you all the pods. Dude, I sucked down so much coffee while we were there. I'm like, I got to take advantage. There's so good. There's so good. Yeah. All right. What about this one for optimal muscle growth? Oh, would you split your GH dose if you were taking 10 IU of taste? Sorry. I can't go into that one. I trained. I've never got my question for one day off. Lars, I'm sorry. We've talked about this before. Jen, I do 15 IU on training days and no GH on rest days. Or should I take 10 IU every day consistently. Guys. And tonight, we put on the gloves and boxes. Because you're a Ebola, all right. I only want to get to 10. All right. So you know, like, one of those, um, one of those little wheels. You know, you get those email pop ups that's like spin the wheel and you went up the eyes. Okay. Put any combination of that total amount of GH you want into different boxes. Spin the wheel and just do that because I think at the end of the day, the net result is probably going to be close to the same. Right. Yeah. That's what I'm getting at. Do that every day as an experiment and then report to us. You spin the wheel. Take your shots. Yeah. And then it could be argued to how do you mix your GH? Is it very concentrated or is it kind of diluted? Because every time you take a shot, you might lose a little bit of that. Mm. You have a door all evens out if you're using the whole bottle. Yeah. Yeah. Good point. I always show a little bit of, and this is always creeps people out. I don't get to say. But I put a little bit of air. Yeah. Just make sure you get it off. No one's apparently it takes like this much to get in what's that. Like, it's like, oh, ventures to kill you in an IV. So if it takes that much in an IV, I'm pretty sure that much in the muscle or sub cue. I'm going to cause any problems as I shifted my seat a couple minutes ago. So I don't die at the BBT. But anyway. Okay. I just, if I'm running out, there's not much water left in there. I may, and I know I've got like one shot left. I may put more water in there. Yeah. Because I hate if it's, you know, you're, there's a little bit around the rim that you get out. You're turning the bottle this way. If I just put an extra, you know, half mill in there. I'm more likely to get it all out. Oh, how strong do you guys, how strong do you do? I usually do personally one mill per ten IU. Oh, really? Okay. All right. So I've got some 36 unit bottles right now. And I just put a CC of water in there. So each, oh, yours are real. They're very concentrated. Yeah. Okay. I'm, because I'm Sarah's them. Um, what is that? It's one CC. Yeah. Yeah. I go 1.8 because I was talking to my clients and like, make math easy. Yeah. That way every 10 minutes is a let me touch on something. Okay. I don't know if you guys get this. There's not a day that goes by that I get a simple math question. And I'm not talking like complex like mixing these compounds together to equal. No, we're talking like simple physical chemistry. And beyond that, I literally have on my first post on my Instagram, a website. That does all the peptide math for you. Oh, is that right? And I made a post and I told clients and I told the same people over and over again. And sometimes I'm just like, so you didn't pay attention to chemistry or physical physics at all, because it's literally, or math class or simple math. Yeah. It's kind of mind blowing to me because it's like, you could ask chat GPT. Like why you send in these questions to me ask chat. I would rather they double track with me. And I would, you know, I feel like, you know, you're working with me. I'm going to make sure I don't want you to mess things up. So I will entertain that and I'll go through it for them and I'll even show them. And then once I commit, man, I'm even getting out in insulin syringe and I'm saying when you drop, you're going to do this. You're going to take 10 units. 10 units looks like this. It's insulin. It's insulin. Yes. I get a little bit of everything. I do with everything. But you know what? I did have one client who this was not my fault at all. Man, but I still felt terrible about it. She's just jet pop, all right. And this is a couple years ago, some of gluteide. She bought some some gluteide instead of waiting and talking to me about it. We had discussed how much she was going to take. But we hadn't talked about mixing it or anything. She knew that she was going to take a half a milligrams. I think it was. This has been a few years. So she put in a milleter of water. And then since she wanted to take a half a milligrams, she took a half a milleter. Yeah. She took 2.5 milligrams and was so sick. Unable to eat. She didn't even tell me for like three days. And she waited till her check in. And she's like, I haven't been able to eat. I was throwing up. I'm thinking to myself, like, you might need to go to the hospital. Probably not at 2.5. But I keep pancreatitis. All the symptoms are pointing to yes, you know. And she thankfully she did. She was okay. But, ah, man, I felt terrible about that. Even though she did it all on her own, you know. You. All right. What about this one? Do you think that SLU and the off season would aid in growth, allowing you to eat more food and stay leaner or do you think that it's just burning more calories so that you eat more and not really gaining anything? I see SLU primarily first as a health supplement before bodybuilding supplement. You know what I'm saying? But, you know, I think anything we can do to improve my to control health, do to let's say me 42 odd years of eating even clean organic foods, which we know the organic farms right next to the non organic farm. And the natural organic area over, right? Just the fact that our food is packaged in plastics or my organs. Just all the things we're doing that degrade nutrients, which are going to have a net effect on our at the cellular level and eventually the mitochondria. So first and foremost, I see SLU as a mitochondrial health and a general health supplement. Okay. In terms of the question, I think with that reasoning, if you're keeping your cells healthier, yes, you're able to eat more and yes, you're going to be able to gain more muscle eventually. I think a healthier body is a better gaining body in terms of muscle mass. So, yeah, I think yeah, adding SLU in the office is definitely a good idea. Yeah, I'm going to have to go a little higher in the dosing with the SLU. Because when I added it, it didn't really do anything. And I had a myriad of other compounds in there. So I have to go back to it when I don't have a lot of other things that I'm taking. To be able to get a more accurate read, I'm going to take the dosa. Let's see. So, I don't know. Okay. In how long, and I'm with you, by the way, got nothing to add. In how long does EQ start to lower E2 if it does that for you? And I'm not sure how fast. I mean, I guess we would have to look at the rate. Well, it's individual because the rate of individual enzymes that metabolize EQ from the ester, get into the bloodstream, and then it's somewhat individual, but I would say, 10 to 12 days, probably for the majority of people. Yeah, and then I can't disagree. I'm thinking as the ester is going to play a part of it, but in with it being a longer ester, it's not going to be rapid. If not going to be like an AI would, and then it would be right away. So, no. Yeah. Like if you were to inject test noester, that's going to happen effect on ester gene within that for our period, right? Because it has noester. It's test-based basically. But looking at something like EQ, it's a longer ester compound. Yeah, I guess that's, I would stick with me answer, probably somewhere in the 10 to 12 day mark for most people. Okay, then I can't disagree with it. And then probably a stronger effect, you know, five weeks in, you know, depending on what your dose is, it's going to continue to build, right? So, absolutely. So, let me ask you guys this, let's say that you're running a cycle, you've got a client running a cycle with test any EQ, and you have it dosed in such a way that you're not going to use any AI. If you were to go in in three weeks, I feel that your ester gene levels are probably not going to be like completely stable, yeah, you know what I'm saying? Because you're everything still building, how long would you wait to get a read on what your ester gene levels actually are going to be in that cycle? That's a good question too. Yeah. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking six, seven weeks. That might not be, might want to play it, save and go eight. That's a tough one. Yeah, because, well, how it would be extremely rare for someone to start to play in of ester gene related side effects three weeks into the cycle? Right. It's usually like you said, skip six, seven weeks. Hey, I'm feeling a little different, whatever that may be, you know? So yeah, I would say six, seven weeks is probably a good time frame. Yeah, I go with that. I've gone like five, because I feel like we're going to be able to get pretty good info. You know what I mean? And if your ester gene is completely tanked at five weeks, it's probably still going to be tanked at seven or eight. But yeah, I think you're probably right to get an actual like accurate, you know, reading you're probably going to want to go a little bit longer than that. But why not? Oh, yeah. So we were trying to put together like, I remember somebody asked just like, what's your dream cycle? None of us said, Inchrelex as part of it. Yeah. We got a mastop, I think, guys. Yeah. And it took an anchor like, yeah. Is it was free, free anchor Lex Andrew? It's a free anchor Lex. Yeah. Me and Matt Porter were going to buy like 20k of it years ago. God. Um, one of us backed out of Cameron boy. Um. I don't know. Here's the thing. I don't know how much anchor Lex would have positively changed my physique in terms of, was it going to make me a 290 pound, you know, big ramen? No, I don't think so. I think I always had a very realistic view of what these, but to expect from these compounds and what the most they could do for me in terms of also weighing the risk on long-term health. So I don't, I don't know if I'm still, I probably would still leave it out, you know. If it was free. I mean, I probably try it for two. I'm saying, I'm thinking, come on Andrew. Yeah. I know I'm 55 and I dig it. Yeah. I'm trying to put myself back into 26 through 32 year old Andrew who was just all in economics. I can't see you know, which yeah, I mean, definitely would have probably three anchor likes. Yeah. I mean, think about it at 2632. I still had kids relying on me like if I died, something would happen. That'd be terrible. Now they're all gone. Now wife on this, maybe it only briefly. She'll be on a beach and borrow borrow with my wife insurance cash now. So be like, yeah, it's too bad he's gone, but I'm doing okay for myself. I recently, just in the last week, I was talking to a pro. I don't want to mention his name, but you guys, everybody in the audience would know who he is. And he had used anchor likes like he did the he dove in. You know what I'm saying? Like he was like, I'm going to make the investment. I'm going to run this for real. And I had been a while ago. It was like a couple years back that he had done that. And so I reached out to him and he just came to mind. And I was like, hey, now in hindsight, what was your take on when you had run anchor likes? And he said, honestly, man, I don't know. He was like, I got incredible pumps. Like in incredible pumps. And I said, well, I could relate to that that I got good pumps from IGF. One LR3. And he was like, oh, no, like it's in a different world than IGF LR3. This far as that goes. He said, but I don't know how much of it really contributed to new muscle gain. So I would compare that probably to taking a bottle of Serus Demoday. Like when I tell you the pumps, I mean fresh out of bed. You go to brush your teeth and you're like, holy crap. People get your arm and you you're just going like this and don't make any jokes about that. Just going like, well, I would like what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're like holy crap. My whole delts and bi-center. They look like I just do a full chest arm workout. You know what I mean? Like it's just for brushing your teeth. You're watching the dishes. You're like, holy crap. This hurts it. I'm so pumped right now. Or yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing. Nothing short of amazing. I don't think I can run growth anymore, by the way. I've had these weird responses. I don't want to get into it like, you know, big topic, but I tried running it again. I've had a couple of kits that I've had. And you have any room? Yeah, that's probably bad. Send us. You can. I just touched the land rest in case you don't know. Yeah. Well, I might come down to that. So I'm on top of the world feeling. You know, like everything's going good. And then I get it in my head. Like, I think I'm going to, why don't I just add in that growth? I'm already taken my SS 31 every morning. And I get a few days in and I freaking crash. Go through my whole thing, you know, and Victorian, I kind of pinpointed. I think this is the third time that I've done that. I think it's something blood sugar related. I'm not sure I haven't been checking my blood sugar. So I can't say that as a fact. But there's something just something going on, man. I don't think I can take growth anymore. So there's that. Well, I just feel bad for your G.A.s. So it's generic skip. You don't want it. Oh, good boy. Yeah, that's definitely below me. My bad. Yeah. All right. Another great episode Scott. Oh, are you? Here's what he said. Are you running any test? And I can't say this word on YouTube. I'll say it like this. Another great episode Scott. Are you running any test with your G.A. G.H. Second letter of the alphabet. And if so, what's the ratio? Are you running? Hey. I see. Wait. Hey. Hey. That's my brain is so freaking slow. I'll tell you this. Yeah. You could get me that. I would use it. No. Would you use it on the show? No. I wouldn't use it. Hardly. I'm telling you, man. I wish I could go back because I'm old enough to be able to buy it at GNC. Yeah. I remember there. I was like, don't we have to have a table? I don't know how I missed this. I just don't know how I missed it. And I say that it be from a sleep standpoint. You know, recovery sample, things like that. You know, maybe it wouldn't have been as beneficial then when I was younger. But man, in my older age, that that's sleep and everything else. And then what would have happened is it would have been this spiral because my wife would have somehow found out how good did she be like, oh, screw the bourbon. I'm just thinking it's true. I'm just thinking it's true. Yeah. That's true. What a little bit. Yeah. Like I thought I had more of this than I did. So if I reached out, said he had someone who's refrigerator, you had a jug of it. Yeah. By living in Colorado and he didn't. I don't want to see where, where he lived. Don't want to give it away. Just say if you had it now, I could probably drive there. So I said, I responded and I said, I never tried the stuff and he responded saying, I think you might have missed red what I said, great. Keep up the great content. And then I'm still not putting it together and then you see Suma said, Hey, man, I think that you meant DHB brother. Oh, okay. Okay. One to one. I've been doing it like a one to one ratio. So fcaught. Yeah. Do you have a ratio with your DHB skip? No, it's not usually as high as Tesla. I mean, like as an example, if I run it, I don't usually run it over. And I don't run it at 300, 400 milligrams, but I don't think I've taken it over 400. I find it to be just a, I mean, I think that was one of the first ones of three of us. Correct me if I run, but I mean, I can't say them. And I just love this stuff. Like I don't see it because it came up. I think at least 10 toxicity. What's that? I ran in 2010. You want to be. Oh, yeah. I used to for years. It was just worth that impressed with it. I don't know. I liked it. Oh, but I didn't like the pain from the shots. Yeah. And so I just never circled back around to it. And it wasn't like super highly available back then either. There was like one guy, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, then I think it came up when we started talking about it. Based on the toxicity, everybody was in weird. I'm like, I just don't see this. And I still don't see this. Okay. And there are things that can do, you know, everybody has different variables and different things. And we take different things and, you know, we have to hear what I'm saying. Here's what I think that comes down to skip. So there were like two studies that were done on rats. And in those rats, they saw higher inflammation markers. Now I've had three clients that have all tested before they used it. And then tested six weeks in and their inflammation markers were fine. They're in their liver values were fine. Like absolutely fine. You see, so much as finish this contest prep, he had been running it for like at least three months, maybe four months, 400 milligrams. And guess what? His liver values are in range post-contest now. Yeah. No. There's that. And it's great. The levels are in range too. They're like everything is good. Nice. All right. Is that question about crashing your test? There was a couple of other things in here. As someone who's always suffered from poor sleep, I've looked into, I'm looking for some improvements. I had to blow this up. Sorry, you're second here. There we go. What are your thoughts on high dose melatonin? I know Dante recommended a high dose in the past. And I recently heard Cuba uses the same approach, thoughts and ideas as always, thank you all for the free info that you provide. You are invaluable to the bodybuilding community. Thank you, Mark. Appreciate the kind of words, man. I don't have sleep problems. I am this one's kind of not in my wheelhouse. I've had your ready to take the GH second letter. The alphabet right now. Good point. Yeah, that's very good. Maybe I'm just upset that I missed that. That. That arrow. Yeah, that arrow, that that break, that whatever the hell it is. Thanks. That's what I'm looking for. Yeah. I don't have sleep. I mean, like I said, I sleep well and try not. My wife gets mad. My latency is like three to five minutes if that. She's like you will be snoring within five minutes. So it's probably good that we don't have the same sleep schedule because she wouldn't be able to go to sleep. Or the show she's in point at the hotel. She moved over to the other bed and I'd wake up. She'd have pillows all over and I feel bad. But I'm like, what do I do? And is that really helping one bed away? Like is it not loud over there? But my next to me and the same that is the same. But don't you get some, like, some earplugs. You know, she normally does and she forgot them. That's why she said she doesn't. Can I not, you know, she does not call me skip. So he's skip. Yeah, it's skip. It's gone. You know, don't feel bad. It just, that's how that's how, you know, I'm like, why did I have? Why was I snoring because I don't snore when I'm lean? So we couldn't figure that out either. But I was snoring that last week probably. Oh, that's another, you know. How high is the highest you've taken your melatonin, Andrew? 80 milligrams. Yeah. And did you build that? Over time. No, that was talking Dante. And then I think I did it for like a month. I didn't see any difference honestly. So like currently now I just do 10 orally. And then I think I get another five or 10 injectable from this blood of stuff that I use with like aubo. And what? Okay. My thing is, I think I sleep fine. It's the duration. I don't hear it. Well, not only get four and a half, five hours just when I schedule it. Wow. So it's definitely, if there's one major pitfall in my health program, I guess you can say it's definitely, you know, the lack of sleep. So now you have a different protocol for sleep. Don't you much like my daughter and my son in terms of like glyceone and stuff like that or no, I don't want to throw you into the bus to get something you wanted to forget it. Oh, no, go ahead. Why? I just, I thought you, herb was it in herb? Yeah. Yeah. I'm also, yeah. No, no. So I mean, that's to help me relax. I use a little bit of THC. Yeah, for sure. Okay. I didn't know if you, I was like, maybe I should, I don't give a shit. No, it's 2025. You know what I mean? My daughter goes out on the balcony every night. My wife used to bitch at her. She's like, I run this place. You can't be seen out on the balcony. I can see your wife because it is technically still illegal. Yeah. It's just barely missing. Hey, so I'm passing. Honestly, I think it's might be a good thing that it didn't get passed legally because if you look at the research for communities that do pass it, like there's a major downfall, increase in crime, increase in things are just so lacks like that. Yeah. Well, look at any of the places that have legalized, like drug use, like Portland and stuff like, you just some of it's different though. Do you know what I mean? Like, like say like the real heavy stuff in Portland versus, like we have, we have, we have a big conversation here. Is Colorado bad now? If you, if you were to do like an internal, like real pulling of the residents that are taxpayers, they wish they wouldn't have done it from what I understand. I'd have to look into it for Michigan. I haven't, I haven't seen or heard anything here, but it is recreational here too, but I guess it doesn't answer his question. You get a podcast with Dr. Dean St, or I did a podcast with Dr. Dean St. Martin, probably four years ago now called Hacking Sleep with Dr. Dean St. Martin. And we pulled up a basically like a thing that he had made and showed like a slide showing all the pathways of how your body ends up with melatonin. And his whole goal is instead of just giving you melatonin, helping you to improve your own natural production and sustain it through the night. So we talked about the different types of insomnia, having a hard time falling asleep versus having a hard time staying asleep and why those two things happen. And I found that like just learning that and I watched it like three times after we recorded even, it's helped me a lot to understand the process and understand the benefits of everything we talk about with Sleep hygiene. And the light going into your eyes. It's not just a fed that stuff really is important in giving yourself the time to relax and basically get rid of the dopamine to give way to the serotonin. But I'm still not gonna say don't use melatonin. I found the same thing, man. I found that like 30, I think I got the 30. And it was too much for me. And then get this, I became dependent on it. I ran 30 for like a couple months. And then I was like I'm just not gonna take it and then I couldn't sleep. I had to take like, I had to step it back down and get takes 20 and then 15, you know. So that was an issue. But Dr. Dina has a lot of good supplements that he recommends in there. He does make a sleep stack that contains them all, but you could put them all together yourself. I've taken some of myself, you know, I've like pulled some of his ideas using things like P5P, and L. Theanine. I think that there could be a lot of beneficial stuff to that certain forms of magnesium are freaking killer, right? For sleep. Do you guys ever mess with magnesium for sleep, Andrew? Every night. That's the idea. You could even not have the sleep issues. What kind do you use? Oh, by the wise, but basically, yeah, there you go. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. I got a whole program, our whole product that has, it's actually a no name brand off Amazon, because, you know, I compare and greeting for greeting. As long as it's a third party test of company, it was like half the cost of some of these bigger name companies, but a, you know, CNN, originally a Rosoya, or I came and ready to say that. 5HTP, the Larian route, now a tone in, it's got a few other things to do. And then I do glycine, one thing I think, if you could, to really improve your sleep, take like three to five grams of glycine powder. It's, it's really cheap. Yeah. Like, it's, I was actually amazed at how much I helped my sleep. Hmm. I was like, how long did I go on the phone? That's, I was like, magnesium. I used elemental magnesium. I noticed that that one's really good. Yeah. I used to drink a monster zero for five hours for my good and I can sleep. I mean, it's just, it's just crazy. I don't understand. I mean, actually, real quick, I know it's not entirely based on this question, but we're talking about sleep. Does smoking in much like drinking wood? Does smoking negatively impact, you know, REM cycles or deep sleep or anything like that? I personally have seen no change. I can't speak. I know I did some research at some point, but I also don't like abuse it. I don't like, I literally go outside and take like, you know, two or three puffs out of a pipe. That's what my dog got at night. You know what I'm saying? It's more just like a wine debt. Like I put the computer away. Sure. Wounded down. Same way, someone around a cocktail at night or glass of wine to to to wind down. It's really, you know, 10 pm. I think a few puffs. Eat my last meal. We get bed. Go to sleep. I don't care how late I'm getting bed in the morning. I cannot get off the computer and go straight to bed. I do need about 20 minutes just to get whether it's a Netflix 20 minutes, something on my phone. I need to not regulate. I encourage reading for that. Like, and I know people are not going to read for telling you. Like reading if you're a ton, if you're already a little tired and you know you should be going to bed, like reading you'll fall asleep without book right in here. Right in the left. But I've gone back to reading. Actually, it's weird. Years. The kids will say when we get together. I remember getting out of his when they were little. You know, have his little stand by the toilet and he'd have two or three books on it. That's all you have to say. I'm like, yeah, prior to social media. And then I had to pay attention when I woke up to, you know, everything that was going on and catch up for the day. But I went back to blunt force Tonya says she has, oh, I have about 70 puffs. I thought that. That's three hours of downregulating. Yeah. I mean, the other thing to tie this all together for optimal sleep is I think you want to try to recreate what's going on outside. So I encourage people to not use overhead lighting and to use more lamp lighting because it's more dim, right, to help with, because your brain senses, with your circadian rhythm, what's going on with the outside. And you want to try to replicate. It's why you wake up in the morning. The sun comes out. It's why you want to go to sleep at night when it's dark. You're about your room temperature. You're better in temperature to like 63 degrees. The body likes right around 62 to 63 to fall asleep. Make sure your room is in order. Like, don't have it being disarray because subconsciously, your brain just like, you ever seen a dog when a dog is getting in bed. It's moving around and it's moving the cover. It's exactly how it wants it. Part of it is, I guess it's subconscious looking for snakes or looking for reptiles or things that it wants to that could, could possibly get. Now I won't sleep well tonight. Thanks. Well, it's a phobia of snakes. So there's that. It's a built-in. I got a great video for you from my apartment. No, no. But, uh, I'll definitely send it. No, but, uh, but subconsciously, your body wants your sleeping arrangements to be in order so you can relax and check one thing. Another thing off the list. All right. With you 100% on that, um, what is the lowest effective dose of our now famous cycle, test EQ in, uh, NPP? Um, what was the lowest effective? Let's say you have somebody who, uh, what is the most effective dose? Exactly. All of it. Um, let's see. We had somebody who was like, uh, intermediate. They're at a point where they're, and they can use enough gear to run three compounds, but they haven't really taken their test over 600. And I made that up because I have no clue what a suggestion is. I don't throw a number out, but I don't like it. Okay. 400 300 300. I don't like it. I want to buy three three, but then we go over the thousand, you know, milestone, are, you know, are we saying that like when you walk into the gym after a month, maybe haven't seen a body in a while, he's like, well, bro, like you blow up. You blew up recently. Like that kind of recognition like you're on a cycle right now. Like that's the lowest. That's the time. We don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But he walked in the gym. It's been a while. Yeah. You know, um, yeah. I wouldn't disagree with you, uh, skip out. You know, I'd go with that. 400 300. Yeah. I think. Yeah. If I were to go with any lower, I do like maybe 400 test 300 EQ and 200 and PP, and like for something low, low. So yeah, I was going to go lower. I just leave out a combo. Yeah. You know what I mean? I probably would go, you know, I'm looking at like, what 400 300, you know, I just wouldn't, I wouldn't take this 500 400 and come down to like 150 or, you know, yeah, there comes a point where, yeah. At the end of the day, doesn't matter who I'm, yeah, probably. You know what, if I only would have taken three compounds with the same milligrams, those who just, uh, you know, it, you know, it. Um, hey, Scott, put question for the next episode starting a 16 week cycle 600 test 450 EQ, 225, DACA trying to stay around Andrews 1 to 8 to 4 ratio suggestion from a few episodes back. Andrew, I bet you don't even remember that suggestion. Been small to do what we need. I mean, because we're not really like big ratio people, but I feel like people are looking at ratios and they're like, oh, that's the ratio Andrew always goes by, you know. Look, can I say something real quick? Like, if I'm playing in a client cycle and helping them out with that, there's no, I don't start with a ratio of hard numbers of anything. Right. It's like what you experience, you know, what do you feel comfortable with? And then the biggest question I ask is what are the side effects you've had from XWRZ. And then let's maybe think about eliminating the compound that I think causes that. And then let's start with that. And then, okay, so let's just say someone's use and their cycles 1200 milligrams for their offseason cycles, you know, maybe 700 tests and 500 of something else, right? Okay, we might probably start with that. But again, it's also focusing on, well, I'm going to assume that you probably haven't been paying attention to nutrition, the training, the supplements, the sleep, all the other things that are going to make you grow better. So I want to get more out of that. And then we'll probably going to discuss the drugs. But there's no ratios at all. Like, very rarely is there ratio of them. If you hear our say ratios in the show, it's just like, oh, skip said 500, 500. I'm like, yeah, one to one ratio. Oh, no one. This sounds okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like we have this preconceived sheet of, okay, they're going to look at this and that. Okay, we need to do exactly this in that. So I think more and more people are telling people, more and more people on content, content creators are like throwing out ratios. Like, yeah. And I get it. Like, it sounds sexy, man. Like, and it does just kind of button everything up. You know what I mean? Yeah. Also, let's do, like, if you have a coach that just gives you ratios, like, right out of the bat, I'd be probably second guessing. Same thing if like, if a coach just gives you a pre-made 20-week cycle without the caveat of like, I'm putting these numbers on here because it's kind of a ballpark of what I'm trying to get. Right. Really to let you know what compounds to have ready for this many weeks out so that you prepared and we're not, hey, let's throw this in. Oh, shoot, I got to get my guide ascended to me. It's going to take two weeks and now we're two weeks behind. It's really just, it's a template, not a prescription. Right. Yeah. Lightweight baby says, hey, Scott, I purchased some true nutrition. Hydralized beef collagen on your recommendation. How much do you recommend taking per day? Even the nutritional facts, one serving is like 30 something grams of protein much higher than other collagen products. So just from talking to a guy who did all of his PhD research on collagen, he said that 20 grams is pretty much been the best number that they had found in that they've seen in research. And that's kind of what I've seen too. Okay, had suggested a full 30 grams, which is the whole scoop. But he also suggested that to me when I had torn my shoulder. So I've kind of leaned into the 20 to more or less save money. And then with an injury, I would push it up to 30. Now, I wouldn't say that this is something where you're going to notice a difference either way. Like you're not going to notice anything. It's not something where it will change the way you feel or that you'll notice like, oh my shoulder doesn't hurt anymore. It's just the materials that your body can use to create new, connective tissue. Because with this of the collagen experts that you talked about, would he have said anything maybe, like with a dosing be different for say 110 pound female versus say a 270 pound or 260 pound male body builder. That's a great point. No, we didn't get into all that. I mean, I could imagine that if you were bigger, you might be able to better. If you had more connective tissue, yeah, as I'm getting out, you have more connective tissue, more muscle tissue that's pulling on that connective tissue, using higher poundages, would it be more beneficial to supplement a little bit more or even less if you're, are you just wasting some if you're 115 pound female? Yeah. And then we had, it could be like a whole podcast. But can you guys do a video talking about your health supplements that you all take? That would be the podcast. It wouldn't be. Is there anything that jumps out to you right now that you're excited about health supplement wise? No, they're not very exciting. Right. Yeah. It's an expense that you're like, well, I'm only doing this so I stay healthier, not, it's not a listening and irgogenic benefit. So no. Yeah. Yeah. You're doing up so long, that though. Yeah. And then we had a question and I want to get your opinions to on this. Scott, what are your top three guns? Ha ha. That you own or that you. I think just top three is my guess. Yeah. I don't know. Andrew, what do you think of the staccato? Fucking love it, man. Yeah. It's hard not to, right? It's the point where I like, I want to give away all my other handguns, except for like maybe one of my canics. So listen, I got my staccato, right? And at the time, you didn't know about staccato's yet. You were buying Strecrifiers and you're like, dude, I got another $400 Strecrifier. Yeah. And why did you do that? Just get us, just stop. Don't get us staccato. You know, no, you're having that right. You're this. Because it's an investment. It's just, you know, it's, you know, I think I didn't see myself as, I guess, an enthusiast or maybe I didn't feel like I trained enough to need a firearm or, you know, like, yeah, I get that. You know what I'm saying? Like I wasn't as invested as a, as a, as a, as a user, you know, yeah, yeah, get that for sure. And I feel like, yeah, I, there's never a day that goes by wherever I regret it. It was a more expensive, I don't buy a lot of expensive stuff and it was expensive. So yeah, it was like, you know what, but there's never a day where I regret it. And there's been shit in my life where I'm like, fuck, I didn't really need that. You know what I mean? I get a lot of pleasure out of it. So it was worth it to me. So I'm going to say, staccato number one, I am going to say my guy's least super duty number two and then I'm going to say number three, anything B&T pistol, color, brocciar, carbine, although we can't put super, super safety's in them yet. They haven't been advanced enough to be able to do that. Because yeah, so those are those are my three. What do you got for our Sandra? Definitely going to go with the staccato. I'm also going to go with my Wilson combat, AR pistol. I love that going. I'll go third with, I really do like my mechanic, Mette, as a I feel like for a striker fire pistol, it's the trigger is so similar to like my staccato that I think that's why I love it. So I hear they're really good. I have never shot a canic, but I've only heard like awesome things about them. And the price is incredible, right? Put it this way. If you're in the market for like, I would say like a low to mid level sig or a glock or some of those other like brands that are in that tier price wise, give a canic a shot. I think you'll be surprised at it's functionality. You know, skip what you got for us. I know you got it. Well, I don't want to say because you guys are like on the advanced levels, you're going to be like, okay. He carries that. I mean, you know, I have a, I had a, have a, how can I already pay, which I really like and can't carry it because it's like a bazooka. I carry a Kimber 380, Crimson Trace. It's small. I know you laugh because it's a 380, but you know, how the points are still, they'll still take your soul. I like it's a 380. I can say that without YouTube. You can't. You can't. Yes. You sure can. It also this, this, this yanks my man card right here. If it's into my Gucci bag, just find it. Let me tell you something. You see, you see a, do with a Gucci bag, you don't think he's barren. You will not think that's yeah. That's a good point. So I'm the guy in the room. I'm a guy with the bag. He, he cleared the room. I got a point. He eliminated the threat. All right. We appreciate everybody tuning in. Thank you guys for being here. And of course, leave us questions for the next episode. Comment. Tell us what you think in, hey, at just personally, if you are a second amendment enthusiast, too, then I want to know what your top three is. And of course, check out treenutrition.com. Use our code, thanks supplement source.ca for Canadians. Thank you to everybody from. Oh, I asked you to send me a physique critique and I almost bailed on him. Didn't I? I was going to say that, but I'm like, oh, he's already starting his. I was a rock man. I figured this was your time. You're like, I will do it next time. I want to cut you completely drop the ball on that. All right, we'll make this real quick game. We're going to get you up here. Let's see here. Share and screen window. Here he is. All right. So we just competed in Australia. You competed in Australia? I think he said Australia. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. No, no, no, no, no. This is somebody else, isn't it? Yeah. I was talking to somebody else from Australia. That's the work with this. I have another guy. That's right. Who's from Australia? Yeah. No, he's American. All right. Yeah, he looked great here, man. I think the question for him was, was he going to go class or stand body building? Yeah, if I remember, yeah. Be careful. Be careful. He's swipe right. Look at that, dude. Yeah. Yeah, his conditioning is always ridiculous. I think he's been in this kind of like, because I've seen pictures of him in like 10 weeks out and glutes lower back or all fully straighted. Like like like almost contest condition. Like that is peeled. Absolutely. Lights out peeled. Yeah. Oh, that's a great shot, too. His back shots are freaking incredible, huh? Yeah. Now his details on another level. Looks like he did juniors. I can try to blow these up as we're going a little bit. He's. Ah, there we go. Condition is second and none. I think he's definitely been the most condition guy in every show that I've seen him in. For him, I think it's really, you got to fill out. You just got to fill out the tissue. You got to grow. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what probably his feedback's always been. You know, like, where all over? Yeah. Yeah. You know what's for this strikes me? Yeah. Now looking in when he's in a pose, the arms don't strike me as a weakness, but immediately on that, whether it be the back shot or there was another one, I thought what his arms are down by a side, they looked in. But in pose, they look great. The shape. Yeah. Conditioning obviously is great, but the shape. It's just, you're right, Andrew. This is just a matter of adding balance tissue. More, this could be a really insaneer. The thing that one it is right now, just made that one. It's good. Yeah. My understanding is that he can't get fat like he just doesn't feel like it's very hard for him to put on size like he just can't look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Oh, he's crap. No waste. Yeah. Yeah. Make a bigger real quick. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. His frickin' waste is insane, dude. Look at the striations, the light, like just those, like just faint striations through his packs. Yeah. But if he were to flex, he's not even flexing him hard. If he were, they would all strike hard. But like you're still seeing lines in him when they're just like kind of flexed. I'm surprised with his shoulder width and his back is so good that he can have his elbows that low. You know what I mean? It's almost like, like if he, I don't know, I'm just saying, I want to bring some more. Yeah. I just wonder what that would look like now. It may not look better, but that's what's going through my brain because I'm just saying, how do you get your elbows that low? He looks like he's missing some bones down in his torso. I don't know which one. Yeah. Grab some thin butt. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think testing is only about four. Yeah. He's missing an organ. He's got to be. Go back to some of those full body shots again. Look at the, the hotel room. Yeah. Maybe. Go back to the one with ink. There's four pictures in there. All right. Yeah. Let's go on one of those. Go that up a bit. So the knees being so far out wide in the front shots. Yeah. There we go. That's a little distracting to me. It basically kind of plays on taking away from his shape in a sense. And it tells me you just got to build bigger set of legs. You got to have more more quads. We, more out of actors. That's one thing, and I'm just, I've been a stick around it. All my clients are probably sick of me. Like, stop pushing your knees out so much. It's exposing that you need to put on more muscle. Same thing with like figure athletes too. Like when they're kind of squatting, a little bit, it's like now stay big. Stay tall. And he's not tall, right? I don't think he's the shortest guy in the world either, though. Okay. If I remember Crickle, I think he might be a lay heavy. Maybe he's full. Is there any info on an email? Okay. Yeah, I mean, I think he's, to turn pro. I think he's got to be a top end heavyweight. I think if summing this is like him making the lay heavies, he's got to be, he's got to put on like 15 to 20. Use the other thing. I think if I'm not mistaken, he's also a doctor. He just graduated medical school recently. So he's obviously been spending a lot of mental energy on that. And maybe body buildings will become a little easier for him. You know, now that he probably has a career path and isn't studying as much. So you're right as on test grips, too. I don't know. That's where we go every time. That guy on the little antivar now. Yeah, yeah. Good. Yeah. Yeah, he looks fantastic, though. He looks fantastic. I got to graduate with a DNP in May. And I couldn't resist. Like, can you write prescription? Can you? Yeah. She's like, you would go there, would you? Oh, yeah. Like, I didn't put you through school for nothing. Exactly. Now, they all, you think you got through his goal. Yeah. I got one more that I wanted to show you guys. And this is just a follow up from a physique critique. So he said, he's got, I sent you pics about six weeks out from the show. I just competed this week in in Perth, Australia. I came third overall, classic, open, second, heavyweight open body builder. 24 years old, he weighs 216 pounds. He's five, 11 and a half. Potentially, could have gotten second and body building, but my nerves and sweating on stage got the best of me and ruined my look in that round, unfortunately. Here are some stage picks and some comparisons to the last show. The final two photos were my last show in 2023 at 90 kilograms versus 98.2 kilograms. Now, thanks, Scott, keep up their amazing work with the boys on the podcast. Let's see. All right, he says, next show is pro card opportunity in two weeks. And that is actually happening. That might have already happened. It was just last weekend. It was just past week. Yeah. I was going to say he sent me this on the 13th of September. Australia has two seasons. They've season A and Cs and B where they have their local shows, a couple weeks before the regional shows. And then they have their pro qualifier. So it's kind of like all their shows, season shows are in a three to five week period. And then they shut down for five months. And then they do it again for season B. And this was okay. I remember this guy now. Here he is. Let's see. Yeah, he looks good. And let's go. Yeah. See if I can blow this up a little bit more. There we go. Got some good abs in that shot. Yeah, great. That ball. Nice twisting shot. I want to see the legs a little bit harder. Okay. You got third overall, said. I think so. Yeah. Yep. Could he twist that the leg, not the leg is standing on, but the other one. Could he twist that leg out just a little bit? Show a little bit more of a certain worry is and development. Yeah. And my add a little more sweep too. That's what I'm wondering. You know? Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm going to bring that with you. How old is he? I could see maybe a little dryer from the back of our trying to critique him. You know, if it like upper body specifically, lower body is looking a little bit harder than the upper maybe. Is it a water thing? I wonder, you know? What's funny, the lower body looks harder from the back and the upper body looks harder from the front. Hmm. Yeah, that's. That's a, he looks very, yeah. That's a nice shot on him right there. It's very subtle shot too, you know? But I feel like if anybody in the world weren't into lifting weights and they wanted to get into it, anybody could say like, I want to look like this. What a pervert. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Great shape to the packs too, you know? Hmm. Yeah. I mean, let's see. Okay. All right. Let's see, get some comparisons going here. So I'd have a second out of this line up. Man, I was thinking the same, but, you know, it's a picture. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would too. Now that you mentioned it. So this guy apparently, it looks like they gave him second is what we're guessing. Lane. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. This is just a big dude. Look at the arms on this guy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. To me that that guy was clear winner is you getting a little bit away from the classic and looking a little bit. Yeah. You think? Sure. But he made the Hayden way chart and he pulled a vacuum. He plays a vacuum. Yeah. But I mean, yeah, I still say I would have, I can't remember what his name is, but I'd have him in second place here. Do we have a backshot? Let's see. Keep rolling here. See what else we got. Oh, look at that side shot on him. Yeah. I think I'd still have. Well, you know, getting second in this shot. I do like the big guy though. You know. Yeah. The big guy up top looks good. I like, oh, I would say I like his lower body better than the big guys here. Got better than that. Oh, I agree. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Oh, that big dude's back is freaking solid. Yeah. You know what? He might have fallen victim to be next to the big guy who has a good. Yeah, you got a wonder right there. I wonder. Looking at his back compared to this guy over here, I feel like he's got him. You know, yeah, I agree with that. Maybe just a little bit of tweaking the posing and the lower body might help him out. Like that right leg looks a little too straight. Yeah. Pushing in the out just a little bit, creating a little more aesthetics. But I still, I'm not moving. I think I still have him in second place in the show. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of the glutes and hips on the guy in the center. That's just, that's just, you know. Yeah. Not as conditioned in the center, but he's got that size. Well, because he's not talking. He's not talking the same way. Yeah. You know what I mean? This aesthetically, to me, it doesn't look as pleasing. I definitely say. I, I, I, I, I'm not going to say he got rubs, but like from these pictures. Oh, he should have beat this dude. Look at that. I think he's got the best app to dial up there. No offense to this guy because I am going to say this guy has a really nice physique too. And he's got really, I don't see it as much in this shot. But I feel like this guy has really nice shape. And I'm wondering if, you know, what would be the reasoning to that? Have something to do with it, but I'm with you, man. Yeah. I wonder how close that was second and third. I'm wondering. It's probably a, like, of, you know, eight, seven or something. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I like his class. It's a short better too. So yeah. Yeah. Well, this guy does have some cool stuff going on the, how billowy that lad is on him over here. There we go. Great lower body conditioning. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Okay. I think that was a good idea. Was it? Yeah. He looks incredible though. Looks really good. Solid physique, you know, third place you're right there. Just, you know, next year, probably be your year. Just treat every day like your contest prep this year and put on a little bit. Oh, he said he put on eight kilos, right? Which is like about 20 pounds from his last show. That's, that's amazing. It's 2023. So yeah, that's amazing. You even do half of that in, in a year. And yeah. You're going to be in that winter circle. So just keep out of it. And let that be a lesson too to maybe some people who haven't competed in their thinking they want to. That's a huge amount of weight. But he didn't step on stage again in 2024. He waited a year to bring this look, you know, very well worth it. Very much so. All right. I think we already have our outro. We're done. That's it. For nothing. But it's watching because of the outro. There's that. Yeah. We'll see you soon.

That's why this I love this video for back training. It's just you know watch the back moves. See if I break their stand. Yep. That's just elbow drive to the floor. That's what everyone's talking about now elbow drive to the floor. Bring in the handle down in front of you instead of like down to you. And then we'll learn the sooner. Hey everybody. Welcome to it's just body building reacts. Today we are watching one of the greatest Golden era 90s videos. It's about of the Olympia 99 and it's the Flex Wheeler Chris Cornier segment. This is like this is I remember seeing this everyone just being like oh my god. So this is some of the best footage of these guys at their best. Just wait till the t-shirts come off. But yeah, here we are. Gold's Venice. It's Flex Chris Charles Glass and I think Rico's in there too. Okay. Doing some chins at some point or doing some rows of them. I can't remember if he shows up but anyways. Straight to chins once again it's on. So yeah, there's Chris Malone. What's on the jersey there? It's yours. That's marketing real quick. Oh he's got his own shirt on. Real deal. Who has a picture of their face on a shirt? That's weird. Oh, why not? Maybe Rico's not in this one. I was just used to recouping in other videos. Maybe Rico's not there. Oh he's definitely there. They just didn't film. There's got never no problem. Impossible. So Flex looks like he's on no food. He's like this one. That's when drives me crazy about Flex. When you just look at the joint size. Yeah. The joint size. So you can blow out of his mind. Also just had a meeting with an office supply company. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. When you got an office supply company meeting and then an arm workout. He used one of my favorites by the way. Just abs. Oh yeah. Ben and as thickness. So reach extension over the bench. He doesn't have much for weight there. 13 days out. Yeah. Yeah. This is this is how gold was when I first started going that I almost all the way. Yeah. It was just like that. It was literally the greatest thing ever. I like the pants made of plastic. That's good. Remember those? I'd pair two of those. T-bars used in the 25s for better range. This is where things get wacky because it takes a shape. You can really see how nasty the detail is on these. 13 days out. Arms just busting that shirt until they come out. Getting the wraps. Lot of volume. I know. I don't even hold any down to the bench. Yeah. That was just he's getting his money worth. You know. Show wise. So look at the shit show starts here. Yeah. This is crazy. The triceps on him. Just nuts. Yeah. His shape is just freaking just nutty. There's no words for it. You don't even. Yeah. The aerial shot at the back here is just. So when you guys are training back next, everyone listening when you're in your next workout, think about this mess. You know, you're moving your back and try to like think about using it. You know, opening it, closing it like that. Hmm. I finally mentioned that you have some doing different movements for this. Yeah. Make sure one nerve like. If it makes me be like, Chris is lower back, father and number, something like you never know, right? There's for the most part that this is the one that I remember. There were crosshairs. The veins. I always loved his vein. That goes across the lower trap. What part of my back does this work? What? What area am I back in my working? I'm trying to hit this little part right here in the corner there. Is that working? Is that working? Yes. The whole goddamn thing is working. Bring it back. Look at that. Your whole back man. Quit worrying so much. I need this and I need this. I missed my that square inch below my shoulder blade. No, you didn't. Sorry, guys. Am I wrong? A little bit of a soft subject here for a run recently, but it's fine. I don't disagree with him. I love just the, I mean, both of these guys, what I love is they're depleted as hell and look like this. So there's a point in that gold chain that permeates wearing. And it's kind of going parallel to the floor across this chest. You notice that? Yes. Just being a bridge. Yeah. A bridge. Yes. What is? And next time you do your pull down, everybody, that's why this, I love this video for back training. It's just, you know, watch the back moves. I'll break their stand. Yep. That's just elbow drive to the floor. That's what everyone's talking about now. I'll go drive to the floor, bring in the handle down in front of you instead of like down to you. And I'm just going to learn the sooner. I can feel it right now. Just watching him. I always had to like the elbows out. You know what I mean? Elbows are coming. Yeah. You know, it like all the, Yeah. And my armpits are sore at the end of that workout. I don't know why. Yeah. We get the meat underneath the arm on that when he pulls it down. Yeah. And everything's just, see that. And he's not, he's not cutting his range short. He's not worried about losing tension or anything. He's reaching for the roof. Yeah. No full stretch, full activate everything. You know, that's the one that I don't, I don't do that when it does now. Is that like, the stretch has, they've decided it's no longer necessary. I'm like, I just reach as high as I possibly can. Yeah. It's tight. Yeah. I like to feel it ripping. You know. I think what's wild is, is in this particular video, you can see how bonkers flexes. Yeah. Chris, come here. It's like, what if the greatest ever. Yeah. And flexes like, yeah, just to warfing him in this. And again, obviously, it's 13 days out. They're probably in different points of their, of their crap and what they're supposed to look like. But, you know, there was just a gap at least in this moment for sure. And it's like, you know, it's a great thing. They all train together, too, because like, what a great way to make sure you're best out of each other. Yeah. You're leading up, competing against your competition every day. You know, with them and against them, you know, here, you're doing that. And then we'll just have to be each other. Imagine the one of the show, being backstage with him going on stage with all that. Get that whole experience together would be really cool. Again, in the middle of his back, see how it's stretching across the ground. Yeah. Well, because there's such a deep cavern and the skin just won't go in that far. It just pulls out. Like, Christian. Yeah. You know, my Christian at that point, you know, ten years removed from the Olympia. And he's still in their training, you know. Big, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. God, all the detail. It's tension, tension, tension, tension, tension, tension. You know what I mean? Driving those elbows down. I just find these pump workouts are the worst at the very end, because you're just, it's exhausting for me to do ten easy reps like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like literally all they have left in the tank. And I know exactly how they feel. Like, we looked at that last rep and we thought, oh, it looks like you could have done more. But he's probably like at that point barely feeling it. He feels like he's yanking on it. Yeah. You know what I mean? Every single certain shutdown. Rains only half working at the moment. That's just, that was, yeah. Well, part of his back is he working. Yeah. Yeah. This is the Smith beds. I love the top of these on every rep. Cross-shakes. Yes. You're probably just going to say. Looks like he's driving the bar back against his hips at the top, you know? Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? To create like even more tension, like, little intent there to pull back, you know? Bang. It's a great video. Yeah. I've only seen it with 726 times. Yeah. See the entire back all the way down the spine from the neck to the lower directors is folding over with those rows, you know? Like the, the whole back. Come on, come on. Four plates on the Smith. Oh, barbarian brothers are the back. Yeah. Yeah. Still there. Still around. The feathered hair. Oh, yeah. All the pieces are coming together. We've watched enough of these videos now. Yeah. Yeah. Flex going bizarre, bizarre. You know? I was surprised I never noticed he was over under on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know nothing happened, but it still makes me worry about it. Yeah. Look at the quality on those wraps, right? So yeah. I just hope people could watch this and just, you know, take a little bit. And everyone's really into their back training right now, but just seeing the muscle moving like that, seeing the whole lat and everything that he's doing. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep in mind this is 13 days out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys are always talking about high intensity training. They're just stopping. Right. That's where they are at this point in their prep. That's not what we'll put all that muscle on there. Well, Flex talks here for a bit. All right. That's what he says. I can tell. Turkey. Turkey. 3 hours. Maybe 3 hours. We've been out for 15 hours here. That is gone. Craven. A sundown. Craven a sundown trophy. Oh, that's right. He's a little brain-duddery though. No carbs. Y

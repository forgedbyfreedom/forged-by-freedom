And you got to leave the one. Yeah. You have to leave the one. Yeah. I think they're lightening up a little, little. Right. I think they're got us this time. Yeah. It's like, you know, it's all through. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when the kids act up a lot, they got it up down for a little while. I think that's what it is. Yeah. Hannah, no intentions. Yeah. That are Google's just not getting their money and they're like, you guys got this kind of monetizing more stuff. Or shit. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're busy. We're busy.

And thanks to you guys for 200 episodes. You know, I can't believe we've done 200. I mean, to be fair and I'm not saying it has anything to do with weed. But I don't remember almost any of them. I did miss some of them. You missed a few. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. You were even here for all 200. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one.

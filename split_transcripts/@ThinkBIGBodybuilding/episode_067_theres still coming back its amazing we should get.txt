We appreciate you guys. So Andrew and I haven't had a chance to talk, Arnold Classic yet, almost at Olympia. Arnold Classic yet. I said Andrew and I, because skip, skip has not been following. And that's okay, skip. I don't understand. I don't understand. I'm looking at this list. I'll say it. Not impressed. What? Send me the list of people in the, I know. I don't mean it shitty. I look, they're clearly far better bodybuilder than I'll ever be in another hundred years if I could do it 10 times over. I'm just saying from past history, you know, with the Arnold lineups, um, in my hotline saying that this is pretty much a formality. What do you mean? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Okay. Well, A, I first, I think you're wrong. I don't think that this is just the, I don't think this is going to be a week armor classic. I think it's going to be a two man show. Yes. I mean, hotion Samsung. I think, because Samsung's, you know, he's, he's, he's the, the sitting champ right now. Hoties, the, the scorned Olympia second place who, from what I've seen is literally a slept, brave, breathe bodybuilding. Like, and every post is like, you can just tell. He doesn't do anything for fun. He doesn't do anything for recreation. It's been Jim Meals recovery. So, I think hoties coming into this thing to try to show people like, hey, you made him a steak by giving Derek Lons for the Olympia. And this is my best. Uh, with that being said, you know, Samsung just continues to improve every year. Yeah. And he's got a prettier structure, just being a little bit taller, little bit broader in the shoulders, having the flowing quads. He's got the classical frame with open bodybuilder muscle. So you can't, you know, deny that either. So I do think it's a two man race between those two. I hope they're both in the best shape of their lives. And I hope it's a show that we all remember for years to come. But I do, I would agree with you with this gift that I think that it is a, a, a fight for third place, third, fourth and fifth place. I think is where the real action is going to be. Um, I think this is the list here. Yes, I got the one. Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is it's not deep. It doesn't seem deep to me where it's like, it's a toss up. This is going to be like, you know, a battle. And but you know, again, listen, I admit you guys said it in an I admit it. I don't follow those top two shows like I used to. I did. You know, I admit it. I just don't. Well, I'll say this is because typically the Arnold classic is only like a 10 or 12 man lineup. So it's not like you limp. It's not like, you know, some of those bigger shows. So I really think we're going to see a lot of quality in the top six seven. And you know, let's say, you know, I have hotty and Samson and Ron, one and two. I can't tell you who, you know, right. That's the tough one is what's going to be next. That third place finisher. That's where it's this is so freaking wide open. Because I feel like I can't even tell man. And this is something I've gone to the Arnold for like over a decade now, right? And in it's so many times it's like, oh, well, here is your top five, right? After first and second, which I still don't even know for sure what's going to happen there, which you know, and I talked to Ron and Dusty about this too. Now, I don't know if they're going to give Samson any kind of like credit for having won last year. You know, in a moment. I hope not. Yeah, I don't think they are. You know, so I don't think we have to worry about we could call that politics possibly. I don't think we have to worry about those politics. And if there were politics, how we've got a Mr. a very recent Mr. Olympia on stage, right? Nobody else in this lineup has done that. But after that, what the hell is going to happen? You know what I mean? It's really hard to nail down, but you know, I mean, just going off names and we haven't seen him much lately, but Rafael is next on that list. So he's he growing a lot because a couple of people have been saying, Ralph, and I loved Ralph. And I'm going to be the first one to tell you, I haven't followed him close enough. My main impression of him was like four or five years ago at the Arnold. And he looked impeccable, but like a smaller version of a bodybuilder compared to everybody else on stage has he, has he brought that up? I mean, I guess we'll find out. Yeah. I mean, yeah, he competed. I think it was early last year. And I don't think we've seen him since. But you know, but I think in a no particular order, I think three, four, five, six. I'm looking at Rafael. I'm looking at horse MD. Yes. And honestly, I haven't heard a lot of people talking about MD, but if you look up his shots, his structure is very increasing. And he gets peeled. Like his side shots, the detail on the side of his legs is out of this world. The the only knock on him, I will say is his rear double is not as developed as his other shots. And obviously the rear double front double, most muskettos are like our power shots in open bodybuilding. So he might get a little bit hurt there. But if he's peeled out of his mind, and he's real dominant in his front double on his side shots, I think he's in that conversation. Look at this guy's get check this out. I mean, like if I could if I could look like a bodybuilder that's competing today, like he would be very high on my list. You know, they're a very good point. I was actually thinking the same thing. That's a very desirable look at the history. I was looking there. Yeah. And he's got cash. Yeah, small joints, everything is rounded out. The shape is just amazing. Additional is balanced. It's pretty pretty insane. That hamstring is absolutely nuts from the side of the sound. It's ridiculous. It's yeah, it's another word we'd like to use, but we can't use anymore. Redonculous. Redonculous. But anytime the can of a starts with re, I get really. Yeah, you got hot throughout the country. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Continue and down. I also have James Hollins said in that next group, we don't know what we're going to see. What James we're going to see because, you know, I feel like he was peaked fairly well when he worked with Phil like Phil Viz, like four years ago, five years ago. And then he worked with Patrick Tour and he always kind of came in with like a spilled flat look, like they kind of pushed things too hard and maybe missed the peak by like a day or two. He's with me low snow. So I think, you know, the the wizard, the doctor, I think you'll figure him out. I will say this though. And you guys, let me know what you think because I saw he was training. He picked his final week training to hang out with Branch Warren and train with Branch. And Branch wasn't taking it easy on him. Like this is a guy's final week of prep. They were doing this stuff you were talking about a minute ago, like the dumbbell presses and the you pussy like to me, honestly, that would be the last move I would do if that's not my style of training, especially coming over to the US, hanging with Branch Warren in that final. We try to impress him because he's a legend. Of course, you're trying to keep up with him in terms of intensity to me. I would tear both texts, both biceps, hamstrings, like every. And if not, at least don't go horseback ride with him. Yeah, I mean, of course, right? Exactly. Like, of course. Exactly. And then, you know, the next time I list that I have in that group being would be Antoine Volion. Oh, yeah. You know, I feel like, you know, we weren't as impressed with his off season, shots this year, but then, like, lately, he's like, turned it on. And he's just, he kind of similar to Samson and having that classical, like, physique kind of flow, but with open muscle. And he poses really well. So I think he's in that that that that conversation for three, four, five, six. I would probably say more that like, like, five, six, maybe seven, which would be cool. I take that for him. Yeah. And then there's some other guys, you know, that I think have the ability to be in that three, four, five, like Justin Rodriguez, but now I have just kind of missed the mark over the last couple of years. The Hobbit Shaban. We haven't seen much of him lately. He took all last year off. John Delirosa, I hear he's looking more improved than he was last year. And he want to show last year, you know, great. I don't know for a lot of people. We're in Somal. The gym is great. So I'm going to open a few years, but it's the place to be. He opened shortly after I left for West Palm and I say, I'm going to go down there, but I haven't. Well, this is going to be coming out on Friday. The beginning of the year, and if anybody is listening to this while they're while they're driving to the Arnold class, they hang out with the expo guys, I will see you there. Be sure to stop by the meat and booth. We're going to be doing podcasting all weekend long at the mutant booth. So I'll look for a minute. Next, going to be the grab as parents if you can. This is what I'm trying to have a thing. You want to do a podcast with next parents. I do. I do. And he said he's going to talk to him. And if he thinks that they might do it, but he didn't want to commit for them. Are you going to be on your best behavior with? Oh, absolutely. But I like that. I think it would be fun for the listeners too to get this. Because this parents are incredibly lively, very involved. It's a very, very close as a family. I think it's cool when I think it'll be quite entertaining. All right. Yeah. I'm down. I'm down. I'm sure the audience would love that, too. As long as you're in your best behavior, I don't want to be fair. Honestly, I'm going to be honest. I think the next mom in general would probably prefer skip not to be on his best behavior. Like, this is your right. Yeah. I really, I'm being serious. I got a lot of questions. You just just, I think they're like a very good time family. And I think like skip being himself, like they would absolutely have a right with that. And would join right in. You know, because I've seen them at the Olympia. Like, they all got the T-shirts on. And yeah. They're all like, you know. So yeah, it's these seem like a very fun family. They'd be a blast. All right. Let's get onto our topics. We've got a bunch of list or questions. And this is one that stuck out to you and Drew. And I feel like the edge could be kind of complicated. So, and this is, I'll tell you what. So here's the deal. As a coach, you have your check-ins every day that you go through and you're like, okay, yep. This is exactly what we want to see. You know, let's do this or let's do nothing, right? And those are the easy check-ins. But unfortunately, it's not always that fun, right? We run into situations like this. And this is where we actually have to figure some stuff out. So he says, hey guys, great show. Have you ever encountered someone who has been in a deficit and has struggled to lose fat? I've been in a deficit for many weeks now. I have yet to lose a damn pound of fat it seems. I started with body weight times eight. And I feel like that put me in a pretty good deficit when I'm eating beyond that for, but I've been eating beyond that for months. Any ideas on what the problem could be? I'm not sure what he means by the body weight times eight. I just figured out. I think he's meaning his body weight times eight calorie. Yeah, eight calories per pound. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So then you don't know what the ratios are. We don't know what the macros are. And did that formula? Because it's very arbitrary, very random to me. It is. Are you actually in a deficit? You can cut from what you were taking in. For some people, you can cut four or five hundred calories and it can start to fall. Other people, you can cut eight, nine hundred calories and it cannot move. So that would be my first question. Mm-hmm. I mean, I'll tell you, I think that, you know, was a coach or when your self diagnosed and this stuff it always comes down to three different directions. Or you gotta ask yourself which direction we're going. You got three possible things, right? If things are going well, well then just keep doing what you're doing. That's easy. Right, but the next, but the next decision is, do we need to push harder or do we need to pull back? Mm-hmm. It always just comes down to that black and white to me because, well, we know we just can't keep doing what we're doing. We're just beating our head into the wall and we might be driving number tables and down even worse and we're just not getting anywhere. So, I mean, I guess what I would ask him is, what are the steps you've made since you've hit this wall? Like, and was, did you hit this wall eight weeks ago? Or did you hit this wall for the first time this week? You know, have you manipulated your cardio? Have you manipulated your supplements by adding thermogenics in? Have you looked at your non-exercise activity? Like, just your steps, you know, simple things like that. You know, because I can tell you guys like, when I used to the personal train, I was training people, you know, 10, sometimes 12 clients a day, getting 20,000 steps and was super easy. You switch to sitting in front of a computer all day. Sometimes you're like, oh, man, I got 2,000 steps and I got to get moving. Yeah. So, there is a big difference there in what you can eat and then how much cardio you have to do to compensate. So, that, you know, just looking at it from like very basic, like first line things, I guess. Then, secondarily, I'd be like, okay, are you doing anything to stimulate your metabolism? Are you doing refeeds? Are you doing sheet meals? Or are you literally just eating eight times your body weight every single day? Because, in my opinion, like the best way to make a stagnant metabolism is to eat the same thing every day without any variation, either down or up. Is it safe to say that most diets are going to have some sort of a cyclical effect? Like, you're not doing the same thing as what you're saying every day. It's very rare for somebody to go from point A to point B and literally eat the same thing day in and day out without any manipulation or variation at all. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, just quick points, you know, have you tried to do some high carbohydrate refeeds? You know, if you're eating 200 grams of carbs a day, have you tried bumping it up to 450 for say two days and then get right back on your diet. Have you tried polling calories? You know, have you pulled your calories further? You know, and then I start to think about like the next level stuff like, okay, hormonally, are you using PEDs? Are you not using PEDs? Are you natural? And you've just literally driven your testosterone and your endocrine system into the tanks and you might need some support there. So, you just start, did you just start a cycle? Where you were on the RT and you've added growth and your weight is coming up. So your body composition would be changing and yet the scale weight may not be moving. The other thing too is, you know, taking those numbers that you provided, say it's 200 pounds and just as an arbitrary number, you're talking about 1600 calories roughly. Pretty low for a 200 pound person. So, not, you know, absurdly, let's say he's, you know, he's going to step on stage at, you know, 165 and he's 200 pounds then okay, but still it's low. There should still be if the gear is constant and the gear isn't like you didn't just start a cycle and you have that added variable there. There should be some some initial loss, even if it's just water. So, if you've gone a few weeks and you have gone to these numbers, it's likely that you're not too low because there would have been that initial drop to begin with. So, and again, this is taking the gear out of the equation, you know, as many other variables as possible. So, I'm with you. I think we had all agree, it push harder because if you push harder and it starts to fall and then you find yourself in a week or two that you're depleted, then you may be able to start to slowly bring those calories back up to defeat them atabels and it may well be stall. We don't know what you did in the off season. We don't know insulin sensitivity. We don't know if you're overtrained. We don't know any of that at this point. The other thing that just comes to my mind is we don't know if this is a male or female. Good point. Because I just look, I just tried to look at the name on the, and it's, you know, like a atmonicard, like you, you never could tell some of these things, you know, it's like at the, these something. So, yeah, yeah, you know, if it's a female and eating 600 calories a day and let's say she's 140 pounds and wants to get down to somewhere in the 120s, yeah, then definitely the first move is pull, right? I mean, it's, it's, it's, but I'm with skip if you're a 200 pound male and you're eating 1600 calories and you're stalled out already. Something, maybe the 1600, what you think is 1600 calories is actually more like 3000 calories. You can actually do the math or you need to backstip a little bit and maybe reverse diet and then try again. Because in, in no coach ever wants to admit this that they sometimes can't get people into shape the first time around. But how many times have you had people aware you get them going? They hit a wall and you're like, oh, this is actually going to take twice as long as we thought. And you have to explain to them, okay, now we need to actually reverse diet for a little while. Build your calories back up, get your metabolism healthy again and then attack this thing again. And no, no client wants to hear that. They're like, what do you mean? I thought you'd get me, you know, in decent shape within three or four months. But you know, that's how the body works sometimes. You know, we can't, we can't, we can't shortcut that. It takes as long as it takes, you know? Yeah. All right, yeah, I'm with that. And I think the, the hormone thing, you know, get your hormones checked or what's going on with Astrogen? Did you like skip said, like did you just start a cycle? And one of the things I've been seeing too is that I've been seeing people shining any type of Astrogen control. And I think that you can get away with like super, super high Astrogen and continue to grow muscle. I don't think that that's as much of a problem. But I think it can be an issue that if your Astrogens like going in triple digits and you're trying to lose fat, I don't think that that's going to be your benefit. Let me add, let me add a counter to that, too. Like if you've driven your estrogen to like the, like the, the tens of lower. Yeah. That can also impair your fat loss. Yeah. So, so I agree with you. The, the checking your hormones, you know, uh, endocrine system as well as thyroid, I think is definitely yes. And that you need to do, you know. And I want to piggyback off that to say that I don't think and have changed my perspective on this over the years. If you go back 12 years ago, 2010, 2012, I would have wanted that, uh, one of the estrogen lower. And I look more at the ratio now of what you're taking versus and what's going to romanticize versus the estrogen level instead of saying, oh my god, it's, you know, 110. If you're on, you know, your blood levels are off the charts. That's not so bad. If your blood levels are at TRT and you're 110, then that's a little different story. I agree. That's it. We've got here. How about, um, I'm going to throw this one in just because it's fun. Actually, you know what, I'll save that because we're doing that out of other show. We're talking about training. So that'd be a good one. We had a couple of questions that were about, um, uh, about doing two with days. And let me see if I can find one of them. I'll just throw this one up first. They're kind of, we've got two questions about it. This guy says, what are your thoughts on working out twice a day? He says, I have plenty of free time and a nice week, nicely equipped home gym. We'll start with that when I guess. I want to say that first, no one should base their training frequency on the amount of free time that they have. Oh, my love it. Just love that. It's so you can tell where I'm going with the answer. And and we've covered this several times before, but there's a very, very few number of people that can grow if not just survive to a day training. All right. You know, you only have so much recovery ability. And it's hard enough to say, you know, train five days a week with super intensity. So now you're talking about possibly increasing that to 10 training. You're fit in 10 training days into into into a week, basically, of seven days. Um, I just think you're going to interfere with your recovery. You're going to interfere with your muscle protein synthesis. And um, you're going to leave yourself down the road to lack of gains and injuries if not anything. So it's all just leave it with that. Yeah, it's a recovery issue. It's parasympathetic versus sympathetic. I just think it's a bad idea. If you're Kevin the Vrony and you start training chest twice a day in the 90s and you grow, then more power to Kevin the Vrony. Uh, I don't know how he did it either, but I'm not a gifted, you know, I don't have that gifted predisposition. I've tried it. I tried it back in the day. I tried it back in the early 2000s and it didn't take long before things started hurting. My motivation to train went down because if you train twice a day, you're already look. You're already focused on your meals, your prep of everything. It's a very, especially if someone's new to it. You may like it at first, but it becomes a very arduous, very, um, not laborious, but just this anxiety, riddled thing of all I got to eat. Oh, I got to do this. Oh, I got to do it. You just, you just complicated what should be kept as simple as possible. Now your entire day has to do with timing around two workouts instead of one. I don't see any benefit. You may even if you're gifted, here's the argument. I would go it. Even if you're gifted and you grow, you're growing and you're gifted. I don't, like how fast do you need to get to the finish line? Just keep growing and be happy that you're gifted and you're going to grow faster than everybody else. I don't see it almost ever working. I have a client that has trained back twice a day and it actually has helped. My question, though, with the process was would that back growth have been there anyway changing a few other different variables versus training at twice a day? And there came a point where after doing that for a few months, I don't know that it was as beneficial because then again, the things we talked about, there were recovery, beating yourself down twice a day. You only have so much recovery building. That's, that's it. Yeah, you really do. And I think that, you know what, I'll just talk about like more volume in general. I think that when when we first start body building and we first start making progress, then we see that one body part that we say, hey, you know, my back gets not growing as well as everything else. And so our first thought is that, hey, well, what if I did more volume? What if I did another back day or, you know, whatever? What if I trained back twice two times, you know, today instead of months? My thought is been nowadays that let's look at the reasons that your back wasn't growing to begin with, you know? And if we can look at, like, how to improve that technique and how to get instead of trying to think about how can I do more? My question is, is like, how can you get more out of what you're doing? And ideally, maybe even get more out of less. I think that I can, and I can't remember skip the, I can't remember the way you put it just now. But I, at one point, I trained seven days a week, okay? And I knew at that point in my life, like, this is not going to be good for me. I'm, it's not going to benefit my body building, but I like I just don't want to go home, you know? I'm going to go, yeah, seven days a week. And that's just what I'm going to do for a while. In like, a good ways into that, did it for a few months? A good ways into that, man? That's all right. Good ways into that. I literally felt like I was punching a clock. I'd get done with work. I'd go get my gym close on, I'd go to the gym. Damn well, could it just been like punched a clock? And now I'm doing cable extensions, and now I'm doing this, you know? It's like it, it really was, I got less out of it, you know? I got less out of each workout. Yeah. I got a better answer for the guy than train twice a day, train once a day, and find something to provide a revenue stream, build a business. There you go. Do something kind of side hustle. How about like personal train people with your awesome home gym? How about that? I would almost tell people to do something non-body building related. As someone that's meant my whole life in gyms and also coaches people, I love everything I do. But there is sometimes where it's like, I don't want to go to the fucking friggin gym after talking about the gym and the programs for the gym and talking diets about the gym. You know what I'm saying? So if someone's, you know, I'll just leave it at that, because sometimes there's like too much of a good thing. Absolutely. I've said it on a how many times in my wife's so glad I've come to this. I don't want to go out on the weekend with people who are body builders because I don't want to talk about nutrition and train. I want to talk about anything other than not because I don't enjoy it, but because that's how I make my living. It almost seems all consuming. So I want to go out and talk to people who are not normal, but for lack of a better word, have different interests. Yeah. Away from stuff. Skip just wants to be the big guy at the table. Yeah. My friends, it's like the woman who picks just fat ugly friends. So she can be the hot one in the picture. You know, he's both shut up. I'm not good. All right. So let's see if this one has anything different to it. He said it thoughts on two-way day training in prop instead of cardio, two cardio session, cardio slash two cardio sessions. Stand after being used to be a huge advocate at back in the 2000s. And so I asked for a little more clarification and he said instead of strength training and one or two cardio sessions, how about two sessions of training sessions with only one cardio session if any. His reasoning from stand-offering was that why burn calories with a catabolic activity like cardio instead of two a day and a ballacang activity with weight lifting. Well, tell you what, it's a decent point. Yeah. It is a little bit. It leads him how he's presenting it. And I'm not saying stand-offering is wrong because stands obviously very intelligent. He does, I've gone to some of his talks and stuff and he's very entertaining too. He's someone that like you know is walk the walk, you know. But I think what he's failing to maybe explain or point out or bring up or think about is that at some point training is catabolic too. So you can't just say that training is all just an anabolic activity, right? Because otherwise why don't we do four hour workouts? Why don't we train as much as we possibly can? Why don't we train three times a day, six days a week? You know what I mean? So I think, yeah, I'll just leave it at that. I think it's a little, it's a little bit of a short-sighted answer I guess. I do like that he pulls away the importance or a little bit of significance from cardio because I'm just over the years I have really come to understand that in my opinion based on my experience. I find that cardio is overrated for getting lean. I'm not saying it won't get you lean and I'm not saying that it's not necessary but I also think that people jump to these big amounts of cardio like well you know I got to do two hours a day of cardio and everybody can do that and give it. I don't think that that's the best approach. I think it also plays into recovery. It also plays into your CNS. It plays into a ton of shit and before you know it you have senior blocks on your feet because you're doing a ton of cardio and I also think and I think that this might be where Stan is going to is and I agree with you about the recovery. You can only fill a glass you know to the top. You can't fill it past the top. So there is still then I think we lose sight of this and body but there's still a metabolic impact from weight training. As an example if you train volume for two hours versus training DC for 40 minutes or 45 minutes there is a different caloric you know caloric intake mess messers or there's more of a demand on the metabolism for training longer periods of time than there is for these very very short training sessions in my opinion and I've seen it with clients not everybody not straight across the board but I don't want to say I want to go so far as to say that high volume training is like cardio because I don't that either but I do think it has more of a metabolic impact if you train for two hours versus if you train for 40 minutes even with the intensity higher. Now it could be on mute and I'm using DC because everyone's familiar with DC I do suppose that if you went in for 45 minutes and we literally didn't put down weights and you did giant sets and and you're going to be a mellow type of thing you're probably going to walk out pretty difficult I think that's a little bit different story but I think there's a difference between different styles of training and there's looking off into the egg what do you think? It's because I'm sitting here and I'm thinking back to like my DC squat sets and like just how much I would equate it to hit cardio whereas I would really more volume training to more like steady state cardio to use in the water. I think I would get it because like some of these hacksquad and leg press and draw and squat we don't make her sets like I thought I flatlined. Yeah you know what I'm doing for 40 minutes though either right? I mean your sessions were still going longer. My sessions were probably when I was like don't take real the program and I folded to a T and I would say with the warmups and everything I was in and out in an hour so actual training was probably 45 to 50 minutes tops. Yeah because it's okay. Were you prepping or wanting to get lean at the same time? No it was just a little bit difficult to do I know some people do that I can't do that because I can't recover from that. So I guess I'm equating the question more because he was involving cardio and maybe I maybe I shouldn't because I maybe just assuming that this is what he means but I'm assuming it's either in a cut phase or to get leaner so I don't know then you would talk then you could argue that the long volume sessions are going to tap recovery just as much or as the shorter duration higher intensity. The both can is that they're going to both potentially fry your CNS which is another rabbit hole we need to go down as far as recovery during prep when your calories are restricted. Everybody wants to train their ass off myself included when we're prepping and yet your recovery is arguably more compromised than it ever was in the offseason but that's a different topic for still. That would be a great topic because is it our compromise and in on paper I would say absolutely it is but in reality when you're in that groove of a prep and your meals are exactly the same time every day and your supplements are taken every day and you're going to bed at 930 and you're sleeping until 730. I almost feel like because you're in such a groove and you know exactly what to expect sure you get beat up but I almost feel like your recovery is almost the same or better in a sense. You know it's funny I find it to be sporadic. Yeah almost entirely random you know just in response to what you're saying so I don't disagree but I think consistently over the it almost seems to be like this it's like one week you'll just be like off-season like oh my god I feel yeah stronger I feel great and the next week you just absolutely destroyed you're like oh my god I need to reload and I've only been biocic for two or three weeks. Well because let me let me just suppose that with the the offseason when you're at your near heaviest and you wake up in the morning and you don't feel recovered at all and you're like I'm eating a ridiculous number calories I'm training four maybe five days a week like I'm doing next to no cardio like shouldn't I be so recovered it and I feel sluggish yeah yeah so I'm in another you feel so sluggish and bloated and you're like man I but I'm not feeling any faster recovery from saying my leg workouts for my yeah and it's not necessarily because I'm training harder because if you look at the weights being used you know from one season to the next they're about the same you know maybe I lose a repertoire and the in the pre-contest phase but the weights are pretty close to to what I would hit in the same in the same offseason so it's just one of these things it's like you can't scientifically explain it exactly but if you if people that are listening know what I'm talking about because they've been in the groove and they they felt that like on your body is like doing everything more effectively and like you're not mistaken you're not missing any meals you're getting all that sleep and I think you said it those god everything is effectively inefficient and and and and skip always brings up this point that yeah your sleep is hurting in in in a prep you you find yourself getting four and a half five maybe six hours of sleep towards the end but it is more efficiently right you know what I mean and I think because when you said effective it made me think of efficiency and I think your body becomes more efficient at all those I think so too I just gotta tell you which begs the question this if you're in prep you tend to have weeks out you know you need a day off logically you know you need it you can take it of course not not many people are gonna take it they're gonna be like black and white I need to try I need a push-through and that's where you have to be able to read and it's difficult because even as a look even as a coach I'll admit if you're not feeling it if you know matter fact I'm not feeling I'm running down and I'm running to the ground how many clients you can tell you I they're basically saying I'm pushing out they're gonna kind of keep themselves and they're gonna think oh it's prep I gotta push through I gotta get this done I think what I'm saying is we lean more towards continuing with that rigid very high structure of I need to train today versus if we were to play it and we were to play it without our emotions and just the feedback from our body we would take that day maybe even too to be able to recover and then that would be optimal but again I guess that's what I'm talking about when it comes back to recovery it is absolutely individual we can all agree on that you know that there's so many variables and I think that's why it's difficult to approach in my opinion difficult to approach training from a scientific standpoint with studies because there are so many variables involved the list is so long that how do you control all those variables it's tight it's tough one I just did a like an hour-long talk with Cuba about the topic of basically adjusting your training around your basically your your nutrition around your fuel your fuel level it is interesting because we go all the way through his off season into what he's calling like his like health phase recovery phase and then into the prep and he was saying what he does is he'll remove things like it's he calls him like set extensions so drop sets rest pause stuff like that he feels like he wants to get rid of those things but he's still gonna of course like go as heavy as he absolutely can in the exercises that he's doing and then the next stage would be maybe removing some set but if you remove set say in a push day he's not touching anything to do with any of that like compound chest work it's gonna come from like shoulders from triceps which that makes sense to me you know going on so on that route and then he's still able to hit it as hard as he needs to for that that mean you know compound meat and potato stuff yeah when you said something that's very very important and we've said this before and it maybe it's been a while but the main difference to me between the off season and prep when you relate diet to training is you can change your nutrition to fit your training in the off season uh in the prep you better be ready to change your training to fit your nutrition yeah because the goal is just literally completely different and I think if people approached it that way and I know it's an over simplification but it's a really good rule to live by when you transition from off season to well both off season to prep or prep to off season you can you need to switch the focus there the whether you're feeding and not gonna reiterate it already said it twice all right good enough good enough um let's let's take this one here this is from Patreon so all right would you ever advise cutting growth while on TRT because growth in antibiotics function better together for instance to make the most out of your out of what you have and to cut expenses so he's saying maybe like while you're in cycle turn the growth up and then to save money dial it back during like a TRT face I'm gonna say my pain with the growth is the only factor determining when and how much you take it is your wallet yes and no it's been set a many times and it's almost very cliche but there's just so much so much truth well okay so that they like for people that maybe don't understand like they work from entirely different mechanisms it's it's not a growth home it was not an energy and it doesn't hit the energy and receptor so I guess why not keep it as high as you possibly can unless you have blood sugar issues or some yeah yeah heart cart some cardio pulmonary issues that are you know kidneys and whatnot that are that are being affected why wouldn't you keep another growth factor in there as high as you possibly could especially when you're using less antigens right I mean yeah to answer I would I would keep your growth up but we keep it high and I would keep it plenty full yep and let me just throw in just a little ad for you guys because I'm curious what you think you can only pick one phase to use growth hormone you like God came down and said you can you can I'll give you as much Sarah Stim is you want especially if you like that he's you know he's a giving he's a giving it so but you can only use it during the off season or you can only use it during what you got without you that cruel God he has very weird sense of humor I would use it during a prep phase and I would die it for the rest of my life yeah I was a try to be funny the correct answer yes all right how about this one another one from patreon from Nick he says question for bsg now okay we're going to talk about a medication for ADHD I'm not going to say the name of that medication for the sake of YouTube how would you implement or this implement cycles for competitors on prescription medications like ADHD meds as ma meds blood pressure meds SSRIs etc both men and women I asked specifically because my wife has recently been prescribed in ADHD medication but she but I feel like it could be an interesting topic well first off you should not be even thinking about taking your wife's medication very yeah you don't even have to worry about this Nick this isn't even a problem so we is you asking how to utilize ADHD medications I think I think you say in like hey if you have it I think you say if you have a client that's using say medications or they're on an SSRI how do you cope them when it comes to let's say adding PEDs do you take that into consideration like what if that were the case and then we're like hey what let's we want around clan you know after your time yeah I got you all right so first thing I'll do is I'll look up and see if there's any contraindications which I mean there shouldn't be because it's typically PEDs are not very well researched in combination with sRIs or SSRIs or some of these other compounds but it's still good to do your due diligence and look it up you know I came over the exact website it's like drugbank something dot com and you can see like every known contraindication for using two different substances or three different substances and what side effects could emerge but with that you know beyond that it's it's kind of like well it's prescribed by their doctor and I would say a doctor super seeds they're online coach telling them what to do or what not to do and most situations now I will say there isn't an example of say acutane because acutane is very hepatoxic right and let's say so and so it doesn't want to stop using their their PED cycles and some of it might involve some other orals as well what I've done several times has have them cut their acutane cycle in half or cut the dosage in half and they still got the same benefits that they would at the higher dosage from from previous experience is using and I think that that helped cut down in some of the liver toxicity that we might have experienced with using you know polypharmacy of say you know an oral based androgen as well as the acutane that makes sense I got one I got one and we're thinking in a different direction the SSR I think that if somebody were on an SSR I you know it it really just in general if I'm working with somebody and I have any kind of their suspect that maybe they have some mood stuff going on I might not be like hey let's throw Deca into the mix you know I feel like I've seen a lot of people that hit and it's interesting because Dave Crossle was recently saying he's like I don't think that we used to talk about it 10 20 years ago about the mood things that can arise with Deca but I remember a few years back on Instagram stories somebody said hey every time I take Deca I get really jealous of my girlfriend like of other guys and stuff she was like I normally not a jealous person but it's a legit thing I get that way and why is that and I I kind of laughed at it I was like that's crazy Deca causing jealousy but then guess what like a dozen people respond and they're like oh yeah I totally get what he means I've gotten weird like weird emotional stuff taking Deca so it's out there and and for that reason then and then also too I've seen a few clients that maybe weren't doing really good and maybe even that like one guy I'm can think enough that I might even listen to the show I'm not getting a call here let me turn this off. Oh, it's not a call came in. I one guy he make this really quick. We started NPP even and he started he started like losing interest in bodybuilding and before you know it it's like he started to like just change and like his responses and his check-ins were getting like just like off something was off and I could send something something was offer a few weeks and finally I was like hey man what do you say we take a break from this because it was like coming to a head I was like why don't you say we take a break for this MPP and let that clear and he did in everything got better so I just want to be careful if somebody has something you know mood-wise with nineteen doors that's all that would make sense yeah doesn't to me I gone record and said yeah I was surprised man but like someone has people reached out to me and they're like hey I get it and that's the thing I don't dismiss whether it be a client or anybody else you know listen to the show or anything else if they feel that there is a connection between a specific mood whether it be jealousy or anything else here's the issue that I have and this is just me thinking off the top man I understand that there's individual issues I understand that people react to you know drugs differently I get that but I will say first off I mean I I've taken a lot of shit for a long time in different combinations I'd go so far to say more than most for a duration like for a very long period of time I and just because I haven't witnessed that doesn't mean that it's not possible what I am saying is this it's going back to what we were talking about with the training and stuff I'm a variables guy I don't know how to me it seems that it's more likely that it's correlative versus causative that's just me saying that without experiencing that myself jealousy is a very broad thing motivation comes and goes I would argue that it's correlative until I were to actually see it play out and hear more feedback from it to where I saw that there may be more of a pattern I'm not saying it doesn't exist I'm saying I'm finding it difficult to believe that it's causative are you familiar with deck as effect I'm dopamine yeah absolutely so then I would even come back to what other compounds are with it are you only running that we we just literally came out of about what 10 year phase of deck I only cycle not just came out of it right so you but you know what I mean so or trend only cycle are things that to people like us seem like why are you experimenting with these things that are not to someone who's been around long time more balanced more logical so I don't know what else they're using in there I would even question where was your jealousy level before that but that was my thought but it's not you weren't jealous now all of a sudden you are over you a little bit jealous that was my thought those skip but what about like just general insecurities lower related to lower mood and and everything related to think about like if you're if you're not getting as much out of your dopamine your sense of well being is going down so you're not able to get as much pleasure out of life or out of the thing I should do so even without any other drugs involved maybe somebody if so already got like a little bit of an imbalance or a lot of an imbalance going on I could see how it could you know it could take somebody further I've just seen it enough times now because like I said man we should just matter a fact what we do this guys if you've had any issues with deck of comment below you know what I mean let's talk about it I want to hear that's why I say I'm not saying that it's not possible and I want to be very very clear on that because okay yeah the tube is YouTube is notorious for you know I'll get bashed in the comments I guess that's why I almost didn't say anything and I'm like you know what I'm gonna say it because I'm being honest I just feel that it's more correlative and I don't see that it's causative yet I more than willing to hear more experiences on it trained a lot of people I have not had a lot of feed much hardly any feedback on mood related things like that related to uh I just haven't and that's twenty plus years so that's a lot of it's much asperes with you but I will say this is when we can completely disagree is that's cool and please understand too because I'm trying to pull away from this at a bad experience with a client and I ended up that we had two part ways it was more of a rapport issue type of thing certainly a great guy but it wasn't it just wasn't a good fit and I did use and I was my wife who told me she goes you you just you can't do that because you know sometimes my problems I don't talk to my wife you know client issues is a you can't let people think that or them get the perception that you have all the answers because you've done what you do for so long okay so I've been trying to pull back on that because and it's funny it's a kind of a double-edged sword because you want to point out this is my experience over a long period of time but you don't want to give the the implication of the perception that that's why you are right yeah well it's a balancing act it's difficult it's so I have I'm trying to make a conscious effort to not focus on giving that that perception because it's certainly not my intent I'm just trying to say trust the process and understand that I've seen this seen so many different things a thousand different ways trust the process versus their perception is I'm right I don't want to hear you do it this way because this is what I'm telling you to do yeah I'll tell you what I'm going to get back to the bodybuilding part of it that it like in clients I would say that just gear in general with somebody who's using your SSRIs could be something you know what I mean yeah yeah could be but we were talking specifically the one compound and that's where I was like I don't know but again I'll leave it at that because I'm not let's say I don't let's let me open it up again let me open it up again I'm not a fan of SSRIs I think they caused my harm the good and I felt they did my own life honestly when I used them you felt that they did cause more harm yeah yeah I did but at the same time man if I have a client that's using them I have to let them I can't tell you that you know what I mean no I'll be back because you're trainers of the gym yeah yeah yeah my bodybuilding which in of course any of those is going to 30 yeah well of course any doctor when they think of like my trainer my online coach they think of like someone with a clipboard in the gym who has no education in the same way that you know what that we probably do but no I just I see a lot more harm the good with the SSRIs I see a lot of interaction or a lot of um issues with getting into shape I see a lot of issues with I would say their their sanity I think um another other realms I guess regardless of PED use or not so when asked about if I think that they should continue with them I kind of err on the side like you did Scott where I said well your doctor has you prescribed on those but in my opinion I would be using those or I would use the lowest dose I possibly could and then try to do that myself off of it and try to work more on skills in coping and lifestyle factors that can help me maintain um you know yeah I just never know where people are at too you know I have a guy who may even listen to the show that we worked together he did like this freaking awesome job and he was using an SSRI and now he's kind of he's he's we stopped working together he did really good and competed and and and after the show like did really good and stuff rebounded and everything still looks freaking great but like his interested body building he's like trying to adjust medications and all it's like there's a lot to that I hate to see you know what I hate seeing somebody suffer with that stuff but like at the same time I'm like oh I don't know what he's been through I don't know what's going on in his head you know what I mean so I can't tell him like oh you should you know I can only say lots work for me you know I'm also coming from a kick like I don't trust anything and yeah I do a lot of reading and lately I've been on a kick about the pharmaceutical industry and just like the number of drugs that we have in our country that are proof for use where the reason why they're proof for use is because the trials were done in places like Africa where they don't have the like they don't count the same what you call like mortality factors they don't count the negatives the same way we do but but on the paper sheet over an Africa I'll say like next to no adverse reactions because their things don't count as adverse reactions as they would over here and then they could pass it on the FDA and say nope there's next to no adverse reactions and then people start using these things and we wonder why people do crazy stuff like you know bring firearms and the schools and shoot up schools or you know what I'm saying I'm taking it to the extreme but I'm saying like you know every one of those cases someone was on heavy medications yeah all right see what else we got here a fun question how about a fun question do we have anything fun oh we had one about our training that somebody come forget my word in the day oh yeah we can't in fact I screencapped that guy who said that he liked it somebody was asking us I can't see what it is but he said what are your guys' training looking like lately oh I'll start so me and later on a split where so it will do like legs push pull basically like like the first day yeah right nice like pretty deep it pretty advanced right now but like the first day the first leg day will be a quad base day okay like you know like extensions I should I won't go over all exercises but then the second day will be more of a hamstring day with a couple quad exercises thrown in how many days a week five days a week usually works out you so yeah I'm taking Wednesdays and Wednesdays and Sundays off right now so are you I just like I was going to say I just got back down here so I'm getting in the groove again this is my second week training I'm starting to like feel good have some of the go juice in me so I'm really starting to feel good and he's coming off of the cruise and getting ready for his prep so yeah like I think we're going to have a really good really good next couple months for training I want to do a video with him yeah I want to do a video with Nate about like how did you grow your legs just period just a one on one Nate likes to tell us about it really dequius they are did we say Re and I said Re anybody correcting me in the comments I'm very clear that it's spelled R.I. and that R.E. Oh because I made that reference earlier and I am certain that Andrew knows the same thing so save your comment skip what what to save our training for another time because we have a guest as joining us in the green room oh but real quick though uh what's our word of the day lithological no idea let me let me let me let's go lithological okay you ever you're ever in a conversation and you go to use a word and you can't remember the word and then you kind of start to obsess on it and you're like what I'm looking for that with that's lithological you can't find the word that explains do you want to use it explains what you're they get an I know I don't like it's so mad and then what happens five minutes later after the conversation is over like that was the word great that's why I'm so much better at writing writing and sounding intelligent in our articulate than I am speaking you don't deal with lithological when you're writing right or at least if I do I have the time to be able to find that word all right well we appreciate everybody tuning in thanks for watching um for the people in the livestream we're going to record another show and of course to check out the teams gift.com if you want to reach out to skip for coaching you can go to bodybarry.com to reach out to Andrew uh McNally diets at gmail.com hit me up after the Arnold and hopefully I'll be seeing you guys at the Arnold it'll be freaking awesome weekend also let us know who do you think is gonna be actually third place we want to know who your third place furniture is for the Arnold Classic and of course check out true nutrition.com user code think supplementsouric.ca for Canadians and thank you to everybody from patreon for another episode of Blood Sweat and Gear with Coach's Skip Hill and Andrew Barry I'm Scott McNally we will see you soon

What's up guys? Welcome back to Blood Sweat and Geowath Coach's Skip Hill. Andrew Berry. I'm Scott McNally and all of our programming is brought to you by you. Yeah, you. The people of Patreon. Thank you guys very much for your support. We're brought to you by Trunutrition.com. Use our code Think Over There. SupplementSource.ca for Canadians. All right. So listen, Andrew stitched together for us. An immaculate piece of art actually. This is, you literally put together pictures. Everybody who is qualified for the Olympia and you listed how they got qualified. I listed there the last time we saw them on stage. Oh, that's what it is. So the picture is from the last appearance we saw of them on stage. Will occurs in the day. I mean, come on. Well, I actually first asked chat GPT to do it for me. Oh, it's smart. And it responded. We haven't responded saying it couldn't. So then I actually had to do it myself. The only person that's not in these groupings is Be Roots because he will not be my understanding. And he's not able to come and get a visa in the United States being for my run. So he's the only one. And where he, we could we talk about where he would shake things up in this mix. But I organized it into tears and I'm not, I love it. Yeah, I organized it in a sense of like, based off of, Okay, where did you place in the most recent Olympia? What has been and obviously Nick didn't do the Olympia the last two years? But what has been your trajectory in the most recent shows? And what has been your MO in the Olympia as you have been a part of? So this is my, my top six or at least the grouping that I'm considering. The guys we should talk about in the top six. Samson, Hadi, Derek, all Olympia champions themselves. Nick, he won the New York Pro this year. Martin, he got fourth and a breakout year last year at the Mr. Olympia. And then I guess I'm going to say like the the mystery dark horse Andrew Jack, who if he could just dial it all in and get really conditioned. Yeah, he might be able to blow all these guys away. You know structurally and it's crazy because he goes to our gym now. And it's kind of cool in the times I do get to go to see him training a little bit. But I don't know, it's one of these things where we don't really know what these guys are looking like right now because none of them are posting any pictures. Yeah, you know, two, three or three and a half weeks out. So I won't say that Samson had that really nice guest posing six weeks out. People can just look that up on on Google. He was in great condition for six weeks out. Yeah. Hadi is we know he's going to be in condition. He's he's going to make it. We know he's going to be able to make it over. My understanding is that he signs an employment contract with the Evagant every year. And so he gets in on a work visa. And because he's been doing that several years in a row, he gets preferential clearance, I guess. Trust in traveler. Yes. Yeah, exactly exactly. But what do you guys like out of the mix? I'll say this man. I would love to see Andrew Jack step up. You mentioned that, you know, if you were to bring it in, I feel like he still needs a little bit more size, honestly, when I've seen him. But yeah, I'm going by seeing him in the past. I felt like he needed more. Maybe he's brought it up. You mentioned Samson and that recent guest posing or recent appearance. I think that his conditioning there says that he is contract to be his best. If Samson comes in, absolutely freaking head to toes diced. With the fullness, the roundness, all of that. Like, I don't think that anybody is going to be able to beat that. He's just absolutely depredious. But, you know what, man? It's like the day, all these guys really, let me, let me say this. All of these guys in their play things, it's going to come down to how they nail their peek. It's not like any of them are that much better than the others. You know, I mean, maybe just what I know of, I would say if I were to take this a tear further, I would call it Samson, Hottie, Derek, and Nick. Yeah, I agree. That's if I were to like try to boil it down further. Boiling it down further from there. I don't know, man. Tell me, what do you guys hear about Derek lately? Because I haven't heard a lot. Like, you know, like people are talking about Nick. People are talking about this guy. People are talking about that guy. We saw Samson. I feel like Derek's quiet, but maybe it's just the social media that I've been seeing. Um, I mean, he did just open his gym three weeks ago. So to the public, so who knows there might be the added stress of that. Yeah. But, um, I mean, I don't know. I don't know how he's going to look. I haven't seen it lately. I see him in my 40 all the time. I'm not really sure. I will say this that if gunned in my head, like, who do I think is going to bring their best look, but without a long, without a doubt, Nick Walker. Yeah. And just seeing his motivation talking to him, you know, I'm good friends with Kyle's coach. And, you know, I did get to see some exclusive picks. All right. Recently, Nick is far above. He was ahead of schedule when I saw these picks. And he was a lot bigger than he had been earlier this year in a good way. So, um, I think this could be that if he nails his peak of him, and Kyle nail it, I think this could be his year where he becomes Mr. Olympia. And he believes he can. Nick has never had the, Nick's had momentum going into other shows before. This isn't the first time that people have gotten behind him. But I would say I have never seen people get behind Nick Walker, like I have this year. And I think that he believes in himself more than he ever has, too. By agree. Um, with you guys as far as I, but I'm going to switch one. I don't know if it's because I, well, I've been in the sport a long time. So I, I fancy myself as someone who can put aside biases and, you know, either friendships or the fact that it's my client, you know, or something, something along those lines, I'm pretty good at that. And Andrew and I've talked about that in the past. I have Samson, Hottie and Nick in top I. Want to believe. And I think Nick should be able to beat Derek. Now, this is where the, I don't know if it's necessarily biased, but it's a, it's something that I look at. I don't like Derek, Derek, you got a great physique. So before the Derek minions crawled down my throat, I don't like my pants and everything else. He's got a great physique. I don't like that. I don't like the conditioning. I don't like the, what people are finally starting to talk about. The volume, but, but a lack of separation. If we just look at Nick's arms, no one is going to win the Olympic on arms, I'm just making a point if you look at Nick's arms. And you look at Derek's arms, there's right there, too. There's a lot going on in the last stuff that I think that could take the You know take away from the condition too, but let me compare Derrick's condition to like Victor Martinez That's what I see when I see that physique to me. This is just me He's riding on structure and shape more than he is condition because if you break that conditioning down It's not that it's bad But it's not dry and can hard. Howdy hard dry. It's it's maybe he looks great It's a little it's maybe a different type of condition, but take take this for what it's a word. Yeah, take this for what it's worth Seeing Derrick at the Arnold and like having pretty good seeds I can say this I Don't think that I have ever seen a better bodybuilder in person in my life the peak that he nailed there It was the most Austria and I'm not saying that as like oh man, I'm rooting for him But just like trying to be objective. I was like holy crap that can be there Yeah, there was a wild factor in the condition was part of it man I hadn't seen anything like it was one of the best looks if not like it's right up there I can't think of anybody else that I mean there's other guys that had different wild factors I'll say I'll leave it at this one of the absolute best Physiques I had ever seen in my life that specific peak in person There's no doubt in Derrick as a beautiful physique right and I think which skip is referring to though is He's condition in certain like his glutes and hamstrings are completely dialed in but from the front We're just not seeing the same kind of action in the upper chest the deltoids Yeah, even the lats whereas you look at a competitor like Haudian Nick who are probably gonna be the most Condition guys in the show those guys have detailed that just crawls out of every crevice You know lines everywhere no no stone unturned in terms of conditioning So it's just different physics right and then Samson's kind of in the middle of those of those different groups He's got a beautiful physique he gets pretty good condition But I and again, I don't know if it's lighting because I've never walked away from a show being like wow Samson was peeled You know, yeah, even whenever the Olympia I didn't think that it was like that Crazy, you know 100% but you know what man? I can think of other guys that had that were pretty like burning curry when he and that was he said that that was his favorite Look the year he won the Olympia. I liked him at the Arnold better when he was more peeled than that You know, but yeah, and that's why you know it's a subjective sport, right? It's yeah, and I say that by the way about Derek like not saying like oh man I'm rooting for him you guys you know like I'm I'm just saying like that's my like as objective as I can be like holy crap I wish you guys could have seen that right there But you know you're right because when I think of what I was looking at it's like the side shots Where you can see how etched out the glute in the hamstring was and all that you know what I mean It was but not in the yeah, I know that you're right the chest has been the the flaw hasn't it I've never seen I don't think I've seen Derek on stage But having seen like Nick on stage of both the Arnold classics several years ago and then at the New York this year That's kind of how I felt the way you're describing Scott of like This is one of the greatest physics that's ever walked on stage in terms of nailing a peak conditioning Maximizing muscle tissue per you know square inch on the body And that's not to say that everything will athlete up here does have some flaws Scott, I did understand you have I think your picture just a minute ago of hotty that I do want to show here because he is a one guy that showed a picture Of most of his physique in a in a time frame And I think we should probably show I did reach out to Nick I'd reach out to Derek a couple weeks ago you supposed to be on my podcast and he canceled on us or he'd know he just know showed us So I wasn't gonna reach out for For pictures from him. Yeah, I don't know happened there, but Can I make a comparison while you're doing that? Yes. Oh Sorry, I was pulling the other one. No, that's okay. I know I'll change I thought it would take one I'll go back I'll go back to it a second. Here's that picture So that was him a seven and a half weeks out I Think the man's gonna be in shape. Yeah, yeah, look at that thickness Yeah, and oh, and I just watched a video of him I think it was three days ago. He was shrugging. I think it was seven or eight plates aside Of course he was I mean, and we've all seen the squat videos with him squatting Five plates for ten reps, you know backsquats. No Smith machine regular backsquats and doing lunges with three 15 So if there's ever a guy a poster child for you better not lose strength during prep hoties your guy Yeah, yeah, let me ask you if you guys see this or not It just might be the way my brain works. It's a little off But it's almost like he takes hamson and maybe he's the 20 24 20 25 Lex Wheeler then he go over to hotie and you see a 24 25 Sean Ray and then when I say this With more muscle that's why I'm saying 20 24 20 25 and then when I look at Derek I think of an arguably better or in this generation J cutler. That's so bad Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, if I was looking at it kind of skewed It's like if you totally got it and you added more size we have similar looks in and the J cutler Derek comparison is again because of conditioning Yeah, J was always in condition, but it wasn't The Beale exactly exactly You're right J did reach that conditioning in his first Olympia Fair enough. I mean, that was my that was literally my favorite my favorite look at J color was that in Yes, he didn't have the same size that he had when he eventually started winning them, but the peak of the him and Chris As you know had that that one blew my mind you know detail everywhere But now if I Go ahead Say my only Criticism I guess of Nick and God do I hate To crit like give any type of constructive criticism when Someone so Zika so much far in above what I've ever accomplished, but so take it you know for what it's worth But I find that the three on top aesthetically are more pleasing to my eye if I were a judge Than Nick and that says a lot I think because I genuinely like Nick I like everything about the guy I love the drive I love the support system He's gotten places a good dude, but I don't that's the only thing that makes me go Sure, be even his best may not be able to pull it out But I'm gonna I'll be the first one to be jumping out of my chair To be composed off it'd be like yeah, you know, yes, this is freaking awesome I would agree with you skip if we didn't see him at the Pittsburgh next to the Yeah, and and Martin pushing and and I don't think the complaint I don't think they're ready complaints of like and he looks a little wonky or his structure is not as good as state It was really a do you think Derek one or do you think Nick one? You know, yeah and you make that's a very good point But let's go now this is this is me playing the other side Let's go to into the judges head for a minute did he Derek win because they Quite possibly I mean, I know obviously it's a gas, but that's what I it's like and when you get to this level It's got to be really hard to judge because it's not apples and oranges But it's very well For our labor genius it's like what is your threat like it's like how do you do this? It's not like well he looks so much better from the front. No Yeah, they're all so good so much better and that's why I'm saying skip I think it's gonna come down to a lot of it is gonna be their peak You know like who nails it you know who nails it and she does it we always expect like any time we do these predictions We're as like assuming everybody comes in exactly how they want to come in right? There are best their best in our head. Yeah, so all those would say the say those four who is more likely just your opinion Who is more likely to not come in peat? Not more likely but who's less likely to come in peat like Camembert because it's not it's not a hundred percent usually I would say Samsung Derek that's what I'm saying statistically I think the same thing. Yeah, I mean, how do you has you can argue say he was a half percent off at the last Olympia maybe you could not really but of you know maybe it's just because Samsung would better than he did the year before But Nick and Hottie seem to nail their peaks. I think their their coaches are very good at manipulating water They're very good at knowing exactly how much to fill them up before it starts to crowd separation Yeah, I think they're they're the odds on favor to nail their peaks. I think that Derek will have a better Probability this year working with the Ceto I think that they've gotten to learn his body a lot more now And I so I could see him statistically doing better with Chris Now with Samsung and here's the thing I feel like any time you critique the champ and maybe it's just Samsung But people get really defensive his wife isn't somebody who is peaked a ton of people over the deck Gades, you know, so Statistically I don't think it's been done as many times you know With him so I think that that net self could be a potential place That said it's not like she's dealing with anybody else. She's seeing him literally every For me that's when I was gonna so it could be me. I mean times as you peaked him it could be an advantage I mean, yeah, you mean where she making the calls like a babe actually you should do this You know what coach was saying and then right might have worked I mean yeah, yeah, I mean I'll give you a quick one. I mean years ago I don't remember I think it was either universe or I don't know but John Metos He was like last great for what she thinks you know Post or and let her let me know what she says, you know because he's like she looks at you every day She's the one taking your pictures like a dryer. You're not dry. You know, yeah the lighting's not great rely on someone that that sees you regularly But before we go off the next slide we didn't talk about Martin much and I think that's because Martin reached a new pinnacle last year and then I think we yeah, maybe all collectively Thought there's a little bit of a let down this year. He didn't necessarily move forward or he didn't necessarily Achieve that same Olympia peak and and you know that got me thinking about it when we're talking about who's likely to nail or not nail their peak And we've seen some up and down with Martin over the last, you know 2018 months so You guys think Martin stays in the top four five I think that no matter what it's gonna be really tough and for me to answer that question I want to see the next grouping too because some of those guys could be part of what's yeah You know push before you pull that up. I'll go out I'll go on the record side. I don't see them in the top four. I could see him potentially pulling the fist spot But I do not it just my opinion. I don't see him. Hey, I've been wrong before The viewers have pointed out that I was wrong before hey, the right piece So the right peak on him and the wrong peak on somebody else could change everything No question with the upside for him is just huge right? I mean the the potential is all there so Yeah, I agree Before we did move on to the next grouping though I did want to I want to throw this out there just one of our listeners, Dan So he's gonna call Samson Nick Hadi and if he makes it oh, how do if he makes it and then Derek and then Martin and I want to also also ask What do you guys think at home? You guys comment. Let us know and I'm gonna add to the right now I feel like you guys tell me if you've noticed this Body building fans I think are more passionate than they've ever been like You hear people arguing more now like I don't remember people arguing like I hate you basically If I think that's just social media and job Maybe that's what I'm only I can't disagree with you, but I think it will runs across the runs the game Well, you're right though Scott because there's so many body building podcasts There's so many body building specific pages that Fans from all over the place can go and argue about their favorite guy or you know it's funny because I read one where someone was trying to say like Nick's legs were shit And I'm like okay, wait shit like come on Like shit is like the guy who plays fourth place at the local show, you know, he doesn't have legs But to say something like Nick's legs are shit. It's like come on All right, this is the next year and these are guys that I mean one I'm really excited about to see how he does against these other guys is Earth You know, he just went to shows back to back He put on something like 30 pounds from his class at cutoff to what you see on stage in this picture and I want to say the first show He did I felt like while he was deserving to win They overcarb the shit out of him and he just kept a separation and then I think they learned for the second show Last week where he brought much better balance in terms of separation and dryness and fullness So I Mean I actually have a bet with one of my one of my buddies on where he's gonna place I won't say it out loud on this podcast, but let's just say I have them a lot higher than I think a lot of people do What do you guys think? I speak of myself once he gets out of the top five It's a roll All right, I mean because it's a man there What it is because there's also not that predictability as the as we move to like through tears We're also moving into I don't want to say lack of consistency, but not the consistency of knowing how they're going to show up So it makes it easier for me to say you know us to say wow we know how hot he's gonna show up It's gonna be pretty damn close to what we're thinking about in our head sure arguably with Nick too Okay, and maybe it'll depend if Derek is you know Dry enough for tight enough same same with SAMHSA But when you get down into the next tier then it's it to me. It's kind of a roll the dice. I mean It's it's gonna again coming down to the peak I think that top four top by I think the top four is unless there's just a shocking Oh my god type of thing I don't see the top four changing but that's just a study show create 10 doesn't just fuel your muscles It fuels your brain research links create into improved memory focused and mental clarity Especially while under stress and helps reduce mental fatigue supports learning and may even protect long-term brain health I order my creatin from true nutrition use code think it check out to get 10% off and support this podcast Power your body and your mind with true nutrition creatin by the way This is my actual morning routine mixing 15 grams of creatin into my oats no flavor no texture and hey Since I got married we stored in this fancy jar so it doesn't look like my wife lives with a bro But hey if you're single just leave it in the bag on the counter. It's totally fine Okay, well let's take a distraction because we've got some of the old guard in this group being between Said right I was said said right now between Brandon Curry a few Williams and and Edward, you know, so what do we do we think they're gonna continue sliding? I say yes, yeah, I don't I'm not saying I want that but I would say yes Let's we see a gunter shler camp You know someone show up all of sudden that is just like oh crap You know he goes from 10 to second or I don't know what the what the plays he was I've got too many shows. I've been brain for too many years before I mean unless it's just something extraordinary there I don't see anybody in this tier being catapulted up and being kind of a shocking like wow he killed it But well I will counter that because I think the one guy that could really Crack into maybe breaks some hearts in the top five would be good veto I was waiting for it. Sorry. It's not right man. That's what I was gonna you know no no no take it dude You keep going I was gonna because I was just gonna turn it to you and ask what did you think of good veto? Kind of lead me in that direction. Yeah, so we didn't get to see him on stage for the the Pittsburgh show and and he was training at my 40s It was kind of cool to see him do some posing and whatnot He's got an exceptional physique and The guy knows how to get peaked. I don't know who his coaches But I think I know it's a seat oh, sorry. Oh, he's not a seat oh yeah and Yeah, he won the what I say the Arnold Brazil right yeah and I look I look those pictures up because there's so many pro shows now That right aren't necessarily in the US that you forget that there's so many great physics and so many great guys that win some of these shows He's got a physique that if it's not this year that he's cracking into the top six I think it's very very soon he will be yeah He's his leg separation size muscular development His legs are crazy man. Yeah, he's got ridiculous like if if there's anything I'd like to see a little bit more thickness in the lats and again, you know like skip said picking apart Guys that are eons better than you Yeah, yeah, you know And I do want to point out actually after I put this together I did find out Raphael is out of the Olympia Okay, he won't be competing and I guess like an idiot I put such a susan up their twice I noticed that I wasn't gonna call you out Just give me better odds, you know, but I want to point out about sauce is I don't know what kind of physique we're gonna get out of him because He competed I think five shows earlier this year. I mean between Detroit Dubai New York He did I can't remember if he did Pittsburgh or not he did Toronto Meas it you can't five or six any cat coming up against like almost getting it almost getting it you know Trying to get the qualification until he did I thought he looked phenomenal at Detroit like like between Him and Barnock I thought they both looked incredible you know and and deserving to be in this realm But are you thinking that maybe he's not gonna be able to hold what he had earlier on? Well, I mean I've never competed in seven shows in a season so I don't know what it's like but I'm good again I'm not a professional in the level these guys are right? Yeah, so Maybe he has just structured his health phases his lifestyle with stress and everything that as soon as he got done Computing earlier in the year he really distressed got as a dream. He'll figure it out and Maybe made a little bit more progress. I mean Who knows this could be his best show ever? I don't know. I think one thing he did show is that a guy like him can take two years off from the stage and come back and hang with most of the best of them and And win shows and be in the top three and what four five shows So yeah, and here's the thing that I've kind of noticed about Sassan because I I knew him from you know back before He had always been and and I really see it now I don't think that he's got a push super hard with the supplements to be able to get where he's at I don't think that he's been redlining it and I think that that is you know obviously gonna work on his side to be able to continue doing it What's the name is Beating myself up over here the 2025 you're open what what what what's this? First first Colonsky okay Of all the physics up because I just could not get it of all the physics up there as far as just pleasing like if I said if God came down and said You have to choose someone's gift to change physics with I'd want that physique more than I do the other physics up there to me. It's and I understand I you know I see yeah, I'm just gonna be bigger you know things like that But that shape to me. I just look at something like that and they go so if I was gonna play favorite side say Man, I just I really want to translate well Do well, but it with more stuff. I know That's the government road. Yeah, yeah, for the last six seven years good good luck So that one's kind of I want to say it's up for grants, but who knows good how that's gonna play out I mean I want to see Dorian in the mix only because he has turned a corner just to see where are you gonna stack up? Against these other guys with having turned that corner and now your condition isn't a place that it hasn't been before So it's there's gonna be some fun in there I think hers has room you know To what you're saying Andrew both you guys he's got room like I'm excited I think we're all excited to see you know what he does in the next couple years The knock on Earth is his back, you know, he It's not wide enough yet from the back and it doesn't have the detail and The tissue coming out at you, you know from from the backside so and some of that could have been peaking You know, maybe just wasn't dry enough in the back area and some of these shows, but I think for him to Catapult as a regular say top six or first call out at the Olympia guy He's got a really he's probably got another 15 to 20 pounds of muscle. He's got to put on to really you know being that mix But what that said I got a question for you guys out of this group Who do you think places? I asked I think that Bonic has Traditionally showing a real I could see I could see Bonic doing I wouldn't be put it this way I wouldn't be surprised if Bonic did I know that's not a solid answer I mean, but I wouldn't be surprised if Bonic he's got the experience I know that he's older at this point, but I think he's just done a nail it Although I could I could see earth pushing him out from it and Brandon man I don't think that I don't think we're gonna see anything less from Brandon than we have in the past See I do I think I mean we all know father time is undefeated and I think we've seen His waist slip a little bit more you know pretty physique that won him deal in Pia Sure not the exact same physique Well he might be able to get a little bit drier a little bit more condition than he then he has in the past I think he's losing a little bit of that bubblyness and but and that being said I mean all respect and hats off to him for still doing this after so many years and He's got nothing left to prove it in the whole game of body building and he's obviously loves the sport that much to continue doing this So I'm happy to see him up there But I would agree I still think bonic might be the guy because somehow he I can see bonic in earth. Would you put yours up there with me? I's a bonic irrs in good veto. I think those are the three To watch out of this group and I don't know exactly I can't say where they're gonna go, but I think Then I put here I think you're right and I maybe put Brandon somewhere right after that He's on what's that oh, he's oh, Brandon Brandon Yeah, yeah, I put Brandon right after that then if that's if that's where you're going You know personally. Yeah, I just think he still has enough. I still you still has enough Yes, you guys a question when when competitors start to slip Let's say it's you know it's not just slip one year. It's you know it's a few years How many of those competitors Come in that and obviously we don't have the answer you know the the an accurate answer, but off the top of your head How many of those competitors actually show up and have a Wow not just the wild factor But they also place higher and the place higher is important because I'm gonna say come off top my head It is We you know one out of three hundred I mean it's it doesn't typically at once the slide starts and it shows any resembles of consistency. Yeah, there's really not The the only one that I can think of really and I mentioned earlier was was Guntar It that's the only one that I think that I can remember that I went wait wait what like when I heard it I went what and immediately went to try to find what the information I could to see what like how did this happen I can't think of of anybody else. Yes, they may Lose the title come back and get the title but After a few years when that slide starts to happen It doesn't reverse it so And if it does it's incredibly rare. I even asked the viewers like throw it at me You know Bus me on this one who who has done that who has reversed it and went like oh shit and had people go whole crap This is Similar but not exactly what you're talking about, but I consider what Sean wrote and did when in the Olympia kind of like that because he was kind of always tight casted into the second third place guy And then we saw all the pictures of him at the Pittsburgh pro Before it was a bodybuilding show when it was just an exhibition and we were all like oh this guy It's gonna fall to like seventh eighth tenth at the Olympia like he's so out of shape He lost so much muscle he looks he looks like a muscular guy with hits, you know I mean I remember looking at being like wow and then everybody just say so I'm is like being like not Lacks a day's a cool remember that yeah, and then you just realize no he's just a calm Collective Internally kind of brooding kind of guy and He'd been holding on to that that that that that taste and back of his mouth of of Phil Heath for a number of years and He put it all together man like even he couldn't even even remember he couldn't eat food He was drinking out of a straw because his mouth was wired shut and So I don't know maybe maybe maybe we see maybe I'm wrong and maybe Brandon Proo's me and skip yeah, and I'm not saying it can't happen all saying is When does it not very likely based on you know Always remember when Arnold came back in one of the people Exactly when they gifted it to him All right, yeah, I could see I'm with you guys I'm on all that and I listen to at home What did you guys think of that round? Where did you guys put those people and We've got our our next grouping here We just had Brett on the podcast this week I'm expecting him to be to do a lot personally You know I feel like we haven't seen him for a year nobody's talking about him because of that I think that he's definitely growing a lot since then You know he had the gut issues he pulled out of 23 and and came back it was like a year ago then that he competed at Legion And yeah, we haven't seen him since so I think 24 He was like just getting his feet wet again You know what I'm saying at Legion and now he's taking all of this time and him and Martin had been training He's you know Place it my heart for him. I want to see him like Jump forward at the top to the top of this, you know Let me also say this grouping I consider these Guys that A I didn't it's kind of a mix guys that I didn't think we're gonna be in the mix with guys that are wildcards and I consider Brett Tonyo and Jordan Hutchinson wildcards to where yeah, I need to see him next to the other guys on stage before you know Obviously, but it's like I couldn't in my mind's eye be like man is he a top 10 guys? He top five guys. He a top 50 you know I I will say this you know I think I can't remember his name. I'll talk my head the the Chinese me He won the the China pro he looks incredible. Leave a bull Browned physique but conditioning if he brings the same conditioning he brought to that show He will finish last or dead last or second last Yeah, his shape is crazy man. Oh he was he was he was over full, you know Incredible like his posing routine everything was bursting but he turned around from the back and there wasn't a glue line, you know, which that that wouldn't fly over here Rubio Nexila I just don't like his physique. I think it's wonky. I think And maybe it's just because his head is kind of small compared to his physique. I don't know but it's like it just doesn't flow The way I want to see it I guess and then Jordan I could see him. Oh muscle and people though like I could see He's you know really pushing for because I think too when he gets in I think that's a very exposing pose We have him in that front double bicep but get him in like a side chest and he starts stopping people You know and I'm saying when he can be fair I I did go on them NPC news and if they didn't have a front double from their last show I just picked the next shot that they had so most of these guys are in front doubles For Dorian I picked his best pose. I think it's most muscular pretty nasty when you see it on stage Yeah, I agree I think for Dorian just the genetic caliber that he's going up against he's gonna be in that that later call out Even if he reaches his best condition of all time Which that's not a knock on him. He's now he's he's done his career. He's done he's put on a hell of a ton of muscle He's reached his best conditioning recently. Yeah, and he's continued bodybuilding all the way through it's just When we're nuts to wall Yeah, you're running up against a wall of genetic talent at the Olympia. It's it's you know You've done what you done you've done you can do you know can I add to that just real quick in 2010 I Competed against him at the Rocky Mountain yeah, and he was natural and I was on a lot of drugs And I and I couldn't beat him so there's that And that's me really just kind of putting myself out there just going yeah, he's pretty good and I do suck So you know, I'm feed the trolls probably but that a lot of people don't know I mean he started off his career doesn't matter when it comes to where you're gonna place it Olympia. I'm just making a point that he's one of those guys much like a feel he could start it out with either being natural very very low Gear use and I don't know doring enough well enough these days because I'm no longer in Colorado To know you know what he has done since I've left I've been gone for quite a while seven or eight years now so I just want to see him standing next to people. I think yeah, I think you guys would agree if he were to make the top 10 I think he would just be all that be cool the side himself like oh shit, you know like wow So and I think a lot of us would who known him and You know see it come up and obviously his fans, but I like a lot of these guys Yeah, that person I kind of have that personal connection to him. Yeah, so I would love to see that There's a lot of these guys that I would love to see I mean I personally I could see I could see Quadzilla jump in forward. I could see him getting 6-7th even I could see here I could see I could see it. I like a bit on that one I'll make it right now. I could see I want to do rat jumping forward. I could see I can see breath 6-7 you know I can get an Olympic you know I could see Jordan jumping forward I could see him hitting the 6-7 I like I just I think it's gonna be I don't know I really don't know until until we see it but like these guys to me are very exciting because I can't predict it I can't call it man. I just can't to me the best dark horse or the I guess the Yeah, the best dark horse I would say is Jordan Hutchins in here And I'm bias I saw him twice in person beating a very good quitting In back to back weeks as well as a couple of Joe I can't remember his name the one that skipped shit all over But no I'll Jordan is huge on stage. I mean he looks like he's 285 on stage. Yeah, and I don't know if he's he might be 265-278 I can ask Chris but how tall is he? He's probably five 10 to five 11 is so little on his holer side there. Okay. Yeah, but it's Poison you know, but he but it like if you look he doesn't have like the link you're arm She's gonna have some nice to do all arms and every muscles in good proportion and Honestly, I think he still has more upside. I think he could probably fit like another 10 more pounds on that physique Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean and he's just a nice guy too Which is always nice when when you know guys that are doing well are nice people too So yeah, yeah, he's he's he's a pretty cool dude both him and Brett Bolton. I want to see them both I'll tell you what I'll I'll take you on a bet I want to see I think that Brett is my dark horse, so if you got Jordan as yours we'll see Let's see who you know and who knows about play things right, but who's higher yeah right who places higher Who's more the surprise how about that? Yeah, that'd be if I would be very happy for either one of these gentlemen Right if they did because I don't breath a great person too and Yeah, I mean just nice fallen his career over the years he it'd be nice to see him back on stages here So yeah, yeah, I think this is freaking amazing. Let me let me turn it into the audience again guys What do you think what do you think tell us tell us where did we go wrong? Tell us what we should have done instead and also tell us did we miss anything You know anything that we should have talked about right what about like Stefan is coaching what percent of the Kyson heel impede this year Who do you have he's got Martin he's got Martin he's got Brett He's got Bonic he's got earth You know it's like that's a pretty high percentile right yeah, you know that's nothing though compared to cuts with the men's physique He's got 18 of them holy crap your kid me man. He's got like like a third or more than a third of the men's physique division He's speaking in coaching for the show that's wild. I don't know if I could do 18 people in the same show I mean maybe you probably don't start there You know what I'm saying like I've done for five people in the same show and I can do that So maybe I'd have to do six before I could get to 18 you know what I'm saying It's got to be a record. I mean I peaked seven feet for our local show one time But it was legit not it was not the Olympia Yeah, and they all were in the exact same class where you know attitudes and and and Especially in men's physique division these tempers are gonna flare all you gave this guy five more minutes attention than you gave me and I saw you give him something extra what was that you know you didn't have me take it or whatever it might have been Yeah, I see those got a few guys too. He's got Derek he's got veto he's got Andrew Jack. Yeah Do we know his coaching hotty I don't is honey still maybe secretly coaching him. I'm wondering I Wonder I thought that because I think they just had such a good relationship and I think I'm just going off the cuff here Just from stuff I've heard and just what I've observed a seat of the guy on his ason as well. Oh, just ason. Yeah I don't I don't think honey wanted the pressure the stress of it and yet other business endeavors You want to get into but I think he does have a suppressor relationship with hotty Yeah, I would say that probably kept them now Maybe I'm wrong if someone knows in the comments please tell me I'm an idiot. Yeah. Yeah, I know kidding. Let us know I love hotty he's he's one of my favorites personally if if and listen if I know it's it would probably sound better If I were a lot more dramatic about it. I'd be happy to see any of these guys like up in that that Top six that we looked at any of those guys. I think would be incredible Do the fancier Jack to came in and he just blew everybody away like do you realize like how exciting that would be you know? I take it Basically what you're saying is we just want to see a really good show. Yeah, yeah, that's really what it comes down to and I want to see everybody nail it man We spend so much time talking about this stuff right and then You know day of the show. It's like what percentage of the guys actually bring it you know It's it's not always up there, right? Yeah We're the forward to the political Discord after I don't like who got he doesn't win now it's there's a lot focused around how do they get's really nasty I think that's from his people yeah, not his people but I'm saying his country I guess no question yeah I'm not saying he encourages any of that whatsoever. No, yeah You know I mean Everybody wants to win especially if you're one of those top five guys in you're looking the best you ever have and Everyone in your campus telling you oh my god you blew his of like the way your back is amazing You know it's it's got to be hard to sit there rationally be like okay wait a minute Let's let me really see what happened. Okay. I can see why I got third place, you know It wasn't a shot at how do you know No, I didn't think it did it's like Yeah, not sure we care about that Yeah, all right, I guess that's it that was literally a whole show of just freaking breaking down No sense getting into any other stuff right now.

a new golden age of bodybuilding. Yeah. I was like, he's, that's a great way to put it because like we're very lucky. This is a very exciting time. Champions getting beat. Like, Dynasties not happening. Mm-hmm. Right? Like, that is, is tough. Now, it is not the same as it was. And, and, uh, I mean, who knows what's going to happen in Pittsburgh? Hey, everybody.

You don't have to go to put up with anybody. You know, hey, how's it going, man? What's going on? How's your badge? You don't have that conversation at the store? I don't know. Just order what you want. Yeah, it'd be great. Okay. What's going on today? Well, we are going to run through the, everyone's favorite topic right now, which is the Pittsburgh Pearl. Because we are the show coverage specialist. Everyone knows this is where he comes for shows. We're like the hitman of show coverage. No, no, no, no. You need a professional job. Number one in contest coverage. Number one in contest coverage. Let's cover first, third and fourth today. Yeah. That's at least started first. So we get to first. Yes, right. Yeah. Very key. Okay. So of course, the talk of the town, Derek Lundsford is in the town. He posted it. We are in Pittsburgh. Yes. It makes it all real. Because I'll be the first to admit. I wasn't certain the whole time. Okay. You didn't know if he'd actually show up. Yeah, like I wasn't like, I know because it was like, you know, he's going to do it. And I was like, well, we'll see. And I know there's a hundred grand online, but I, I was just curious, but Chris informed me at, uh, Feebo that what we saw at the Arnold is nowhere near. How good he is now, which is scary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Chris did say that he said I was in Dirk's hotel room this morning. It's completely out of hand. And that was like weeks and weeks ago, right? So let's not forget also that he's seen a lot about a hand. So for him to say that. Yeah, that's also not forget that when he says that, it often like is. Absolutely. Yeah. So yeah. Um, of course, Derek, uh, there was a photo that got released, uh, of the back double, like five weeks out from the Arnold versus five weeks out now. Yeah. And it was like obviously condition difference because he was already in shape. So it's like the glutes are like already, you know, lungs for dish. Yeah. And everything like that. So we'll see what happens with that. But do you think he's the man to beat just because he's, you know, the Arnold classic champ? I think he's the man to beat because he's the best. There you go. Okay. If he's in his best, if he's a, if he's a 90% of his best, he's the best. Yeah. So so now how do you think? So what was the battle? You removed Derek from the show. Take Derek out of the show. Like before Derek said he was entering the show. And every one of course is talking about Nick Nick Martin. Right. Good veto. Yeah. But I feel like Nick and Martin are the, are the conversation because they were close at the, uh, Olympia. And then there were one and two at which show that the Derek New York. Yeah. The Nick one last year. Yeah. That was the show they were close. That was it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I know Nick wasn't in the Olympic. Yeah. He did, they were close and a lot of people even thought, I mean, I know that Dave said last week that he actually thought Martin won New York. He did. He didn't. Yeah. So and we've all seen, and then from New York to the Olympia, Martin made drastic improvements and has made even more than that sense the Olympia, which makes that show down very exciting. Yeah. And then it's going to be a killer show. I think, um, obviously they got the 100 grand prize money, but also as it's like, you know, because I've got some experience with promoting shows. This is going to buy far be their highest selling live stream. Yeah. They've ever done it from this show. Like this is going to be crazy because, uh, I mean, like, like, normally I wouldn't get up in the morning and pay for the live stream to watch Pittsburgh pro. Yeah. And are they doing a free live stream? Or are you paying, you got pay for it? I bet you have a paid for it. I was just seeing our live stream. I just wanted to find out if they did the free one, right? Yeah. I'll find out. Yeah. But if it is pay, you should pay because it'll be worth it. Yeah, because normally, you know, if you just sit on Instagram while you're eating breakfast, you'll catch pre judging because I'm out west, right? Yeah. So by the time I'm eating breakfast, pre judging's like, I'm getting all the, you know, the 4K videos coming through. But this will be worth getting up early and, um, and watching the pre judging because it's going to be mental. Do we have a full competitors list got? Okay, throw that up. Yeah. Throw it up. Yeah. It's on our chat. And the text. I said yesterday. Yeah. I think that that, you know, if we do have Derek taking first, if that does happen, I want to see how both Nick and Martin push him. And then we can't forget, uh, and of course, good video. I want to see how he fits into all of that. And I want to see how Crezo fits into all of that because Crezo's looking freaking crazy. VJ, I think, told me that I think Crezo might have had, I know Nick had an update picture. You said right, Dusty. Yeah. And good video had update pictures. I'll grab those in just a minute. Um, but, uh, I was from what I hear what, uh, VJ tells me that, uh, the insiders that are seeing Martin's pictures are saying that Martin is off the hook right now. So yeah. And I have to give, uh, Crezo credit because I've got a good friend of mine. He, he doesn't follow bodybuilding the way we do like contest playsings and the intricacies, but he's a big fan and a bodybuilder himself. And he, he keeps sending me clips of Crezo and he's like, yeah, this guy looks insane in the gym. How could this, this looks like a, this looks like the type of guy that no one could stand. Like what is going on. Have you seen this guy in real life? I'm like, he's pretty crazy. Right. But it's actually not small. It just looks small. Right. Yeah. He's got this, this, this look. What he's doing the one on a video of him doing the one arm row. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're just like, oh, god. It's, it's hard to imagine that that physique doesn't like just stop everyone all the time. You know, like if you were to take that look and go back and time, like it would just people's heads would pop off. He looks like AI, like if you were to tell me, like if you asked AI, like make a really crazy as hard to be a. European looking bodybuilder this. Yeah. Just with like off-avocial, blunky conditioning, but like way bigger. Yeah. And remember, Pevell, and make it look impossible, like something you really couldn't do in real life. I feel like you would get crazy. That's what it would pop out for us. Yeah. It's in my as my buddy says, he's got the dumbest arms I've ever seen. Those are nuts. Yeah. And he met that as a compliment, right? Yes. Everything negative is a compliment and bodybuilding. Yeah. Yeah. Disgusting. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. I'm definitely excited to see that I, like, I can't help it because I know all the guys. And I really want to see Nick. I don't get where he lands, but this, it was fun. I was telling Nicky the other day, I pull up a picture of him that he had posted. And I go into the comments of people like he should retire. Somebody still, are they still, is there people still saying that? Oh, yeah. And the thing, I'm like, OK, let's, let's just say you're correct. And he's not going to win the Olympia. So you're saying that anyone who can't win the Olympia should quit because he's definitely top five on the planet. Top eight at the very worst if he was off. That means you should quit. That's like out of all the bodybuilders that are doing bodybuilding everywhere in every gym in every city around the entire world. It's not my every stage. Yeah. So basically, if you can't beat Derek Lunsford, then you should quit bodybuilding. But now we're back to the days where Sergio shows up all by himself. Yeah. Is that progression? That's what you think about. You know what I mean? Mind blowing to me. And it does appear based on the pictures his waist is way down. That back lats spread taper looks like almost like he had surgery. And it's like, I don't arms look bigger because of it. Yeah. Slide to the, the lats spread shot. All right. There we go. Legs look, the sweep looks bigger. Yeah. You know, in those it can actually look at a photo and see shadows can see where his waist actually is. I mean, if that's retirement, then the rest of us should have never started. Yeah. I can't play football. Yeah. Yeah. Mind blowing to me. So we know it's going to be him, Martin. You know, the, the, the, the four we said all in the top group. My big question is good veto based on the photo that he posted front of a bicep. If he can land on stage and look like that, I don't know how that stands if you want to pull that up Scott. I don't know how that stands next to everyone else because it looks completely cartoonish. Oh, yeah. He doesn't look real to me. I mean, and I know that we've seen him leading the shows before. It's had that effect, but like, what that is just naughty. Yeah. He's got like a real hyper muscular look. Yeah. But he's a mass monster, but where's the waist? Why is it, and why is he vacuuming in on that shot? Like how the hell do you do that? You know, and then we're sitting here saying that can't win his mind bubbling. Yeah. You know, you can say he's insane. And then also, too, the fact that we haven't mentioned Bonak yet, who is one of those guys that I will admit we sometimes don't mention and then he comes in and beats half the guys we talked about. And we're like, oh, yeah, Bonak, two-time Arnold classic winner, duh, and then bring him up. Here's a bomb because you know how it is. You know how it is. You got to stand on stage and line up against everyone and things all of a sudden change. We go through this every show and everyone goes through this every show, right? Everyone makes their predictions and then there's that one guy that like, oh yeah, yeah, Synazista and the lineup he was three places higher than I had him. And you think about Martin of the Olympia? Like if you just seen Martin when he walked out alone at the Olympia, you weren't thinking top five. Right. I was sick and man he looks insane, but he's like one of the smaller guys. Yeah. And then you're sitting your head, right? Yeah. You start seeing next to each other and you're like, wait, why do my eyes keep pulling to him? Why did I think he was a smaller guy? Just kidding. Right. He's less. Yeah. And then I was sending he's like, oh my god, he's going to, he's going to place in the top five. Like you just got everything go shot. I was like, what the fuck. So, but that's one of the things I love the most. Like bodybuilding's boring when it's totally predictable. Yeah. It's those moments that make a show exciting, right? That was one of the things that made the Olympia super exciting was like, yes, I'm in one that was awesome. Like Sam's such a great guy wins. Really great top three and all that. But then one of the talks of the show was Jesus Martin. Yeah. You know, Martin shows up in like boom, boom, boom, just like topples a bunch of guys and bam, right in there. You know, and that final call out and all that stuff that happened. And that's when, you know, that's when bodybuilding gets really exciting. And I would love to see something like that happen at this show. Like, I want, you know, obviously everyone thinks, you know, Derek, Derek's hard to beat. But there's a lot of exciting shit that can go down like between the first call out and the last call out of the finals when they do that confirmation call out. There's a lot of guys that could get like, bump, bump, bump, bump. And there's no promises just because we think Derek is, you know, potentially going to be the best he's got the track record. You know, he's done so well. It doesn't mean that he's going to do it. You know, he could eat some Lacex fish and have a bad show. Yeah. I was wrong coach. Wrong coach for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody, do you think about those as same like coach when you rewind time when, when, when Gunter took fifth at the Olympia. That was a highlighted whole show. He was whoever went talked about. He took fifth. Yeah. He was the one that everyone was like, whoa, what? And then same thing. I mean, you know, last year at the classic bumps and wins, you expected that. But I would say half of the conversation if not more was Mike the bad ass. Like, yeah, where did you come from? Yeah. And why weren't we talking about you leading the show? And the fact that Chris, for the first time out of all of his wins, wasn't straight first. Yeah. And everyone knew it. They were like, holy shit. Mike, when I couple poses there, that was nuts. Yep. That was, that was, it's so fun. And, and I love it when bodybuilding is fun. Because I'll admit, old, grizzled, jaded. I've got to beat up heart gentlemen. Years in the game. And I don't mean my heart's healthy. I just, very, it's really that. Figuratively. Figuratively. And it's super fun when you get that little kid feeling again, like you're watching something new and exciting happen. And I'm glad that like, when Dave said on the show last week, that he thought we were going through a new golden age of bodybuilding. Yep. And I thought about that after that was actually one of the moments in the show I thought about afterwards when I was sitting there, having my meal. Yeah. I was like, he's, that's a great way to put it because like, we're very lucky. This is a very exciting time. Champions getting beat. Like, Dynasty's not happening. Right? Like, that shit is, is tough now. It is not the same as it was. And I mean, who knows what's going to happen in Pittsburgh? And who would have thought they'd go to Pittsburgh to see this shit? Right? Right? Because right, what was the prize money in Pittsburgh up till now? Was it like a 10 grand show? Yeah, it was. It was enough that it wasn't even the top list that people talked about. It was a tear-tooth show for the bodybuilding. It was a lot of good shows. It got one too. Someone correct me. But, and all of a sudden, it's a hundred K. And, you know, and it's right again, throw a bunch of money in people show up. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm really excited for it. And I do hope that there's some people that shock because that, as a fan, is fun. There's two scots. That's where it's possible. Scott, it's. Are you seeing two? Because I should only have a four, we got a four square. We got a four square on Mike. I don't know. I don't really have anything. Oh, now we got, there we go. Now you can see the middle. Oh, no, I'm in the middle. Now Scott's frozen again. But he looks good frozen. Oh, there he is. There he is. He's back. But yeah, no, I'm excited for that part of, I want to see, I'm really hoping as a fan to see good veto come in like I see in the updates because I haven't seen that. But if I see the front double that we just saw on stage, I don't care where he lands. Yeah, it's awesome. And then all of a sudden, people are talking differently every time he does a show. So yeah, it'll be exciting. And all of it leads to an even better Olympia. No matter what happens, even if he goes down exactly how we say, it makes the Olympia more exciting again and like Ron said, I actually, I actually told this to a guy at the gym that day he wanted to smack me. I skipped a couple of Olympia finals that I could have went to because I was like, I know who's winning. Yeah. And I'm good. I've seen, you know, so many of them. And now I don't miss the Arnold I'm going. The Olympia I go. Like, we don't know going into the show. I mean, whoever wins the Olympia, it still means the title changed hands because in everyone eyes now that Derek beat Samson, he's the best again. So even if Samson wins the Olympia, it'll actually feel like a trade of power again, even though he's the stand up. You know, Scott, you have to stop playing your random music during the show. Yeah. I was trying to move with the song that I was trying to pull up that post that you, it's great. You guys are looking at it. I figured I was going to try, I was trying to prepare in the background. I didn't next. Sigma. Yes. Look at him go. I had to turn the music down there before we get the amount of time. I just don't want to get a trade mark. I'm not. No. No one's CCR to come after you. Right. It's the last thing you want. John Fogretty calling you up. He's in my song. Beat Nam movie's only son. Yeah. There's no helicopter seen in this. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. I saw Derek also said that he wanted to be the first triple crown winner. And I'm like, oh, so are we now considering the Pittsburgh, the triple crown like with the oh and the Arnold. So that's what I was talking about. New York, right? Is that what you're going to say? Right. I would have thought if you would ask me what's the triple crown of bodybuilding if you had to build one. I'd be like, well, it's the Lempia Arnold and I guess New York pro. And I would put Chicago if you asked me for a fourth. You know, right, right. So now I guess the prize money. I mean, what's prize money in New York? Is it a hundred k 25? I guess it's not 30. I guess it's not the trifecta anymore. Well, then I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Yeah, I'm right. It was 25 last year, at least it was. So New York was always because that's the show everyone want. I mean, it is the draw. I still have like that that remember when it used to be called night of champions. Oh, yes. And it was like the like, you know, the night of champions rang and like the whole there was like a big deal to win that show. And it still is obviously to New York pro. It's the most vicious crowd in bodybuilding. They say, I love that. Yeah, I mean, I show up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. We're off the contest coverage everybody. No real predictions. Not putting our balls on the line. Moving on. We really didn't say anything like all. No, no. We didn't say Derek. We voted Derek. And then we also immediately said, but if he doesn't wait, I'll tell you what. I want to see Nick Walker earn the respect that he deserves. You know, you know, that's our earned. People just said that's what I want to see. I want to see him show people up. You know, I like all the guys, but you know, I know Nick had a freaking heart deal with couple, you know, issues that had taken him out. And he, he definitely deserves. I think more respect than he gets. So I want to see him up there. And I want to see him battle Martin and made the best man win. You know what I mean at the end of the day, if Martin wins, I'm not hurt by that either. You know, the best guy's got to take it. But I want to see a freaking battle show. I mean, like you guys were saying basically show me a battle. You know, and that I think it's going to be an excellent show no matter how it goes. What was this post you guys said? Was this you dusted you sent this one? Yeah, it does. It's so funny. And I just like, this is me times 100 every time Emily and I go anywhere. And we just went to Mexico right? So this happened. Yeah. This is, you got to put it up. Can you put it up? We're going to do it up to post. I'll throw it up in post. Actually, yeah, that'll be the easiest. Another jack to guy at the resort gym this morning. Head nod. So I'm at breakfast with our families. Head nod and what's up, bro? Ran into him again on the beach. Head nod. My wife. Who's that? Me. No clue. Just some dude from the gym. They just don't get it. It is a thing. Everybody who does knows that thing you do. You're like, so yeah. Yeah. I remember like, I remember we got to Mexico. We go down, you know, get the, get the sunscreen on. The Emily gets her chair. She's going to do the land, the sun thing that she likes to do that I can't stand. I'm like, well, I'm going to go do a lap around the pool. And I'm walking around the pool. I see a dude, Drake sitting there, Drake in a rum. And I'm like, and I can't really tell the guy, obviously, trains. He's like, you know, packs big arms sitting there. Head nod. Walk by and guy ordered him some food. Looks over at me. I'm like, that guy's jacked. He had nod. Like, just, there's like four head nods around the pool. I can't actually go. So did you make some friends? And they go, yeah. But you guys here. Yeah. Well, you know, I think I told you guys when we were on our trip in the Dominican, we're sitting up and they've got like a over top pool area. We just kind of chill. And we're sitting, I see this guy across the, on the same pool area. I'm like, that guy's got some size on him. Yeah. And she's out. Yeah. And he definitely looked out of place. And we, you know, mentioned it about 10 or so minutes later, him and his girl come walking up. He's like, you dusty hands. I'm like, yes. And he goes, oh, I watched this show all the time. We get talking, of course, he competes the whole thing. I'm like, yeah. Well, I noticed you. So you're, you're doing something very well. Right. And when I can see just your shoulders at the top of the pool, I'm like, that guy, he doesn't just train. Like, that's a body. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing I try to tell my clients like that's the goal. When I first started bodybuilding, you could see I trained, but I could have been an athlete. I could have been anything. And it's not until somebody started, like people started saying, oh, you bodybuild. Like, then I realized, oh, I've crossed that men doze alone. We're no one's ask. Like, obviously they can see I'm not athletic at all anymore. Yeah. So I've crossed the line where he's definitely not an athlete. Right. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's funny. And then especially the older guys, too. Like, like the one dude we saw at the resort was like, you know, he's probably five years older than me. Like he would have been into his 50s. Yeah. And, and, and, you know, we did the head nod like two breakfasts in a row. And then finally on the third day, he's like, hey, uh, you're you're you're, you're, you're, you're, you're mutant, right? And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but when he starts talking, and then he's like, oh, yeah, he's like, I actually knew Rich back in the day. He's like a living in a lay for like eight years. And he was telling me how he knew Rich at the gym. And then he trained at gold to bunch of times. And, and I was just like, yeah, it's fist funny. Like the, you know, guys had been around for a long time. Everyone knows someone. And, you know, yeah. We had a guy who commented on the show the other day. And he was like, hey, I'm from Siocet, New York. And I knew Dave since before Dave was big. Like he was scrawny at any blue up on his like, there was like a two-year period where he just exploded, you know? Oh, that's awesome. That was cool. You all love the throwback ones. I told you guys this, but I had to have mentioned on the show because that was cool. So two Saturdays ago, I'm training legs. And I see this kid on the pendulum squat. And he's starting to struggle a little bit. But I know he's got more in him. So I don't say, I just noticed he doesn't have any air pods in. So I come over and I just say over and show them, like, I got you, just keep jamming. So we force that a couple reps. And then as soon as he racks it, I just walk away. I start my next set. And I, I look at him and he's getting ready to get started. I said, hey, give me a minute if you want another spot. I'll, I'll spot you through another. He's a correct cool. So it was like his drop-back set. And at like 10, he's struggling. So I push him through like five more reps. Like it's barely moving. I'm giving him like a pound and a half of help, you know? And he racks it and I walk away. And then a few minutes later he walks over and he's like, I listen to the show all the time. And I'm like, oh, God. That was like, well, you can now tell everyone that I completely ruined your workout. I have no idea how many reps you were planning on doing. Yeah. And. You might have an injury you're dealing with. But now it's 10 times worse. Because I just, thanks. Yeah. I know. I was like, I got a save. I was like, all right, well, I'll forever remember that I didn't allow Doug to even let me know what he was looking for. I just made him do more. Yeah. That's funny that you mentioned that because I actually like, you know, when we opened the gym, I had a habit of like, right, we walk around the gym and I'd see somebody at Governight spot them. Okay. Yeah. And then I started thinking like, not everybody wants four strokes. Ha ha ha ha. I'm really hoping that Doug wasn't leaving reps and river. Reserve. Yeah. I'm really hoping that he's going to start the owner made me do it more way. Yeah. One strike. Some guys following a five by five program. Yeah. It's totally screwed up as an app. It's like, that was me right there. Yeah. You know, he did. He's like, fuck, this order keeps coming over. Just destroying me and my volume, my output goes in the tank. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really hoping that Doug wasn't leaving reps and river reserve. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know, it's over. I. I. Yeah. I just leave people alone, unless I hear a screaming and there's like someone trapped under something. You know, you still come over, are you doing a negative or should I actually take this off? I help. I don't want to like it, too. You know, yeah. Yeah. One star. The moment he said that I was like, and I actually didn't ask. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Things to be aware of. I have to throw something out there, guys. I have to say to the audience. Everybody listening. First of all, we appreciate having you guys here. We need questions for the next shows. So hit us up. Leave us questions. Everything you got. We had a bunch of them dusty from you. You because so when we do the interview shows, we usually don't get them a lot of listener questions. So we didn't have a lot this week, but I dug back. And I looked at that thread that you posted on Instagram, the other week. And I grabbed a bunch of those because we like, I think that you put that thread up. And then we didn't answer any of them. Do you remember that? It's kind of like our contest coverage. Ask for something and don't deliver to what we do. So I would ask you guys. I want to ask you guys this one. This is one of the listener questions. How would Justin Compton do in today's lineup? Imagine him coming into Pittsburgh, Pro. Like at his best. Extremely well. Yeah. I consider Justin Compton. He is in the same category to me as Mike Francois. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. I'll see where you're going. We're like unbelievable potential. And career just hit other things going on. Gonna shut it down. It's probably making way more money now. Probably smart move. Saving money. I'm not bodybuilding. Yeah. They're saying my not bodybuilding. Great guy. You know, everyone likes Justin Compton, everyone like Mike Francois. He's very similar. Obviously Mike had like severe colitis that like engine his career forcibly like yeah hospital surgery, life changing sort of thing. And and Compton is spoken about why he shut things down too. But you know, Compton's, you know, they come to do it great now. I mean, I'm at spoken to him for a while. But he's in that same category where like, you know, we won't, we didn't get to see Compton win an Arnold or anything like that. But he was that type of bodybuilder to me. And and a great guy too, like I remember seeing him in the most I talk to him was in Australia one year because he was down there for the Australian Arnold. I think he was, I don't think he competed. I think he was a serve for the expo. And I saw him at the gym and he was a group. He was a coolist dude. And spoken to him. I was spoken to him other, you know, obviously through our technology. Yeah. But I consider him to be like that. Like we'll never really know what he could have done on stage. But extraordinarily dangerous. And, you know, conditioning obviously off the hook all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say it's funny that you said Meg Prince Wobby because I was thinking Dennis Newman. Right. Even the only thing I got to throw in there is because I hate the word potential. Yeah. Because potential usually means you have a nun shit. And that's that's that's not the term I'm using in this regard because he was realized his potential is anymore time to continue doing the path he was on. Every time. Yeah. And that's the difference. Like I usually consider potential to be a negative word. But in his case, the only thing that stopped the media rise that he was on was that he stopped. Don't care why he's he's chose to stop. But it wasn't like, oh, if he would have done this or stayed more thought, it was not that it just more time. You know, I would not blink to assume at a healthy version that would have kept going. Would have won an Arnold Postman Olympia. And I mean, he's young enough. He could get still be bang. And so I agree 100% I think sadly we did not see the best that we would have seen. And that's mind boggling because he was so good. You know, so yeah, he'd do awesome. And that's I want to just segue real quick, Scott, while we're on the subject because Dave said something that rang to me, not because I've never thought of it. But because I say it all the time, it's that when we asked him about the thing that separates the best guys from the rest, he said consistency. And it blows my mind. I want to talk about with you guys because I know you guys can share the same point. I have multiple athletes with very big goals, big aspirations. And it's done's me how you can have a goal of winning an overall or turning pro. And simultaneously, because that's one of the things I ask in the check-ins, like, what are your goals? I want to show it to him, goal. I mean, what's your be-hag? Is that call your big hairy ass goal that maybe you can't reach for your chasing? And those things are listed and simultaneously multiple times a year, I get how many meals were missed, how the training was a little down this week, how they did this. When he said that, I just shook my head and I actually responded to one of my clients, I said, you either need to change your goals because your output does not match that, or you need to change how you're approaching your bodybuilding. Yeah. David said his accurate, like, when I was competing, I knew what I was capable of. The end goal I knew was not phenomenal, but I also understood the only way to get to the best I could be was to be insane. So when he was like, oh, I didn't miss meals for years, I'm like, need it. I didn't have down workouts. I was obsessed with getting this done, and I think there's some confusion with some people that Derek Lundzford's life is somehow easy to get all this done or anyone. So I'm like, no, when I was turning pro, I had five retail stores and was waking up at four in the morning and going to bed after training at midnight. And that's not like, oh, I'm hardcore. That's just how many hours were in my day. It was the only way to get it all done. And you know, like you were saying, Ron, with Ron, it never occurred to me that missing a meal was even a plausible option. Yeah. And it blows my mind how if you don't get that every single day, every single meal, every single workout matters. And how can you have this goal? And if you're doing what you should be doing, your goal should be slightly out of the reach. And you should be hunting it down. Then how can you think that you're going to not do everything every day and beat people who are genetically better than you? Yeah. Not going to happen. Yeah. And it's just one of those things where, and I don't think that in for those are listening, I don't think there's anything wrong with having that realization and saying, those goals don't mean enough to me. I'm not willing to not have a week off or miss a meal because of work or whatever. That's okay. I'm not Mr. Hardcore. I think it's just important that you're a realist and say, yeah, I'm not going to do that. Yeah. And then you can, you know, change your mind and say, okay, I need to lower these goals. Maybe my highest goal is just to state level when. Cool. That might be feasible with the way you're chasing. But these win a pro card, win an overall, that ain't going to happen. You know, I mean, I got five local guys here who don't miss meals ever who train at three in the morning because that's the only way they can get it done before work because they got kids at home and they don't want to become an home at 10 pm and not seeing their kids. How are you going to beat them, let alone genetic mutants who also don't miss meals? I mean, Dave was a freak. Yeah. But he never missed a meal also. Yeah, the whole like, you know, talent versus hard work is like, well, there's talent and hard work in those guys. Yeah, he's just not going to touch them. Yeah. So yeah, I just thought that was a simple point. The day may that I feel it should be played over and over and over like consistency. That's the magic. You know what people ask me? I mean, how many times do you have a bad work out? I'm like, I can't even remember. Yeah, having a bad workout. Also, too. What's a bad workout like because when the guests are the right literally, yeah. So I think another thing too is the ability to make mental pivots with how you perceive what's happening. Like if if I think okay, well, I didn't have bad workouts. I'm like, well, I had workouts that I could have perceived as bad. Yeah. But I shifted my perception and I changed gears and I did something different and I managed to get a really great pump that day. And then I didn't think of it as a bad workout and then it didn't like my mindset wouldn't go there. Right. So it's also your ability to control your own mindset. Like, you know, maybe I went to the gym one day and you know, I had like a week set on my opener. But instead of just letting that get me down, which I see, I see this from people like, oh, I brought you down on my incline today. Fucking shit. I'm like, I never did that. I'd be like, okay, I just had a bad set of inclines. I got five instead of eight. I'm going to change gears. I'm going to go over to this machine. I'm going to blast sets of 15. Yeah, blow the shit out of my packs. Then I'm going to do that fly machine that I never use because I actually kind of like it. And I'm going to smash some sets on that and finish with another press. And then how is your workout? And by the end of your workout, you got this crazy upper, plexure blowing out and your fucking triceps are blowing out from doing tries and you're like, awesome. Dude, an awesome workout. Dude, I've, I've worked with people occasionally. One guy, I'm think of in particular. And I think he's changing that perspective now. But he would like, he would get down on himself. And I almost feel like bodybuilding became a, like, it would not be a fun thing if you're constantly disappointing yourself. And like, oh, I didn't get those reps. And I failed here. And I like that perspective better because you're constantly like you said, you're spinning it into something that ends up being a good thing, you know? And I, I, I have to touch on my hobbies here because I thought about this the other day. I, that skill that I took and I don't know if I learned it from bodybuilding, but I definitely did 30 years of it in the gym. But that that perspective, shifting perspective practice I had with all of those potentially bad workouts that weren't bad workouts. I, I find myself doing that now with my hobbies. Like I've got the bad hip right now. By the way, I'm looking, I'm talking to surgeons about hip replacement. Oh, I've got. I've got like, consults coming up and stuff. It's really, really, I haven't really mentioned. It's really interfered with my riding. Like there's a bunch of tricks I was starting to learn. And I can't really lift my knee up high enough right now without some pretty bad pain. So I have to put those tricks all in the back burner. So what do I just not know? I go out and I practice other things learn other other skills I can learn. Why don't I have to lift my knee? Yes, there's a whole bunch of other skills. So let shift your perspective, learn other things get better in another way. And then when your hips better, you're going to have, it'll all come together. It's just a patient's game. And then same with guitar. Like I'll have a session where something I'm working on. I just suck. I just have trying to learn a new song. Just like my favorite fingers aren't listening to my brain. And I just so I'll just, you know what? I'll put on some stuff that's easy. Crank up the album. It just jam with an album for like 30 minutes. And then I come out with a big smile on my face. All this positive bio stuff happening in my brain from having a blast and jamming along. And I'll turn it into a great session. And as a result, you're going to want to do it again versus you. Have enough fails and enough times that are relevant. Why am I even doing this anymore? Yeah, I'm like getting a stuck on like man, you know, like that sort of shit. It's practice to be able to keep a positive perspective and find something positive to go to. And you know, Emily would be like, oh, I should have come out of the office and like how was it? You know, I've been in there jamming for 45 minutes. I'm like, oh, it's awesome. Yeah. You know, the other thing about the body-reeling side, though, with this whole thing is back to the consistency. If you're food and you're water and you're sleep and all those things are correct, the odds of having this workout that you have to adjust are lower. Yeah. Because usually that's something I can ask a client like, well, what, what'd you do different? Oh, you know this morning, I didn't get my water in, but okay, there you go. Yeah. Like that's half the reason you were weaker. Like how'd you sleep last night? Well, I was stressed. Okay. Now you can't always avoid those things. But when you're consistent, then the odds go lower. Like if somebody said to me, on May 14th, 2012, you trained back. What'd you do that morning? I could tell you. I don't need to know the day, it's because I did the same thing every day. Well, over the same time, eight the same meals, right? The same liquids, everything was the same leading up. So all the things that I could control were the same. Yeah. And I feel like that's a big missed part. It's like, you can't necessarily control if you got a bad night's sleep. You know, that's, I mean, that just happens. But if you're letting a bunch of other things be, everyone's so worried about exactly how they're performing a rep, but they're not concerned about how much water they drank and showed him they brought him before they went to the gym, if all that stuff's the same, then the odds of even half in a half this twist in your workout get lower. And then when it happens and it's so rare, it's a lot harder to get frustrated. You know, because when I go to the gym, like you were saying, Ron, if I could tell, like, okay, I mean, we've all been there. I always use the deadlift as an example. I put 135 on the bar. Sometimes it feels like I'd never done it before. I'm like, why is this awkward as hell? And then sometimes I pick up 135 and I'm like, it's going to be a good day. And people like, how do you know? I'm like, because the bar moved flawlessly, the very first time I pulled it, which means as I go up, that's going to continue happening. You can't control that, but on the days that are, the days that are off and everything you've controlled, the cook control is there. It's really easy. Oh, you know what? The universe is decided today's workout's going to be a little different. So we're going to beat the shit out ourselves with 405 on dead today. Because I already know what'll happen when I get into 600 pounds. And I'll get frustrated. So I'm just going to skip it and not do that. Like you said, and not allow my very first movement to derail. Or I'm sure you guys have had the experience where your first movement's a little off. And you're like, ah, if you've gotten your head and said, oh, it's a bad workout, well, it's going to be one. But next thing you know, your second movement just moving like butter. And you're like, oh, well, that's good. I guess it was just the inkline was awkward today for some reason. You know what I mean? So I definitely think you're right, Ron, is it's how you preface it, but also when you control all the things that you can, the odds of even half and do that are really low. And I think that's why I didn't experience my most times, because it was all controlled. And anything that popped up was only things out of my control. And I tell people that all the time, like, if it's out of your control, fuck it, it is what it is. But if you're failing on things that you can control, well, then fix it. That's not hard. That's not hard. But yeah, I was really stoked when Dave said that, because I was, I love that he said one word and went silent. He's like consistency. And then just sat there and I was like, then he went into it. But I'm like, yes. I pulled out a couple good ones from the, a couple more good ones from your, your thread dusty. Here's what I wanted to hear what you guys had say. When did the behind the neck press go extinct? When Kevin the Roni retired. Yeah. The skip still doesn't skip gloves the behind the neck press. I mean, he's wearing the team Michael sweatshirt too, which by the way, Ron, he told me that the same owner from all the way back in the day still owns team Michael still owns it. Still selling the, what did he call it? The, the big top shirt. You could still buy the big top. Yeah. It's not too late, Ron. You can get an extra large big top instead of a four X. So, I'm still a double X does to know what I'm going to do. I think I'm, I think I'm, I'm genetically a double X. I think I don't think your bones aren't going to be way out. I think I'm going to get narrower than I am now. That's funny. When did the behind the neck press? Yeah, Kevin the vrong was a big one. When the, when when he stopped making a V stop doing 405 behind the neck. Yeah. I, I still remember like when I stopped doing them. I was, you know, I started training in 1990 and behind the neck presses, where a thing, everyone's behind the neck pressing, right? Yeah. And I remember I was training with my friend John and Australia. And he could do like three and a half plates behind the neck press. Like for reps like I don't rack it like go to the bar, he'd crank out like six, seven, I'd spot him for a couple. And I remember it was at old school shoulder press, right? With like the, the seats like straight. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and there's no railing on the front of the machine, right? It's just like you unrak it and it's, you are a loan in space with that above, above your head, right? There's no safety rack. Yeah. And, uh, and I remember I'd press with him and, and I could do like a plate and a half behind my head. Yeah. And, you know, maybe two plates for five or something like that like heavy ass set. And I just remember I'd smack my head at least once every set like bang. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, Jesus. Like yeah. And it would just never like I never had the mobility, even as like an athletic, more athletic young guy. I was gonna say, I don't know any big guys anymore. They're telling me, I'll notice they're like, I can't even squat with the regular bar. I have to use a safety squat bar. Try getting those arms behind the neck, you know? Yeah, yeah. Like I couldn't even do it now with an empty bar. I couldn't even put, you know. So, uh, I'd say like early to mid 90s, I stopped seeing anyone behind the neck press. Yep. Yeah. And I think probably Dorian's video came out too in 97. And he had the front military Smith. Everybody started doing that. And I think that was like the final nail. And the coffin, you know. You know, that was probably it. Also after Dorian's video, after Blood and Gets came out, another thing. Bodybuilders greatly and largely reduced how much they were squatting. No. It was hacking, like pressing Smith machine squatting because everyone was on the Dorian plan. So like the barbell squats really like went to like a small number of people. And then of course, what happens after Dorian, Ronnie wins. Yeah. And then everyone starts squat front squatting, parking lot lunging. It's, people don't realize how those videos absolutely change training. Like every time a new Mr. Olympia dynasty happened or like Dusty said, LaRona's videos had those crazy behind the neck presses and stuff. It affected the whole bodybuilding trend thing. Look at the, that's what it's crazy. Man, it's looking today. It's still happening, but it's not necessarily the Olympia. It's like the influencers, which I'm sorry. I'm going to call Jordan Peters an influencer. You know what I'm saying? Look at how many people are doing what he does now. You know. So here's a little message. I told this to one of my guys and he was like, really? Because he's younger, right? And I said, until Jordan Peters came along, I never saw a bodybuilder on the doctor machine. Ha, yeah. Like I want the young guys to know that like Dorian, Kevin, all those a whole 90s era. Yep. Then you, then you got NASA, the mass monsters into the 2000s. Jay, all those freaks that came in that era, Phil Heath, 7 Olympias, straight. Every single guy, leg pressing, hacking, squatting, lunging, extensions, curls, stiff leg deadlifts. Yep. That is it to know, a doctor and a jimpin. And then Jordan Peters started doing a doctors. Yeah. And everyone started taking, oh, if I want to increase my a doctor's size, I have to do a doctor machine. Yep. But man, nobody did them. Like look at NASA's a doctors. Look at every, don't you know, you have to look at the guys at one show. Look at the guys that are in like 10th, 9th, 8th. Yeah. Look at their doctors. They all huge legs. Yep. Squatting, pressing, moving their feet around on the leg press. Yeah. Moving their feet around on the hack, lunging, especially, single leg squats in the Smith, all types of stuff. Not a single guy used the a doctor machine. And now it's like a doctor's in a jimpin. Yeah. And I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying you guys need to understand this is brand new and completely isolated to your generation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why a doctors have a 200 pound stack on them because they're not made for JP. Yeah. It didn't even dawn on a doctor manufacturers that JP was going to add 300 pounds to his a doctor machine. Right. Which then leads to me. Now we've had two broken cables on the doctor because of jimpins. And we want to be a bodybuilder from the jim, obviously. But guess how much the cable on the a doctor machine costs? Yeah. What are those run for? It's not a normal cable. It's not like I just put a cable on and crimp a loop on it and attach it. Yeah. It's a custom cable with a ball in it that has a 50 ton press that customizes it with the fixture already on it. You have to order it from life fitness 650 bucks every time someone breaks that cable. And so someone broke at the other day putting like three plates on it. And then it's down for two weeks because I got an order of cable from life fitness. And then all the bodybuilders are complaining and when's it? Dr. Get in fixed. I'm like you guys this is not a cable stack with a press down on it where I just go crimp a cable and it's fixed. I had an order of cable. And they're like oh it's 50 I see guys on Instagram. I had $15 cable big deal. No no it's a $650 cable. It's a custom cable. That's not a normal cable. And so now we don't allow Jimpins on the doctor anymore. And the amount of heartbreak. And it's like dude, nobody used this for that for like the entire time. Until recently. And then also when you break the a doctor and it's down, take of all the girls now. Like two and a half weeks worth of female members are like the doctor's broken. Dusty that. I trigger him by bringing a behind the neck press or did he trigger himself. It was a spiral. I'm glad. I'm just glad he was triggered. That's all. I just want to let the guys know. It's not a simple as it sounds. I saw a video the other day. I'm a kid doing a plate loaded row machine. Okay. It was an old Icarrean plate loaded row. Great. I like those. Yeah. Yeah. But we know the Icarrean machines are stacks for a little like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's got the full stack on. And then he has three, 45s on the Jimpins. Ooh. And he pulls on it and it snaps. And he's like, oh, getting too strong for the Jim. And the comments are like, as it, you know, someone says like, oh, as a Jim owner, that's really annoying. And the number of people that literally go shut the fuck up, I pay my membership. You can fix that cable in two minutes quit bitching. Whoa. That's the type of respect Jim owner's get from some of these guys. Well, fair. Listen to be honest. That's the type of respect anybody gets online. If you don't write with them, you know, right. And that's the way we react now. Right. And it's one comment was like, that takes three minutes to fix. Yeah. Of course. If you have cable on hand, maybe you're just ran out of cable because someone broke 10 other machines and they're waiting for cable to arrive. So like, I just, as a Jim owner, some of this stuff people sound like. I think you guys have no idea. Now that machines out order for at least a couple days. And which annoys a Jim owner because we want everything to work. Right. Yeah. And also two men, why don't you just use a chess supported T bar? Yeah. You could fill it up. Put seven plates on it. No cares. Why do you have to use a cable machine and put three, foury, fives on it? And like, hey, I used to put a plate on a lot of stuff. We used to take an extra pin, put a plate on the pack deck, put a plate on the leg extension. I remember those days. Yeah. But three plates. Now you're like literally almost doubling the stack, right? It's going to be a problem. Well, the funny thing to me about the the Jim pens is, I found with certain machines because the the weight actually moves that I don't even get the weight I think I'm getting because now the negative is dragging. So I'm not feeling that. So I've actually found on some pieces. I have to keep it with one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And just get more reps because it doesn't work out. Like I'm like, oh, I actually get more out of doing a single plate on this. Yeah. Where it's not throwing it off. If I'm not lucky enough to like some of the pieces I have, I can put a Jim pen on each side and balance it out. Yeah. Right. But if you can't, it's like pay attention to both your e-centric and concentric on the pole and you're going to realize this isn't benefiting any of the stack racks on the lean and drag down. Yeah. And then also two one trick is you put the Jim pen as low as you can. Yep. So there's less tilt to the stack because if you have it up higher, it's going to really tilt more. But so some of the machines like some of the presses, if you put the Jim pen really low and you put one plate on and then put a band on the handles. Yep. You've got the plate and a band and now you can overload it without like just loading the stack with plates. Okay. Yeah. So you just gotta try to, but yeah, just think about think about the Jim pin stuff's getting a little out of hand with some of the kids that are doing the five rep everything, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that by the way. We can edit that whole thing out Scott. Sorry. Dude. No, there's the best part of the show. There's going to be below one that they're waiting for the rant. Actually, I wonder if it's up one second. Scott, I need to see some of my descendants. All right. Do you, and I hate to tell you your membership, your one membership is worth less than 25 to 35 women that complain about the machine being broken. So you started to do the math. Scott, I'm going to send you something to your Instagram. Perfect. I can pull up Instagram easier than I used to now. So yeah, you pull this up. I want people to see this. It's it's very valuable information. No, all right. All right. Give me just a minute gentlemen. I think I know what this is, Dusty. All right. Yeah. Are we doing this? What was the, we're definitely doing this. Let's see it go up. I can go to this now. Here we go. There we go. That's that good. I'm so waiting. That. How much is my band actually assisting? Yes, we talked about this. Braden did a video to show everyone. Oh, wow. How much the band is actually helping you when you load it up on this? This is pretty cool. Yeah, he does a great job with this video. I reposted it. This is my training partner, Braden. And this is his home gym and his garage. That band is giving you 155 pounds of assistance at zero. Now, also keep in mind as it stretches and gets lower. Yeah. It's even more than that with no band when he pulls on it. So, so while that's the right type of band. He's got the right type of band done. So it takes 40 pounds off the bottom. It de-loads. Yeah, he's got the right type of band. Oh, I see. So he's seeing like what the sled weighs out the band. Yeah. And then he figures it out, right? I want to know how much my body master's sled weighs. Because it's freaking heavy. Real heavy. So he's got the light band, like a lighter band. So it's zero at the top because it's got slack. Right. And then he drops it down and he sort of estimates like for his high short, where he actually bottoms out. So he pulls it up to about. He's like I'm about there and he weighs the sled. And it's a 40 pound difference. Yeah. With the lightest band. With, well, it's not, yeah, it's his lightest band. But you can go smaller if you want it, yeah. But it's a great way to show people. Because I see guys using the thick band. Oh, yeah. And I started using the band at once for my knees later in my career. And it definitely helped. But how you set the band is game changing. Yeah. If you're putting a huge band and then you're wrapping it long ways like he did there, it's giving you like three plates aside. I mean, it's obscene, you know. So be mindful of that when you're loading the machine. And I still am and I don't need to do it anymore even with the knee. Like I don't have to put the band on. But there's something to note when you're adding that. Don't get overly caught up and how much you're doing. It's assisting a lot more than you think. I put bands on my chest press. But the opposite way to resist. Yeah, yeah, to make it harder. And it changes the strength curve. You can get like the little short elite bands, like a little red minis and throw that on your hammer strength press. And it'll completely change that strength curve. It's kind of cool because it's still going to be easier in the hole where it's the hardest. Right. But as you push up and you get stronger, it gets harder too. I love doing that. I mean, it's not like I'm saying like all you gotta do that. If everyone would be your best. But if you get like if you've done 10,000 reps this year on that machine, you know what I'm saying? Like you want to do something a little different. It's fun to throw the band on there. But yeah, it's less of a thing than it was. But for a while there like the amount of people that were banding like everything that was in the middle of the year. Oh, yeah. I'm like, not to make it easier. Yeah, they're misunderstanding. Yeah. Like yeah. I think I actually Luke started the banding because that's where I got it. I was like, you know, I am doing 10 plates aside. It probably is a good idea to get that little assistance at the bottom. I knew I was getting extra reps because of it. But I was like, yeah, you can see he explained it to me. He's like, yeah, with the knees of that depth going below parallel. I was like, that's probably a good idea. And I definitely saw the reps go up. But I could see how over time that was it was worth it. I was like, that's fine. Yeah. So the way I remember John said something once. Meadows used to say the purpose of changing the strength curve is to make the whole rep harder technically. Right. So like, you know, intensity is how much work can you do in a period of time. Yeah. So if you think about your rep and if half the rep is really easy and half the rep is really hard, if you make the whole rep equally hard, then you've raised your intensity in his mind. Right. Right. Yeah. So that was that was so you want to band enough to make the rep feel equally hard all the way through. You know, as you get mechanically stronger, the weight gets heavier and it stays equally hard all the way up. Yeah. So that was the thing that never got lost on me, but clearly got lost on a whole bunch of people. Like, Braden put that post up and he says frustrating because he gets messages from people. They're like, so it makes it easier. It's like, that's okay. Okay. And not really what I was trying to point out here. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I used to reverse band that I loved doing was the squat in a rack. Yeah. And that was when I got from John. It was back. And I couldn't afford it at the time. VJ bought is like right when I started training with VH. And he bought the the Mountain Dog Elite Band set. So it was like four different sets of bands, you know? And so we're like, you know, John sees some bands where you use bands. We're banding everything. And I found the, so we'd hook it at the top of the squat rack. Yeah. You could go from bottom up right and make it hard to let down. Dang it down. And it would use like the, I can't remember what was the green band though. So it was like a narrow band, but it was stronger. And I could get like an entire additional plate. And I would feel that plate almost all the way down. And it was still like hard as hell in the hole. But it was like no stress on my low back. Or you know what I mean, no, it didn't load it a bit. And then as you're driving up, oh my god, like it got harder than I had ever been able to handle. You know what I'm saying? Like two like yeah, two thirds. Well now your handling actually played. Yeah, two thirds. The way up. Yeah. It was cool. I like doing that is fun. So I remember one of the funnest things I ever did squatting was right when all that was coming in. I don't know what year that would have been. Is that like oh. Yeah, right there. There did 12. Maybe that 12 liter. And they were there. 13. So I was training at a gym that had a bunch of chains. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And so I would hook this small chains. They would hang down. And then I would have the bundle at the bottom. Yes. Right. And of course, most people didn't know of any idea what to do with chains. We were just hanging a chain. And it wouldn't even touch the floor. Yeah. And they'd squat down. And it was like maybe like six or seven links would coil. And they'd stand back up on my. It's like literally a 10 pound. Yeah. If that. Yeah. The point is you want the cluster of chains. Is it the bottom to kind of always touch so they don't swing. Yeah. Right. You know what? I'm swinging around. You want them to kind of always just have enough drag on the floor that they stay still. But then as you squat down like 50 pounds of chain on each side would d load to the floor. Yeah. In the bottom third of the wrap. Right. Yep. And I remember I figured it out. I got all the links. I'm counting links and writing it down like K22 links down. All right. I got six six cluster. You know, three clusters looped on each side. 10 links hanging. And I would like I made the notes on how I like to squat. And I was squatting with chains for a little while. And it was like fun. It was fun. It was just, you know, there's a feel to it. You know, as you come out, you feel the mload onto the bar and you have to drive through because you know what's going to get harder. So you're trying to accelerate. Which is also by power lifters would to help build acceleration and speed, right? R speed. So it was fun. And then one day, I was coming up out of the squat. I had three and a half plates aside with about 50 pounds of chain on each side. Okay. So it was about a 450 squat. Yeah. And I was about 14 weeks out from my show. Okay. I was just started my prep. And I'm coming out of the hole and as the chain loaded onto the bar, loud crunch in the front of my quad. Oh, pom pom. And I got to the top and f***ing dump the bar. And I, and right at the top of my tier drop, about halfway up my leg on the inside of my thigh, the top of my tier drop, my quad was just spasm spasm spasm spasm spasm spasm and I had to rub it out and hurt like shit. Sure, shit. I tore some fibers. It didn't look good. That wasn't the, that wasn't the tear. That wasn't the tear. But that was one of the, that was a tear I had on my other leg. It was a tear I had on my, on my right leg. And it bruised up and my whole leg turned purple. And it was like a month of purple leg. I think it was all purple and great way to start out. Great way to start out. Yeah. And I had to go to the Arnold that following week with this purple leg swollen foot standing at the booth every night. Go straight back to my room. Put my leg up to try to drain it out. Praise me. And Rich, I showed Rich my leg. That was 2013. I showed Rich my leg in my room and he goes, oh, well, you can't do the show. And I was like, oh, yeah, I got 13 weeks. Yeah. And I remember all the way to the show that leg didn't quite come in. Yeah. And that was my worst placing at Nationals ever. I had one quad that just wasn't as separated. It just didn't quite clear out in time. It took months for it to all go away. That's the worst. Pop, pop, pop. Oh, that's the worst sound. Oh, yeah. Pop. Like, yeah. There's something about that sound. I, a friend of mine, towards Tri-Sept doing basically French press. Yeah. And I was spotting him. And I heard it sound like Velcro. Yeah. So I mean, as soon as I heard like yank the bar, I got to pull that out of his hands, put it down. And he looks at me and I mean, his face is already white. Right. That's a guy. He doesn't compete. He's just like a hard train dude. And he's like, all right. I think I'm out for the rest of the try-set workout. But I'll stay in spot you. I'm like, no, you will leave. Go to the doctor. Like, I mean, no, no, I'll be fine. I'm like, I'll be fine. Finishing this workout. Like, I heard the Velcro bro. I don't need to ask a doc what's gone on. I know what happened just now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. All right. Two, there was very important guys. How important is the pump? Well, it's not the BLN doll. It's not, I mean, just to pump itself isn't directly linked to any growth. Like, you could get a pump on a, on a, with a 20 pound band, right? Yeah. But I think the pump is great feedback because like, let's say you're training back. And after you do your pull downs in your rows, your biceps are pumped. Yeah. And your rear delts are pumped, but you don't feel like your back is pumped. I think that's great feedback that your back's not doing the majority of the work. Right. And you're using your arms and rear delts too much. Whereas if you do like, you know, like a very experienced bodybuilder like us, I go in the gym and we do our warm ups sets on the pull down and my back's already full of blood. Yeah. And my, I'm like, oh. I'm so good at using my back. So it's a good feedback mechanism that you're using the right muscles. And I don't think it could possibly be a bad thing to deliver nutrients and, and, you know, hormones and growth factors and all that stuff to a muscle. There's people now saying it's, you don't want to pump because it causes fatigue. I'm just like, God, I just don't go to failure. Don't get a pump. Yeah. Don't get a pump. Pump will restrict your, your, your power or your strength on your next egg. You don't want to pump. Don't want to get it. I would like to know how I would do a curl without getting a pump. Yeah. How am I supposed to train without getting a pump? I get the ones instantly. They get pumps on one negative. I have with the pump is if people confuse the value, because for example, pump. If you're doing an, well, not even just that, but if you were basing the pump on whether or not a movement is good, then you would say extensions are better for quads, right? Then a hack squat, right? Yeah. Because when you do, you know, and how let's, let's go light and weight, when do 150 reps, right? Your legs are going to feel like they're going to pop when you do that. Now if we're, if we're calling the pump to be all end all, then that is better than an extension set that's heavy to 10 at failure or way better than a squat, because like how pumped to your quads feeling comparison to an extension when you squat. Yeah. That's the only area where I find it could be tricky. I also worry about the word pump when you're dieting, because I'm like, yes, when I ask you how the pump is, I'm not asking compared to when you had pizza last night and then came in and trained. I'm aware that you're on 50 grams of carbs, right? You know, really I'm just asking, are you feeling the muscle contract and fill up in any way that, you know, so I only ask really advanced clients about their pump, because I've made that mistake before and then I realized my, oh, I asked a question they can't answer. This is good. You know, there are people that, and I had this happen with my doctor, even because I can't remember what it was and you know, I was talking about like symptoms of the long bug and all that, I was like, I can't get, I'm like, I haven't been able to get a pump. She's like, a pump. Like you know, when you're working out, the pump, she's like, what is that? I've had two people say that to me. What's the pump? And I, I find that so interesting because I think in our lives, the circles of people, we know. The pump is the cure. There's, I don't know anybody else, like it shocks me that somebody wouldn't know what the pump was. I just told them to go watch the pumping iron ass. I don't know. I'll tell you. Yeah, young, this can, hand or a seat, hand or a DVD. She probably still has one that she doesn't know the pump is. We know what the pump is better than. It's better than it is. You just said that. It's better than section. What's happening? Yeah, but you're right. I knew where people should just concentrate on getting stronger. They shouldn't worry about, they shouldn't worry about where they're feeling it. They should just worry about getting stronger. Yeah. Like is your bench going up? Is your squat going up? Is your form getting better? That's all they should think. And that'll all come later. That whole like feeling also. And Ron, like think about, if you're, you know, like the push on on hip thrust, right? You can really feel your glutes if you're doing right. I'm not an ant, I hip thrust guy first. But you can really feel your glutes. I don't feel my glutes on a leg day until two days later when they're just smoked and in pain. And I'm like apparently gone below parallel did his job. But during the training, I never like, man, my glutes are really firing on this. Hacksquat. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, hey, that's another thing. Like, glute training wasn't even a thought for body builders at all. Bloods and hams and glutes just got trained because you're like press and 14 plates aside, your Hacksquat and 700 pounds and your barbell squatting 400 to 500 all the time and you're lunging. So glutes just got hammered. You know? And we'd think like, oh, lunges are good for the glutes, look at Ronny. But we weren't thinking like, I have glute day. No. Yeah. And never occurred to anybody, you know? So the secret is skating because I had to be careful because of years of hockey to try not to get the glutes involved because they made my hamstrings like smaller. Huh. Really? Like, if you look at like, if I were just post a picture of like my started body, yeah. I was all legs. Oh, dude, every hockey player I've ever worked with. Like, I look at him. They sent me pictures and I'm like, did you play hockey? I don't know. Yeah. 18 years. You know, just all legs. Yeah. It's like legs and glutes are what you have. So I had to really be cautious though. I'm like finding that sweet spot. I've got a great parallel in the beginning of my career on purpose. It was like touch parallel come back up. Okay. I did not want to because I had weak hamstrings to begin with and over developed glutes. So it's like, you're just highlighting your weakness, right? Yeah. Like, like no one says, oh, he has great glutes. They say he has small hamstrings. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so it's one of those. I had a couple questions that we that Nikki threw in as well that I thought were interesting for you guys. First one is peaking for shows. Is it necessary for everyone and what are some peaking myths? Well, a peaking myth is that it's necessary for everyone. Check. Right? A peaking myth is that you need dioretics. You don't. I've just had some very recent success with none at all several times. Um, peaking myth is that you should load into a show. Like, it's all of them are myths. It should be how do you look, right? Like, I think the best plan generally is to be ready early. And I'm talking like almost two weeks out. Like you bear every glutes in. You better look pretty damn good. And and don't rely on feeding up right before the show. I mean, that's that's strategy that can and has worked for a lot of people. But ideally, you want to start feeding up like a week out and make sure the guy feels great and looks good. How you feeling to jump? Oh, man. I'm so glad my fatigue is gone. I'm cutting back on cardio. Like that's ideally the situation. And then you just try to maintain that position. Like I've had lots of guys Friday before the show. They're back on their diet. Like they're back on their lower carb day. Yeah. They did high carbs Monday, high carbs Wednesday. And medium carbs Thursday. And they wake up Friday and I'm like, hey, let's just just do the normal diet day. You look great. You know, so a myth is that you should do a whole bunch of shit the last week. If someone's ready, the coach should have very little to do the last week. Like, hey, just repeat repeat repeat yesterday. Don't change anything repeat. That's that's a great place to be. Oh, yeah. I agreed. What about you Scott? Anything to add? Yeah. Not really. I think that that pretty much nails. There are times, you know, like where things just aren't right. You know, like that's the ideal situation. And I would say that I love when that ideal situation happens. So all of the can hear you. It's like really. Yeah, you sound like a robot. It says trying to read your back says trying to recognize. Oh, there we go. I would start. Okay. I'll say that that is the ideal situation that you don't have to do anything. But yeah, everything is going to be completely unique. You know, every situation is unique. So yeah, I agree. Just that the only myth is that there is anything that you're supposed to do other than relax. That's one thing everybody's other. Another one. Husband wife coaching relationships. Do they work? Why or why not? Would you coach your spouse? They can work. It just depends on the dynamic. And I did help, Emily. I was a coach when we met. I was a coach for like years before we got together. And then I coach for the last few shows. I coached her for the Arnold when we went to Spain and she did the Arnold and play really well. Made the finals and everything at the Arnold. So that was cool. But we're also very level headed and she works really hard and I know she's not cheating under diet and you know, all that stuff. So just, you know, it worked for us, but you know, some people obviously is not going to be a great idea. And you know, it's also too like this. It also depends on the division like, you know, there's lots of factors. But she was doing bikini and at the time it worked well. You know, what I coach her again, she probably coach herself. You know, like I helped Nikki for her shows there because Dusty was like, I'm going to help her in the gym and beat the crap out of her. Yeah. And you can do the numbers because I want nothing to do with it. And it worked out really well. Nikki looked amazing. I just shows. Yeah. I like that from the side that they almost told us she was over conditioned. Whatever they did with her. Yeah. I didn't want like for me as a, as some of you coaches like I wanted to just bring my pal and poms and show them. Yeah. Because that's fine. Yeah. I wanted to just be the fun part. And I didn't, I took the pictures and made zero comments and moved it on and didn't think about it. It was a lot more fun for me. I've done both. And I can't say this from experience. I helped a girl that won everything we ever did. And she was a machine. And then later on in life, we were dating and I helped her. And then there were questions. Yeah. Then there was, do I really do, like things that never came up before? And she didn't place as well at that show. And I was like, there it is. We, we lost that thing where you just do what I say. You know, so that was, that was definitely a tricking part to me. And I think you're right, Ron, it is person a person. I helped my first wife for her shows. And then she, you know, I was like, I want to eat try hiring someone else and see how it goes. And it went horrendously. And I bit my tongue in the whole time. And then after she came off for pre-judging, she was like, you knew the whole time, I'm like, I did. And then she came back and worked with me for the rest of her career. So just it does really depend on how it works. We got time for more. We have enough Scott. I have a few more. It says I'm trying to reconnect again. We have an issue here. I've got some rope. Yeah. Yeah. Ron. Yeah. We do another one. Yeah. Scott has no opinion. I'm happy to do another one. I got one thing I want to touch on before we go, but it's not bodybuilding. Cool. Well, actually the one I'm going to check on is not bodybuilding either, but it could be. So first quarter of the year is obviously setting on. And I'm curious with our listeners how many people set goals for their year. And if they're on pace or beating them or if they even knew to set a goal, I'm sure you guys have some set. And curious how years are going. You don't have to get specific. But I think it's important. I've talked to a lot of people recently about this. And I'm shocked how many people just don't. This was, I turned 50 this year in October. And I mean, I've known this was coming for a while now. And it's lit a real fire under my ass. I've been like, wow, they're very nice. Wow, no, it's more like I was going to, I was hoping I would turn 50 this year. It's a little bit sketchy there for a while. But I had a goal this year. And I told Emily, I said, this year, I am going to bury myself in work that seems impossible to get done. And because I'm, this is the set up year. Like I am, this is a year that I is going to dictate, you know, the rest of our lives. Like I want to do some really big stuff this year. Income wise, investment wise. And everything, you know, you know, things you start building these little relationships and things start to. And it's, I've got a couple of projects on the go right now that are going to be very important. And I'm very excited and things are starting to roll. And I'm definitely on track for a big year of a lot of hard work. It's my like, say yes to every job I can take on type of year. Love it. And, you know, even like from, you know, stuff mutants asking me to do to stuff related to the gym, to stuff related to my training business, to other things with other projects. And I'm working on more things at once now than I ever have. And I think I just taking on the workload, taking on responsibility, putting myself in a position where I have no choice but to succeed. Yep. And taking some risks. And that's what this year is all about. And definitely put in my balls on a line with a couple things this year. Okay. So I will keep you posted. I can vouch for that. Yeah. And also too like, you know, another like my hips been a mass for two years. Yeah. I'm fucking done. Yep. I'm talking to private clinics now. If they can't get me in for the Canadian free shit. I'm fucking buying a hip. I don't give a shit. I'm done. I talked to Mike Van Wick. He paid for both of his hips. He said he didn't want to wait. They told him like crazy wait times because we're in Canada. And so he just paid for his hips. Went to a guy in Montreal or Toronto or whatever. He gave me the guy's contact. And I'm talking to the guy. I got I sent in my forms. You know, my like I sent to my MRIs. And I sent to my forms. And I'm waiting for a consult. And I've got a consult with my doctor about meeting a surgeon for the free hip. And I got some names from my brother of good orthos that do sports guys. And so whatever I can get in if the weight time isn't too bad. I'll wait for the free surgery. But if it's going to be silly, I'm just going to pay for it. And just getting things done so I can get on with shit. I like that. Well, I took a hit so far this year. My game plan has been to build a website to replace Patreon. And I invested some money in that with somebody that I guess I should have invested money with. And I lost a thousand bucks. This flat out what ended up happening. And then it became one of those things where like it's cheers to it only being a thousand. Yeah. Yeah. Well, 50 to be exact, but it sucks to lose anything. And it kind of like drug on. And then I'm reaching out to him and he's telling me like, oh, it's all set. But I don't have, I've never given him any of my stuff to build the site. You know, so I think it's all like, and he's like, oh, well, I need money to get this up now. So then I was like, well, can we have a meeting as of last week? And he's like, yeah, I'm going to need another, you know, three hundred dollars to get this hosted. I thought that's what part of the 1250 was for, you know, and so I just, I decided I don't trust this guy. I'm not going to go through with it. But if anybody out there who's listening knows a good person to go do a website, you know, basically there's so many like only fans typesites out there. We got to be able to do something like that. You know what I mean? And I'm not getting well, that that part. I met this. I, yeah, once the words came out of how much money is in it again. Yeah. What's the, never mind. I'm back. I was of goals doing this might help. Let me say that again, the structure of the site. You know what I'm saying? There's gotta be some way to set something like that up. So I need some help, but that's one of my goals this year is to try to move to that. Because it'll give us more freedom for me to build the like say things that I can't say. And because Patron at the end of the day is still a social media platform, and they do have their rules and regulations. They don't like everything we do in body building. Anyway, yeah, so I'm kind of bummed and I haven't talked about it at all yet. Like my wife knows. I'm gonna put you on this. Yeah, my wife knows. Well, I was like, you know what I'm gonna say it. Because it kind of sucks, but guess what? Life isn't always awesome, right? So, you know, that was a crappy thing that happened, but it's not holding me back. And another thing that I wanted to do was my health this year. Like I really wanted to step it up. Like the January 5th, 12th or 15th. I started deciding like, hey, I'm gonna start doing cardio consistently. I'm gonna start getting in shape. And I have not felt this good in a really long time. So, there's a loss and there's a really good win, which ultimately I think is even more important than a thousand bucks. You know what I mean? Absolutely. So real quick, is it something I thought of while you were talking around? Um, when I was like 22 years old, this conversation about goals and plans and having multiple things and all this, would seem like, how do you even get to that? You know what I mean? It just, it sounds like a conversation at 22 years old that I didn't need to be a part of. And that couldn't be further from the truth. So, what advice would you give to somebody who's young and maybe as they're listening to this or hearing that and thinking, well, they're talking about businesses and, you know, websites and stuff, that's not me yet. I'm barely getting by. How would you suggest someone like that? First off, change that mindset and second off, find themselves in a position where that could be possible at the current moment, and of course, advanced down the line. Oh, man, that's tough. Um, you know, I think, well, one thing that I didn't do, and I'm sure it all contributed, but I never spent money on dumb shit. I did, you bought like stupid cars and stuff and went through some phases, and there's some expensive girls in there too. But I didn't spend money on dumb shit. Like, I didn't care about watches and jewelry, and I didn't care about designer clothes. I just didn't give a fuck. And I know that contributed a bit to just like saving when I was young, but it also is me now. Like, I don't own any jewelry. I don't own a watch. I don't have anything. I don't care. I just live a simple life. People spend a lot of money trying to impress people that they don't even like, and that don't like them. So keep that in mind. Investing a little bit goes a long ways over the course of 3040 years. Yeah. So if you're out there in your 20 years old, I know you don't have much money right now, because everyone's, you know, everyone's bus in their ass, but you should be putting like a hundred bucks a month into like, your, your funds or buy an S&P 500 or doing something. And just trust me, don't worry. It's going to go like this. Yeah. But like in 30 years, you're going to look and you're going to go, I got a chunk of money here. And now I can go to the bank and borrow some money, because they go, oh, you got money, because that's how rich people get rich, right? They don't use their money. Yeah. They just show their money to the bank and then the bank doesn't money. And so you got to start thinking about building wealth 10 bucks at a time. Yep. And it's a slug and it doesn't come fast, but it man, time's going to fly by, you're going to wake up tomorrow and you're going to be 35, and you're going to have $200,000 in your funds. Yeah. And you're going to be like, oh, shit. Okay. That's great. Right. And then you, you know, just, that's sort of thing. I've talked about it a bunch of times, but also to Dave made a very good point. He said, be nice to people. That was awesome. That was a cool part. And I can attest that right now, I have a project on the go. That is extremely interesting and exciting. And it is because I developed a relationship with someone based on just mutually respecting them, being nice to them. I knew this guy for a long time. I didn't know him real well. I knew him as like a good dude. We worked together many years ago. And I was like, oh, it's a good guy. You know, and then I respected what he was doing. He respected what I was doing. We were always cordial to one another. I'd see him around. Hey, you're doing man. Like, and just developing relationships like that. I had no idea that there was going to be a future, you know, possible business opportunity. Come up with this guy. It's not like he was being nice to me to get something out of me. And it's not like I was being nice to him for any reason at all other than just a good guy. And I'm nice to people. And we got to know each other started chatting on Instagram a lot more the last while. Like, hey, start like, you know, and now all of a sudden, there's a very exciting project happening with this guy. Because we're both nice guys. Like, you never know what opportunities are out there. And if you go through life with always bitchy resting face, and you don't say hi to people and you walk into the gym and don't talk to the staff. And you don't, you walk around the gym, scowling everyone. There's going to be hundreds of potential opportunities that just never come to you because everybody thinks you're a dickhead. Yeah. And I'm not any brilliant business man or anything. I know what I happen to know, but he came to me because I know those things. And he's like, you know some stuff that I need. And I've got some stuff that you need. And if we hook up, we can do something. And I'm like, you're fucking right, we can't. And so I'm excited about it. And so that's just my little reiteration of what Dave said. Like, you have to create opportunities for yourself without meaning to do so. Like, remember when we were in Germany Scott? Yeah. And it's the last day. Feeba was smoked. We're sitting down. We're eating. And this guy walks by and he's like, looking at us. When he finally stops by and he's like, I know you to Ron. And we're in the hotel long eating. Yeah. Yeah. And Ron goes, yeah. He goes, what? Oh, I sat next to you at a banquet of some sort. And in long story short, they go back and forth. You know, exchange conversation. And I looked at Ron and I said, it's so funny that that guy's stopping is a move people don't do. They see him. They go, I know that guy makes keep walking. And I didn't Ron can tell you this. I literally said, in 10 years, this could be something. Maybe not. Yeah. He paused. And you guys had a short conversation and introduced me. And I said, I'm going to go to this whole thing. It's all because that guy stopped. And because he obviously Ron left a impression on from their last meeting. And he's very much in the wheelhouse of what we do. And it was just funny because when he left, I said, that's just a run. I was like, people don't do that and it blows my mind. Yeah. He's a CEO of a major fitness chain here in Canada. Okay. Yeah. Like a massive franchise. Yeah. And I sat next to him at like a business development banquet that I got invited to because of West Coast Island. Uh-huh. And I just happened to be put at his table. And we start chatting and he's like, oh, I run all the blah blah blah. And I'm like, oh, yeah. And then we start chatting and he's like, hey, I like what you guys are doing. You know, it's not what we do. But I really respect you guys. I have to say, they're really cool niche going on. Like it's awesome. And then when you call them, they recognize you and you're so far out of their lane. You know? Yeah. I was like five years ago. Okay. And then he sees me and he's like, what do I know you? And I'm like, come from Vancouver and he goes, you own West Coast Island. And we start chatting and then this and then like Dusty says, you know, that's how guys wind up like owning stuff together. Yeah. And shit is like those types of things, but people don't take advantage of those opportunities. You know, great guy, really nice guy. But he was there too to like just look at equipment and stuff. Yeah. And so yeah. That was very cool. So opportunities for yourself. Go up to people. Say hi. I like that. It's enormous. Yeah. That was a good note to finish out with. Yeah. I got one thing. Yes. One thing. I did not watch hockey for about 20 years. Okay. You're welcome. I used to be a big hockey. Like I grew up watching playoff hockey all the time, right? Like it was a thing. I used to, you know, it was just a thing. You know, we're Canadian, but I kind of stopped watching hockey for years. I went to a couple of other games where I lived in Emmaton. You know, some playoff games versus Dallas. I was super exciting. You know, one and over. I was, you know, and I knew the oilers. I used to support them drinks at the bar. You know, Ryan Smith used to drink off. Me dug weight. We gave me his credit card. I'd run it through. Run it tab for the boys. Like I knew those guys. But hockey that we have seen for the last two years in the playoffs, including the first round that we just witnessed. We just witnessed is the greatest hockey I have ever seen in my life. And I am so happy that Americans and obviously Americans, I love talking to it to Greed, but the, like the viewership is skyrocketing. Oh yeah. And people are saying stuff like, I'm not going to watch the NBA. The playoff games are happening at the same time. I'm watching hockey. Okay. It is the, I have always said this. It is the playoff hockey is the perfect television sport. It is fast. It is extremely exciting. The camera can follow it very easily. You know, on soccer, you get lost in the field and nothing's happening for a while. There's like lots of violent contact, lots of exciting hits. The game we saw last night between Winnipeg and St. Louis that Dustin and I watched. Yeah. That is like absolutely mind blowing how exciting that game was. That's cool. And, and it also was a perfect showcase of how precise the skill is with some of the stuff they're doing. Like those two tip-ing goals that that guy got. Just people don't realize they think you're shooting the pocket that net and it goes in. No, no, they're doing like there's like 100 mile in our slap shots. And the other guys are holding their sticks up and just tipping the puck, changing the angle by like 10 degrees right under the goal. These are like some amazing shit and that tying goal with one second left. Scott, the team, my, the, the jets are down two goals with under two minutes left in the game. Okay. They score goal and then they end up scoring the tying goal with 1.6 seconds left. And then they win in double overtime. Double over two weeks. 30 plus minutes of hockey later. Ron text me at like 11 p.m. I just watched this game. I'm like, you're damn random watch of this game. That's epic. And another thing that Dallas gained the night before, which I also watched was incredible. And went, and also both for home team wins. Dallas won in Dallas win a pick one and win a pick in double overtime. Both came from behind. Both came from behind in the third period. That guy scored a hat trick in the third period. Like, just crazy. We're just seeing these performances from players that are like just putting their guts on the line. And like guys playing with bloody miles and smashed faces and broken bones in their foot. And it is like the showcase of what hockey is all about. And you know, we watch soccer players take dice and we watch basketball guys fall down. They didn't even get hit in the face. Oh my god, my face. And then you watch hockey. Like nobody's leaving the game. To give you an idea, Scott, after the Florida series, two Florida teams played. Nikki's team won the series, but Victor Hadman that plays for the Tampa Bay light. Yeah, they never say what injuries are during the series. And then they say no after. They let you know afterwards who is playing on a broken light. You're kidding me. Well listen, I get it now because they watch fucking thing. I keep it out of season of shoresy. So I might not be an actual fan, but I live in Detroit. Everybody around me is and I watch shoresy. So I know man. It's cool. It's cool. It's crazy. Yeah. Plus the the added bonus for the Dallas game that I got through and for anybody who's interested is this guy played for the avalanche. And his contract was coming up. Yeah. And he wanted his he wanted his money. And the avalanche said you're not, you know, you're not going to have to go to the Dallas. Yeah. And then he came there. He went to Carolina first, but as soon as they brought him in, they sign him to an eight year 12 million dollar a year deal. And he ends up being the one that scores three goals in the third period and knocks the avalanche out of the play. Yeah. But guy, you let go. I was like, oh, that had to be a little bit. It was a little bit. It was the ultimate revenge. Like of all player revenge of all traded players that have ever gotten revenge on the team. Yeah. And you mean like, here's your 12 million. One, two, three, go play ball. Yeah. Yeah. And also when that the hockey crowds is, is there a better hockey crowd than a home town over time with the same. That building explodes. Like it comes to your TV. Like, oh my god. Like it's like a bomb goes off when that puck went in with 1.5 seconds. Or whatever time. That TV just. That's nice. You always see that people hit the roof and I used to go to games and I left the game every single time with no voice. That's how loud you're in the crowd. Like I would leave and you couldn't even talk on the way home because your voices are all shot. Best time in your life. So I'm glad that Ron is back to the addiction because I know he's in after last year. I'm like, oh good. I've got somebody to send hockey. Yeah, I just say, don't you can send him stuff and talk about it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we just want to let the viewers know if you've never watched NHL playoff hockey, pick a game, round two is about to start. We got some crazy matchups, oilers and Vegas. Let's go. And who's your team right now, Dusty? Who's left for you guys? The Panthers and they're playing the, they're playing Toronto. So Florida's playing Toronto. I'd be good series. Yeah. The Leafs have been like dog shit for how many decades. Forever. Yeah, the first round for the first round. Yeah, the Leafs have just been like Toronto's heartbreak for like so long. And now all of a sudden round two, let's go. I guarantee you we have hockey fans watching this show right now. Oh, yeah. They should definitely let the run. They're not even right now. Ron and Dusty, you know, who are you, who are you rooting for? Right. Yeah, so it's just a little thing. It's just been so fun, man. The games have been awesome. And, you know, kind of makes me a little extra like a little extra Canadian pride there too. I like that kind of our exports. So bad as doing well. Okay. Is that it? That's it. Okay. We did pretty good today, gentlemen. That was fun show. Okay. Remember, like share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell ring that bell. Remember, I am mutant.com. Get your discount. Do you want to save money? Do you want to take your money to Costco and buy some food? And you have enough left over for a bottle of gear. There you go. You're good. Okay. Yeah, bottle of test. Okay. So yeah, Dusty and Big Ron are your codes. Get your rights to search, get your all, and never one should get on the gear. I'm talking about the EAAs. Yes. And then if you, you know, with the one of you, save, you can buy bottle of test. There you go. Okay. Thanks everybody. Remember, it's just body building.

It's natural to push into bigger doses because we live in this environment and body building is terrible for this where more is better, excess, everything is excessive, bigger, stronger, everything is about being excessive. When actually when you get there, you actually realise that I'm making better progress, I feel better, I feel healthier if I'm caping off at 2, 2 and a half grams. And I do think that beyond those numbers, I accept for a few select people who have a genetic predisposition to be very tolerant of these drugs. There isn't really much cause to be going above two.

It's the only way you've got to ever see us again. Dave, so here's the thing, man. We talked about like, Annavar at an actual muscle building dose and people were lost their minds. 50 milligrams of interval, hollow before your liver falls out. And then we talk about like T or T plus what's the least amount you can use per performance enhancement. In fact, and we got crap for that. We can't win. We can't win, Dave. We just can't win. No, dumb, did you do? And dumb, if you don't, the problem is that will always be somebody with a different opinion. Yeah, and that's okay. I like this comment from Samurai Steve. He says, uh, 10 milligrams of anavar or wind stroke losing your credibility to limit liability 20 milligrams of deba'll pre workout, liars dirty filthy. Well, catch me is they take you so out of context. You know, you're actually stopped picking your nose and scratching your ass while you're listening to this show. I'd actually listen to the full context of the conversation. We've said time and time again. These are not performance enhancing doses, but you might get a little bit in the gym. Well, I call that performance enhancing. I just wouldn't call it muscle building. Okay, muscle building. But by point is, you know, we've sent all this a million times. You know, you want really effective dosing. You're going to be north of 34 milligrams. Yeah, and most people are going to be nearer to 56. You might as well as wear most people for it. 60s, wear most people will set. But you can't get something out of those really low doses, particularly if you are on point. But yeah, nice. Yeah. Can't win, Dave. We can't win. So I got a topic for us today. Let's take it back into the other direction. How to progressively plan your cycles for maximum gains. Starting from that first cycle, what would that look like? And then how do we continue to build it out from there? Because we see a lot of extremes. We see guys saying, like, you only need 300 tests. And then you have guys saying, but I've heard that the pros are using three grams. They didn't just jump to three grams. Obviously, we try to explain. They've built cycles up over time. That's probably not a good idea for your first few years of bodybuilding to be running gear like that. It's something that's happened progressively. So I wanted to see if we could try to explain to people today how to cycle building progressively increase what would be the way to do that? I completely made some of this done today's mission. I thought we were talking about something totally different. I know what you thought, too. Yeah. I can talk about that, too. That's what I wanted to happen. I don't want to. Boxed it. Most people, I would say that a start cycle is pretty much 99% of the time going to be test only. Yeah. Reasons being it is a compound to your body knows. It knows what to do with it. And it also is pretty much the foundation of all cycles. So you need to learn how you tolerate test and how you react to it before you can go forward. It's a little bit like learning to grow before you walk. So it's going to be test. 3 to 500 is fairly standard. If you are more towards the robot side of discipline, then you'd probably get away with the three. If you're more towards a train, money defried, you go out with a boy's for a few beers on the weekend end of discipline, then you're probably going to need a five. And the reality of that is that that extra dosing is compensating for the fact that they are things and you're trying to diet that aren't on point. From there, some depends on a suppose. Which direction you're going in regards to your physique? Why are you trying to face strength? Are you trying to get leaner? Let's assume the goal is muscle building which can give it as big as possible. I would then consider two options. One would be the repeat of the initial cycle or there are there about some maybe a slight increase. Yeah. A one would be so, say you let's go down a middle. You'd also use a four-leaf mid-bremble test for your first cycle. I see no reason why your second cycle couldn't be four, five or six hundred milligrams of test. You know what happens, you know how you react to it. And you know you're going to need a little bit more reach and management. You may then think, okay, I don't really want to go much higher on a single compound. So let's bring a secondary compound in. And then what starts to factor in is your understanding of compounds. If you're not that switched up on what compounds do we're out of managing, you're probably better going as a second compound at DHT. Because you're not going to run into massive issues in issues. You're not going to run into particularly pro-liked an issue. Is there anything driven from that side of things? So, massed, pre-mo, or potentially EQ. And then as your experience gains, you can start looking at compounds that are a bit more complex and you know, testing Deca, old school works a treat. It's old school and still relied on because it works. But it does require understanding of the drugs. You're now not only dealing with each region conversion, you're now dealing with pro-lactic. So you've got two negative drugs that you or undesirable drugs that you now have to manage. And a lot of it is where your confidence is in understanding about how the drugs work within your body and therefore your confidence in how to manage it. If you just want a drug combo that you can take forget about, and you don't really want to be doing mid-cycle bludds and you don't really want to be messing around with extra compounds in the way of management drugs, so anti-eachiness, anti-prolactants, and stuff like that. Then stick to a test of the DHT. You'll be fairly safe. And off you go. You know, if you want to get into drugs that have a broader spectrum of effect, but do require more technicality now to get them to work properly, then you can start looking at, I want to say they're exotic, but you can start looking at your decos and things like men and compounds that do check them all management. But with that greater risk and that greater management does come a greater reward. Yeah, I would stay away from personally those more like the higher side effect profile compounds for a look as long as you can. Yeah, I mean, I think it's something depending on how far you're going, you may never to believe or up against. I mean, and even then I would probably say start with Deca, because it's probably the easiest of the free. But yeah, I mean, you could probably get away with test master or test EQ or test master EQ. Though that might be too much easier to do in suppression. For, you know, probably three, four or five years, or cycling, if you wanted, it all depends on on what your linear trap is. You know, are you 21 year old, 22 year old, really feel like you're destined to turn pro and want to give it your all. If you do, you're going to get into the harder drugs a little bit quicker. But Beth has, you know, I'm 35 year old married with a couple of kids. I just want to look good when I go all day. Then we're probably going to stay with test master for everybody's cycle. We do them, maybe throw a bit into your ball or run about in there at some point. Yeah, you know, I'll give you an example of somebody I'm working with that we, we're pushing it just a little bit more. He competed this year and competing he competed on TRT with a little bit of an oral at the tail end, like the last few weeks. Then post contest he was like, hey, listen, let's run a cycle. I want to try to grow and then compete again, you know, ideally then have more size to be able to compete with. He hadn't run any gear and he's by the way, the guys guys like later 40s, I think he's 47 maybe. You know, we, one approach that I think would be a really decent approach to take with him would be, like, okay, let's just run test only, right? You can run 500 tests only see what we get out of that or even 300 tests only. He's only been on TRT, but here's my thought Dave is that he's probably not going to want to mess around with gear for the next decade, right? He's probably not going to be like pushing a bunch of gear now to least 60. So he's probably only going to run a few cycles. My thought was why don't we go to like 500 tests 400 EQ, like out the gate. He's already had previous experience with gear. He's already knows what he's doing with training. He's 100% on the diet. And so I would consider that to be a little less of a conservative move, but part of it in my mind was that, you know, what, let's get what we can out of this versus I think that if he were a lot younger, I would have said, hey, let's keep it lower because that'll leave us a lot more room to increase assuming he's going to be running gear for the next 15, 20 years off and on. In this case, he might be running a few cycles. I think that it's still going to be a very manageable cycle. What do you think of that? I see you point an argument and I'm very much in the middle with it. Yeah. And I think ultimately he's down to the individual that's using it should be that decision. Absolutely. But yeah, I mean, I see you point and I get you point and I think it's a valid point. I also think that as an older gentleman, you are getting a need slightly more to generate the growth because you don't have you from your side. Okay. Yeah. There's that. But I would also suggest that not everybody, but I would like to think the most older gentleman and older users are a little bit more sensible as well when it comes to how they manage the drugs and their other lifestyle choices around it. Not everyone. Yeah. That's a few that are. But I'd like to think that from the most part, their party in days are over and they're only going to be sticking one chemical in their body rather than two or three different ones. In the sense of a steroid or alcohol or recreational drugs. Yeah. So there's that aspect as well. And I've always been a great believer. And if you're going to stick a poisoning your body, which effectively all this stuff is, then pick one. You know what I mean? Those stuff throw you two with three at the end. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So eventually we get those doses do build. You know, these guys then that are five minutes. I mean, test and 700 tests. Then a thousand, I mean, I down the road. I went to four and a half grams. But I didn't go to four and a half grams because I felt I needed that to grow. I went to four and a half grams because I thought I needed it to grow in the time scale. I was looking up. Okay. Then that was a big decision. I didn't try to do it. Plus it. It wasn't a great thing. What did you do? Um. Yes. Like, would you suggest that others? No. But that's my point. That comes down to my point of personal. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, I think even time again, I probably wouldn't shy on the dough. Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think I would. Do you think though it was that beneficial? Like to say, like, you know, like, oh, yeah, had I taken three grams. You know, I wouldn't have been able to do what I've done, you know. I don't think I would have sustained the progress. Okay. So I grew for seven months. Yeah. And I kept growing. I mean, I was still growing at the back end of it, though. They were negative starting to creep in. I had about four or five weeks and negative at the end that just gradually built. They weren't major negatives. They were just me girls and stupid shit. You know, it's like when you beat on two of them. Well, there was a big major negative, too. Oh, that was the second one. That was the second one. Okay. Okay. I just don't know, because maybe we have people who were tuning in and they're like, oh, he ran four grams. It is not a problem for them. Oh, no. I wouldn't say that. That's all. No, that will join issues at the end of the day. No, no, no. Hi, then repeated that cycle, different drugs, but same total dosage ish. And that resulted in kidney failure in heart failure and all sorts of health problems. So, you know, I'm not for one minute suggesting that there's this two, there's two sorts of size to this. Tons of the drug while I was using them and immediate problems while using them, weren't that bad. And progress was very good. Long-term health impacts were a lot more serious. Which is kind of scary, man, because I think a lot of times we judge, well, how bad am I feeling? That's really, you know what I mean? They're we're not thinking like, well, how is this cycle going to affect me in five years or six more? No, I think I think it's part of the conversation that you need to have with yourself, as you start to elevate the dose, is you're not going to come out of this unscathed in one way or be major, but you're not going to come out of this unscathed in one way or the other. And it was very interesting, so I was at a conference on Friday on gear. And one of the new areas of research, which to me is old, to be fair, but it's one of the academically that started to take more interest in, is dependency. Yeah, okay, yeah. And they're now accepting that dependency is a big issue for a lot of people. And obviously, that then starts to lead to choice and decision-making that may not be fully neutral in, I can't think of the right word today for some reason. In the fact that it's going to be influenced by the fact that people are scared to come off or scared to lower the dose. And it's for a whole host of factors, you know, I mean loss of size, loss of identity, loss of feeling, a certain way. There's lots of drivers behind you. But yeah, so dependency is becoming a bigger thing. So the, you know, the long-term impacts from using gear are not just physical, but are also psychological and things like dependency that is developing in people. And probably a lot more common than people want to accept. It's very difficult to say or admit your dependent on the substance. Yeah, it's not only a conversation to have a yourself, and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to over-soul and go, well, I can't use gear anymore. It just means you have to be conscious of that bias when it comes to making decisions about what you're going to be doing. Yeah, and then with that too, I think that's where sometimes the needless increase of dose occurs, because then, you know, you maybe you start out and let's say that you aren't on TRT, but somewhere around down the road, as you're progressing in your cycles, now you are on TRT. And you get further down the road and your cycles are getting higher. And then you decide that you're not just going to do TRT, you're going to cruise. And you're doing 300 milligrams of test. It, you know, for your cruise. Now, if you're doing 300 milligrams of test for your cruise, that 450, 500 milligrams test cycle doesn't seem quite that great anymore. You know what I mean? Now, we have to take that up to 750 plus something else. And that I think is, it's a slippery slope. I hate to use that term. But it can be kind of develop, you know, over. I think, you know, if you want, if you want to create little rules of foam, little sort of guidelines, I would say that if you do a cycle and you grow off it, then there is no reason why you can't repeat that cycle. And if you grow off it again, there's no reason why you can't repeat the cycle again. And you could potentially do that to the point where you stop getting progress off that cycle. And then that would be the point when you'd look at a dosing crease or a compound change. And you may even, let's say the total dose is 600 milligrams of this test owner. And you get three cycles out of that and you progress well, but the third cycles a bit, wish you watch it. So you might then go, right, what mean, next cycle instead of going 700 or 800, I'll do 300 milligrams, mega test and three to mega deca. So the same total milligrams, just different compounds playing now. And you might find you grow again. So the sense of that, you don't always have to drive the dos up. And it is a risk reward scenario and that's going to be very individual for each person. But the two, well, one major factor I would say about exposure to antibiotics and your choice around our mobile voice, this isn't a free ride. There is a cost. Now those costs can be managed. But not always and you have to be willing to pay the potential price that these drugs can cost you. And if you're not, think long and hard about what you're doing with your drugs and cycles. Because, you know, there's people like contact me on a regular basis that are paying prices. They never realize we're going to be there and I've always mean now. And it's like, well, what did you expect? You know, it's, I mean, it was only last week, a two-twelfth competitor pro passed away, unfortunately. I'm not saying it was steroid related, but you can't help but think that maybe it played a factor in it. And I know tons of amateurs that particularly cardiovascular issues, you know, when they've hit in the 40s and 50s. And there's no denying that, you know, the incident, cardiovascular episode with steroid users is significantly higher than the general populace. So, you know, there are risks there. And they will bite you on the ass. So you've always got a factor that in when you make decisions. And it's not the easy thing to do when you're 21 and you want to be massive and, you know, you're not thinking about what's happening when you're 45. One last thing that I'll add into just to kind of piggyback off what you're saying day with, you know, progressing those doses and or staying the same early and getting the most out of this cycle and then repeating that cycle, getting the most out of it again. If you stop progressing it might not just be you're related. Remember that as you grow, your nutritional needs will change. Your, your body's always kind of looking for homeostasis. And I think that we, a lot of times on this show, called drugs and stuff, right? So we focus on the drugs. But you and I both, you know, are well aware. And we, you know, maybe don't talk about it enough on this show. But there are the other sides to it. The nutrition in the training. Like your body's always like, if you do the same exercises, the same sequence, you can take that so far, but there does come a point that that needs to change too. And that may be your biggest limiting factor. You might be able to up the dose and then seek out some more progress on a program for training that used to be great and now is inferior, but you can only do that so many times. So I would suggest that as much as you invest into learning about gear to be safe and understand how these compounds work, don't sleep on your training, don't sleep on the nutrition because those things are equally as important. I believe it at that. Yeah, I, there's something I've noticed, which has led me to come into a bit of a conclusion. I've been fortunate to talk to a lot of pros over the years about their drug use and their patterns of drug use. And it's easy to be fairly common that they will start getting into the three four gram numbers for a short period of time. And they nearly all exclusively come back down till two to two and a half. And that seems to be where they end up settling. And it does seem to be very much that it's natural to push into bigger doses because we live in this environment and bodybuilding is terrible for this web. More is about a success. Everything's excessive, bigger, stronger, everything's about being excessive. When actually when you get there, you actually realize that I'm making better progress. I feel better. I feel healthier. If I'm capping off at two two and a half gram. And I do think that beyond those numbers, except for a few select people who have a genetic predisposition to be very tolerant of these drugs, there isn't really much cause to be going above two. Fair enough. I think that that's a great point. Study show creatin doesn't just fuel your muscles, fuels your brain, research links create into improved memory, focused and mental clarity, especially while under stress. It helps reduce mental fatigue, supports learning and may even protect long-term brain health. I order my creatin from true nutrition, use code think it check out to get 10% off and support this podcast. Power your body and your mind with true nutrition creatin. By the way, this is my actual morning routine, mixing 15 grams of creatin into my oats. No flavor, no texture. And since I got married, we stored in this fancy jar so it doesn't look like my wife lives with a bro. But hey, if you're single, just leave it in the bag on the counter. It's totally fine. Alright, listen, let's move forward. Let's jump into our listener questions. We got a bunch of them. They left us tons of questions. They have, and if you guys want to take part in the next show, then definitely comment. I had a couple on Patreon that I wanted to make sure we got to. Alright, how about this one? It says, uh, on a cruise for around six weeks, and I want to cut before my next push. Would like to get my markers in check for pre blast labs. How much does plan affect my blood work? No, he was. Wasp. What? What? You messed up your camera. Did you mean I wasn't sure? Oh, you're back. I got you. I'm fine. Yeah, wasp. I was getting both bio wasp. God. Um, I don't think cleanse can have a major effect. It's not going to affect your cholesterol. No, I would have said to you only really way you're going to see clan impact is resting heart rate, BP potentially some impacts there, but I wouldn't suspect anything on bloods. No. Yeah. A question for the podcast. Are you still nanny if you use a GLP mad? Seeing a lot of influencers claiming natural despite their GLP use. Ah, at least, yeah, the boundary of where does someone move? I mean, if you want to be truly literal about natural, then you would take nothing that wasn't grown in the ground or raised on the land. Yeah, who's defining what nanny is? Is it an organization that you're competing? I think generally the war, that the nanny rule is very much based around what is the water bound list. Yeah, I think you're right. But, you know, the race, the arbitrary and itself, but maybe they try to put caffeine on it at one point. But then it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, some people argue that you're nanny as long as you're not using actual antibiotics, some people, and I suppose it's down to a personal definition, but I would have personally said that natural is someone who uses no chemical image or performance enhancement compounds. Yeah, I could go with that. So, I mean, here's what I'd say too, Dave, is that like if you're claiming that like there's a line in there, like, you know, what I consider myself, I'm not nanny, you know what I mean? But like unenhanced while using rada for fat loss in my own life, yeah, I'd be like, yeah, I'm not really on anything, but I'm using rada. You know, I wouldn't consider that to be like performance enhancing, but if we had two people that were competing against each other, and one of whom was using rada, and one of whom was not, and this category was supposed to be natural. Or this person says, hey, guys, you know, buy my new supplement, and it's going to help you to get as lean as I am, but they're using rada, you know, then yeah, it's kind of dishonest, doesn't it? Yeah, I think that there's growing pressure for this, but whether it'll ever actually happen or not, there's already been a move that companies that have the size products and use athletes have to stay somewhere on the other, that this person didn't achieve this, if it's using this product. Yeah, good luck. But they, they, yeah, they're trying to get that much more driven into it where, you know, if you're, you have to declare that your physique wasn't built purely off that product. Yeah, all right, another Patreon one from David he says, uh, uh, just coming off my first cycle in around 15 years. Um, I've been on an anavar and test cycle with mass in the final stretch for over three months. I gained about 15 pounds. I'm happy with that. I've generally been on a calorie maintenance, um, but I've had two weeks of holiday vacation for you yanks. You understood that language, Dave, I understand. Um, uh, where the diet was what it was, I expected a few extra in there. Uh, the training has been good, intense and consistent, even though the holidays and the muscle and strength gains are noticeable. Um, my question is, as I come off cycle, um, if I keep the diet the same, how much weight can I expect to lose in the first month after and what's the best way to adjust the diet to try to retain the muscle of accumulated while still burning fat? Uh, I do want to lose some of the weight that I've put on, but I wanted to be as a fish and as possible. Thanks guys. Me personally, what built it will keep it. Um, so I wouldn't change the diet at all or the training and know there's some excess from the holiday, but I would get back to the pre-e holiday diet and I would hold that for a good four weeks. Then I could potentially start looking a calorie reduction or an expenditure increase to start to try and improve condition. But as long as you're training the same way and your diet is the same, there shouldn't be a huge amount of muscle loss. There's going to be some flattening, you know, you're not going to hold as much glycone and will or rinse so early because you're not on gear. It's as simple as that. And there is potentially as a slight drop, but I wouldn't expect anything significant and I think I'd be talking maybe on the acopolycalo. If it was more than that, it would be start into question the effectiveness of your diet and training and whether the gains would genuine or they would just chemically driven. Yeah. I got a podcast with Scott Stevenson a little while ago. Uh, we titled it, maintaining your gains post cycle. And one of the things that like you said Dave keeping that food up, you know, after the cycle, your body will want to shed any newly gained muscle. So the mistake I see people make is they're no longer as full and stretching their t-shirts out as they were when they're on cycle, but they definitely are still holding the additional fat they gained. So now they kind of feel like, you know, slumpy and they want to try to start tightening up. But I'm with you like at least a month after and that's a month after everything's cleared. Like a month, if you's doing PCT, that's a month after PCT is over. That's when I would then possibly consider to do anything to try to recomp in any way. Um, one of the things that Scott said that I thought was fantastic is you're talking about like satellite cells and building new muscle. He said that like if you envision a city expanding out into suburbs, as that city expands and little suburbs develop, they aren't building new post offices out in the middle of corn fields, assuming that one day there's going to be a city built up around it. That city's going to expand and they're going to keep using the same post offices that they already have. We're talking about like these, like the nuclei and the satellite cells that these. So basically, you know, as that city expands, eventually you'll have to put in new post offices, right? But that's a process and that's not they're not going to preemptively already have them there. So you don't have the impulse structure to hold that new muscle the minute that you grow it and your body will more easily shut it. So it takes time to kind of build that impulse structure. But those post offices in and make it self-sufficient before you start pulling the calories back. Yeah. Completely new. What about this one? Oh, so we got a bunch of people last week. They tons of people sharing with us their insight on how their estrogen levels were affected from using EQ. Here's just one example. 900 tests, 900 EQ on his most recent cycle, E2 levels on Ultra-sensitive were 13. That's low. Yeah. I asked him what he did after that. He said, I ended up with using 800 EQ, but he didn't get another set of labs done. So, you know, but yeah, just an example there of how EQ is at a one-to-one ratio had a real strong effect on that guy. It seems to be when it is, it seems to be the strongest of all the unavalex I have in on to estrogen effect. Do you feel like because of the difficulty in getting massed in pre-mode? Do you, I feel like we, we kind of talked about this before, but I think I'm seeing it in practice now. Do you feel like EQ might be the new most popular additional steroid? I think he said in that way, but the mass supply route does seem to me slowly recovering, but not great. So, I think a lot of it will depend on how long people are worried about massed. And I think the only negative in the sense that might put people off being fully committed to EQ, is its reputation for blood thickening? Yeah. So, I think if that wasn't there, I think with CEQ already being a virtual good choice when it came to this set up, but I think that blood thickening element is just making people that little bit more cautious than they would normally be about that switch over. Yeah. Do you feel like EQ has that much greater of a propensity for causing blood thickness than other steroids? It's greater. Is it that much greater? Hard to say. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because with it, like you've said before, we've talked about that they all do it, right? Yeah. They all do it. Sorry, I was just sort of message pop up in the, it's, it's something EQ's not getting to talk to. That was the thing that just popped up. Okay. Yeah. Rice 41. So, we hear that I can only speak out of my experience working with like a vast number of people over the last 15 years that have used a, a small shipping container of EQ that I haven't seen EQ being kidney. But that's something that's been floating around the internet for the past couple years. Like, oh, you got to stay away from EQ, because it's real kidney toxic. And if that were the case, I feel like we would see people experiencing a lot of problems from that. The only, the only drug that I'm aware of that has a direct impact on the kidney's is trend. In a very guess, showed to in rat studies? Yeah, but I've not seen it carried out in humans. Not from the point of actual kidney problems. You see a alteration of markers, but not actual kidney problems. Whether our EQIs are tied directly to the case studies of EQIs directly tried to try to use. Now EQ has shown issues around liver. EQIs, as shown to have an impact on the liver. But I've never seen anything to document a dish, shows any impact on the kidneys. Granted, it's not the most studied subject as well. There's that. So, there is that element to it. But I'm not seeing a lot, and it don't either. I, yes, kidney issues from unmanaged thick blood, but that isn't sure itself. In high blood pressure. Yeah. You know, all that. Yep. We had on that note, I can't remember where it is, but somebody asked us, they said, hey, you know, one of the big things I'm concerned about with EQIs anxiety is that I understand it's related to GABA could I use supplemental GABA to make a difference? I don't know if that would make a difference, because for my understanding GABA does not pass the blood brain barrier or oral GABA supplementation. Right. Now I've got a question. David, question. Yeah. Back. Thank you, Chesa. I've more of recent years see more people suggesting or experiencing those suggestions around words I apologize, experiencing issues with compounds that previously people haven't reported. So severe mental health impacts from things like Deca, EQB and another one. And I'm just like, is it the compound or I mean, I know there is some or is it more just the total on the body value that's the issue or is it a combination? You know, you've got back to the 80s and 90s, but it's very few people have reported mental ill issues around Deca. Now the science is there to show that Deca should cause it, so I'm completely agreement that Deca can cause it. I don't know if it's because it's just more users now, so we have a more broad spectrum come back of what people are experienced. And it's like EQIs, it's not a drug that on paper, I see having any real major impacts around mental health, but all out of all, it's not like mental health. So it's not like and I'm just wondering sometimes is it the compound or is it just a total on the public side going in? Yeah, I wonder too, you know, the whole thing with GABA, because it does change your, does change the neuro-transmitter stuff related to GABA in the brain. I wonder if, and we've known about that for a long time, but I think estrogen plays a real major role in moods being either high estrogen or low estrogen in that ratio to antigens, you know? So I wonder too if there's an element of that, like, if somebody gets anxiety from EQ, because we've seen it, I know what you mean. It seems like more people are reporting it now, but we've always, like even back in the Master's Board days, there was the random guy that was like, I can't use it. Yeah, I say, you seem to be more broad spectrum now, and I'm just like, is it the compound or is it more of a total explosion thing? Or is he just because there's more people using, so we've got a lot of spectrum of responses, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, that could be it too. And here's the thing, man, for me personally, I was hesitant with EQ because I tend to get anxiety with stuff, like if I were to take like ECA, I feel like a little stemmed out, and I feel like just more like my body feels more physically anxious, you know? So I assumed, like, I'm probably somebody that if something causes anxiety, I'm going to get it, but I never got it, man. All right, let's see what else we have here. Scott, love the pod, and I love the way that you present yourself. I like this guy. He says a question, I ran SLUPP332. During my cut, didn't really notice much. Still have a bit remaining, it was thinking of trying it during my current growth phase. What's your opinion on that? Really want to prove myself that SLU works and how my body reacts before prep, because before prep, before completely giving up on it. Thanks. I asked him how much he was using. He said he was using 250 micrograms three times a day. And I'll tell you what, I think that's a plenty to see what you're going to get from it. Now that I've had a lot of experience with it in this year, and I've talked to a ton of people who have had their own experiences, be it clients, listeners. Okay. I got a thought date. I'm going to share. I understand you got you. I'm just my body. I'm very patient. Okay. Thank you. My thought is this, that I wonder if not everybody is going to get the great benefit from it. I don't know why I have some theories. But for my I've seen as I've had people that respond in some cases as great as me. I would call myself like the best possible outcome to get from SLU. And then I've had people say, yeah, I noticed great mental clarity from it and improved endurance. And then I've had people say, yeah, I think I've noticed some additional endurance. And then I've had like a handful, small handful of people say, I didn't get anything from it at all. I wonder if it has to do like with in my situation, poor mitochondrial function to begin with, having gotten the bug several years back, is it correcting that just to get me up and running to feel normal again? Because that's pretty much the way I feel using it versus somebody else who didn't have those same level of issues. You know, maybe that has something to do with it. That would be that would be my main thought on it. But yeah, I don't see it working the same across the board for everyone. And I've seen very few random people that they just don't get anything from it. So, you know, I guess it's any drug, right? What was your thought, Dave? It's not. It's this is reminded me of something. And I wanted to ask you an opinion on it. It's going to take us off topic. So, okay. I'll be to hold it if you don't want to. What were between questions? Let's run it. Right. So, there's a whole host of new mitochondrial support drugs, MOT, SL, SLDP. I know obviously, Nads have been around a while, but it's growing in popularity and seems to be making a bit of a research in this recently. Yeah. I'm there's a few of them as well in the peptide range. I've heard it proposed that because of all these new peptides, that it would be possible to run a gram to 2 gram year round and offset with a very comprehensive program of these sort of peptides. I genuinely do not know how effective these peptides are at offsetting the negative impact from other Botlics. So, you've done a bit more running than me. So, I was curious just your thought on that idea. I don't. Okay. It's an interesting direction that they're taking that. And I guess that naturally, I can see how people would, you know, want to say anything. Okay. How can I take more? Yeah. It's, it's similarly took about a half a additional time is that harm reduction wants people to stop using steroids. Steregyz is one of you's more and more effectively. They're those to pull their opposite approaches that often causes a friction between effective service. Here's my take on it, though, would be this. I've seen it this way. I've seen it being that if you can get your body tuned up and in the best possible place. And I would say this, not just the mitochondrial stuff, but also let's look at the GLPs where we can like greatly radically improve your insulin sensitivity quickly. You know, because example being that if somebody isn't in off season and I need to get them into a dieted state, we're going to have a period of time where their body isn't as responsive. You know, where we're, maybe pulling food back, their body isn't just like clicking yet. If they've been in a long off season, so there's almost like a pre-diet phase that they need to go through after a, like, a big push upward before they're ready to actually be in a good fat loss position. I think that you can use GLPs to fast track that. So if you can fast track somebody is ability to get like super-sensitive, super-responsive to dieting and you can not only increase the, the, the function of your mitochondria, but increase the number of your mitochondria, you're putting yourself into a position where you can get more out of less. Maybe we need less to get the same job done is the way that I've looked at it. Yeah, but you're not answering my question is. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I don't see all that those peptides and that new family of peptides have the potential to offset high dose or long-term exposure to animal use. I don't think I doubt it, man. I mean, I think that you could get some benefit, but like honestly, man, you know what it's like, they're like, yeah, no, I just, I don't know we know for about them. You've looked at them in a lot more depth than me, so I don't know you've got some personal experience. I don't have the personal experience and I've not really looked at them in any depth yet, so I honestly didn't know. So I thought, well, you know, well, I'll ask God, he's probably got a better idea on the actual peptide side of things. Yeah, I think if anything, you can get away with using less. Like, maybe we don't need to add clenin as soon. Maybe we don't even need T3 or we don't need it as soon. You know, we start the cycle and, you know, for say a contest prep, maybe we don't feel the need to push the doses as high. Like, you get the results you're going for and I use the, that's the way I say it as a coach. You know, we use the doses that are required to get the results we're going for within, you know, safety or, you know, harm reduction, I guess. We risk risk reduction, right? And then I'm just finding though, we're getting further along with less than we needed before. Okay. See all standby, basically the opposite. Well, yeah, kind of. Within with the introduction of those peptides, you should get away with a less of those. Absolutely. I mean, you need to use more. Okay. Yeah, that would totally be my take. I think that we could, it could be a really good benefit to our community overall, you know, get our, like, and basically we're talking about like just getting somebody tuned up, getting their health into the best place they can. I do think that is going to go the other way though, unfortunately. It's unfortunate, man. I could see you being right, though, you know. All right. Um, don't know if you're, let's see what this is saying here. Oh, just a comment. So this guy says that he'll buy a batch test everything I order now. So you're, we're talking about like testing your mass, testing your pre-mo. So here's what he's going to do. He'll buy three different batches of pre-mo from the same vendor, I think. And then he'll mix them together and send that off to genushe. I mean, if it's off, let's say it's all pre-mo. Okay. Yeah. And then you had one that was dose correctly and two that were dose, well, incorrectly, then those two are going to pull about one down. So when you send your mix batch, you're going to get a reading that's slightly older but not reflective of the individuals. I don't understand the logic there. Maybe it's me that's missing the standard in the situation. I'll just, I would thought if you take three separate samples of a drug, yeah, and combine them and then get them tested, you're not getting any indication of which samples of go to which samples of you getting a blend. But if it all tests out at, you know, like I say, what we supposed to be a hundred and it all tests and you send, you mix three together and it comes back at a hundred, then you're certain. Yeah, you know, you go three. It comes back at 75. You might have one at 50 and one at 100 and it's like, well, I don't know which is which, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's a point too. I guess you're just trying to save money, right? No, I get it. Fucking expensive. I don't get it. I don't get it. It would be such a nice world if we could trust these supplies. Following on from that question, I ask you, Ryze said something. It's like, I disagree because there are factors, disagree with what that. It was saying it would make you more tolerant, resilient to some abuse. Yeah, but they don't cover every aspect of what abuse problems cause. True. So we've got mental health issues. We've got heart cardiac pressure. Now, we'll couple of the peptides do support cardiac to a degree, but I don't see as being a blanket repair from a little bit that I do know. But I was asking Scott because he knows more about it than me. Another guy with his EQ information. He says he was using five 25 tests, 350 EQ. He said, Astrogen was 34 tested after six weeks. So that's like a three to two. You know, to be part of tests to two parts EQ and he's, you know, a little bit higher. The last guy was one to one. This is like a three to two. Yeah, I wouldn't have said that's probably close. It's the way you need to be. I like that. Yeah, like that. Three to two then. Yeah. At least, after 22 weeks at 10 milligrams of anovar, you were saying we were wondering how long could you run var for, you know, at a low dose. After 22 weeks at 10 milligrams of var in 175 tests each week, HDL was 34 and hematicrit MC, MCV, hemoglobin were slightly in the red. Test was 1500 for test 404 was low, but T3 uptake was high. I mean, I consider that to be not bad. What was LDL? You say? You didn't say. Yeah, because I'm a var in Chris's LDL. Going back to rise. Yeah, the problem with Jason is he's got a vested interest in drugs. Notice, you're expected to die in a slight SES. He's a clever man and everything, but I wouldn't say that was a true harm reduction angle because there's a disease. I could see it helping. Yeah, I could see it helping, but I would definitely, I wouldn't, I don't know, in, in, I know Jason personally. I don't think he would subscribe to the idea of you can now blast your gear higher. You know what I mean? I don't think he's saying that at all. No, I don't think he eats. I think the issue is though that anyone that's within the industry, there's this risk of a slightly cognitive bias towards usage in the same way that from the medical community, which I spent all day Friday with, they have a bias towards non-usage. Yeah, so I have affiliates that, you know, have these things that we, we don't talk about here and you do, but so you could say I do too. At the same time, it's not my, like, foundational business. So if I didn't believe in it, I just wouldn't stand behind it. No, I think the problem is that it's the background that you're coming from a little bit, you know, I mean, so I guess what you mean? You know, I was with the end of the college, I'm Friday and there were some very valid points raised, but there were also some unrealistic or slightly biased points raised in each slide and then not anti-usage in the slightest, but they have a slight bias because their information, everything comes from a medical side of things where it's our information always comes from a usage side of things, even though we do research and look at things. So there's always going to be that slight edge one way or the other, depending on where your background is. Yeah. Yeah. So take a take everybody with that green assault, you know, I guess. But yeah, it's just, you know, I would use, I was, anyone, even Clevver Scott, who's probably the man I trust the most on the planet when it comes to unabolics. I would still use as a star, I'd point to just go and do some of your own finding on it, you know what I mean? Yeah. Let me see if I can find one more here. All right, we'll take, we'll take this last one. Oh, he has two questions. He said Andrew mentioned using Matt Foreman, like they're taking insulin. How does Matt Foreman work? I don't know if Andrew said to do that. Who's I don't think he would? Andrew Barry that I podcast with. I don't think he would have said to, it's not, Matt Foreman is going to dispose of your glucose, right? Versus insulin is going to shuttle that glucose to storage and hopefully the muscle. Many people combine Matt Foreman and insulin because of the increased sensitivity from Matt Foreman. Whether that's, I wouldn't say that's necessary. Yeah, yeah, I feel like Matt Foreman used to be a lot more popular than it is now, you know. Yeah, I do think he's weighing in a bit, it's a bit on this time. And then he also said, I believe it's been mentioned that he can take six weeks to peak in the blood. If you up the dose after six weeks, will it take just as long for the change to happen? Depends on the dose increase. Oh, yeah. You know, I mean, if you're going from not for into 600 milligrams of EQ, we, I mean, most drugs peak about five, six weeks is not just EQ. If you're going from zero to 600 milligrams, if you're going from six months to 800, then that's not going to take another six weeks for that increase to to peak. All right. Dave, do you have any wisdom points today? Nice weather. Hope you're feeling better this week, Dave. That's what Gabe said. I am. Thank you. A little bit snotty, which I always am a little bit snotty. I get about my son as a zombie best. But yeah, in general, I am feeling much better. Thank you. Generally feeling like a concote with life again, whereas last week I felt like it was dying. Sorry, unaliving very slowly. We tell you, actually, I suppose technically speaking, advice, Dave's wisdom more advice. Well, of course, time you had a great comment. I like this one a lot when we were talking about somebody had asked about taking Gabba, while on EQ, she said, for my understanding, it's better to support Gabba production through B5, B6, 5HTP, etc. I like that. Smart gal. Hmm. It just is loud. Do you remember all the sleep products that had Gabba in? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, it will help to relax like the skeleton muscle. You know, and if you can physically get that sense of relaxation, I do think that that does help with restfulness. I don't really have anything. I was trying to think if I had something, and I don't really have anything. It's okay. What's up? I feel I'm going to be very in danger of repeating myself. You, you, you, you, you know, I'm not going to say it before you say it. You, you, you made this into a big thing, you know, I watch a grand thumb. If you guys know who grand thumb is on YouTube, he's another YouTuber. He's actually a real big YouTuber, and they have their dad advice at the end of the show. And it's like this long. They'll be like, Dave, what do you have for dad advice? And it'll be like, make sure you spend time with your kids. Boom, Mike drop. That's it. Versus for you, you can add a pressure on yourself. You made it look like this big novel, the segment. I know. I couldn't say that though. I couldn't say it's bedtime. You kids, because I can't fucking stand my. I'm trying to get rid of the last one, desperately, but it's not working. Keep testing for you. No, no, none of my kids were from it. No. It's acceptable. You said. T's. No, the youngest is like, I'm trying to go around the house. You had a fucking full time job in the mouth, but it isn't happening. No, I'm sorry, guys. I haven't really got anything. I mean, it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to have anything, Dave. We like you just for who you are. You know that? And people were worried about you last week. They're like, oh, Dave looks a little peek at this week. He doesn't look well. I, you know, you can't even self. I am no issue. The bags under my eyes that become very relevant or very visual should when I do these podcasts. Oh, looking particularly bad on it. God, I'm looking old. We're getting there. We're getting there. I'll let you know how my calcium score test goes. I'm going to get that tomorrow. I think they're trying to do for me, by the way. They're like, you can't drink caffeine for 48 hours. And then I look everywhere online, says four hours. Yeah, the other thing with the calcium score, the test has to be done fairly quickly, that's sample deteriorates like a batch. But they're doing, uh, they're doing, uh, it's an MRI. It's a picture. The test I'm doing. All right. I thought you just meant to both test. All right. No, I'm laying in a tube. You laying in a tube? You know, you're going to hang out there. That's, that's what I'm doing tomorrow. See, you get the headphones over there and you can pick your own music. Oh, I don't even know about that. They used to do it, I don't do it anymore, but yeah, you got headphones and you used to better bring a CD and I don't see, you don't have CDs anymore, much, but you used to better bring a CD and it's just a machine and then you better listen. Maybe you could plug my, you know, plug my phone in and I could listen to, uh, you know, Dave, uh, educators. I could, you could listen to me reading little of the buys. Oh, Dave, thanks for sharing the show yesterday by the way. I'm a social media with your big, you know, Dave's got a great social media following guys over on Instagram. He doesn't incredible job. You know, I, I, now great it. Yeah, I do spend hours putting the show together for us and everything and I spend all that time making that picture every week and all that. Dave has that one little job, you know, of just sharing the show with a link in his, in his, in his, uh, stories on Instagram. But it's such an important job. I wanted to take a minute here just to, we can all thank him for doing that. You know, Zach Brownlee this morning kick it off as well because he asked me to share his new ebook. He's got a new ebook, huh? Yeah, training one. Uh, it's doing quite a few much of it. Okay. And I did share it about three days like, um, but I didn't tag him in it. So you are, we don't just want to give me a boost for the for not tagging it. That's like a cow Winnie. Yeah. Well, this is your own thing. This is our thing, you know, I know, I go online. I go online and I see Dave, right? I see him and he's all like, oh, do you want five tips on how to, uh, you know, you're. You're off to do with me. That's my social letter. What are you talking about? Hold on a second here. Hold on a second here. I got something for you here. No, so my social people send me a video, at least if I want a video on this list, this is this. I shared the show yesterday. I tagged Dave. I also put a link in there. Dave didn't do that. So, okay, here's Dave right here. What's this? You know what? What's this? You know, when you do some of your own, you miss his reminds you of it for fucking years. It becomes very well. No, you have nothing to do with this, do you? That's not right. That's not you. Let me explain. Who does that sound like? listeners? Audio listeners? So, how do we just see things? Who does that sound like to you? I, I get a list. I get a, I get a, I get a, I get a WhatsApp message from Tony and she says, I want a video on this, this, this, this, this, and this, and then I go and say it in front of the PC and I do all these videos, then I send them a. And then the videos might come out three months later, four months later, depending on what you schedule it. So, yes, I am, I think useless with it. I know. Hey, by the way, two, one last thing, there was that gear's place on Instagram that was impersonating you and using our videos, right? I reported them. So, did I? As being, the, like, and they ask you, like, what are you reporting this ass? And I said, as impersonating somebody, as impersonating and then the next thing is like who? And then I put in you and I, you know, and then it said, nope, we found that this, this profile is doing nothing wrong. So, that I do it again, right? I'm like, oh, okay, because it's linked to a fake gear site, you know, like scam gear site. So, I do it again. I'm saying it, and I certified right amount, you know, the legal, legal goods that they're trying to sell. And I got a message back again a couple days later. No, we investigated this profile. They aren't doing anything wrong. And yeah, I put an advent for the Pedsco's open. I get blocked from life for a whole year. It's the first thing I thought of doing. That's the first thing I thought of. Yeah, he's like the guy in person, you can get away with it. But the actual real person gets done for it, you know, he's, uh, I get hooked. Guys, we appreciate you tuning in. Dave, are you taking new clients right now? Always. Okay. How do they reach out to you social media? Is that the best place? Yeah, usually to be honest, just on one of the social media platform messages. All right. We've got Dave linked below in the description. So go there, guys. You can reach out to Dave hit me up.

For Patreon, we got through your Patreon quest yesterday and for another episode of the podcast. See you soon. Thanks Dave. I mentioned it last week in the live stream. But if Dave is a bit over the Uncle Dave's advice, could you go back to when Dave teaches Scott proper English? Do you remember that? I do. We had like a British word of the day. The same thing? Dave, yeah, it was like Dave teaches Scott English. The word of the day is cocoa humble. Oh, you did that one before. I'm not. Yeah. Yeah. All right, spunk book it then. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you did that one before. But I just I've heard you say it at least. Something long. It's a good one. I just hired ginger, training, Josh, gold as my coach. Never mind. You'll get over it. All right. All right. I'll break it. He stinks the pacemase, ginger. Aren't you kind of ginger, too? No, I'm right. What's the difference? Right. So, couple of things. Ginger's a stinker piece. Cheetah cards and the soul stealing scatters on light. I'm red. Have you ever heard of Eric the ginger Viking? I think so. No, you've heard of Eric the red. Oh, is that what was that? Oh, I've heard of. Okay. If you see a good looking woman who's got Auburn hair, you say she's a good looking redhead. Yeah, you do not say she's a good looking ginger. Do you? No, you see. Reds are all the positives of the genetics, right? And gingers are all the shit. And Josh is ginger. So, therefore, he stinks the piss. She's a counts. Isn't there something about genetic differences with people who have red hair for a little bit like tolerance for pain or tolerance for medications? Isn't there some truth to that? That's some of it. Yeah. I don't know. Now, my pain tolerance is weird. It depends what it is. Yeah. So, physio can go as hard as they want into my back. My hamstrings, my cows, my glutes, no problem. Touch my chest or my core and I cry like a five-year-old. Let's see. Do redheads handle medications differently? Redheads comprising of one to two percent of the global population, often carry unique genetic traits influencing their response to medication. The is genetic variations impact factors like drug metabolism, pain sensitivity, and anesthesia reactions. Making redheads a compelling focus for pharma, was it? Pharma could cog, cog, cognitive, pharma, cognitive, pharma, cognitive, and that's a good one. Pharma, cognitive, and genetics. All right. I'll bring us in.

What's more nanny to stosterone or creatin? Crazy. Is it though? We produced a stosterone. Do we produce creatin or do we consume it through red meat, Dave? I would say based on adding the two chemicals into your system, the least natural will be the one that has the greatest impact. And in this case, it's you take 50 grams of creatin. You're going to ship from the iron needle, but you ain't growing any bigger. Haha. There's that. Yeah. You increase the dose of tests. You are going to get some direct correlation. What's up guys?

I don't want to show that other one on the screen. Also last but not least, thank you guys from Patreon. Alright, Dave, we've got a ton of listener questions. We're going to answer those as we always do for anybody new tuning in. Dave is an expert witness for the UK court system testifying in cases of PEDs and steroids. You can see he's very attentive, very excited for the program today and he's also an educator to the police, the military and and really in general public of the UK. You may have seen him in the movies under construction one and two when he was 400 and something pounds. Dave, I got a topic for you. Alright, before we get into our listener questions, I did this on a like a live stream ask me anything a couple months ago. I want to get your opinion. Alright, the tears of steroid use dosing wise. Alright, because we have everybody complaining, right, that's not a dose. That's not enough or guys saying that's too much and we kind of talked about this last week. But let's freaking put the nail in this coffin so that everybody can stop there bitching. Let's talk about what are the tears. And here's the tears. I want to know these doses. We've got legit TRT. Alright, then we've got TRT+. Then we've got legit all on cycle. There is no denying it, man. You're on a cycle, which is I know arguably TRT plus is a cycle. But we're beyond that. You can't call it that anymore. You're on a cycle. And then there is like absolutely super charged. I'm going to nation this year. Let's call it those four levels. How does that dosing breakdowns? So for starters, I guess, why is true TRT? A grum. A grum. You're telling me. Is that a grum total? Yes, and then TRT is 2 grum and a cycle is 3 grum. And then if you want to grum mostly is 4 grum plus. No. TRT. I think the clue is in the name. It is testosterone replacement therapy. So therefore my approach is it is the dose required to replicate good healthy natural levels. Okay. Not a bit of range. In range, good healthy natural levels. That's TRT. And I think it's to me, my big bookbearer about the TRT plus and all that thing is not the doses. It's not the drugs. It's the terminology. It's the ownership. It's the ownership. It's the ownership. It's the ownership. It's TRT is a therapeutic medical dose into replicate natural levels. That's it. No more. No less. Don't box. Deal. You want to take more? Fine. I'll give a fuck. Take more. But do not call it TRT. Okay. Now, TRT plus, where does that enter in? And where does it enter? Where does the TRT plus end? And you know, getting into? I would say we are anything above range. Probably capped around three, three hundred, three, fifty, make total of eight. Okay. Let me ask you this. If I normally had like 700 tests on US scale and then I get on TRT and I'm pushing eight, fifty. Or let's just say I had 500 tests naturally. Everything feels good. But then I go on TRT and I'm at eight, fifty. Is that TRT plus? No, it's TRT because you're still within the natural range. Okay. See, stop. It's not where you were in comparison to what you were providing because you go on TRT because your test is low. Yes. It's about not making your test super pharmacological in what is effectively a medical prescribed treatment in the sense of what it smokes to be. If you want to take more than TRT, that's fine, but just don't call it TRT. Okay. Because my issue is that calling it TRT normalizes high use in relative to natural levels, not high uses in overall high use because it is a low dose comparative to a cycle. But when you use the terminology TRT, you normalize it. You make it as being correct, legit and there's no concerns around it. Yeah. That isn't the case. So this is why I've got this strong distinction thing around TRT and cycle. Those things are horrible. Okay. And I think then too. So we get into that TRT plus range. One thing that I think people need to understand too is that so testosterone is a hormone, obviously that exists in our bodies, right? And it acts like that hormonal supposed to at normal doses. But when you start getting above that, it becomes druglike. You know, if you take too much vitamin C, guess what? You just pee the rest of it out. You know, it's not like you can, you know, it's not like you boost your immune system with a gram of vitamin C. And if you take 20 grams of vitamin C, you've got 20 times the immune system. You know, there is an element of as you build that testosterone. Now you start getting a drug like a fact super physiological. So we're getting into that range now with TRT plus. You said it was up to you consider 350 TRT plus. Is that like just total hormone or what are you going to start to? That's total hormone. I think there's, I think there's a, there's not a distinct line. You know, I wouldn't say that 350 is TRT plus and 350 watt is cycle. But I would say that, you know, when you start getting 350, 400, close to five, you're now moving into cyclic sort of dosages. Where I could see argument for someone running 200, being a test and I wonder if it's a, as, as a high cruise or TRT. Yeah. Okay. I would probably personally tell you. I'm guessing in, you know, obviously we're just making this up as we go based off our experience. It's not like this is written stone. I would say for me, maybe my line would be about 300. Yeah. Which isn't that off. Yeah. Yeah. There it goes. I think this quite a broad band of crossover depending on the individual as well. I mean, I do know legitimately no people that have to dose 250 milligrams a week to maintain just a mid-operanged natural level because they're metabolism to drug you so I. So, you know, there are going to be people that fall out of these categories. So, that's why I don't mind having like 150 milligrams crossover band where it's a bit. Yeah. Yeah. So, legit cycles that starts then in, in your book today in this conversation at least at anything from above 350. Well, I would say, yeah, you, you sort of 400, 500 and above is where your cycles are starting. Obviously, with the 400 being, most people's first cycles sort of dose in most people are going to sit around that sort of range for a first cycle or potentially a second cycle. Yeah. Yeah. And you can do a lot. I think that's where most of our listeners are going to live when it comes to cycling. You know, it's kind of in this range. So, all right, I don't know if we need one more section or if we need two more. But anything, what's above what we would call like standard bro cycles? I think the standard bro cycle is probably getting run anywhere from five to 12, 1500. Okay, 12,500. And that's total milligrams. So, that's, that's like 600 tests, 600 EQ or 75 tests, 100 EQ. Yeah. And then I think you start getting into more competitive and serious dosings, gram and a half up to two and a half, cap in off of that free. And we discussed this last week that I think beyond three, there's arguably more negatives than the risk positives at that point. Yeah. Yeah. Like cost to benefit starts shifting massively. And there will be exceptions and there will be occasions where a shaker approach or you know, a really high cycle approach may yield benefit for a short exposure. I cannot see any real advantage to anyone going above four and a half, five at any point. That is so much gear dude. But I know plenty that have done it. Yeah. I never wished that. I mean, yeah, I did, but that was deliberate, but I know plenty of people that have got into those sort of doses through experimentation and just progressively overloading what they do. And then ultimately 95% of them have gone no and pulled back down to the sort of two to an hour three. Yeah, you mentioned that last episode. I think that makes a lot of sense because I feel like I did that myself with progressing and hey, if this much did good, what would a little bit more do in you repeat that process over and over until you reach a point where you're like, wow, the benefit of that wasn't as great. And for me, it's like the logistics. I remember thinking like, God, just the amount of painting that you have to do when you get up to, you know, the over two grams is it can be pretty substantial. Well, I mean, at four and a half, I was putting it the most I put in of test was three gram a week. Okay. And that was a four vial. So that's 10 miller-a-a-a week and it is pretty, it's a lot of sites. So you end up daily injecting not because of you want to spread it out and it says if you think there's any benefit to it, just in the case of it's the only way to get all the freaking oil in. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's where a lot of times guys end up doing more site shots, you know, and they get into the, you know, doubts, rear delts by sets into the triceps. I know you did calves, I'd never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. I wouldn't recommend it, but for some reason, I just told right it well. I don't know why, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to the average person because in old theory, it should be absolutely horrendous, but for some reason, I got on with it really well. And yeah, I didn't get on with quads, I didn't get on with glutes. I always had a hard time with quads. I felt like the tissue there is just like so freaking dense. It's not like, I don't know man, there's no give to it. It's not very flexible. I tried peck that didn't do much for me. I tried a lot, that didn't do much for me. And both of those sites, it just ended up pooled in a stain and it was really difficult to go to, to put this first. Whereas buys, tries, doubts, and cause it disperser really well. Also too, you had a lot of buys, you know, like if you were at, what were your arms at their biggest? 13 inch. You see, 13? Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty good, man. What do you add now? Like 12 and a half still? Yeah. Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see, I know you still got it. I've never raised. I've never used to got an arm on you. I've no got much mate. I've no got much. You got a lot, you got a little bit left. As my good friend Dave Calic, you used to say, it was his leftover muscle. He was still a big jack dude. He'd be like, dude, Dave, you look cute. He's like, oh, this is just my leftover muscle. I haven't trained um, five years? Yeah. Longa. Which up what's your name for eight years? Have you trained, it all was that con recently? How's he doing? No, just time. He's, he's, um, so that's all right. I'm seeing him as much as I've like, and I haven't had chance to get over anywhere, because it's just like an hour and a half for me to get through him. I haven't 20 minutes. I can picture him now. Oh, boo, do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a little bit more. But, no, he's just been to time. Time's just been against me for a while now. And I need to get better all good eyes and get back on top of it. But I'm getting it. We gotta get him back on the show at some point. I mean, well, let's just leave you to monetize, but that's. Actually, you know, he'd probably want to come on, because he's done an e-book series. So it'd probably be quite interesting coming on talk about that. Oh, yeah, I think you mentioned that recently. All right, let's, let's plan it. And you guys tell us in the listening audience, couple things. Number one, do you want that con back on the show? And number two, where do, where are your lines in this, like, made up conversation of TRT versus TRT plus versus actual legit cycle of versus like supercharged competitor? I'm curious to hear what our listeners have to say on how those things fall in. Because Dave, like we've talked about it so many times, there's so many arguments about, like, you know, the 10 milligrams anivar is not enough versus, you know, the, the guy saying, the other guy saying that 60 milligrams is going to absolutely obliterate you, you know? I mean, he's personal experiences, well, isn't it? And I think a lot as well, you know, war stories influence this a lot because you lay a guy saying, oh, yeah, I've fought my liver because I took 50 milligrams of anivar and what she's, what really means is I went for a blood test and me all was a little bit high. And I shipped myself because I didn't know what it was. But yeah, there's that. You know, this stuff like that that goes on all the time. I mean, I get people message me about the blood's good. Oh, I'm a good idea. You know, it's just because they don't know so they look at a blood as old as he loves the red and think, oh, shit, he's like, that's normal. That's normal. Well, maybe that one you can do it some about. But that one's normal. Yeah, study show creatin doesn't just fuel your muscles, fuels your brain, research links create into improved memory, focus, and mental clarity, especially while under stress, it helps reduce mental fatigue, supports learning and may even protect long-term brain health. I ordered my creatin from true nutrition, use code think it check out to get 10% off and support this podcast. Power your body and your mind with true nutrition creatin. By the way, this is my actual morning routine mixing 15 grams of creatin into my oats. No flavor, no texture. And hey, since I got married, we stored in this fancy jar so it doesn't look like my wife lives with a bro. But hey, if you're single, just leave it in the bag on the counter. It's totally fine. All right, listen, we got a bunch of listed questions. We got people on the stream too. Hey, shout out to Peter, I own a throw this up there. He says, my favorite pod and I'm catching it live with the help of this channel. I've successfully lost 153 pounds in 10 months. Self-coached and trained the information sheared here is, I think he's a life-changing at the end. The wife's something. That's impressive. That's impressive. Yeah, great job, dude. Yeah, the information here is life-changing and priceless. Thanks for being with us, man. That's exactly what I hope for. You know, it's like it's awesome. I love being able to coach people one-on-one as do you. But you know what, we can reach a lot more people with the channel. And although it's not personalized individual information, if you listen to all these shows, you can figure out a lot on your own. Here's a good question for you out of the chat from last week. By the way, guys, if you want to take part in the next show, comment with your questions. We're going to try to run through as many of these as we can. What's more nanny to stosterone or creatin? Crazy. Is it though? We produce both. Or if we actually, we produce, we produce, we produce testosterone. Do we produce creatin or do we consume it through red meat, Dave? I would say based on adding the two chemicals into your system, the least natural will be the one that has the greatest impact. And in this case, it's you take 50 grams of creatin. You're going to ship from the oven needle, but you ain't growing any bigger. There's that. You increase the dose of test. You are going to get some direct correlation. Oh, yes. Ramana and Danial have got engaged. Yeah, did you cut? Did you come Danielle? Yes, Danielle. Yes. Dan, Beth. So it was a little tough. It was Ramana's 50 if at the weekend of the other day at 14th. And Dan proposed to her. Are you kidding me? Would you say, did you say it was her 50? She's not 50. So guys, that was an inside job. You're 50. You're 56, got so I mean, I guess anything's possible, then. All right. I thought it was 57. And I just shared with you. It was a birthday show on Sunday. She was 40 and Dan proposed to her. And the stupid woman said yes. Hi. Hey, yeah, it's on her now. It's on her. We had a couple interesting points. And I don't know how that. Oh, it was. We're talking about EQ and anxiety and stuff. Somebody said, I've always thought that the mid to high dose provider on would be great for people who come off heavier cycles to get that get depressed and have massive change in their psychological well being provider with DHA and pregnant alone for some or for some other neuro steroids. Somebody commented back saying, provider on his rubbish and he worth doing anything with it. But you know what though, I looked it up and I mean, I entered into my office. It's a mild case. Yeah, it is a mild DHA. It's metabolized by an also tissue. So you're not really seeing an ana, you're not seeing an anabolic effect from it. Yeah, but the only potential I could see, as far as a lot would depend on dosing and I wouldn't even know where to start with dosing would be the potential of low ease of your Oh, yeah, there's that. It's somebody else. Okay. I was going to say somebody else said speaking on an anabolic and mental health stuff. I had panic attacks for years and was on. It was on a benzo a day for 16 years and found out that he had low T after he started T RT. He had no more anxiety. Just in the T RT and didn't need the medications anymore. No, that story several times, particularly UK based because they're very quick to offer out anti depressants. Yeah, right. Rather than look at hormones, I had anxiety issues for quite a few years, but it was down to F3. Oh, yeah, that. Then what you do it. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. So I did look it up, provide on in depression and I did see some stuff that was basically like, hey, antigen's are basically anti depressants. I guess it makes sense, you know, I mean, when we increase our testosterone, we're also increasing dopamine. So, you know, there is that, right? Yeah, I mean, I think the problem is it's a fine line in it before you get an increase in your or an activity. But if it goes to high, you end up with anxiety and over thinking because you got too much or an activity that you can't regulate. I mean, that's one of the main actions from trend with anxiety is it's reduction in stuff like gabba, but it's increasing your or an activity. All right, well, listen guys, if you're new to our content and you haven't seen this show before, welcome. We're happy to have you. This is Dave right here. Hi, Dave. I'm Scott and we would love to have you along for all the stuff we do. So, if you hit the subscribe button and hit the bell, you'll be more likely to see us, otherwise you probably won't see us again. So anyway, either way, we're happy to have you today. And thank you for supporting two mentally challenged individual in the online rumblings. Yeah, yeah. All right, how about this one? I think this guy's having an ACL surgery. Okay, yeah, he says he's currently waiting for ACL reconstruction surgery, which is booked for the 30th of September. So he's got two weeks from the time we're recording this. I want to start a cycle ASP, ASAAP after the surgery to help recovery and repair. I haven't been on cycle for almost two years due to waiting for the surgery, NHS wait times. I didn't want them to deny me surgery because of elevated levels. So I dropped all the gear. I just wanted to know what would be the best to run. I know Test, DACA, and Annavar are highly recommended, but I didn't want to run all of those at once on my first cycle. But I want to get the most I can and put this cycle into helping to recover quicker. Any advice would be great. Just so you know, I have run cycles before my injury two years ago, mainly Test and Master, Winchery Occasionally. He said he started watching a couple months ago and he's watched all the old episodes. Since, oh, and he says recommend recommendation for Dave, since he likes Fizandra, restaurant so much. He would love Hickory's milkhouse, give it a try. No shit. No, he can't. He can't. When you look at the menu it looks really nice, right? It's an American dinner. When you actually eat the stuff, it's all very much the same. It's not really stand out in flavor. Everything has got a heavy barbecue to it and it's just a source. I mean, he's not a true rubbed smoked barbecue. What's American diner, by the way? I just called it diner here. Because it serves American style food. What is American style food? So, for all American style food, these things like burgers, steaks, ribs, barbecue type stuff. I like that. But no, I don't mind, he agrees as a restaurant. He's not a bad place to be, but I'm not a massive fan of the menu. I think it's a bit blunt. All right, what about his ACL reconstruction? He wants to hop on gear straight away. I had ACL reconstruction. Did you know that? No. Yeah, it was years ago, like 97, I think, and it's held up, man. They used a piece of my Patel attendant. So now they'll usually use cadaver. But they used a piece of my Patel attendant from my right knee, strong it up as my ACL on my left knee, meaning they had to flay both legs open for this procedure, meaning my legs were both in splints for 30 days, and I wasn't a wheelchair. I literally, I couldn't walk for 30 days. Now it's a lot faster than that. You're back on your feet, like real quick. Hi, don't think a cycle person needs a good idea. I do think adding supported chemicals is a good idea, but I would avoid a cycle. I see no benefit to it. I would make sure that test levels are healthy. I would definitely look at GH. I would definitely look at collagen. I would definitely look at TB and BPC. You've had some experience with an Avar and injury repair. I haven't, so I'm not sure on that one. I'd just maybe a therapeutic sort of style dose of decade, you know, 50, 100 milligrams on one. So effectively what we've called the T.R.T. Plus. But I don't see any real benefit to running a full-blown cycle because you're not training and that extra level of antibiotics is getting a hard, hard no extra to the recovery. And in an untrained state, antibiotics will weaken connected tissue. So only when we do it, combine with a train stay that we get the connective tissue strengthening. So when you look at the research around antibiotics, they show that they weaken connectivity of connected tissue if the tissue is not trained, but because antibiotics allow for heavier and harder training, if you're training, the actual neck, there's an actual neck gain. So it offsets it and there's an actual neck gain. But I'll see, you're not going to be training that ACL because it's just being built. So I would keep the antibiotics to a minimum and focus on stuff like Grailful, Mom peptides and that side of things. Josh says that it's called an autograph. Those are still done. Worked with the College Football Player who had one a couple of years ago. That's the type I had. That's the notes of Grailful. Grailful. So here, check this up, man. I remember when I got the procedure done, first they went in and they cleaned up all the cartilage. And when they got in there, that's when they realized that the ACL was even torn. They were doing a scope. They removed 90% of the cartilage out of my left knee and they got in there and realized, oh yeah, that's worse. You have torn ACL. So then I had to go back in for that. But they looked at me and they were like, you know what, we need to get that leg as strong as possible first before you go in for the surgery because you will experience muscle loss afterward. And it's crazy, man. So they put me on this machine Dave where you do like it's a leg extension, but it's you can't lift it all the way up and it's hooked up to a machine. It tells you how much how hard you're pressing. And then they said, okay, we want you to follow this physical therapy, which I did to a T. And then come back in I think six weeks and then we'll retest you to see if you've built it up enough. So I come back in six weeks and dude, that's when I realized that I had some level of genetics because I wasn't bodybuilding at the time. But my I remember the short side been wearing for physical therapy. Like my legs were looked normal in a minute first. When I came back, my legs literally were stretching the shorts. And the doctor looked at me and he was like, I was excited because I'm like, I get to do the test again and see how strong I got. He was like, oh, we don't even need to do the test. You're not going to have to do it. We, we, we, you've got plenty of muscle. So anyway, though, after the surgery, it literally just zapped everything. That both legs shrunk down immensely. And that's generally what happens after the surgery. So I could see some level of antibiotics in there being a good idea. But I wouldn't go crazy. Like, I think what he's thinking is, I'm in a blast and do the cycle, dude, you're not going to be able to do any heavy leg movements. This is all about therapy. So I would keep it light, keep it modest. This isn't a big blast. I'm with Dave, TB and BPC, collagen, vitamin C is a huge one. You know, and then from there, maybe a low dose cycle, low dose test with some anovar, 25 a day or a small amount of, you 100 milligrams of DACA, something like that is really all you need, get yourself into a good recovered state. Then if he PCTs, I assume, PCT come off, recover, and then do your next blast. You'll be fine. You'll make more progress that way too. I promise. Yeah, good. All right. How about this one? Oh, nice comment. Professional shelves, somebody says. I don't know, more program they were watching. But yeah, it's just sweet channels, right? You go that rough. Yeah. How about this one? How bad are the health effects, cholesterol, etc. From injectables versus orals, I assume injectables are healthier, but red injectable windstrel is just as bad as the oral form. Injectable forms of orals don't really serve any benefit from their health point of view, apart from the fact that you won't irritate the stomach lining or that side of things. So they're still 17-alculated. They still stress the liver. They still have the same impact on lipids, more or less than might be slight benefits, but nothing that would be particularly noticeable. The lipid argument is a long and varied one. Where's the people still? Very strongly feeling that lipids aren't that much of a concern. I disagree, but I'm open to the fact that that might not be right. Red, red, rubber, or on the side of caution. Yeah. Yeah. And the cardiovascular problem is the biggest problem facing any animal external disease. But generally speaking, injectables are going to be gentle or on lipids than orals, however, dosing is much more capable on injectables. And so dosing can definitely offset the harshness that orals have on that side of health. So you know, 50-minagram of an or 50-minagram of windstrawl, yeah, it's going to be harsh on lipids. But so is 500 pre-mil. Yeah. And probably more so. Because you've got 500 medical hardness, obviously, 1-minagram for 1-minagram, the orals are harsh, but because of the reality of whether doses are, sometimes it's very little difference whatsoever. So, but I'm just to greatly believe in that lipids do play a role in long term cardiovascular health. Yeah. How much directly I know is heavily disputed under the heart foundation has not tied a direct link to LDL being a cause of heart disease, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I do think the HDL LDL ratio is a very important factor in the long term cardiovascular health. Also, this I personally think that orals tend to zap HDL faster than a lot of your cycles. Well, injectable products, but I mean, then we have to look at what are the injectables, like you said, Primo. I think DHTs are going to be more likely to impact your cholesterol, than say a 19-nore or testosterone-based compound. So, like how about test versus anovar? I would definitely say test would be less affecting on your cholesterol. Grant it assuming that the doses were comparable, right? I agree. What you, what you, what you're getting, you got some business here, attending to, did a little work there on that, like, what you doing there, who are you talking to? I'm talking to my Oxford clinic. You had a question that needs it on, so what's your Oxford clinic? It's a clinic in Oxford. But what is that? What do you mean what is it? A clinic. Yeah, where people go to get their bloodstone. Okay, I didn't know. It could be what they think it was. I take my dog to a clinic, too. You need to go to a fucking clinic. I can't find this one, dude. Somebody had a really good point. He was like, hey, you know, I get where you guys are coming from. I think, but you know, you can't really call it just, like, I don't like the milligrams, the total milligrams. Because trend is a lot stronger. I agree. I know. So, if you're like, oh, you're good at 500 total milligrams. We're like, 500 or total milligrams, I'll what? Very valid point. Yes, I agree. But it's the problem is, to relay information in bite size, consumable bits, it has to be simplified. Yeah. And the reality of this is, though there will be somebody, the vast majority of people are not going to do a primarily trend cycle that will be someone that do. I know that. I know that. So, it's going to pop from the feed. I did. Just try to over. Yeah, right. But that's your unique, your snowflake, your special. We recognize you. Ride the short Boston liquid nose. Yes, but, you know, for the average user, most cycles are going to be test based with some females. I guess one, I've seen it. The stew we come in. Yeah. Scott reminded me of stew from family guy. What you were going on there, Brian? Were you going on that novel, Brian? Do you watch her in the guy ever? I have been off for a long time. Yeah, me, there's been some time. It was a great show, though. I'm watching a weed one at the moment called out with the botlons. The badlands are outward out of the botlons. Out of the badlands. We just watched finish watching Jack Ryan, have you seen that? It was like based off of Tom Clancy book. He's like working for the CIA and stuff too. It's a good show. What's this out of the badlands show? Posted up of a public tick. Yeah, that stuff. Victorian art. And there's the area the botlons is split into five regions controlled by barons, very sort of, calledish. And there's a loads of internal fighting. And it focuses around this region who is like a lead killer for what are the barons. Controls is out of me. He basically is had enough for wants to leave. And he's in love with a medicine woman and she's pregnant. And there's lots of internal, treachery and stuff like this. And then there's these dark ones, which are people with this genetic gift that when they get caught, they turn into psychopathic killers. And they're sort of collected by this lead monk. And it's, it's, it says all a bit, there's quite a few themes going on. But it's not the best produced program far from it, but he's definitely watchable. Yeah, I'll have to make note of that one and check it out. Check this one out in the stream from James. He says, hello Dave. Olympia level competitors. How do they have great skin? Well, on gear. What are they taking? Also, there's no, you use zero periods or any kind of punctuation except for a hello Dave period. Then it's just Olympia level competitors. How do they? It's just one big sentence James. You need to work on your punctuation. I promise. Scott Stuggles with this. You've got to be a little bit more. I do. I guess I'm sharing a little bit of an action. And I don't know where to stop. Because you don't know where to stop. There are a few pros that don't have good skin. And I believe Mr Walker's had some problems in the past. Yeah. Although I don't think it's so much fun. I'm sure of what I've got skin. Do you need for a while? Wait a minute. I don't remember him having bad skin. All right, maybe I've had him. Maybe he was amateur. Well, then maybe I've got that wrong and got it mixed up with some materials. All right. But yeah, I mean, even the pros sometimes have bad skin. I could be wrong too. I don't know. But obviously, I think the difference, the several differences between a true career and your average builder. And one of that is a true career. I wasn't going to work every day. He isn't getting himself in potentially a dirty environment. Everything else goes with that. And their skin appearances part of their presentation. So they know they have to manage that because it's part of how they look. And nobody wants to see a pro showing off a physique if they're covered in zits and acne scars and the rest of it. So there's lots of elements to this. I think potentially there's a genetic element as well. If you're a top pro, you have the genetics to be a top pro and in part that will be tolerance of skin infection the drugs. I think acne is not such a big issue. As it used to be, we'd draw gifts anymore. I think we've got a better understanding of how to control these things now. And so unless somebody is particularly sensitive, he's not something I see coming up anywhere near as much as he used to. So I think in general we've moved on a little bit with quality of products and understanding each other management around its effects on skin and DHT management around its effect on skin. So I think there's a few factors. But I also think that some pros probably have quite heavy skin regimes to keep it up by. Yeah. Yeah, you know, not in kind of one of the things you touched on is that not everybody is genetically predisposed to acne. And that could be a genetic trait for like making you a good bodybuilder. You know, you don't like Ron Partlo has said, like I didn't really ever have stomach issues. So I can't really relate to you. It's like, yeah, I felt bloated because I was 300 pounds. But, you know, he didn't have stomach issues. Just like, you know, a lot of guys are like, I never had acne. Just never was something that came up. No, I never had an issue with acne. No, it's not one now and again, but no, not actual outbreaks apart from when I got the real deep relationships from the face, which was, was true, but it was stress, true toxicity, not hormonal imbalance issues. Yeah. I think too that we learn to manage the compounds that's part of becoming a good bodybuilder, becoming a pro or just becoming an experienced, you know, seasoned vet at the game that I think early on, we start breaking out and we're like, oh, I'm just going to keep push in through this. You know what I mean? Or you get Gino and you're like, ah, what do I do with this? But you keep taking the gear, you know, how do I get rid of this? Like, you know, you kind of figure out how to manage these things. And especially after it happens once, then you're better at being able to catch it. Like, oh, now I know I'm prone to this and you can adjust. Be it pulling the doses back, be certain compounds, be it the nuclear option, running acutane and potentially like Dave Pellumbo's talked about it. I used acutane as well that it will permanently change the amount of oil, the sebaceous gland pushes out. Yeah, so yeah, and yeah, I think that those are all factors there. Also too, once you put the tan on and you can kind of hide acne, you know, there is that there's this lots of factors. I think as well when you're when you're more or should say less experienced, what's going to say more naive is one of those so long to immerse it. As long as you're when you're less experienced, your your cycles are much more precious to you when there's you've been cycling for a number of years. You're not so opposed to stopping a cycle short because things are quite going out. You want them to go and you understand that actually if I stop this now, regroup and come back at it, I'm probably going to have a better situation than if I try and push through it. Right? So, and I think that comes with experience and time where you're much more milling to walk away from a cycle even though it's not finished. Whereas I think when you're in your second or third cycle, you're still very much, I have to do the 10, 12, 16, whatever weeks I've planned, I've got to do them. I've got to stick the course. Yeah, absolutely. What are you just doing? Well, I got this product from a parabolic and I haven't even opened it yet. They sent me this. I'm so you decide to do it half with you. You're moan about me answering a question to a clinic and you're sat there on wrapping early Christmas presents. Well, this is a it's topical copper peptide. I don't know if you've heard about copper peptide, but it's being used for skin regeneration. This is a do you have some skin that needs regenerating? Yeah, dude, I'm 57. Remember? 58. Now, so what skin are you regenerating? Your false skin? That's gone. Long gone. I am going to, uh, I'm going to, am I doing a little rejuvenation therapy? We'll see if I look younger with it. I'm going to try. I'll keep you posted. I'll keep you posted. Why not just spend 79 cents and get a filter? But I can do that cheaper. Just put a piece of Serenir app over the lens about that. It's been improvement. Oh, thanks, dude. Thank you. All right, I'll keep you guys posted though. I am kind of curious to see what this stuff does. We're not in the best. I know you're not at all, you know, by the way, somebody had a comment. Please tune into drugs and stuff for Scott Skincare routine. Hey, dude, this is bodybuilding, really. This is bodybuilding, Dave. You remember last week you mentioned something about, uh, I thought bodybuilding was lifting weights and taking drugs. Okay, gone. I mentioned something about what a god knows. I took all sorts of shite. Um, he, okay, I can't find it now. But he had said that he had, uh, what was it? The, the whole thing with you, you had asked last week about SLU in the new peptides and will that be an excuse for people to be able to like run more gear year round. He said, well, you know, a lot of these guys are using it now. So the proof is going to be in the pudding soon enough because we're going to start seeing the results. Are we seeing guys with like substantially better labs? You know, I don't know. The thing is, it's taken probably 10 years for UC's trends to actually start to present in health concerns now. Yeah. I think some cases five. Um, so, you know, we've, we've used thyroid meds for years and we've always been very much of the opinion thyroid's pretty robust. You can pretty much hammer it. It's going to be fine. And now I'm starting to see people with thyroid problems. Not loads, but more than I used to. Okay. So we're genuinely seeing people start to have thyroid issues from low and toe mix, exposure to stuff like T-13. But that's taken years to become an issue. So I do think we're probably going to be a good five years down the line. If we do see a trend to more long-term higher doses, support at buy these anti-oxidin peptides and that sort of thing, I do think we're going to be a good five push years down the line before we see any result from that sort of behavior. Yeah. Yeah. I can tell you this. So UC Sumas with us. He's been using it and he just finished a long contest season. A third show this past weekend shot out to him by the way. He looked incredible. Climate mine. He's with us right now. And he had been using redda and SLU. His labs looked fantastic six weeks into DHB. And now we're going to get labs tested again. Like they were his best-ever labs, you know, on cycle. So you know, in a prep. So we'll see, you know, we'll see. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's going to be interesting. Yeah. I've got no fall gone conclusion at all. I have just no idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's going to be interesting to see how things went out. But for Stania also adds on the acne thing. She said vitamin A is pretty underrated as a preventative supplement during cycles reducing oil production. She's definitely right about that. I'd say you were a good little old school trick as well using hadn't shown his don't have shampoo as a body wash. Your mic is really loud today. This like all the. Oh, that. I don't know why. I'm just I don't think it's your fault. It's always my fault. So that's that's for a specific type like, um, is it fungal, fungal-based acne? It works. It drives skin. So it works for a lot of I'm not saying it kills it completely, but it does help keep it under control. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen that too. Also, um, if it's DHT related, Nizoro 1% shampoo is good. We have to get a prescription for that here. It's also good for, I wouldn't say hair restoration, but you know, maintaining hair. Hmm. Hey, you handsomes? You get on gear, young and stupid and say, no, I don't ever want to have kids fast forward 15 years meet the girl your dreams and you're like, shit, I want to have kids. Could you guys go over the best ways to restore fertility on TRT? Mate, you don't want kids. Trust me. You do no one kids that are a little expensive bastards. Stay in fertile. Get a rabbit. All right. So. Get a rabbit. I have it stink dude. I mean, they're cute. So kids. Yeah. That's a good point. Generally, I would look at, I've stick to our T to being quite straight. I don't think there's any real benefit to running it slightly above or anything about nature. I do Hcg somewhere around the 300-hour you mark. Monday Wednesday Friday or every other day. And then HMG 75-hour you, Monday Wednesday Friday, however, HMG is not cheap. So if you're struggling for the cost point view target it for like a week, 10 days prior to when your partner is most fertile. So you're given that sperm the best kick you can before you actually want it. One grab of our carnitine at day will help with sperm mobility and make them little bogus swim better and fit many. Okay. Yeah. What about, uh, did you mention Clomed or uh, and Clomed? No, I, so I know, I think Clomed Clomed is definitely very good for female, by the way. So I think a lot of people don't realize that. Got to be careful with it though. That's all the quickest way to have quadruplets. Yes, I say you could also have multiple birds with Clomed as well. I was just about to say that. But um, I'm, I'm on the fence how effective Clomed is in a TRT fertility, sea scenario, definitely in a natural fertility scenario, but I'm not sure how effective it is in a TRT. Okay. So I'm working with a guy who um, just came off everything for the past several months. In fact, we literally just started back up on cycle this past week. He got the go ahead and the clear from his doctor. Um, but they're in a fertility program. And so he's been off using, uh, I believe he was on Clomed and he's working with the doctor, but I believe he was working with Clomed and Hcg and he's been off all testosterone and he's maintained all of his muscle dude. He's maintained his body fat. In fact, he's maintained his strength. He never had a crash because of that combo. Um, I think if you're off Clomed on Obedax, he's, he's, he's a very positive movie. Yeah. So I'm just going to throw that out there to him that we're afraid that like we have to come off all together. I mean, he wasn't making massive strides forward, but he, he made some good progress still. Like, and he, he maintained everything. Because here's the, the, the, the, the, kick in the pants of it. Dave, like we started working together. He started making tremendous progress. And then his wife was like, hey, let's have another kid. And then all of a sudden in the middle of all of this, he's been on T.R. T. forever, right? We've run cycles to, you know, together, working together and, and now he's got to come off. And I was like, oh, man, this is going to be the end of everything, right? No, no. He like maintained everything and kept getting stronger. So don't be a afraid of potentially even coming off and running a program like that worked for him. I've seen it work for other guys too. But there is that, you know, and hey, if it didn't work, let's see, you get six weeks in and you're like, oh, God, this is just awful. I feel terrible, you know, then you could always go back on, right? Yeah. And I say, it's, I don't, it, it depends on the individual person at the end of the day. There's no, a lot of people think they have to come off and they don't. But you can obviously try it and it's not going to do you any harm. Yeah. But at the end of the day, if you come off and you can't get it up in the first place, you might make your no kids do my arm or spoon, you'd say. Yeah. All right, we've got enough time for a couple more here. Hey, guys, we're going to the show. Thank you for this channel. It's been an amazing source of information. Thanks Bob Gladwick and help you. He says, I've had Guy No from Peter, Puberty. It's not horrible. I'm going to start running test, G. H. Slow taper 30 milligrams a day of probe to start in two. I use of G. H. Testing bloods after four weeks, increasing 10 milligrams, depending on how the results differ from my nanny blood work. See what I can handle before my E2 starts going up getting out of range before I began raising the G. H. 2. I have a rummissen Nova cable, T-ball, mass P, test P, G. H. On hand, any recommendations to mitigate size would be greatly appreciated. I was considering picking up some anovar in doing a low dose 10 milligrams a day for my first cycle, for the length of my cycle, for the drive muscle connection and health properties or healing properties. I also have SS31, Rada, on hand when I start to lean bulk again. I think he potentially have a thinking this. Yeah, I like that. That's a little bit long-winded. So, away from the main topic, Reta, I'm a bit like, do you really want to be used? Reta in a cut scenario, get it, understand it, not a problem. I'm still a bit confused about using retarine a bulk scenario. I understand the improvement in blood glucose management and rest, but that can be achieved in other ways. I don't understand why you'd want to draw that suppresses your appetite, even though it is the mildest of the 3GLPs when you're trying to grow. So that's just a throw away that puts at the end. I can respond to that. Okay, well, Lana. I will say that there are additional health benefits too. Like, the toxic in the liver, keeping yourself if you're in tip-top shape and your insulin sensitivity is high. Oregon health is great. And you're able to, what I'm finding is it's dose dependent. So, like you mentioned, it's out of the the 3 common GLPs, it has the least effect on appetite. And generally in bodybuilding, I'm not seeing it being used higher than maybe 2 milligrams. There are people using more than that, I'm not saying they're not, but at least 2 and like the people I talked to, my coaching, I've been around 1.5 to 2.2, and occasionally 2.5. But we don't really go higher than that. And we're getting good effect in a fat loss state. Down to 1 milligrams in a growth phase, I don't really notice much changes in appetite. I'm not going to do anything any benefits in the growth phase of the industry. It's hard to say this early in. Yeah, it's hard to say whether it'll be worth it or not. But I'm not seeing it take away from people's ability to eat. And if that were the case, there's been actually, you know, what I take that back. I had a client two weeks ago, Massage Me. And this was the most perplexing message he said. I'm having, I can't help but cheat on my diet. This guy is always 100% years. In fact, he's one of my oldest clients. You see Summa, I've literally worked with him for 10 years straight. This guy met, this met or you see Summa met me through this guy. So I'd been working with him on and off since before Matt. Anyway, so he's always been 100% he said my, my, I've been cheating on the diet and cheated on like three times. I mean, having our time to control myself because of the redder. What? So is that, do you think that's a case of that you get an initial mile suppression? And then as the reds are starts to die off because you're not doing the three condos in the, you get in almost a rebound in up and toe. He's in a growth phase. He's eating a surplus right now. So it didn't make any sense to me, right? I had the same look on my face that you just did. I dug in further. Here's the deal. He said that his appetite is so blunted. He has zero, like interest or ability to eat his clean food. The only, so he's starving that the only thing that would remotely sound okay to put in a stomach or things you have salue loves. Yeah. That's a final. We pulled the redder, he's back on. But yeah, in general, I'm, I'm not seeing it have that negative effect. I am seeing it being a fantastic tool to get somebody like to key it up to be super insulincensitive and start barking. But yeah, time will tell whether the one milligrams of difference or not. So sorry, carry on. Okay. And then the other thing was I was just going to say, I think you're overthinking it and being a little bit overcourses. I appreciate that you don't want to listen to the guy know. Yeah. But I think a preventive measure of nova dex would be a start point. And then I think you just need to, the thing is you're going to do four weeks and you're going to test and you're going to put a little bit and you're probably going to, you'll be 12 weeks of messing around before you actually got to a dose that's going to do anything. So I think you're going to start a bit higher going a little bit harder, but just bucket it with a lot of nova dex. At the end of the day, you're not going to develop guy know instantaneously. You're going to get information primarily first before this tissue formation. So you're going to get a warning. I might not be the longest of warnings, but it's not going to be an instantaneously fact. So you will know if it's coming and therefore you can address it. So I would be a little bit not care three, I think that's the wrong approach, but probably a little bit less cautious in you are being thought I'd do understand why you are. So what would you say would be a reasonable plan here then instead? Well I wouldn't use prop for a start. Yeah. And I would probably start. I mean it's his first cycle. It kind of sounds like it is. Yeah, so I'd probably, I'd probably be cause of the guy know issues. I'd probably start for a minute and not test a week. Yeah. And you would run nova dex with it. Mm-hmm. Okay. And I mean you could even get away with also running say 12.5 mg of rumours into ice week on top of that because we know it is going to be elevated each year not free 100. So then anything we don't know is sensitivity levels, but if we've got nova and a little bit of rumours in just to take the edge off tested four or five weeks, you know, I'm just from there unless you experience any sides prior to that. So like 20 milligrams nova dex is a standard tablet. Would you use 20 a day or half that or oh, I'd start with 20 a day. Okay. There's not real negative at that point. Yeah. And you're only talking in four or five weeks so you get your first test in and see what you are. Yeah. So four to five weeks get your labs run. I bet you he sees low low estrogen if he's doing all that with 300 tests. You know what I mean? It's going to be a big, like you said he's overthinking it. It'd be a big worry for you know. I understand why. I mean I think anyone who's experienced guy know naturally is going to be incredibly cautious about using antibiotics because they don't want to trigger what they feel is a pro. But often Pew Best and Guy know doesn't carry into other world as well. I mean I know plenty of people that have at Pew Best and Guy know they have no issues in management issues in other worlds. So there's you know he's not that sir that he's going to carry through. I did more so earlier on in bodybuilding and I just feel like the sensitivity isn't what it used to be now. You know or maybe I'm just better at managing it or recognizing it before it's a problem. Well I think when you take it's grown out big you've got no choice but to accept the tests now so you don't know he's this little difference is anymore. Day spoke about conditioning work during a bulk slash blast would hit training three days a week with a sandbag along with sprints be just enough to keep things moving but not so much. That's your mental returns. I would say so yeah. That's why they 25 minutes each session. That's brutal man. That's brutal. You guys are going to be hating you by the time he's done with that first session isn't he? Everybody I used to be. Is that your uncle's was him for the day? No I've actually I've saw a got some. You're kidding me. No I sent you a message about it. Oh you did that's where I even forgot you but that helped you remember. Yeah. I can't remember what I sent you. I sent you a message about. Yeah me too. I can't remember either. Let's see here. Do you remember we're going to talk about? One was the B light water. Okay. That was one thing I sent you. I know everyone's going to know what that's Bruce Lee which is Bruce Lee and that's exactly where it came from but I'll explain the background to that and then the other one was some of that are speeding fine. Speeding camera and Sweden? That's it yes. Okay so I'll start with the first one. Dave said. Who am un-for-a-d. This actually happened. So in Sweden. Seven. They changed a speeding camera so that it didn't issue points or notifications of fines to people that's spread. Okay. What it did is it financially rewarded people that didn't speed. Oh wow and it proved to be so much more successful. I'd be rich right now because I do pretty good. And the real thing. So and like my reason I brought that up was that it makes a very, very valid point that though fear of repercussion or discipline will cause people to perform you will always get better performance and more long term performance if you reward good performance. But the key is that you reward good performance. You don't reward adequate performance. So as say you employ people or even in just the people you work with you maybe a team manager, you should expect a certain standard of performance from your staff or your team. And you shouldn't make excuses if they fall below that because they should be a minimum standard that they're achieving but if they go beyond that you should reward that. That will not only make the person that achieves of them beyond be a free, feel appreciated and wanted and being encouraged to do more it will also create inspiration in the others to step up to perform more rather than a punishment mentality which just forces people to do enough to get through without getting bogged. Yeah. I could go with that man. That was that one. And then the other one and I haven't read the book in the slightest. It is sat at the side of my bed and my wife put it there for some weird reason and it's the Bruce Lee book be like water. Well written by his daughter actually. But I got thinking about what he meant by be like what? Now I don't know if this is Bruce's philosophy on it. It may well be or it may be slightly different of come up with me. I'm sort of version of it but to me, the I water is actually quite a nice little sort of mantra because if you like water you're always striving to move forward. Okay you're always progressive. If you like water you will mold yourself around obstacles so that you can continue to progress rather than waste your time dealing with an obstacle which in most part is going to take a lot of effort or be unmovable. And the other thing was that water erodes problems slowly. Yeah, but it's powerful though. It's powerful. Yeah. Yeah. Look at the Grand Canyon. The only time water to relax reacts harshly is when you hit it with a blunt force trauma directly. And I feel that that's a very good way of approaching problems in life. If you have a problem in life that presents itself you work your way around it so you can continue to progress but be mindful of the fact that you need to erode it one way or another. But if something blocks your passage completely and sharply then you meet that with equal force. So you're not a pushover and you stand up for yourself when challenged but if it's a non-challenge and obstacle just work around it. Don't make a mountain out because it doesn't need to be. So just work around it but also work on removing the obstacle long term. Yeah. I think that is more or less what he was doing. It was like the flexibility or the adaptability of water, water and water can get into any crack there is. Water will get into that. No, so I just got me thinking about it and I thought, well you know what that wouldn't be about little chop for the show. So there you go. This book called Dr. Zeus. Yes, body mind mastery by Dan and he is a sports psychologist. Great author too and he wrote a book called The Way of the Peace of the Warrior that they made into a movie which is really good and it just me to the idea of mindfulness. Great movie if you want to see it for like super super great stuff I think that we can all learn from and it was based off of his own life too to degree. He used the analogy of like being a rock versus bamboo. Bamboo like a stick of bamboo out in the field is super flexible that the the snow will come down on it. Bamboo will bend. It has that flexibility versus the rock won't. So the water gets in between the cracks and eventually it will break down but the same kind of idea of like being being malleable you know. One of our listeners who just competed at the wings of strength show rising Phoenix Kate Ananzio. She had told me at one point she's she's her job titles basically a change expert she works with individuals and companies to help them embrace change basically and she said that the most successful people are the people that are the most resilient. And it can be hard to be resilient and change like awesome somebody a diet change Dave and sometimes they're like oh god but you know what do I do it's like well you need a half cup less rice you know but I already have my food prepared you know yeah what just take that half cup out you need a half cup less you know and if you're pret food and change it when you're pret food is done yeah yeah it won't be the end of the world. No I'm a scott will shower yeah because he's he's now yeah one day is not going to make a difference but yeah I think we all do that though you know we can be like resistant to change like I'll get caught up and I'll be like but but but but but but if I really think about it I'm like wait that's not a big deal at all yeah I think we all do that I think we all react emotionally quite often to change and you know where I get she's sitting down looking at me I get caught up with driving because I don't leave the house a lot so I'm like well crap it's already four o'clock Dave I don't want to go up to the store now because when I drive home it's going to be rush hour and that means I'm like dude what does that mean it means I might be on the road for five more minutes is it that big of you don't I mean but I'll talk myself out of having gone to the store I'll be like oh wait till tomorrow I'll go it noon it would be a lot better then I think we all do it to various degrees of various things but yes yeah I'm about for that as well I like that guys leave us questions for the next show and you know leave us a comments too do you do a like Uncle Dave's advice did you learn something from Uncle from your Uncle Dave today I want to know leave us questions leave us comments tell Dave that he's loved because he needs to hear that and his life he doesn't have a lot of people that tell him how important he is so he he needs that encouragement okay he doesn't think he does he doesn't want it but he needs it all right also you know what I do need what do you need I mean Patricia no I need my glasses to sell you face straight you don't need a supercharger anymore oh I still need a supercharger but no the glasses will not sell on my face straight and it is really annoying that I'll be I notice that is it that one of your ears is maybe an inch taller than the other I think I've just got one key hey I think it's just one ear is up here maybe we appreciate you guys tune it in check out Strauss portion nutrition go we've got all the stuff links below by the way supplement source.ca for Canadians Trinutrition.com code think and of course eveble at analysis.com go over there get your lab done by Dave if you're in the UK you guys have places set up all over England don't you and more coming we just wait in for the API to be set up so we can log in but yeah okay how about the the uh is I like to call it pillars a gear do you guys have are you doing any uh any course when in the moment the next one starts probably beginning to middle of October I'm also at the gasp event at fully pub gym on sunday okay with Nathan styles and Phoebe Goodwin and a few of us and there's gonna be a Q&A in some of it some that's going on oh no kidding you're gonna answer questions I am a Nathan and we're doing blogs as well so yeah it should be a good little day that sounds like a great day I think there's a lot of gasp goodies going through as well are you gonna wear a gasp shirt while you're there no yeah I guess that would make sense when they yeah thank you to everybody from patreon we appreciate you guys oh Dave I forgot let me ask you one more what you pull me super charger yeah I got a patreon question I want to make sure I got this one on from Nick so last last five minute crew um would there be any benefit to introducing oral compound or low dose of trend like 70 milligrams a week at the beginning of a bulk cycle for the first four to five weeks in a bulk or would it be best saved for a cut and maintain healthier bloods plan is to do an 18 week bulk followed by five weeks hold then 10 to 12 weeks cut testing EQ will be there for the duration of the 38 to 40 weeks cycle where NPP will be used during the bulk and possibly adding in more other compounds in the cut such as an oral trend in mass have decided yet and determined by blood work no yeah I agree it's already got a lot going on there doesn't yet you're already planning why I have to work I would not be putting toxic stuff in other than yeah even it low dose I wouldn't bother with it you you don't need it for one and if you get it I'll add it towards the end yeah guys for another episode of the podcast we'll see you soon thanks Dave

This is exactly what this is perfect. This is all you need to see. That's all you need to see is my intro. Yeah, the Martin's throwing up, right? Yeah. So yeah, that's just that's all you need to see. Brett Brett is where it's at for K. The world needed. My generation needed during and Lee wrote. Yeah. Then the next generation needed branch and Johnny. They were culturally required to keep things healthy. Yeah. And you know what's like what's like demographic. Yeah, it's like what happens to this society if rock and roll music isn't there. Yeah, it goes in. It goes a straight. It's like if you don't have too much Michael Jackson. Yeah, you don't have guys like this. You know, you don't have these guys in this in the pool with everyone else. Yeah, the world isn't right. Hey, everybody. Welcome to It's Just Body Building. I'm a big round part. On the road home from Miami and not with us right now is our friend Dusty Han Shah. So it's just me and Scott the producer holding it down. Remember to like share, subscribe and comment and ring the bell. Yes, beautiful. Okay. So Dusty's gone. That's okay. You guys have done a few with help me. We'll just be really efficient. We'll just move through things. We'll blast through some. What have we got? We got a fun topic. Then we got some overunders. Yep. Yeah. We have a bunch of listener questions. We're ready to reiterate it. I mean, the main topic is five body builders that you should be following their training. Yes. I took a poll before the show and by took a poll. I mean, I talked to a handful of my clients. Guys that train really hard. All right. I'm the anonymous and I said, hey, who would you say everybody should follow training was? And they threw out some really good stuff. People I would have thought of of course. And then, and then a couple of it. Like I was like, oh, yeah. He's definitely on the list. Here's the thing to run. There's a bunch more people that we're not going to mention today because there's, you know, there's so many good trainers out there. So I want to encourage to as we get into that topic. Anybody at home anybody who's not on the list tell us who else should be there. And if you can think of any honorable mentions along the way, you're welcome to, but yeah, we're going to leave a lot of people out today. I think on that. Well, I did one more extension of your poll. I asked my training partner. Okay. I got it. You ready to ask the story. Ready? Ready? Live. Nice. Now I'll get one more person's input because I thought you know I forgot to ask. Braden. And we'll see if he picks one of the five that we already have here. We've got a bet. It's like three of the five. I guarantee. Because like the people that you've got back on your poll. Yeah. I'm like, oh, I bet Braden's like, that's one of the reasons I wanted to ask him. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I did, too. It's like I know that, you know, these guys train hard. They're going to come up with some good answers. Should we just jump straight into that or jump straight into it? And it was funny. Obviously we didn't have a lot of time to go over this list, but it was a quick list. And as soon as we got it, we're like, oh, yeah, all these are great answers. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here's one guy by the way that's not on the list Ryan just commented. Summer felt has a great channel. Yeah. So we don't have him on the list. We're already down one. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Great. Maybe it'll be a predictable list. But we'll see. I'll start here. Let me see who I can grab first. We've got, uh, who is this? Who is this? Oh, that's an obvious one. We're not going to go there. That's another obvious one. Let's go here. Let's go here. Who is this? What do I got here? We've got a hollings head. That's a classic. Yeah. No, definitely. So I tell my clients to follow hollings head. Yeah. There's more than one person on this list that I do that with. Yep. But I tell people to follow hollings head just because, you know, not only kind of coach for him, like, you know, like his my friend. Yeah. But I've trained with him multiple times. So I can vote for like, you know, whoo. He can do all that shit. You know, like, it's not that's not a special day for him. He didn't get, especially psyched up for that moment. That was just an old leg day. He's feeling good. Figured I'm going to put seven up to feel it feels, you know, but yeah. Yeah. Real badass, like good combo of badass mentality with like, you know, the hardcore training and all that stuff that we love as an element of getting good combined with constantly constantly thinking and tweaking and making adjustments and trying to, you know, get the most out of his training. So he's great to watch. He's just by the way for our audio listeners. We're watching a video of him just wrap out seven plate squats. You know, not a warm up, but, you know, it doesn't look like the hardest thing ever. Perfect for man. Like, and you know what to. With the kick spot. You got to throw it out. It's his wife's bottom, right? Right. Yeah. We just had a reaction video to him on Blood Sweat and Gear the other week. And he mentioned he was like, you got to, you got to be married to this thing. Like, you got to get in there and show up every workout. Yeah. And that kind of reminded me of something. I thought of that because of something you said about like, this isn't him just like getting up for the camera. Like, this is the way he trains. And I've heard that before. Like, I remember hearing Foo-A'd say, If years back now, he said, like, if you came in trained with me, you know, like, you could get up for it. You know, maybe you take some extra pre workout. You prepared. You made sure you got all your hydration, all your food for a few days. You're getting ready. And you keep up, you know, but to train with a pro at that high level every single day. Yeah. Every day. That's the exact same thing. That's what's really impressive with guys like this, you know. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. And I remember that exact Foo ad quote. Do you? Right. Yeah. I do because he was like, like, if someone want a contest, they could come and train with me and they train legs and they'd hang. Yeah. But we got back tomorrow. And then we got shoulders Thursday. And then we had chest Saturday. And then there's legs again on Monday. And you got to be here. And if you're five minutes late, I'm really irritated. And then we're off to it. Like, it's like, you know what I mean? Like, it's not just, can you train with me? Can you train with me? Can you hang with me? Can you do extended business with me for an extremely long period of time? Yeah. All right. I got another one on the list here. And we got another good one. I guess we're staying in the UK for now. Got a little bit of a kuba challenge. I know. And you got a couple weeks out. Yeah. And you got to get the funny thing is as soon as you said, hey, I got an idea for a question. Yeah. And you told me, I was like, oh, well, kuba's name is going to come up. And then you listed, you're like, some names came up so many times. And kuba's the first name he said. Like kuba's name kept coming up. And I'm like, yeah, of course. And he's on this channel. But that's because we associate with like minded people. So it's no super. That's it. Man. That's it. By the way, we tried to get kuba for the show today. And he couldn't make it because it is eight past eight o'clock in the England time. And he is asleep at 8 p.m. That's his bedtime. Right. Yes. Look at that. Look at the speed on these negatives on this pendulum squat. Boom. Yeah. And you know, it's funny. I know that there's a lot of, you know, the science-based community now is saying, like, the negatives don't matter. Just don't matter. Yes. The only thing that negatives do is drain you of strength for your next rep. Nope. I guess that's okay. Nope. I think they can say that. But even if the negative doesn't contribute, I still think the best idea is to control your negative completely so that you can put the most torque on the target muscle out of the bottom. You know, that you don't get that, that, you know, bounce reflex stretch. Oh, last one. I'll ask the response. Yes. The last response. Yes. Yes. And I know we use that to our advantage when the reps get tough. We use a little bit of that. Yeah. That's how athletes, that's part of being, that's an athletic thing. That's a, yeah. It's a nervous system, neuromuscular. To help make something easier. Yes. It's a neuromuscular skill, really. Yeah. So I know we do use it on the hard reps later. That's very advanced thinking. But I think controlling your negatives is going to be the most efficient way to put stress on the muscle when you do the rep. So even if they're correct and there's no link, which I don't believe we can conclusively say that at this point. No, we can't. I still think it's best to control them and, you know, that's what Kube is doing, you know. 100% man. This smart guy smart guy minimizing the trend now that we've all come to learn our lesson. And I, I hope that trend that trend with a D. I always get you that confused. No, whatever he'll win does. I hear what I want to hear. Yeah. Yeah. I know. And the thing now is everyone's trying to minimize risk. Oh, yeah. And I think my generation had like gladiator mentality. I will admit that we did a lot of other shit. We took all the risk. And I like to think that the next generation can learn from that and minimize the risk. And that's what you're seeing with all the machine training now, the really smart controlling movements. This is all with where this is all rooted in just minimizing risk to extend your years, you know. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let me see what else we got here because we have us. So that's, so with it's five and four in no particular order. Let's see. There's James. There's this one. We'll go to him. All right. Let's go here. Here's here's a good one. This is Brett Wilkin. Now Brett Wilkin. I would say that he is. I would say he's. This is exactly what this is. Perfect. This is all you need to see. That's all you need to see is. Yeah. The Martin's growing up, right? Yeah. So yeah. That's just that's all you need to see. Brett Brett is where it's at for. Hey. The world needed. My generation needed. Dorian and Lee Roy. Yeah. Did we need it? Then the next generation needed branch and Johnny. Yeah. We're culturally required to keep things healthy. Yeah. And you know what's like what's like demographic. Yeah. It's like what happens to this society if rock and roll music isn't there. Yeah. It goes a, it goes a strain. It's like if you don't have. It's too much Michael Jackson. Yeah. You don't have guys like this. You know, you don't have these guys in this in the pool with everyone else. Yeah. The world isn't right. And I like to take the, you know, they're doing crazy shit. And, and, and, and, and when you follow these guys, what you're going to get. I think it's important to follow someone who maybe does some formula stuff. Yeah. So you're exposed to it and you're going to see that in the list. We've kind of see that with Cuba. Cuba's very. Very. Yeah. Like, hey, I wrote down that forest rap and I wrote down that. He's very on that, right? Yeah. I think these these guys, I think Brett and, you know, obviously Martin, I think they're a little bit more, hey, I'm not quite fucked up yet. What do you want to do? Do one more thing. Right? Yeah. Right? Like, hey, we should do one strip set on the like, press to finish. Like, one more. One more. What can we do on this set? Like, you know, I think there's some, we need some. Got into wishing involved in that. Yeah. You know, in a little bit of like, say to a massacism, you know, there's also a little Indiana Jones. Where could we go? What's, what's on the other side of this rap? Like, I see, I see all these guys is like, there's like, you know, if they're holding up part of what bodybuilding is, you know, it scares me because I like these guys a lot. And I want to see both of them do really well. You know what I mean? But I understand they, and they're safe. You know, they're not, they're not doing anything like stupid. They're, you know, but they're, they, they, they are, you know, come on, mother fucker. Yeah. Yeah. And then we, the world needs a bit of that as a home Saints guy. Now, I'm with you, man. I'm with you a hundred percent. You know, all right. We've got two more on the list here. And like I said, guys, we're only going to have five people here. And we need you to tell us who else belongs on this list. Yes. Of course, we've mentioned him so many times. You guys knew that he had to be here. And I had to pull up the T bar row, the chest or the T bar row. Because when I think about a chest supported T bar row, I think about Justin Shire. Like that's what I'm doing. Yeah. This is the way it's supposed to look. You don't know. No, I know. Justin's a guy. I tell all my clients to follow him. Yeah. I'm like, if you don't know how to do an exercise, just go on this guy's Instagram and just scroll until you like see it. Cause yeah, he covers everything. And, and, and then you saves me like a hundred text. I think I think Justin saves me about a hundred text with every client. Yeah. I do a lot of time. Yeah. I do a lot of time. Yeah. It saves me a lot of time. And the best part about Justin is I don't pay him at all. So it's all free to you. Yeah. I mean his fault for putting in the stuff out there for free. I mean, he could make this into an app, you know, just him training. Be like, you want to see my row? You don't just subscribe. Right. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. It really is. The level of control that he has in this stuff is incredible. And it's in everything he does, you know. I want to see if I can pull up. What else do we have here? How about this? I haven't much to leg press in a while. Let's see this. You know what? I'm really noticing Ron. Everybody Brett was doing it. You're going to see Justin doing it. Much more depth on the leg press than what we used to see. Yeah. You know, and I think it's for the good, honestly. I remember when Blood and Guts came out and we all saw how deep Dory and actually went. Yeah. Because he sinks so it's pretty good. And on that side on the side, right? I remember we all were like, oh, got it. Like, because I was like taught this old school like going to 90. Right. Right. You go to 90. You don't want your hips to roll at all, which is true. But if you got good hit mobility and you got some good ankle flexion, you can get deeper than that. Yeah. And so I remember when we all saw Blood and Guts, we were like, oh, we're on the right track. We're doing the hacks all the way. I'm smashing the hacks and everything. I was just misquadding all deep. Like I was always like that. But the leg presses were purposely sort of like, you know, just touching my chest with my quads a bit, right? Yeah. And so yeah, Justin is full range of motions. He's using one of those hustler pads or whatever. Those are cool. Yeah. They're cool. I mean, on our prime, we have that, we have the prime leg extension. I get plenty deep on the last hole. I put it all the way to number one and I'm like, it's deep as I need to put B. Yeah. Imagine that pad helps if you put on another setting and you need a bit more room or I mean, he's got shorter legs, so maybe it really really comes in handy with him. And you could put it on any machine. This strivet might be not quite as deep. I know my leg press or excuse me, my extension, it doesn't get quite as deep. So I have to, I kind of like scoop forward in the seat a little bit. You don't even extra. Yeah. Yeah. My legs hang under it a little bit. Yeah. Justin's a good follow. I just textbook form, you know what I mean, controlling everything. Massive weight is the key. Yeah. He's talked about that on our programs before is that it's not just the form, but then it's, it's get that first, but then learn how to load it. Because if you, I think in most cases run, if you try to emulate his technique on any of the stuff, all the sudden you're stripping back three plates less than what you were doing before. And his hamstring deadlifts are very respectable. Yeah. But he's doing like, you know, almost five plates, four and a half plates or whatever he does for hamstrings. But the way he does the reps is just like, yeah. And if you want to emulate that, you're probably going to have to go real light at first. Everyone else is going to play it off theirs. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. All right. I think one more here. I think, yeah, we're cooking through the list here. We've got one more. And you guys would probably already have to have known that he was going to be on the list. I mean, Nick Walker, everybody's been talking about his training now for all the 2025. Yeah. His, I feel like this is like, man, what you tell me, what do you think run, but I feel like he is like so self-actualized now. Like he figured out, I've seen him since back in the day. I remember the first time I met him. And when I say met him, the first time I interviewed him, he was an amateur still. Yeah. And I remember him making a trip over to Coach's garage and training there, you know. And picking up some more high intensity stuff, reducing the volume and really kind of plugging in with getting the most out of the list. Now that was, you know, huge step forward for him, but I mean, now he's taken it to an absolutely different level, you know. Yeah, I, I tell a lot of people to follow him and watch him train. Yeah. Because like, I find with myself, I get a little stuck in, you know, because been around for a long time. I think everyone who's been around for a long time goes through this in every field, like whether it's, you know, whatever your expertise is, whatever you do. You, you, you think, oh, everyone knows this. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like everyone knows that by now. Like I, I thought that back in the 90s, but I know that that's not true now. But then you realize, no, no, that's a new thing for every person. Every person who's new to bodybuilding has this certain misconception. Yep. It doesn't go away because it's because it, so I forget that some people don't know certain things. Yeah. So I, I, I tell them I'm like, you, you know, was, because they say, you know, next got six plates on the leg press, what's what, like they don't get it. Right. Right. Oh, you don't understand, what do you mean you don't get it? Like you see where the way he's moving it, you see what he's doing. Yeah. And I'm like, oh, shit, not everybody understands what's going on here. But I, so I think it's good to be exposed to it is my point, right? Yeah. Around about point. And next six plates equates to your two and a half plates just to, you know what I'm saying? Like when you figure that out, like you really do have to find humility to train with control. Yeah. So it's, yeah. And when you said actualize that was like the perfect way to put it. And I also sort of thought of when we interviewed Nick on the show a little while ago. Yeah. Yeah. Remember thinking like, you know how the, you know athletes have their different phases. That does. Yeah. Yeah. You know a lot of athletes have their different phases. Like with Ronnie, we have like, you know, his, his before he was a Mr. O phase where he was a cop and then we got the Mr. O phase and then we got the, you know, the post to retirement phase. Like, I feel like Nick is in a new phase this year. And he said self actualize that was like, that's a perfect way to say he's up the bald head. Yeah. So he's got this new look. He does. Training's changed. He's way bigger. He came on had this, the killer shows this year. Yeah. You know, like, it just feel like he, he shifted a bunch of gears. Yeah. He's sort of, sort of like his character has changed. Like, you know what I mean? It's like it's like five years later and another another movie comes out and the character is different. You're like, oh, what's going to happen? It's almost like two of you think about the way the history of bodybuilding works. This is like the Lo Veroni with the shaved head. Do you know what I mean? There's going to be like, oh, are you talking about Nick Walker with the flat top or yes? Yes. Or with that glasses and the shaved head. Or yeah. That was a good Nick Walker. You know, I mean, young flex and he got older. Yeah. The shaved head was like, took on Ronnie, right? So I just funny. It's like it really is like visually and metaphorically and in the training. It's all like a new, a new, new version of Nick and Nick and so, but the training is the training zoned into like he's just, you know, every rep is identical. Yeah. There's no. That's one thing I want everybody to take home and I see that it, you know, Ron, I think to that's something I've taken for granted is. As you call it, and I tell people this man, I would say, I'll say the guy that I podcast with my friend and I podcast with Ron, I'm a part of the heart low calls at robot reps and that's what I want to see is try to make each rep identical. That's a skill man. You don't just decide to do that in now you're doing it. Like that's as Stefan said last week, you have to train yourself. It takes time to get to that point where you can do robot reps, you know. I'm making any movement identical over time with repetition is an athletic skill. Yeah. Yeah. You know. You're controlling your body, right, and you're memorizing a pattern and it feels the same every time. Yeah. So shout out to these guys. These were the five that I had pulled together in the list. Who did Braden come up with? It's funny. So right before we did our list, I asked Braden and he said Brett Wilken, Mark up. Shire. Mark and got a mention in there. Yeah. Mark on a mask. You can't do Brett without, you know, Martin. Yeah. Yep. He said Cuba. Cuba. He said Hawling's head. And so it's funny because I asked him for five guys and he gave me six. Okay. Yeah. Who's the six? Meadows. Somebody else mentioned Meadows too. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Bill. My client Bill mentioned Meadows. He said he's watched so much of his stuff. I do. I learned so much from John by some of your, you know, back in. I remember Ron, there was a time that he was posting on just some of his ideas on professional muscle would show up. And I started following those ideas and trying to translate that into my own workouts. This was like 2008, 2009 maybe. And I tell people like, oh, I'm doing Mountain Dog training and people were like, oh, is that like, like dog crap training? And I was like, no, it's something different. And honestly, though, the thing is is that because I was taking these bits and pieces, I wasn't actually doing real Mountain Dog training, but I was doing what I thought John was. And I had some of the ideas down, but I had some of it wrong. And then later, I had the opportunity to really nail it in. But yeah, John is a great another great example. He, uh, it's funny. I have this video on my phone of John spotting me on Pendulum. Yeah. From 2019 the last time he was when he came to my gym. So he trained legs together. Yeah. And it was me and Braden walked in to train legs and John Meadows was standing there. Oh man. And I was like, how's like, what are you doing? And he's like, oh, I'm in town for the, the van, you know, the shows. I came up to like, I met the supplement booth. Yeah. And I'm like, and he's like, I sent him a message. And I looked on Instagram and there was a message I hadn't seen yet. Oh man. And he's like, I was going to ask you what you're training. I said I'm doing legs and he goes, let's do it. So he just did legs, I spontaneously and Braden showed up like a minute later. And yeah, you know, he was, we had just started training together. And he was kind of newer to the whole scene. And he, I mean, Meadows, he was like thought Meadows was like, way up here, right? So he was into training. And he's like, what's going on? I'm like, we're training with Meadows today. And he's like, you know, so is awesome. Because we smashed the leg workout with John and it was great. We had a fun time to pitch yours and stuff. Yeah. I still have a great man. Like, you know, you got to train with because of me. I can't really. We got to train with Scott McNaly. You know, you know, I'm dead. And it's actually. Chasmic, but I'm said, me Naly a couple times. You have to train with me Naly. Oh man. I do what I do when I hit the compound though. Next time I'm in town, man. I got it. I got it. Definitely. We'll go hit the compound. All right. So once again, guys, everybody in the chat, I want you to let us know who did we miss. Because there's a bunch of good guys. We already know that we missed Mike the badass and there's a bunch more. So tell us, you know, and tell everybody else. Share with everybody else because there might be, I mean, for a lot of us, we're just enjoying talking about these guys that we enjoy seeing training, right? Yeah. And I've enjoyed talking about some other names that people throw them up like. Is there might be? There might be. There might be. Yeah, I don't know these guys. You know what I'm saying? So you might be educating somebody, you know. And that's going back to what I was saying where I just assume everyone knows stuff. Right. So like, you know, and we, and I think a lot of people who do podcast run into that, like, you've talked about things a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you start to wonder like, well, we've already talked about that. But you know, realize there's a whole new group of people who didn't haven't heard that yet. And I remember John speaking of John actually said that to me once. We were talking and it was off air and everything and he was like, man, you know, sometimes I'll do just an exercise. I've done for 20 years. And I posted it in people say, oh my gosh. Yeah. You've just, I've never seen that before. He's like, I just don't even think about it, you know. Yeah. So I'm okay. You know? Yeah. No, I know exactly what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, who do we got here? Oh, she suggested Jordan Hutchinson. Oh, yeah. Of course. Of course. Of course. Good job Brian. Yeah. Hey man, his partner. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys are, those guys are awesome. All right. I've got to follow up for you. This came from YouTube. And Ron, these guys are always welcome to comment on YouTube. And comment on Spotify, dude. I got to tell you, man, you ever find, this is my analogy, Ron. You ever like pull your winter jacket out. You've been working on it more than a year. And you find like a 20 in the pocket. Oh, yeah. Dude, we set up Spotify back when we started the podcast. And I hadn't been checking the numbers. Spotify is like blowing away everything else on the audio podcast. Like, we are getting a lot of views. I mean, I'm sure that there's other channels that are getting more. But it's around like 50,000 views, 60,000 views per month. So like, it's pretty freaking incredible. Which is like 60,000 on top of everything else that I didn't even realize when we're getting this whole time. So that said, I'm starting to take questions from Spotify. All of our content is also released on video now on Spotify. And Spotify is now our main host for the audio podcast. So you can watch videos there. And that will get set out to iTunes or Apple podcast and all of that. So anyway, segue, Ron, into that question. Is this from YouTube? You guys are welcome to leave comments, questions for the next show. Can you best describe the first time someone showed you how to take your training from intermediate to advanced or expert? What were the main differences that made you realize how most people train compared to how a pro trains? So I had no shortage of like, I was very early to develop into a very hard training pretty darn good form bodybuilder. Like, I was pretty much out of the box within the first six months. I was really early to develop into essentially like 80% of what I was as far as like how I moved weights and really went a failure and forced doing it. I've come here for a strap. Like, I had no intensity shortage at all. Yeah. Like, at all. I was trying to kill myself, trying to out train all the kids I was training with. I hated six. I got to get seven. I got four gets seven. And I'm like, you know what I mean? Like that's sort of mentality. Yeah. But when I was 19 and I went to Australia and I met John Davian Nick Jones. I started training with my two Australian buddies. They were much higher level. Nick was you know qualifying for the world when national classes, you know, John was on the verge of being a pro. He was a big heavyweight. So these guys were like the level above me I competed yet. And when I started training with them, they did things like we were doing press down one day and I remember John was like, get your shoulders back. Like you're you're you're coming over way too much just too much. And pack in your press down. I had control of it, right? Like I wasn't flailing all over. I had control of it. But my form was like, lots of torque on the packs really heavy. So I remember John moving the pin down like dropping off like 40 pounds off my press down. And being like, keep your shoulders back. You know, use your triceps not as much like, you know. And I remember just him like adjusting me on things like first week in the gym training with him. I remember, you know, remember Nick like you got to like when you do your leg extensions, you got to try to like almost try to lift your leg off the bench like that little extra. You know those little things. And I realized that they were paying extra attention and still putting the same intensity out and still getting more reps than me and still stronger. Like, oh, okay, I got to like correct and like get certain things, you know, like I was just little things, but it was a lot of those things. And I was like, oh, there's more like precision. They're more precise than me. There's a level of precision that goes with the I'm going to kill myself. Yeah, right. You know, might have to add it down. But there's a level of like of minimizing risk without realizing that what they were doing. And I think getting more out of that target muscle, like stuff I was saying, like you can pump up everything, you know, or you can try to get that pump into that target muscle. I remember we were Smith squatting one day and I could Smith squat four plates, like no problem. But I was dropping a little too fast and getting too much kind of bounce out punch out of the hole. Okay. And I remember like John was like, take a play it off. I remember that and I was like, that's three plates. That's the same thing. I'm not squatting. But he like, yeah, you do. You know what I mean? There was an ego like ego thing. I was 19 years old. I wanted to turn it to big guys, right? Right. But I'm vividly remembering him saying, I'll take a play off for your next set. I was like, oh, but I did what I was told because he was. You listened. Yeah. Well, yeah. That's another thing. Those two guys are way better than me. So if they told me to do something, I didn't argue. Yeah. You know, you were in a good spot then man, because sometimes I'll work with somebody and I'll even like, local guys, I'll bring them over here and we think they're telling me like, oh, I just squatted six plates last week. And this and that and I get them on my hack squat and I have them crying with a plate and a half because we're controlling to super slow negative. Posing in the hole. All that stuff. But then they go right back to the six plates and you know, it's like, come on. Let's let's see. You got to learn that. Maybe they have some point. Yeah. Yeah. Take a little bit of this back with you. Yeah. Yeah. Just a little bit. I don't expect him to take a hundred percent. But like if you could have taken 40, you know, you get a lot from it, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I just remember them kind of showing me that there was like, there was intention with everything. Like, yeah. You know, yeah. Oh, somebody mentioned yours has a great channel too. I can't wait to see him. Yeah. When did you show? I forget the date for it, even. I do too. Maybe you guys. We couldn't let the audience tell us. Like, a lot of snow. Because it's going to be very interesting. Apparently he's like 35 pounds heavier. Yeah. I'm like ready to go like just, yeah. Yeah. I'm excited to see what they do, man. And this is, it's the Italy, right? Yep. Italy. 2025. Oh, it's the flex, it's a flex pro. Oh, no. No, it's not. Sorry that seeing this event has passed. Oh. What's coming up? Well, while you're looking that up, I'll say that I, you know, I was lucky to get trained or taught by my parents with lifting, because they already were into weightlifting and body building to a degree. They never competed, but they were, you know, real active in it. And, and their good friends were bodybuilders. So I started learning from them from the time I was a little kid. But a lot of it, Ron was like 80 stuff that it just, it wasn't right. You know what I mean? So I had to kind of like relearn some of those things. And I did a lot of learning on my own. But then having a chance to train with like after my first contest prep that I trained with my coach. And he showed me some things I had never thought of before. Like I, we pre-feteed the packs. I had never done that, you know? Right. And I had spent the whole previous year getting a strong as I could on, on a barbell bench. And now we're going as hard as we can on the Pack Deck first, which completely is after my strength, right? But I ended up getting strong again, you know? A few months down the road, that strength came back. And the next year my packs were substantially better. So I started seeing that kind of thing. Or I think I told you the story of, I incline bench press the 90 pound dumbbells. And I was telling John Simmons at my gym. Yeah, man, I got the 90s John. I'm going to go for the hundreds. And he was like, well, how about you learn to take those 90s instead of 10 reps? Learn how to get it for 20? And I guarantee your chest will grow. You know, and I'm starting to realize over time that, yeah, maybe it's not all about the weight. You know, although I will say that a lot of what I had been indoctrinated with was more volume. I don't think you ever went to that place, did you? No, not totally for crazy long periods of time anyways. I tried a lot of stuff out. Yeah, I also remember one thing that I tell people that I think there's a certain type of bodybuilder that has a bad habit of getting too locked in to the routine. Right. And there are the type of person that it actually takes fun away from the whole experience. Like maybe like a friendly run into it the gym is doing arms. So he do arms with me. He's like, oh no, I can't do arms with you. I'm doing like a super set with these two and it doesn't work with two people and you just go. Like I was like, I'll think that's a shame. You know, because I got a lot of great workouts. Like I had a lot of days where I was like, okay, let's say we have a good workout. And then something happened. I wound up training with somebody and had like an awesome workout. Yeah. Right. And I just think that that's, I don't know, that's just something that I hope everyone can have. So I always tell the story one time I remember I went to the gym and I had to work like. So I wasn't going to train with John and our buddy. I was going to train by myself. But then you know, your hours get changed or you get off early or something. And I show up at the gym and they're literally they're warming up. Oh, no kidding. Perfect. But I had already planned to train by myself. So I was like, I was like going to do this other thing. So I went over and I was like warming up on this one shoulder press. And John comes over because he come train with this man. Like we're doing this machine. And I was like, oh, wow, you know, I wanted to do this. And he goes, oh, okay, if you don't want to get any better. I remember I just like, I was like, okay, I've come train with you guys. Yeah. So like, put my, you know, pick my stuff up when I return to them. And then we just want to have a great work or yell at each other and shoulder pressing. And shoulder pressing heavy. And but it was just like, you know, I just just always makes me remind me of like some people get a little too in their little head, you know, have some. Yeah, you know, you know, you know, you know what to man with that. Like, I've been in the position and this is like life in general where I had to teach myself that. If you're having a bad day, you can start your date over at any time. It doesn't have to keep being a bad day. You know what I mean, very important. If you're having a bad workout, like it. Run all these things. The workout is a metaphor for life, you know, it really is though, you know, you can start your workout over and maybe it's not going to look like what your expectations were, but it can still be like a kick ass workout, you know. Yep. Yep. You can. The next set. Yeah. You can change your mentality in your mindset. And you can decide to have a great workout for the next two exercises. Yep. And then you got to go because you got to go to work or whatever. Yeah. But you can change the trajectory of what's going on. You can call an audible. You can. You know what I mean? It's all sorts of funny things that have happened. Like, I remember going to film a mutant video and I was like warming up on legs. Yeah. And I hurt my, my quad in the warm up in the warm up. I'm like, fuck. So it just like, well, okay, it's arm day. We're doing arm. So I remember I ran cut the sleeves off my shirt because I'm not that shirt. You had your leg day shirt. I had my leg day shirt. I had my leg day shirt. I had a little over some mutant shirt for tea. You know, so I thought, fuck, I couldn't cut my sleeves off there. Because doing how we're doing arm day at this gym, you know, just pull an audible and just fucking ruin my day. But solve my day. And then while I'm having a great arm workout for the video and I remember listening it after going, I looked better. I wasn't ready. Like I never sprayed tan. I thought it was going to be too white. Yeah. It was a plan on arms. I love it. I love it. Oh, Ryan chimed in again. He's got another one for us. He said, you guys can't forget Sean Clarita. Oh, yeah. There's another one. Great information to the list. Obviously, there's a lot of our friends would be on that list. Yeah. You know, it was funny that how many names came up repeatedly. Immediately. Oh, yeah. Because you asked like an hour before the show. Yep. You know, it was like all just repeats. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, the show is September 7th. So this weekend. Okay. So we'll find out what's going to be killer. What do you think? I do you don't have, we don't have the list of. I got it right here. Oh, you do? Yeah. Yeah. Who's all in it that we would know? Oh, well, I mean, it's pretty big. Okay. Yeah. Will it? Good veto. Good veto. That is a mirror. I mean, I mean, Good veto. Good veto. Good veto. I mean, guys, man, well. See, how do we know? Errors, obviously. Yeah. Mark Hector, Quentin, Quentin Maria. Cuba, Andre Carlale from Brazil, Roberto Bonomo, from Italy, Tim Budashime, Louis Brede. I'm a big fan of Tim. I know. His conditioning is out of this world, man. Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of guys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're just doing it. So yeah, it'll be interesting show, man. Some big dudes in that, like, you know, Tim Budashime's, I mean, almost big as they get, Quentin. I mean, it's going to be awesome to see those guys standing next to each other. Yeah. Yeah. And Sergio, man. I'm excited to see what he does. Really big. Yeah. People don't realize, you know? I saw him compete at the 2018 Chicago Pro. Did he win that one? I think he took, he took second to me. Okay. What's his name with the crazy quads that he's just like other level, just genetic? I'll think of it. Somebody, somebody maybe chime. I got to look it up now. When you hear his name, you're going to say, like, oh, yeah, of course, you know, you put in, let's see if I go 2018. Because Sergio is very big. I don't know if he's six feet tall, but he might be six feet tall. Like he's big, like, you know, Michael Lockett. Oh, yeah, Michael Lockett. You know what I mean, genetics. That's the first thing that goes to my, yeah, Michael Lockett won that one. I remember Michael Lockett at the North Americans at year. I said, oh man, I go. I didn't expect to see you here. And he goes, yeah, just decided to do the show three weeks ago. When I was like, oh, really? And he's like, yeah, I just like hopped on my diet real quick. Yeah. And his diet is like, stop eating McDonald's. Right. Yeah. Just, you know, clean it up a little bit. Yeah, Justin Rodriguez was third there. Oh, yeah. Red rope was competing at that time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of going on there. But yeah, I just remember he looked incredible. But I also say Sergio was the crowd favorite. Right. He's like Chicago boy. And he had a song that referenced Chicago and his posing routine. Right. Everybody was pumped for him. It was almost as if Michael Lockett was the bad guy that night. You know, for having been showing up in the wind. Just not from Chicago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's fun. I love it when a crowd has an opinion, though, instead of being a dead crowd. Yeah. You know, like, hey, you know, it makes a bodybuilding show fun of people at least cheering. Yeah. You know, it's, I remember when bodybuilding shows used to be quiet in the morning, except you yell at your friends when they're doing the crowd. They're doing the compulsories or what's going on. No, who the friends are. Yeah, you know. Yeah. It's hit the quads. And everyone's yelling. And then at the night show, it was like pandemonium. Everyone would clap and cheer and yell. Yeah. And, you know, it's we complain about how bodybuilding shows now are just groups of people leaving and coming and on their phones and just, you know, yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't, don't leave in the middle of a posing routine. I hate that. Yeah. Yeah. At the night show, let the guy finishes posing your team then get up and get out of there. The, the biggest compliment that I may have ever gotten was from a friend of mine, Sarah Bruce and she worked with Mike Davies and that's when Mike was running the Arnold Amateur. And so we were in the press pit at the Arnold Classic and Sarah was sitting with us and she was hanging out with VJ and I, the whole weekend. And after the show, she said, VJ and Scott watch bodybuilding shows the way most people watch college football. Like we were like, God, look at this leg. You know, we're screaming though. We probably look like idiots, you know, but I really don't care. You know, that college football. Yeah. No, that's true. I also had a conversation with, with someone the other day about how we used to like, we used to dress like dress down for the morning show and then we dress up for the night show. Yeah. We've mentioned that before. Like you used to be a real thing. Yeah. You know, dress up for the night show. I threw some jeans on. You know, this five. Absolutely. All right. You want to jump into some of these listener questions here. We had a bunch of questions. Yeah. We had this. And then I know, you had some overrated underrated. Yeah. Let's make sure we save time for those because Victoria came up. By the way, somebody said, you guys mentioned these people like Victoria and Steve. Can you mention last name so that I can follow them too? I was like, oh, that's maybe a good idea, right? That would probably have been vigorous Steve in Victoria Felker. She's a brilliant scientist. You guys should all follow her. Yeah. Yeah. So let me see what we've got here. Okay. How about this one? This would be a good one for you. Question for the next one. What are your top most iconic bodybuilding pictures of all time that come to mind? Minor J09 quad stop, Tom Plats and Lee Priys tricep flex. And of course, the iconic Dorian Yates front double bicep in the gym with the socks on. Right. Those are all great ones. This is Lucas from Austria, by the way. So there's the iconic tricep one. That's a classic. Right off the bat, right? Obviously. I like the way Tom Plats is yelling in that. Yeah. And I love how he's got the big beyond belief sweatshirt on, which was like a training booklet back then that you could buy a training method. Big beyond belief. Here's the diet. Here's the workout. Yeah. Did you ever, did you read that? Did you follow it? I read that. Yeah. I've got that big protein shakes in it and everything. That was the secret meal for. It'd be some crazy blender shake with three chocolate chip cookies. I think that was the book. No, yeah. Yeah. So what else, what else, what do you say? He also said, of course, the J 2009 quad stop. Yeah. That's a classic. I think this one is a classic. Obviously, the video is even more of a classic. But just this image alone, like, you know, they say sometimes you can hear certain images. Like certain images have a smell. Oh, yeah, body. Right, body. And that's Ronnie on the lake press for audio level. 2300 solid ass pounds. Remember, you got the lake press all loaded up there. Yeah, that was a classic. That's one of the ones that always comes to mind. Okay. I'll show you the Dorian one that I wonder if it's going to come up if I just, Oh, fuck it's so funny. Man, AI in Google now, the searches. Oh, yeah. So easy. This picture to me is probably, while there's two here that are like, the most quintessential Dorian photo. I'm going to blow this up, so it's not quite the whole picture. But this photo here. Oh, that one, huh? Yeah, this to me, this photo, I remember seeing this picture of Dorian. Because you can see his gym. Like, it's not, you know, he's not lifting anything in it, but you just see he's like, looks like he's walking towards that barbell. It's what the kids would call a vibe run. It's a vibe. That picture is a vibe. And that's why I remember it. And I never forgot it. You got to get the Zuba pants, the teenikele shirt. Total vibe. You know, he's got the Nike's on, like, you can, you can tell, like, it's 1994. Like, there's no paint shipping off every day or 92, maybe 92, the paint shipping, you know, it's clearly a shithole dungeon. Yeah. Look at the floor, you know, and you just, you get a feeling off that that was like, I remember seeing that photo in the magazine, when they were kind of talking, I guess it would have been early, yeah, it would have been like 91, 92 when he was coming up, and they were really trying to sell him as a character in the magazines, you know what I mean? Yeah. And they'd show these photos. And then this one is another one. It's like the same era. It's like the exact same story. But like that photo to me was always very iconic. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. You know, what about you? You got one that you're thinking of? You know what? I do. I'm going to see if it just pops up here because it's a pretty common picture. And it's a studio picture, I believe. Oh, yeah. Okay. You know, and this is like, this is real early. Here we go. It's this one. This is when I learned about at the time, modern body building. See if I can get that to show up. There's an awe. Yeah, I'm not. It's Lee Haney. I can't get it to kick it. My favorite. I have too good of a camera to focus there. There we go. I got it. There we go. Yeah. Nice. So because I remember, you know, watching pumping iron. I had this with my dad and his friends as a kid. And then, you know, I was like, oh, you know, Arnold Arnold, this is Arnold that. And my dad's friend told me he's like, yeah, but so Arnold's retired now. And there's a new guy. He's even bigger. And I was like, oh, it's like, this is the guy that everybody's going after now as name is Lee Haney. And then I just remembered seeing him on the cover of magazines from their forward and getting those magazines and taking the the fold out pictures out, you know, and putting them up on my, we didn't have a finished basement. So it was like a painted cement wall in our basement. And I tried to like take tape, you know, like scotch tape and stick them up on that wall. And then it'd come peel and down a day later, you know, but that was that was my, my little gym set up. But I had a couple pictures of Lee up there at that time. And yeah, never did capture that physique for myself. But. Wow. I don't think very many people did. Right. Right. I also got to give a mention to this whole series. And I know there's a bunch of them. But I mean, this this series was iconic. Okay. And it was a whole generation, but that Frank McGrath shoot. Oh, dude, that's funny. You say that because I was thinking of the animal stuff. Yeah. That black and white animal shoot that Frank McGrath did back. Man, that would have been what late 90. No, really that. I thought it was like, oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. He would have turned pro and 03. Yeah, I mean, I got my year's grip. So Frank turned pro and 03. So yeah, oh, eight. Yeah, I was like, I hold decade off there. Yeah. Sorry. It happens. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't even know who he was for like five years. I just saw the pictures. You know what I mean? I saw these arms. And I was like, oh, and they had the the mood to it too. Like him, you know, there's like him sitting at the table. Like with his food while his girls lay in the bed waiting for him. He's like, oh, he was not going to. He's like all these real hardcore tropes, but yeah, like she's waiting on him hand and foot. You know, she was like, no, no, like she's she's waiting for him to like be with her. Yeah, but he's like, he's busy. Yeah, he's busy. He's busy. He's doing the work of a body builder right now. We go there. He's doing the work. Doing the work. Yes. Can't miss out on the work. Do we vote for him for having some of the best arms and best four arms in body building ever? I remember when I first met Frank, he had those four arms and I said, what did you do for four arms? And obviously, I do terrible. I can't do an impression of him. I'm not going to insult him. I try to sound new feet, but he, he did it the time. Have a much thicker accent because he was fresh off the rack or however they say it. But I remember he fakes this forearm. He feels like I got to show off my forearm there. Yeah. Yeah. Flex is for him and he goes, me daddy has bigger me daddy. I remember he said me daddy. Yeah. I was like a new feet and go, I mean daddy's got bigger four arms in me. I remember just thinking like, oh fuck. Okay. I get it. Yeah. You're just better. It all makes sense now. Yeah. It all makes sense now. Okay. I see where this is going. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good call. All of those pictures. In fact, those were things that like you had flipped through the magazines and you'd see what the latest ad was. It was one of 10 pictures. They did a really good job at that time of like selling an idea selling like a mindset. Totally. And I also got to say like, you know, looking back on all the years. I spent really huge and heavy and you know, all that sort of stuff. And I think to like Frank walking around looking like this, he probably only weighs two 45 here. Because he never got crazy heavy, right? He wasn't huge, but he had the freaking arms. Yeah. So Frank could walk around at like 235, 240 in a tank top like this all year. He imagine just going to safely looking like that, but he's only he's only like, he's only like 235 or 240, right? So it's not like that hard to do. Yeah. He's probably eaten three meals a day with a shake, looking like that. Maintaining that. Right. Right. And so like who had a better decade? He did that for a whole decade. But he's a smart one, right? Like you know what I mean? And you just think, yeah, you just think back like, you know, it's just funny. Yeah. Yeah. You know, easy. But I'm over here like how many more sets do I need to do for arms to even remotely look like I, you know, train them? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I know. No. That was a good question. I like that. That was a great. Good. I've got one that will, I think be a nice follow up to that. Give me just a second to kind of dive through here because this will be like I said, but we kind of have this whole like running theme here today with the questions, which is working out really nice. Okay. Let's see. There's another one. There's a few good ones for you here too, round the thing. This goes in the category of episodes that won't be good on Spotify because they will have to see the focus. Sorry guys. I think our listeners know the pictures of Frank McGrath. Sorry audio followers. Yeah. All right. Okay. Follow up to that up to date. Who's the best Canadian bodybuilder of all time up to current day? Paul DeLette. Ian Valier. It's to, well, statistically Ian Valier. Statistics. So yeah, he won the most shows. He won the Olympia a bunch of times. He's most consistent. Yeah. Ian Ian. Ian, Ian, I think it's. It's no contest, isn't it? Okay. Well, let's not. Like if you're looking like, you know, when they say who's a greatest, you go while Tom Brady's got seven rings. So Tom Brady's the best. I think Ian didn't need to do more Olympias in Paul DeLette now. Didn't need place higher at them on average. Didn't he do like all the stats? I think so. I would personally vote for him though. He's, he's probably my favorite. I would say. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no offense, Ron. Sorry, Ron. You know, besides you. But as far as, as far as like guys that I thought were like, this is like, I just saw potential in him of being like, oh crap. This guy could continue doing this and, you know, actually went in Olympia. Like, I saw him rise from nothing. You know what? I'm not nothing. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? You know what I mean? You know what happens every time someone turns pro 21. It's either like, oh, okay. It's either the next J. Yeah. Or it's not. Yeah. Right. And then you just wait until it happens. So, and I, I remember when like, nobody knew who he was. And I saw something about him. And the only place there was any coverage of him at all. There was like one interview with Paulumbo. That was literally like all I could find online. Right. And I don't know if you remember this, but I talked to you. And I was like, hey, can you connect me to Ianville year, the Canadian bodybuilder? And you're like, oh, yeah, I know Ian. And you connected me to him at a dinner interview with him. And I think for me, that's the personal thing is like, after that, then he still was. Like, I mean, it's like, you know, he, I don't think, I don't think, It's like, there's Ian and then there's this girl Melissa and this guy Chris. You know what I mean? That's like kind of the way it was back then. Yeah. Yeah. And this guy, you know, he's going to do classic. I remember those days. This guy Chris. Yeah. Yeah. This guy Chris. And to see where all of them, you know, came from and where they went to. It's kind of cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that question, though. I remember hearing like, I remember hearing Foo Ed and all the guys talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think they said the same thing, you know, It's like, I can't be like me. Right? I look pretty good in Tampa. You know what I mean? I was really good here's the photos. I got the photo. You know? I'll be honest, Foo Ed always kind of intimidated me. Like, I saw, I didn't meet him, but I saw him. There was like this geared up gathering into trait. And he was working with me at the time. And I was friends with John. Yeah. But I wasn't friends with Foo Ed. I didn't really know him, you know? And, but he was there. He was like, this big, dude, he was freaking huge. Yeah. Yeah. Massive, right? He was hot. And John was like, hey, they cracked open the garage door. And they were like, hey, you know, pop your shirt off. Let's do some posing here. I just remember hitting a rear lat spread. And just his imposing size, like his height and width in everything was just like, wow. Yeah. He had Foo Ed did everything he could. Yeah. He looked really good. And he was big. He had, yeah. He was thick and had like, you know, that depth to his torso. When you see guys, you know, like, oh, that's a, that guy said could diesel burner. Yeah. There's like that. Yeah. Like there's body builders. And then there's like, guys, it's fucking big. Yeah. And he had, he had moved into that zone. Because I've been around body builders in my whole life, right? Some guys aren't that, they're not huge in person. They look great on stage. But in person, you're like, oh, yeah. He's got a great physique under that sweatshirt. You know, and then there's other guys, you're like, oh, it's guys like thick. Yeah. Yeah. You know, heavy ass squatter, heavy deadlift or, you know, I don't know. I don't want to say that's just because that's why, but there's just some of the train hard is fuck. Yeah. Yeah. That was a cool event though. I remember that Justin Harris was there too. And there was a bunch of pros. It was at Ken Jackson's gym that he had here in Michigan. And everybody kind of gathered up together and got a work. I got a workout in and then there was like a Q and A afterwards that we talked a lot about at the time. It was like how much highly brain cyclic doctrine can you drink in one workout? Was pretty much the sum up of that air that hole there. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that era. I tell you that I trained with haulings head one day and I tried his drink. Okay. And I wasn't used to it. And it was like the hardest leg day. Oh, God. Yeah. James makes me up. And I'm like, what are you drinking? And he's like, oh, I got that cyclic cyclic dextrin with with the sick with the. What's the pro the peptopro pro? Yeah. The peptopro the catalac of. Yeah. The peptopro. Yeah. Peptopro with with branched chain cyclic dextrin with like other amino's added and probably some creatine in there and all shaken up. And when drinking this one, I'm trying to legs and it was rough. Yeah. I, yeah, I poked my guts out after we trained the end of that. That's good. Yeah. I imagine that was the wrong day to decide. I'm going to try some highly, very cyclic dextrin. It was probably like a big serving too. Yeah. I remember James was like, you got to work yourself up so you get used to it. Right. So I thought, well, I'll start like a bit diluted from what he does. It wasn't nearly in. I was like, oh, so sick. Yeah. We worked up to the time. So I was training with Shelby. And Shelby and John were good friends at that time. And John was all about the intro workouts and we're doing John's training. John was writing the plans. So we started pushing the, and they're long workouts, man. So when I said I got involved with volume, like leg days were like going on three hours. Like they were brutal long workouts and hot summer days and stuff with low AC. And our bad AC. But we worked up to like 200 grams of carbs and short workout for those. And you'd have to have like a gallon jug to like almost full, you know, to get through that and not get a stomach upset issue, you know? Yeah. Fuck. Done a lot of dumb shit. Drank a lot of dumb shit. Like on paper, like we're all this'll be great. Yeah. Just funny. Yeah. It was expensive too, man. So you can imagine. Oh. I remember when I did that, that Bulgarian power split training back in like 91 or 92. I just followed this Bulgarian power split program that I got out of Flex magazine. Yeah. And it was like you do like a 40 minute workout. And then you take like a 30 minute break. And I had to do with like your cortisol gets, it doesn't come up. It stays down or something and you get like a surge of GA. It was all this. It was okay. Okay. And this whole surge, right? Yeah. Meaning like a second. And then you go back down into the Jamie doing another 40 minute workout. And there was a good. So it was like 40 days a week, but you trained twice back to back with a break. It was like a 40 minute break. That's 30 minute break. But then you drink this like shake. That's a comeback downstairs because our did Jim we had was like the pro shop was upstairs to come back downstairs to train for the second workout. And you're like, bro. And the shakes back down weren't as good, right? So it was like, oh, you're radical. It's just like someone just thinking this looks great on paper. And it was just like, yeah. Yeah. The stuff we used to do programs out of Flex magazine. I could just picture it not going to be like, are you feeling that growth hormone? Is that working for you? Is that? Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm getting different pump. Yeah. Positive and different pump environment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know. Hey, I got an off topic one for you. We've never asked you on the show before, but I know you have to have a story because I'll Australia is filled with every single animal that 99% of animals that will unalive you are in Australia. This is true. Jeremy says, can we get some Australian bug or animal stories from Ron's time? I have a couple. So we have to. Yeah. So the first one I've told before, so I don't want to like overtell it. But I don't think I've heard it, man. So you know what a huntsman spider is, right? Yeah. I saw one too. Yeah. So anyways, this huntsman in the story is about size of my hand. Yeah. Okay. Like big real big. Like the body isn't the size of my hand. It's like, but the giant spider. Yeah. But the spider is like big and hairy, right? Yeah. So anyways, I come home from work. It's like four in the morning. Come home from the bar. I bounce in bouncing at a club. My buddy John, he's in bed. We got a big house. We're renting a house. Like big three bedroom house. Sots of the. So I come home and in the kitchen. I make up a blender shake because back then we're blending all our shakes. There's no shake or stuff. It's blenders, right? So I'm blending up my shake and it's four in the morning. And I just got the kitchen light on. And I take my shake. I don't remember what's in it. But it was yummy. And I'm drinking it drinking it. And as I'm drinking, I realize that there's a huntsman spider sitting on the back of the blender. Oh. And he's staring me. He's staring me right in the eyes. So as I tip the blender up and I'm gulping shake, I'm looking dead eyed into this. Huntsman spider's face. It's like six seven inches from my face. Yeah. And I'm staring at it not computing what's happening. I'm just gulping shake. Yeah. And there's that's that I realize what I'm what's going on. You heard like a hiss? You're saying? No, no, I just. Oh, there's a second. Just take a second for my brain to compute that there's a. Conhonsman. And I'm I'm very Canadian at this point. I've been there for like two months. Okay. You've never seen anything like this. I've seen a Huntsman, but it was like in an alley. Like, oh, look at that big spider. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But this one's like, yeah, this one's on the back of the blender right in my face. Yeah. So my reaction is I just sort of go. And I like throw the blender and sort of spit protein shake and like have just a reactive freak out. Like I do a real hard, trisip extension into the sky with the blender. And it goes spinning and it comes down in the sink, the blender. But it comes down and like washes up the other side of the sink. It kind of like half pipes out and keeps spinning and just spinning shake all over the roof and the window. And there's just a protein shake whirlwind happening as his blender spins and flips and bounces all over the counter and the sink. And and I've spit protein shake out and I've jumped back and this giant Huntsman just lands on the ground. Just lands on the floor right in front of me. Yeah. And just runs under the door into the, there was a giant front living room that we didn't use at all because we are renting this big three bedroom house. It was probably 2000 square feet and we didn't use how to fit. Yeah. We didn't use half of it. So we had the whole front entryway. We just had the sliding doors close and there was nothing in there. But he ran under that door and it was like a big space under that door. And I was like, oh fuck. So I opened the door. Of course my roommate comes around and I was like, what's going on? It's foreign the morning. And I'm like, oh, is it giant Huntsman? And he's like, what? Like, yeah. He's not afraid of it right? He's like, oh God. He's not being a baby. We go in the other room and no, they get it been like a week since anyone had been in that room. Okay. And the Huntsman is sitting up in the corner in this giant web. It's fun. Like a giant web in that corner that room. That we were just in that room. Like, I think one of us vacuumed in there because like, you know, we used to take turns taking care of the house, right? Yeah. And I was like, oh my God, I built that giant web. But we kind of laughed at, we're like, holy shit. And like I was holy. It's a big spider. I knew it wasn't going to kill me or anything. I was educated. But I go, what do we do? And he's like, oh, well, those will eat like one of those will eat like all the roaches on the property. Oh, okay. So, um, so we actually opened the door and he actually took the broom and like just swept it out. Okay. And we didn't kill it. And then we just swept the web down, vacuumed. But it was just very unexpected. Welcome to Australia. Oh, God. Yeah. Right on right in your personal space. Right on my interest from your face. Yeah. And then it was living in the house. Like just to know that that was on the other side of that door. The whole time you've been in the room at least a week. Yeah. And then I had another time. And that's the one. It was just to see it was terrifying. Yeah. And it was on the outside of our cabin. And I mean, it was like a dinner plate spider. You know, just huge. I couldn't imagine it. And we had the luxury of being able to say like, oh, let's just not mess with it. Like your alley story. You know, I just don't. Yeah, I couldn't imagine it being that close. Yeah. Yeah. The only other one that was like notable was I opened the medicine cabinet. We were living in this old house. And there was like one of those old, you know, mirror medicine cabinets that you just, it's got magnetonating. Just click it open. Yeah. I had, I don't know if I had ever opened it. Like I don't know if I'd ever opened it. But I was looking for something. And I thought, oh, well, maybe, I don't know. I'm looking for Advill or something. And I thought, well, maybe my roommate, meh, debob. Where's my debob? And so I opened it to look. And there was a perfect funnel web. Like a little funnel web with a little black spider sitting in the back of it with a little red sign on the back. Because if funnel webs are related to black widows. So they have that, they're black with a little red. It's a different looking symbol. But they have like a funnel style web and they sit at the back of it. Okay. And it had built a little funnel in there. Yeah. And I was like, oh, shit. That's a funnel web spider. And like they're very poisons. You don't mess with them. Don't mess with them. And they're little, right? So I, there was a, on my Aussie neighbor. I was like, what do I do? And he's like, oh, come and get it. So he like comes over, you know, barefoot. You know, just walking on this walking through. It's just like, yeah, just say not afraid. Yeah. That's why I'll find this job. We, we had, um, uh, Senapeds in New Mexico. They got real big. Oh, they were, they were. They were. They were. Senapeds. They're like, you know, eight inches were the really big ones. And they're like, yeah, gosh, three quarters of an inch wide maybe. I remember seeing one when I first moved there. It was like two weeks in, and all I had for my bed was a futon mattress that I brought with me. It's futon mattress on the floor. And so I'm basically sitting on the floor, right? And I'm getting ready to go to sleep and out of my peripheral vision on the other side of the room. I see something moving toward me. And so I look over and it was the Senaped. And it was like running straight, like literally straight for me. It was, uh, I stopped him and, and then I put him in a box and I wanted to keep it for a pet. And then that didn't end up working out. But yeah, but I remember I grabbed something and I like pinned him down. And when I pinned him down, you could hear his feet on the carpet going to the floor. Like just trying to get away. Yeah. Like you could hit him. Like I grabbed a book. I think in pinned him down with it. But it didn't even hurt like he's thick enough. That didn't smash him with it. I just held him there. You know what I mean? Oh fuck. Yeah. I, uh, the first time I was in Malaysia, I was backpacking. I hadn't got to Australia yet. Okay. And we went to this backpacker lodge and we realized it was like a rough shit hole. Like it was. And I started seeing, and night time was coming. The sun was going down. We started seeing roaches everywhere. Oh God. And I'm like, oh fuck. And I'm like, I hate roaches. But I remembered that we had just been in this store. Like two blocks up was like, yeah, Yeah. It was kind of corner general store type of things. Yeah. And I had seen bug spray. Okay. So I ran back there and I bought what was like a canner raid. Right? Yeah. And I went in my room in my backpacker room. And I sprayed that whole canner raid along the door. Spread it under the door. Like there was like a puddle of raid on the floor. Under my door. And then there was like a puddle of raid on the floor around this one vent. I just sprayed like half a canner raid into the vent and all around. Probably terribly toxic for everyone who's breathing in. Yeah. Including you. Yeah. I sprayed all this raid around every little thing. Like there was a crack that I thought looked a little open. So I sprayed a little suspicious. Yeah. And then I was like sleeping at night. Like like, like, he wrote this right. Oh, God. So gross. I kept waking up and turned the light on. Yeah. Roaches in here. Roach patrol for two nights. Oh, God. And then you don't know like are they in my luggage or am I taking it with me? So the next morning there was there were some dead roaches on the floor by the door. Oh, okay. So roaches that command and they make it a little ways. Right. They go through the through the the shit and they kind of make it like a few feet across the floor. And then they like, Yeah. So it worked. Yeah. Yeah. And then I got like, you know, had to get along a transplant. Right. Yeah. It took five years off your life, you know. But there are no roaches in your room. No, no. Yeah. That was a lesson. All right. What do you say we go to the, we got these all the like, we're not going to do all these around. There's literally like close to 30 overrated underrated. Oh, fuck. Okay. It's due a few. Let's do some of the things. All right. I'm sure you can pick a good one. All right. Let's see. Oh, train with Arnold in his prime for one month or have a lifetime supply of supplements. Well, to train with Arnold. It was a Arnold in his prime, not like you can go to golds, you know, next month in train with our little. Am I at least healthy? Oh, that's another good question. I don't have a bad elbow. I'm not like. Yeah. That might have changed your old trajectory too though, because you never did a lot of volume. And what if after what if 19 year old Ron didn't go to Australia, he went to train with Arnold and you're like, well, you got a train for three hours a day in the morning and then come back and try to. It would be a would've worked for me. That's true. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not that star struck at the idea of training with Arnold for a month. It would be cool, but I also already get free supplements. So there's that. Yeah. So I go with I'll go with training with Arnold. I'll train with Arnold for a month. Yeah. I kind of was thinking that too. I was like, well, you already get supplements. Yeah. Yeah. You're all set there. No, I'll be fine. I think it would be just fun to train at that golds gym. Oh, yeah. You know, like, what's his prime 74? Yeah. Somewhere in there, 74 75. Yeah. I just spend a month at golds in 74. I can do that. That'd be awesome. That'd be so good. Just that experience in itself. I would train a ton for that. I'll take no more supplements ever. And that includes growth, guys. You know, no more. See how my, see how my sense of humor tests out on girls from the 70s. Yeah. Yeah. They won't get any of my science-owned references. No. No, they won't. We'll be big trouble. All right. Come out this one. Would you rather have to train it for a M every day or only be allowed to train after 10 PM? Oh, two really annoying concepts. Yeah, those are terrible. Are you guys open 24, 7? No. No. Okay. What time do you guys close? 5 to 10. 5 to 10. All right. Which is reasonable. You don't know me. And it's like, yeah. So I had a train at like 4 a.m. Or I got a train after 10 PM. Yeah. So basically after the gym closes. God. Well, that's, that's Scott. That's one of the worst choices. I don't want to, that's terrible choice. Guys, I have to tell you, I've gotten to know you over the years around. We've been doing this for a while. That's, and I can say this definitively that you are not an early morning person. No, no. So the problem I have with this concept is I hate morning. So I'm not a morning. I'm not going to have a 4 to 500. I was trying to be gentle with it. Yeah. I'll just not train anymore. I have this. Another hobby. I'll just do pushups between guitar riffs. Yeah. Yeah. So the 4 a.m thing I just, to me, is just like, God. And then, but the problem with after 10 PM, is that I don't, I don't mind the odd work out after 10 PM. But I want to do that all the time because I got a structure like my energy levels and right. You can caffeine late all the time. I like to be in bed by midnight now if I can. And that's hard for me. I go to bed at 1 a.m. a lot of times. And I'm like, I got to get to bed earlier. You know what I mean? I go to bed at 1 get up at 8, 7 hours of sleep, right? Yeah. But I want to get to bed earlier. And the 10 o'clock thing I'm just annoyed is, should I mean at this point? All that caffeine. Yeah, no. And you're not. You know, like imagine like late day or whatever, and then you're going to go home and go right to bed. And it was your bed for a while. And it was about 11. And then I have time to finish a few emails and get in one game of Madden. Yeah. Yeah. That's a terrible choice. Who was that? That's a, that's a victorious responsible for that. Oh, yes. So here's my answer. Sorry for your health. Sorry for the, sorry for bitching a compliance guy. No, that's, that's the, that's the fun of it. I think I would go with the 4 a.m. Okay. I just, I just, I just, I'm definitely going with the 4. Yeah. I just say, okay, you know what? I'm just going to commit to getting up even earlier now. I'm just going to get it over with and out of the way. And then I'd see if I could maybe make better use of my time through the day and get to bed earlier. But I wouldn't be happy about it. I'm doing 6 a.m. now. This one I've been getting up, but I go to bed at about 9. Like it was 9.30. Now it's gone. It's unstealing. It literally is, but we have black out shades. We're going to bed during the daytime. It was pretty much, man. Pretty much. But I could, I could get with the 4. I just have to, you have to get used to it. I mean, you've probably trained first thing in the morning, haven't you? Oh, I'm done when I had to. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was periods of time. You know, I've had multiple jobs at once and all that shit, you know. Right. And you get into the groove with it, you know, but it takes a little while. Even if it's just one day a week, like I had a period of time where I had to do my Saturday workout had to be early. Okay. Yeah, because I had this big long shift on Saturday. It's a double shift type of thing. So I had to get it in early. Yeah. So yeah. Well, that was a good one. Okay. What's the next? Let's see. We get a couple more here. Um, I already know the answer to some of these. Like would you rather hit a new PR, but tear a muscle or never PR again, but stay in drink free forever. That's a no brainer. It's a no brainer. Which rather bulk forever or cut forever, but never reach your goal, Fasey. So basically just be a bodybuilder. Yeah. Just bodybuilding and general. Would you know, I've been broken since, you know, 20,000, 2000 in 10. I would rather cut forever because I'd live long. Yeah. Yeah. There is that as you know, live longer. They feel better. Yeah. And it's like being in a calorie deficit is a longevity hack. Yeah. I agree with that. 20. Yeah. All right. Would you rather eat? I cut forever, but fall off the wagon twice a week. There we go. I tried. I didn't think that was cotton, but it's just been tough. Would you rather eat plain to la pia for every meal or drink unflavered BCA, BCA is every day. Drink unflavered BCA's. You could just chuck that, right? It's like that. Yeah. And I only drink a meal when I train. Yeah. And that would have been like all of 2005 to 2012. Like I didn't really have a lot of flavors. I just drink stuff that tasted, but tolerable. I didn't get the job. You needed to do. You know? Didn't even cross our minds how it tasted. Okay. How about this one? Would you rather win Mr. Olympia once or be in the top 10 for 10 years straight? Oh, win once. Yeah. Yeah. Win once. I mean, Mr. Olympia. You can win once and then you can just retire. And say, yeah, do it right. Get like your your socials going. Yeah. You know, during that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, and I'm not even thinking the money. I'm just thinking the like it's the Olympia. You know, it's a whole point. And I also think now in hindsight, like the guys that can get in and out the fastest. Or sometimes it's a healthiest. Yeah. Like, just thinking, you know, statistically you'd like to want to spend, you know, an extra 10 years doing something. It's why I get done. I think it also NFL players too. Like, yeah. I think a guy's who play like five seasons. They've got a, you know, 2.1 million dollar contract. You know, they did the rookie thing for the made 250 grand for a couple of years as a rookie. And then they got signed again. And they make their 2.5 million for a few years. And they win a Super Bowl. Like, just quit. Yeah. Like, sorry. You're going to get a head injury. You're going to fucking blow it like statistically you're playing NFL football. Take your Super Bowl ring and your $678 million and just fucking get out. Dude, I just think that all the time when a young guy, like somebody's guys first year drafted win a Super Bowl. I'm like, okay, bank five million and get out. But these guys, they're like, oh, you know, five million's not much. I got all these houses. And I got, you know, this staff working for me now. And the next contract's 15 million and they still need more money. And I just wonder, where's all it? Where's it going? And like, like, I just think, man, you know, because we see what happens to people when, like, you know, NFL's tough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good having just two if you're doing it for that long. But hey, then you've got guys though, the guys that can do it for 10 years and hang in there. You know, you've got your guys like Daxter Jackson, the, you know, he's probably healthier than anybody else. But that's the thing. It's to do that. It takes a certain type of guy that who can do it and be smart about it. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, are you doing 10 years hanging on by a thread or anything it takes? Or are you just not eating fried chicken, you know, or yeah, that's the thing. And that's another thing I think people don't realize is that they're competing against some people. Where 10 years means they're going to, they're still off drugs for four months a year. Yeah. Like they, oh, they don't know. People don't believe anyone goes off. But there's guys that, that's how good they were, you know. You saw that picture I sent you on text yesterday, the guy with the waist. Yeah. Like that, I don't think you helped that guy. Didn't you? Yeah, I'll put that up here. So we worked together for like a very limited time. He was like, well, I want to work with you, but my, you know, me and my family were going to Disney world. And then I want to do nationals after that. And you know, I'll have like a good six, seven weeks or whatever eight weeks till like really, you know, plug in and work real hard, you know, dial it in after that. And he did, right? He was natural. And he, but I, and he did place in the top call out at like 19 years old, you know, like hardly knowing anything. And then of course, you know, he goes and works with somebody else because, you know, down the road, there's like people that are like, and I'll tell you what you need to know. And of course, then, you know, things did progress and he did learn how to put on size with age. He turned pro quickly. Like it should have happened the next year, but it took him a few tries and he did get his pro card, but the waist man, like, people just, I think at him because like he didn't have to work for that. Like he could do that look for decades, you know? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Which, you know, some people don't realize like I said how easy it is for certain people. That's what I'm saying, man. Yeah. All right, let's see. I'll try to come up with one good finisher here. We are in, looks like we've got so. That wasn't good one. That was a good one. That was a good one. That was a good one. That was a good one. That was a good one. Would you rather look amazing in person, but terrible in photos or amazing in photos. But average in person. I already get people say all the time. They have for a long time. I call you a way bigger in person. Oh, no kidding. Yeah, but I say people don't realize that I'm a big guy. Like I'm, you know, almost six foot one. I'm very pretty wide and you know, the big guy, right? So I think it's a lot of people who were just referring to that because obviously I've downsized a lot, but I see even, even when I was big, when I was 300 plus, I would overwhelmingly get that in people pick, oh, you're way bigger in person. They would say it like that too. You're way bigger in person. I'm like, oh, thanks. I don't know. I was just attributed it to how white I was. I didn't like really pop off photos or something. You know, it was a white guy thing. Yeah, we're a white guy thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a tough one, man. I would rather, I guess you got to take big in person, you know, because you want to let people down. Exactly. You know, I'd rather be pleasantly surprised. Right. Yeah. It's a, that's the last thing, you know. Yeah. That's, that's funny, you know. Yeah. There's some other ones in here like that we would, would you rather be a bodybuilding legend, but broke or wealthy and unknown and wealthy and unknown. I'll take, yeah. That's another no brainer here. Would you rather be the best natural bodybuilder ever, or the best bodybuilding coach of all, time? Oh. Well, let's say best coach of all time. Yeah, I'll take that too. Because to be the best coach of all time, you have to have Olympias. Yeah. Like open Olympias, right? Yeah. Yeah. Can't be the best coach of all time without open Olympias. And that beats being a natural world champ, in my opinion. Absolutely. You know, like with, yeah, respect to the natural, yeah. Yeah. Well, if he's making the money, the, like I'm seeing, I'm thinking about my future. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So I'm sort of thinking like, would you rather be like a star player who wins a national title in college football or a Super Bowl winning coach? Yeah. You're like, well, the coach has pretty good story and he gets to win a Super Bowl and he gets to be at the very top of the, the, the food chain. Yeah. There's a lot more money involved. So yeah. I'll go with that. I'll take that too. Yeah. Yeah. I can't get a Canadian bodybuilder by the way. Who? I mean, if we count classic. Wow, bum step. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't make it. But Chris. I just default to when we say best bodybuilder. I just default to men's open. Yeah. No, I did too. I did too. Yeah. But somebody in the comments right mentioned that. Oh, yeah. For sure. I mean, something else. Those were good. Those were good overrated or, or would you rather, is there, what do you call them? Choose one or later underrated? Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's some more in there too. Would you rather fart lonely on stage during your posing routine or forget your entire posing sequence mid show? Forget posing. I could just make it up as I go. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's something you can do. You can't take the fart back. Just get up there. Just. Wow. Especially if it's like a dead stop in your music or something. Yeah. Get through a quiet. Like a moment of tension. That's different. It's a crowd's going crazy. And you know, you know, but if it's at that moment where they haven't started applauding yet, you know, like gentleman front double by a sap and you just wrap. What's that? That's it. You might be known as that guy, especially if that got caught on social media. You know what I mean? Yeah. So you're the kind of farted. Yeah. So what have you seen? I've seen some stuff. I've seen some embarrassing things happen to people on stage. Yeah. I saw like a few females have had like suit malfunctions. I've seen that. Like it's unfortunate. Pretty embarrassing. Obviously no one really cares and everyone's like totally supportive. But at the time. Yeah. And they're horrified. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Suit malfunctions. And then I, I know of a story. I heard about a guy fortunately no one realized what had happened. But he knew and the guy's in his class that's something what happened. But I knew a guy of a guy who shithomself a bit on stage. He like had like squeezing out a pose and he sharded in his trunk. But he had black trunk on and he could smell it. And it was a very embarrassing story that I was told to me by his friend. And he was like, they were already done several rounds. So he was just hoping he could make it off there. Anyone noticing. And then they turned around from the back poses and he was like, Oh my God. I think I'm all right. I think I'm going to make it. And then he like escaped the stage. And like did it very low key and no one really knew. But I guess the one guy in his class was like, fuck it. Stunk up there. Someone was farting. Yeah. And so that was all that too man. Yeah. You said that I thought of that story because I was like, Oh my God. I can't even imagine the stress would be. Yeah. That would be pretty rough man. I don't think I have anything that that terrible. No. You've seen those videos of power lifters who are who puked. Oh, yeah. Right. Like they're doing the deadlift or the squat and the like the front judge has to like jump out of the way. Yeah. Yeah. That happened. I bought it going to show once that I was out. You're kidding. Yeah. He was doing an office class and he was big. He was like a very big body builder and everyone was pretty excited to see him do his debut. Yeah. And he was like going to do the novice class. And so everyone is expecting him to like kill everybody. So he comes out for the novice class and he's like obviously going to win. But you know, it was back in like the 90s and everyone is doing all that dumb shit. And he was saying to his friends he's like, I don't feel good. And they're like, Oh, look awesome. He's like, I don't feel good. And he like apparently didn't feel good at all, but just kept like waiting for his class. Yeah. Trying not to drink anything and like all that stuff, you know. And he went on stage and they start calling poses and the front lats bread and all of a sudden you can tell like he's not doing well. He's in the middle of the call out. And he has hands on his hips and the other guys are posing and he's just standing there and all of a sudden he just goes. Oh, and this objectile pukes. So they just go, ah, we're going to call an intermission. And they just called an immediate mini intermission and they just everyone left the stage and the judges said to jump back out of the way and it was horrible. Oh, do you get the cue to if you projectile vomit on stage or they let you come back? I don't remember what happened because I feel like you might have a flatter stomach. You know what I'm saying after all that. He came back to this place was so small. Right. I so I remember at one show there was a guy throwing up backstage. Okay. That's scary, man. Because you don't know why they're throwing up either. Is this an hydration or what? Yeah. And one of the officials went over to him. He was a really good guy. He was an older guy. And he went over to him and he was like, listen. And I think he gave him a gatorade. Yeah. And he was like, you're going to drink that whole thing or I'm not letting you on stage. Okay. He was like, and you're going to do this and I can't keep me. He made him have something else. And he was like, we don't have it. You can't go on stage. You're dehydrated. Your electrolytes are messed up. You're going to be in suit. He was just telling him you're in trouble. Yeah. I don't see it as much anymore run as I used to. But like, when I first started, which would have been like, you were already body building. It was diuretics where a lot a lot more of a thing like extreme use of. Even just like the calcium sparing diuretics, you know. Yeah. And test and sparing. Thank you. I knew I didn't have that right. I got you. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. But I do remember the multiple occasions of like I remember one girl in particular figure girl sitting on the steps and her hands were just shaking. And I had a pediatl like there and I was like, drink this, you know. And told her like, here, I just so many times of that kind of thing happened. Even I remember and this wasn't that long ago. I guess it was at the Olympia girl in 2018. Maybe it was, there were a bunch. It was either bikini or figure. And it was at the expo stage. And they're all kind of lined up on the sides, you know. And it's, they were all like right up along the curtains and one of the girls who was like back by the curtain just fell out. And they just like opened up the curtain and pulled their back. And there was like a bunch of people to attend tour like right away. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when Dallas was in Australia, Dallas, Mcarver. Yeah. And he did that show in Australia. And he sort of started passing out during pre-judging. Yeah. And they quickly carried him off the stage and like, you know, Paramedics hit him. I was standing right there. Paramedics were all over him. But blah, blah blah blah blah. And that was like, oh shit. That didn't look there for that. Oh yeah. It was right there backstage. And there was an Australian magazine at the time that was doing like a website thing and they wanted me to interview everybody. Oh, no, give it. Oh, no, give it. It's kind of working for this Australian magazine. And I was interviewing everyone. So I had interviewed Dallas and I was interviewing all the body builders. And yeah. And so he came off and he was like on the floor and everyone is tending to him. And then we all left. Yeah. And then we came back for the finals later on like, you know, five o'clock. And I walked back stage and Dallas was standing there talking to Steve. And Steve was like, you're not going on, man. And Dallas was like, I'm fine though. I like I'm totally fine. And Steve's like, tell me, you got carried off stage and prejudging. There's like liabilities. You're not going on. Wow. This is how it works. Like I saw it happen. And I can't unsee it. And yes. And he was like, okay. And so he didn't let him go on. So it was the finals without him, right? But that's what you mean. That's Steve being smart and responsible. Like, right. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. I don't see that as being him like punishing him. No, it's not a fun thing. It's like this is a organization. Yeah. You know, you just, it's terrible. And then what if something happens to you then like, you know, right. Obviously like, you know, if you months later it did. And that's just, like, terrible, you know. Yeah. Wow. No. I never told me that story before. Yeah. Yeah. Because he came back like, I want to go on like, I'm ready. Feel great, you know. Yeah. What you would, too, when correct things, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what to do. Yeah. Wow. Here we go. Oh, do you remember when DeLette froze on stage at one of the Arnold's. Yeah. That was famous. Yeah. They have the whole series of pictures of how we talked about that one. Yeah. We did one of those reactions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The least of these. You can't not unfortunately talk about that. If you're going to do like a sum up of Paul DeLette's body building. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that was like before any my time. Once I started body building everybody was like, you know, we don't ever touch loop DiRetX. Yeah. And think about this. Think about how crazy the 90s were. Guys made the same mistake more than once. Yeah. Like Paul got messed up on loops for the Arnold got carried off stage. And then at the 98 Olympia, I believe he was first call out in the pre judging. And then I don't even think he finished a show because he was so messed up. I got to look at that. But there's a there's a battle for the Olympia where they're walking to pre judging. The big group of them, right? They're all walking together from the hotel to the venue and they're all walking as a group. And Paul has a giant jug of orange gatorade and he's chugging it on the way to pre judging. Okay. So you know something's up. Yeah. Like, you know Chad was like, you're messed up. Yeah. But then he never came back for finals. I don't think. I'm going to make sure what you're that was. Which tells you like what happened. Yeah. You know, for him to not show up and he was first call out. So let me just confirm if my memory is in fact that. Yeah. If you don't, somebody else will. You know Ronnie Flakes, NASA Kevin Sean Chris Lee, earning Mike. Yeah. Yeah. Paul Dillett, Paul Dillett did not finish. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. So it's a 98 Olympia and his score was 35 after the first round. So he's in the top five. Yeah. You know what I mean? So yeah. Crazy times. And he just wanted to momma, Ben Aziza. So yeah. Go back and watch him. Yeah. We just did that whole thing on a monster. I don't know if he saw our reaction. Yeah. Yeah. Ryan Ryan here commenting if you want to see that reaction on Monser. We talk a lot about that stuff. Yeah. You know. Well, I think we we get through this thing, Ron. Do we do this? We do this on right. We do this. We must be. We hung in there. We made it. I know dusty guys. We're we're missing a piece of our souls without without. We're dusty here. But it's good to venture out on your own. So you don't become totally emotionally dependent on someone. You know, like it's good for you and your wife to, you know, maybe have dinner with like you did for your wife to go out dinner with your friends once in a while. Oh, yeah. You're going somewhere else with that. Oh, yeah. You can go off and you know, you bang a few horrors just by your own plan. Like it's just just a little bit like this world. We'll build. Yeah. Yeah. Just so you perspective on humanity is not just the same. You know. Yeah. So she goes out with her friends. She goes out with her friends. Yeah. You know, you see how I see the world. Right. It's a little bit. It's fair. You mean we both share. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Well, good luck with that Scott. Okay. And we missed Dusty. We'll see him again next week. And we give some more guests coming up. So whatever you guys, any suggestions for guests or if we have someone on and you think that they're especially good fit, or make it make sure you let us know. Yeah. And leave us comments too for the next show. And you guys let us know what's going on if you're on Spotify. You know, if you're on Spotify, we could probably use some good reviews like some five star reviews on Spotify. I'm guessing it could definitely use a few. It'll help us out. Or about to crack 40,000 subs on YouTube, which is pretty cool. And we're getting, we're, I, I compared 25 to 24. We have already had more views in 2025 than we did in all of 2024. Ron. Really. Really. Growth is I've been trying to push things in a few different ways to get the channel to keep growing. And 2025 has been, you know, and growth growth has been growth has been selling really well. A lot of people buying the growth. A lot of growth. Yeah. I'm not a growth really moving a lot of growth. Good. Yeah. Moving a lot of growth. I want to see the channel really spending this year. You know, remember that code. Yeah. You're joking. Yeah. Totally jokes. Edit. Remove this whole part. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm happy to see the channel grow too. A lot of people tell me they're listening. And every single time someone says they listen to show, I'm like, because like I said many times we put the show out and it's just it's out there. Yeah. And then when someone who's in my actual bubble comes up and says, hey, good show. I'm like, you listen to the show. Like, as I was blows me away. You know, it almost does. Okay. What, what, what more thing, where where you, you were traveling? Traveling. Oh. Which, where'd you traveling? What? Just on the weekend? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I just went and see my dad and my sister and brother. Oh, okay. And no, if it was like a mutant thing or no, I was just on Vancouver Island. That's why we're doing the episode a little later today. For those of you don't know, you don't care and it doesn't matter. We're recording a little later than usual because that was traveling this morning back from my went and saw my family yesterday. We just went over for lunch. Oh. And then Emily and I thought instead of rushing to get another ferry home, because it's about a four hour trip. It's about a four hour trip door to door like from my place to my sisters. It's about four hours. You get the ferry ride. There's a bunch of bullshit, you know. We thought why don't we just get a hotel and stay for a night and that's a great idea. Yeah. And we had our dog sitter with our dog sitter had the dog. So we were kind of like, you didn't have the kids for a night. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. I got to check out Vancouver Island. Of course, Victoria has told me all about it. I've seen like pictures of the ferry and all of that. One day when we have more time and we get out there. I want to see the island. It's an amazing experience taking the ferry over to Vancouver Island. It's just like, it's something that we take with like, Toss it's normal. Yeah. A lot of Americans that come there like that was real like, That was a great trip like to go over to the island and see it. And it's funny because I mean, people who live on the island might not think this, but when I get to the island, you get off the ferry on the other side. And it just feels like everything's moving slow. Yeah. I like that feeling. It can be if you're, if that's what you need like, Yeah. Like you're like, let's go get a couple of days on the island. Yeah. That's nice. But if you're like kind of in a hurry, like we've got to get to my sisters for lunch and then rush back to the ferry. That's not fun. That's not fun. That's why we didn't want to do that because the traffic's not moving quickly. Like, yeah. It's a big island too. Have you ever been to an innaimo? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm playing. I do in some serious the name of our shopping. I don't have to go to an innaimo to get an innaimo. But I feel like I know, but I feel like I've got, Ron, I've got the supplies here in my house. We've got kits to make them. We can do it on our own, but I want to try like from the source and see if they're right. And see if they're better. I get it. The curiosity makes sense. Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll let you mule and our. You mule. Yeah. Have you muleog if you're going to do the innaimo bars? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Oh, that's the name of it. I'm going to maximize our loading. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, remember everybody. I am mutant.com, user code, big Ron or dusty. Get your 20% off. Save 20%. Don't see people. Stay home. Have it delivered. And I got a bag. The delivery on mutant stuff is super fast. Like you guys are, if you, or if you're going to get it so fast, you're going to think like, you're going to think as Amazon involved with this. Like this is crazy. But they're not. No. No, they're good, man. They're quick. They've got Jim has it's not just being shipped from Canada. Like you guys have distribution in the US. So we have a warehouse full of it that we've already shipped to. Yeah. Oh, they're there. So it's quick. Yeah. Nice and fast. Now, I think it, where's the head quarters for shipping? Is it actually like Nashville or something? Oh, you know better than me. Yeah. I think there's like, I think it's the FedEx headquarters is in like. Some city that you think is like, I remember I think it's Nashville because I remember thinking, oh, it's music city, but then they're like, oh, it's also. The FedEx main airport. Oh, like that. I still, there's a lot of stuff that, and I don't want to miss quotes. It's Nashville, but it's one of those cities that you think is something else. Right. We can look that up. But anyways, I think our warehouse is there so that stuff can be like shipped very quickly. You know. Let's see here. My fist, Tennessee. Oh, man. The FedEx headquarters is so anywhere close to that area would probably be good. You get good service there, you know. Yeah. So I think it has some to do with that. I think that's where our warehouse is. It's something to do with the headquarters of shipping, you know. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Anyway, it's just find out for yourself. Use code big rod or dusty. He's not here, but you could use the dusty code too. I am you in dot com. Remember, like share, subscribe, comment, and ring the bell. I was almost waiting for somebody else to say it. I was like, oh, that's me. Yes. I'm going to. Oh, yeah. Remember the Patreon. And then also, too. I'm going to be on Bloodsfoot and Gear this week, right? Yeah. We don't know if we're going to do it. But we'll figure it out by that. Yeah. No. I want to be prepared. And if I need to, if I need to be included on a text email or a text chain or anything. Let me know. I will do that for you. I will accept another. Another. Chatechain. I missed something today. What's your miss? We've got a physique critique. You want to do it? You got five minutes round. I just realized that right now. Yeah. Five minutes. All right. You can insert it. All right. Yeah. Well, we're not done yet. So technically, I literally have his email pulled up right now. All right. All right. This is Kevin. So this is the bonus section for those of you that haven't left. This is true last five minute crew. Yeah. It really is. Kevin's like, you guys forgot about me. You know what I'm saying? Until this. Oh, no way. All right. So I wanted to submit a critique to. It's just bodybuilding. He said, uh, this pot is my favorite. The synergy between you three is evident. Oh. It's he's currently a hundred and ninety three pounds. Did his first show last December. I know I need to grow everywhere. I'll well having a hard time growing on 300 grams or protein 350 grams of carbs and 60 grams of fat. I never had issues gaining weight in the past. But after this show, my body is definitely different. The difficulty in gaining has come from marriage Relationship stress extremely high or am I or my bodies ability to burn through calories. My coaches are friend of the shows. And you've had him on and tell you some old school stories. He made meat, burgers, and fries for weeks. And cheap meals, two times a week to slow down digestion and help absorption of clean food. I'm a coach myself for lifestyle clients. And I'm not sure that the philosophy of this. Let's see. Anyways, currently, only 600 milligrams of gear, I think, is what he's saying. It was running 900 tests, 400 masks, but due to life stress, I am waiting to push, even though my body doesn't seem to respond to any antibiotics outside a trend. By the way, thanks a lot, Kevin. Now I have to certify that this program is really to that stuff, too. We got away with not talking about that stuff, Ron. All the way up till now. Let's see. All right, here we go. So here's the pictures. We got a front double here. And, let's see if I can't zoom it in. You further. Yeah, there we go. So we got a front double. We got a rear relaxed. We got a front relaxed and a rear double. OK. How old is he? I didn't catch his age. But I'm going to guess late 20s early 30s. OK. Got a good beard. So he's not too fat. So like, see what's he? He's a quadseq, you can see quad separation. And he's got ankles and calves. And he's got a waistline. And I don't mind that his abs are kind of foggy because that's fine. His conditions fine. He can be this body fat level. That's no problem at all. He just needs to grow. I mean, he's 193. I don't know how tall he would be. But he needs to just pack on it, bunch of size. I don't like the drug doses that he was on. I think he's too much gear. I think that he should look at trying to hit like 225 pounds on like 500 makes it the test. OK. Like I really do believe that like the first 80% of everything you're doing to try to be a big bodybuilder can be done on relatively conservative doses of testosterone and minor cycles. It's the difference between that guy and like the next level that we all want to get to. That's the, that's where things change. But at his level, he just needs to train and eat long periods of time with some testlet with some testinum. Like that's all he needs. I don't see anything like wrong with his physique. Like he, I mean, he needs mass everywhere. But like he's got legs already and looks like he's training everything. He's got back width and some thickness. So I would just keep on it. But I would keep the drugs to a minimum and I would be patient with a timeline. And one thing that he said that a don't like was he said like, my body doesn't seem to respond to anything but trend. And I would say like that's probably a misconception. It's probably what you feel, but it's not accurate to reality. You just need time. I like that. I'll add this because we don't know anything about his training. Yeah, there's a bunch of holes, right? So I'm just, yeah. And I'll say this just out of my own personal experience around that I trained hard. We talked today about these long workouts that I was doing with Shelby and John was writing them. And I took plenty of gear. I was eating all the food and taking all the intro workout carbs. And I made progress. I competed. Maybe don't give myself enough credit because in the scheme of people who've lifted weights in their lives, most people can't say that they were like a consistent, light heavy weight. If I was going to be a light heavy weight at a state show that I would be a threat there to some degree. And I can say that most people haven't reached that level. Like most people were listening to the shows, haven't even competed. So I put on a decent amount of muscle, but I still didn't tap into what you were dusty had tapped into. And I could come up with all sorts of reasons. Maybe I obviously didn't do it for as long either. But I really figured things out in my 40s on the least amount of gear that I had ever taken. Like literally I'd taken all sorts of stuff, right? Computing and running 600 tests and eating just casually. Like making sure I ate enough protein each day. And the carbs were like, well, whatever carbs fit with that meal. Like I wasn't paying attention to my food. I was taking 600 tests. But my training got to be at the next level. And I really chased down strength. And at that point, the scale just started moving again. In my mid 40s. So anybody who took all sorts of gear in the past, somebody would eat way more than that. Somebody who had done all sorts of volume and everything. I finally was onto something. And the scale was like moving into places I had never seen it before. It all came back to that training. So I just wonder what is training is. Is there anything in there that he can tap into? Maybe his recovery isn't maybe he needs to. I mean, Ron, I started with a push pole legs five days a week at that strong at this point. And as I built strength, this was crazy dude. But I went to one day on two days off. And I kept it. It was like it slowly morphed into that. But at my ultimate strongest, I was like, fuck it, I think if I take another day off, I'll be even stronger. And I'll be able to surpass my previous fast. And I did. So out of nine days, I trained three times. And I was getting close to 240. Yes. And that would have been the heaviest. I'd gotten to the 230s before. But this was like I'm closing in on 240. I'm closing in on that. And I'm not taking nearly as much as I had in the past. I'm not even pushing the food right now. So I guess seeing that, I really saw some shit that I missed with training. And part of that maybe had to do two within the past. Like I had a really busy physical job that probably ate into some of my calories stress. He was talking about having a really high stress. I don't know how you get rid of that. Yeah. But like stress man is going to destroy your gains. I don't know how you get rid of it, how you fix it. But fix your life so that you can be good at bodybuilding, I guess. Yeah. I don't preach to people or harp to people. And I know the decisions I made were my own. But I always like specifically, I mean, I was just so steadfast on what I was doing. I didn't think I was not being deterred. So I was very like, if I was going to date you, I wanted you to be fully aware of what I was doing. Like, yeah. I wanted to date someone who knew what bodybuilding was like what's going on here. And I wanted them to understand. And I had a single thing that was out in the open right from the start. And those are the only girls that did. And so when I see bodybuilders like dating people who, I'm not saying this to case with this guy. Right. They're there. They're there. Why for something? Hates, hates their training or hates their dieting or hates. It's like, okay, either this isn't the person for you because they just don't want you to do this thing for some reason. Or you're not good at doing it and managing your mood and your time and your attention. And so there is it goes both ways. Like, sometimes it's just like you get to get rid of that crazy bitch. And then other times it's like, you're you're impossible. I can't believe she's still with you. You're so. I'm glad you have a girlfriend. I feel like people don't point that side out enough. We hear the other side. You know, we can be somebody who supports you. And it's like, you also have any hear the other side. Take care of your own shit. Yeah. She's like, yeah, yeah. She's like, he quit work for five weeks because he wanted a peak for the his entry level show. Yeah, for the state level show. And you're like, what, so what, you're just bringing a paycheck home? Yeah, it's all on me. Like, I hear that stuff. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? Yeah. You know, living the dream living the dream. I remember like more than one guy. So I don't want anyone to think that this is about them. This is lots of dudes back in the day. But back in the early 2000s, 2000 to 2006, 7. I lived in Edmonton, Alberta. Okay. And it's blue collar. That's oil. Right. Oil town. Yeah. A lot of people work in the oil field. Oil patch is big deals. And back then, the economy was cranking cranking. Yeah. So like, all those guys in the oil field, I don't exactly know how it works. Because I never worked in the oil field. But they would say stuff like, yeah, oh, I quit that job. I would get it. I just went down to the union and got a new job right away. It was like there was so much work that like I remember having body builders that I was helping and he's like, yeah, I couldn't get the show off. So I just quit. Like, and then, and he's like, oh, but in these are guys that make like back in those days too. This is 20 years ago and they're making like way over six figures. Like, they're just laughs. Wow. So like, blue colored dudes that are making 200 grand a year. They're got a house. They got a truck. They got a skidoo. They got all the toys. They're just banking money. They're making so much money at the time. So they don't care. Like, yeah, I can get the shop says quit. And I'm like, oh, what are you going to do? I'll just go down to the union and just get another job after the show. Like, because they were all like pipe fitters and welders and so they was like, all this like infrastructure for them to do that. And there was so much work constantly never ending the economy was just. Just going ballistic. So it was just this free for all guys would quit just because they couldn't get Saturday off for legs. Like, yeah, like I knew guy he quit multiple jobs. I died at him for a bunch of shows and he'd always be tall. I quit that job. Yeah, and they wanted me to do overtime overtime. I'm like 10 weeks. 10 weeks. No, no, no, no overtime. Told us, guys, fuck off. And you know, you could make that stuff work because I've seen the other side of it where somebody is maybe stuck at a job that they're. Maybe not doing the best right. Not the best for their life, but they're able to eat their food when they want to be able to. Yeah, like, well, if I got that new job, I don't know if I'd be able to do that there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll make it work no matter where you, you know, where you do what's best for your life first. I was last at the dude who just quit quit his job quit his his job that paid 170 grand a year. Just quit it. I can get Saturday off. Yeah, that's crazy. There's another one. It's tons of those jobs. Yeah, it was a funny time. But I knew lots of dudes like that, you know, this anything for the prep. Yeah, but we're Kevin, I'm with you. I didn't see anything in his physique where I'm like, oh, dude, you need some arms. In fact, his arms look pretty strong to me. No. You know, everything looks there. Yeah. It's just that matter of like, I see this as being a situation where like, you need to figure out the switch. There's a switch to get to that next level. And maybe it is. There's something in there. We don't know what it is. Maybe it's getting the stress reduced, figuring that side of your life out. Maybe it is the training. I would definitely take a hard look at training and, you know, and maybe it's not the stuff I'm talking about. You know, like I'm telling you, like, oh, I went super hard. No, maybe it's something else for you, you know, and maybe it's just time. Ah, like yeah. Time is just a forgotten factor. It's the one we can't do anything about. So we don't talk about it. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's not a variable that you can do anything about other than try to use to your best as a person. As ability, you know, so yeah, it could just be time. I mean, the guy might just need five years of just slugging away. And then the wise words around you know, very wise. I don't know. That's a funny word to use. Wise. He's wise. So this. Well, thanks, Scott. Okay. There was always that good last five minute crew. That was good, man. That was for this year. I think you guys got that was like the the gem for the last five minute crew right there. Okay. Okay. You know, well, I'm happy about that. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks to people that tagged along. We went live last minute. Scott just said, Hey, I'm just going to turn the channel on and see if we get anybody. Yeah. Which is kind of cool. People on the beach channel. Yeah, we get Ryan and we get blunt forest. Tanya and forget, you know, you know, you're a little bit. You'll see and Ross and Mark in a couple of people that we've seen before on this stuff. So it's, oh, Ethan also poach his head in. You can see. It's always a sin. Okay. Thanks, guys. Remember, it's just body building. Good. All right.

I got enough GH to do 60 units per week. How do I split that up? Take all of it. Yeah. Like I'm the first to the mom. Don't bother me, completely. What about the bloodswitten gear? I'm just gonna go ahead and get a scum. Scumming now. What's up guys? Welcome back to Bloodswitten gear with coaches. Get, Hill, Andrew, Barry, myself, Scott McNally. We are brought to you by Trunutrition.com. Use our code, thanksupplementsourst.ca for Canadians. Of course, we are brought to you by Patreon. And today we are joined by Big Paul right now. What's up, Paul? Thanks for joining us man. It's going on. It's going on. It's going on. Just do like a crossover episode. Everybody loves crossover. Sounds fun, man. What are the things we do? But with Paul. Let's just tell us all your story. Paul, we're going to run one of our friends. Ram boy. One arm, Paul. I'm not a big Paul anymore. Oh yeah, yeah. So before we end the show today, we are going to go in deep to talk about all your stuff. We want to hear all about it. I saw you posting those pictures you showed us before we started. You just had your surgery done. I want to hear all about the Pap-Tide protocol and all of the stuff. And all the plans for that stuff. But we do have a bunch of listed questions. We're going to start with those. You know, I thought this was kind of interesting the way we're doing it. He said, I got enough GH to do 60 units per week. How do I split that up to get the most out of it for making gains? And of course, we should definitely turn to our guest host, Paul, to give him the floor first. First of all, take all of it. Yeah. Like I'm the first of the month. Don't bother with me. Yeah, you know, I've tried every sort of GH protocol that there is. And I've honestly, where I've landed is take as much as I can afford and tolerate and do it before bed. I would have, I'm diabetic, so I'm acutely aware of my glucose levels. I keep the CGM going. It's like a monitor what's going on. And what I've noticed when during contest prep, I will split up the doses for the lapatic effect of it during the day. But what I've noticed is if I take it during the day, while I'm eating carbohydrates that my glucose levels get a little too high during the day. And when I, what I found, it seems to keep my glucose levels the best. When I just take it all before bed and one single ballus and do it that way. And what I've seen no difference in IGF on levels or anything like that when I do it that way. But contest prep usually I'll split it up. I'll take half in the morning and half before bed. And then that's usually how I do it. I know a lot of guys say take it before fasting cardio. But it's not even going to be peaked before two hours. It takes about two hours for it to peak anyway. So it's kind of pointless doing that unless you're going to get up two hours before you do your fasting cardio. I mean, that's sort of my take on it. It has about six hour half life with the IGF one effect of it. From what I understand is like 36 to 48 hours that it stays. IGF one will stay elevated when you're taking great moments. Really like the whole splitting it up really the only compelling reason I can see to do so is for fat burning. Yeah. What do you guys think? Everything is set as one. This is a study's resume. It's got a controversy. It's just in one of those. No, and I'm totally. It's kept held destroyed. It's just not a little like I don't know. He's having a bad day or something. Got paid. He's losing a sling on one handed Mary. He's couldn't even come back. I'm also lazy and I don't want to take four different shots during the day. No guys that are breaking up in the morning. I don't know what they're doing. They're doing drugs for 30 years. I still don't look like I'm a god. I haven't done it for 30 years. I was thinking about like since I've had my surgery. I was thinking today. I'm like, what was the last time I took a shot at testosterone? I'm thinking of myself and it's been like fucking two weeks. Now the college, here's what I was going to ask you. Or make the point. I don't think it's a good idea. I'm asking you guys what you think. Is that necessarily, I think, taking the GH prior to cardio makes it more of a That's certainly fabric. But it will help to counter the raise or the rise in blood glucose. That's what I've done that. Beat will go with BJ. It's easier to say. BG levels. So I guess I always looked at it from that standpoint versus man in a brain. It's so much more fat. And maybe people assume that. Maybe I'm misreading. Maybe that's the, I don't want to say myth. But I mean, that's the understanding. Well, those shift you to lipid metabolism. GH is lapotic. So it does, it's really at the end of the day. It's a very expensive fat burner. I mean, it's probably not as effective as Tickling Beauty Raw. I mean, where do we rank it? It's called, yeah. It's there. It's like there's green to here. There's GH in there. I would say it's one of those drugs that makes you look leaner all the time without necessarily burning fat. Because like you, we all know like, well, never talking about us now. But back in the day, I remember seeing guys that were like, who could afford mass amounts of GH, you know, when I was in my 20s and they were in their 40s. And these guys were, you know, had veins popping everywhere. And like, you're talking about the shirt on, you're like, oh, they're not actually that lean. It's just that the peripheral, you know, the peripheral, like arms and legs, like veining and maybe you think that they had this conditioning level that they probably didn't have. I think it's kind of... That they would pull this out. Yeah, yeah. So I think it's definitely an aesthetic compound. Yeah. But in terms of like how to split it up, you know, if he's trained in five days, I would just take it on training days, 12 units, whether it's one bullish shot at some point during the day or split it up, six and six. Here's the biggest thing I've noticed with GH. If you're taking enough of it, it works. Regardless of when you take it. That's the thing, right? Like, because I've done, like Paul said, I've tried every different, you know, dosing mechanism and mode to get it in. And, you know, I think my very best was I was taking a bottle of seros to him right after training every day. And, you know, I, I, I, I blew up and everything was going great, you know. And, what had been different if I would have broken it up like 99 and done like, you know, 99 fasted, 94 bad or 99 fasted, 99 postwork out or even nine pre work out. And everyone has their, I guess, superstitions on when to take it. But I think the bottom line is just take it, get it in. Can you say GH, what it does, it stimulates HSL, home run sensitive light pay. So you do get increased light product effect. It frees up trackless rats to be burned while you're taking it. And also limits LP also. You actually, you have this dual effect of it where it actually blocks fat storage and increases liberation of fatty acids while you're in it. But that's also why guys get high glucose levels too because you're shifted towards lipid metabolism and not glucose metabolism. So it's sort of like a temporary effect of, I guess glucose and insinitivity specifically in the, or I'm sorry, insulin insinitivity specifically in the fat cells. And that's why you can kind of play with it. Like if you're playing with insulin with GH, you can force, especially if you're lifting, you can force glycogen synthesis while you're limiting fat storage. But long term you might make yourself a diabetic. So that's the, that's the downside of it. But did you get huge and ripped? I mean, let's keep our mouth out. No, and you make a good point right there. Paul, because that question, Andrew, I don't know if you remember, but that question came up and I posted it to you a few weeks ago. I'm like, we can't have bringing this up on the show because a lot of people, I don't know if it was just a cycle. But anyway, I say cycle like a trend where I was getting asked a lot about the timing of insulin dosing versus GH. And essentially the idea that if you take them too close together at the same time that they, it's like they cancel each other out. She had to, I went the other way with that though. I feel like there's more synergy taking them fairly close together in terms of, excuse me, insulin will help translate KIGF1 receptors. So if you're taking the GH, you know, you're getting your liver to produce IGF1, more, more translocation, easier attachment to the receptor. So I see the benefit of putting them close together. And I agree with you, but then the, the, it begs the question, where did the, the protocol, um, Paul had antiquated if you want to spend around for a long time of, there's a 15 minute gap between I did it. I mean, I went along with that guideline two of a, you know, 15 minutes and then hit the insulin. Almost him crying. There's this window. Don't go screwing it up. Don't cross that line because they're going to cancel each other out. I think we sometimes need to be careful as trainers and people who, I hate to say influence for people who, people who influence other people without calling ourselves influencers. With things that we say because they can be, they can be taken so, so literally black and white. When we're not really saying that it's black and white, we're just giving parameters. And then the people are the perception is, oh, this has to be, this is, this is what it is because so in some sense, this is, it's like, well, we're just giving you parameters and just guidelines here. So I think if you, if you look back at, you know, pros that were started using heavy GH and insulin in the early 90s, and then look at pros in the 2000s and then looked at people today. Because I say pros because back then I feel like it was only pros that really had access to growth hormone and insulin. I didn't know a lot of local guys, you know, when I was coming up in the 90s and early 2000s that were blasting those, those two peptides. There's a lot of different protocols and they all got huge and ripped and every method worked. You know, whether it's, oh, I take my GH before and I take my insulin with a bunch of carbs after training or even reverse it and taking, you know, insulin and intercarbs and taking your GH post. It all works, you know. I think, I think the bros here that insulin in GH are counter regulatory, which is true, but, you know, insulin is going to promote nutrient storage. GH is going to promote liberation of fatty acids, but specifically in our situation like if we're taking insulin, pre-workout and we're lifting, we're going to promote gluten for transport. And you can block lipoluses at the same time, that's why guys get lean while they're taking GH and you can kind of force the issue with glycogen storage while you're working out. And if you're pairing it up with, you know, kind of like meal of such a lifestyle, like the high volume training that he does and slam it a bunch of carbs and taking insulin around the workout, you can, it seems to, there seems to be some sort of super compensatory effect that happens with glycogen synthesis. And then you're also limiting the lipogenesis through the effects of GH and how it limits lipogenesis. So it's kind of like, you know, the end result is you get four and you have less fat storage on top of it. So it's kind of a, I would add to that too by adding injectable carnitine to the mix just amplifies that even more to with, with hand thinking like a gen retention and increased fatty acid utilization at other times. But ultimately, I mean, I think for us, like in an option, like for the way I look at it with GH, there's different purposes for it. Like I look at it. The use of it differently on off season than I do for contest prep really really for like off season. Ultimately what we're looking for is the elevated IGF one levels, right? Because we want to increase, um, lower in AMPK and then increase hypertrophy. So really like a single bolt of stoce is really all you need during the off season. We're not too that too concerned. I am worried about guys getting their blood sugars and A1C2 high and the off season increased insulin resistance as well. So I just, that's kind of like my logic, my long-winded answer. I would believe me, I thought about this a lot. So we talked about splitting it up through the day or not. What about A's on versus days off. He has 60 units. So if he split that up every day that comes out for like eight and a half units per day over seven days, would you guys do seven days a week or would you say do it on training days or a specific setup? I'm every day. Yeah, I run it every day, but then there's there is an argument where if you take a bigger dose that you might get a bigger IGF one spike. I have seen that that compelling argument too, you know, like sort of the whole 18 units of Sarah stem before bad. That's why they dose it that way because you're good more of a, you get more of a, and a ball like a fact from it from taking the higher dose single ball of stow. So, you know, I know the old school guys just run it five day was a five on two all like during the eights and those dudes, but I think that was mostly because they were limited by budget, but yeah. I don't know. I think when you get north of 10 units, it kind of becomes a midpoint. And how much fluctuation is there with IGF levels, right? Your peak doubt. I just really don't see that. So, when I say I use it every day, I don't know that it would matter if I went three on one off five on two off. You're not getting much fluctuation. Once you're at those. The only compelling reason I could see for taking some days off would be to prevent insulin resistance if you have to try to give yourself a break on that aspect. Particularly in the off season, I think, you know. Yeah, yeah, like so like if you would do some sort of carbs like when a clock cycling maybe, maybe it would make sense not to take it on your low day. Because IGF one production is going to be lower when insulin and carbs are lower too. So that's that's possibility. It's just a fat burner on those low days. So I don't know. I'm just thinking abstractly, but long story short. I take it every fucking day. I think we're all kind of in the same same agreement there. Single bullets every day on the off season long story short break it up in a couple doses on contest. If you're trying to burn for that. I know what for fun. Let me pick you back off that and just ask you Paul, you said you break it up into a couple doses. That's what I'm doing. What's your timing? What's all of our timing for those two doses? Well, I mean, if you look at the act of life on it, it's six to eight hours. But the way I structure my meals when I'm one prep. I like my usually it's first four meals or no carbs. Then I work out in the evening and I have my carbohydrate meals. So I take it in the morning and then I take it at night when I'm in a low carb state to increase my policies and then I kind of get out before my work out. And then use that as an opportunity to promote glycogen synthesis. So that's sort of my thought process. You could break it up. I've heard guys break it up into three doses pre work out morning. Before bed that might make more sense because it's active for about six to eight hours somewhere in that range depending on how your body metabolizes it. So if you want it, wanted it presence for the fat burning effects all day long, probably three doses make the most sense. I just curious when I wake and then prior to training because it ends up being about eight hours later. I'm not a pre bed. I've talked about it before. I can't do pre bed because it messes with my sleep. Really? Really? I get better sleep. And I've heard that from other people too. I think that's why that part I think is individual. It just racks mine. It'll chop my it'll chop two thirds of my lemon really. Yeah, I'm the exact opposite. That's like a baby when I take it at night. And I've heard that I'd like that. I've been asleep like a baby anyway. I've never had sleep as thankfully. Sleep issues in my life. I've been on some books. But about I had the first sub cue. I had always done it. I am thinking like, I'm going to get my levels up higher this way. And then I hear hey, maybe sub cue might be more beneficial. But you guys think. Yeah, I mean, I've talked to Kurt quite extensively about that. I mean, he did a lot of research on GHM from what I understand that there's actually there's some concern that I am that the peptide itself might get grown or damaged. I enzymes actually in the muscle tissue. And that it was the drug was designed to be administered subcutaneously. Are you telling me how do you call my gains? I spent a lot of money for that. Now you will get a it's going to be metabolized quicker. I am right. So you're going to have a quicker higher peak. I'm just going to be in an out faster. But I mean, the way the drug, I mean, if you look at the answer packet on on Sarah's time, it says administered. Prebud and a single bolus. That's the way the drug was designed initially to be used for. But it was not in defense of that. It was also designed primarily for kids who were HIV problems. That's not the same. You also tell you that's true. Yeah, we all do that. Yeah, I don't need that. I'm recalling conversation with Scott Stephenson a couple years ago that I had about. All right, let's say let's just say the same example 60 units of GH. Yeah, the theme was like why not just divide it into two doses that week and take like 30 a bolus 30 dose on Monday and another 30 unit dose on Thursday. And I can't remember the exact but I think like the results are about the same. Based off like literature and obviously underweight kids aren't, you know, lifting, heavy ass weights and eating tons of food and doing what we do. But I think in the studies versus daily versus, you know, once too we bolstowsing they're about the same. For what I mean, yeah, I mean if we think about it, if the IGF1 levels are raised for 36 to 48 hours, you could probably get away. We take it into a couple of times a week. You're not going to get the alipotic effect from the fat burner. If I look in for talking to a good girl. Yeah, we're just talking strictly for high-purchasing or growth or muscle, sparing muscle wasting as an HIV, how they use it. For anti-catabolic effects, but. That's a good question though. Sorry for the long-winded answer. Let's good. It's what we're here for. If you're in the market for protein powder, check out true nutrition.com. They literally have like every protein powder under the sun. So with their cold filtered weight isolate or their team skip blend, I prefer the chocolate peanut butter cut, but there's a few flavors that I like. Let me know if you have any questions about that. Victoria, my wife, she gets the P protein isolate. It's rare to find a P isolate. Most of them are concentrated. So the isolate is super low in carbs regardless of your diet. They will have a protein powder for you and you get to flavor how you want and buy it by how many of her pounds you want. So check them out. True nutrition.com. First company that ever supported our podcasting. So we support them. You can support us by shopping with your nutrition and using our code. Think about this one. And we're 10 days late on it. He said emergency question. So 10 days later we're answering. And this will come out for like another day or so. He says. I'm coming toward the end of a blast about 20 weeks. Made insane progress, but I'm starting to lose strength. Diet and training hasn't changed. I could eat over training. I tried taking a D load and it did nothing. I don't want to come off cycle until I gain back my peat. Peaks, pigs, drinks to maintain during my cruise. Do you guys think of this one? Well, I think number one it doesn't qualify as an emergency. So there's that. It's a muscle emergency man. Yeah, just a little cheap. It depends on your perspective. Yeah, exactly. It's angel. Is this due to a power lifter or a bodybuilder? I would assume. I'm guessing. Probably a Jim bro. Yep. Yeah, probably a Jim bro. I mean, to me, it's like if your body's giving you signals, it's had enough. It's had enough. And at this point, you're probably wasting drugs. You're wasting calories in your wasting energy. Getting from overtraining or overreaching into overtraining. And like you want to be a little greedy, but you don't want to stretch it to the wheel fall off when it comes to blasting off season. I would rather quit a little early and get into rest period in a surplus of energy, growth potential, less fatigue, etc. Be able to take that de-load and then cruise and then be able to get right back into it in six day weeks and hit it already. That's just me. Yeah. When do you guys usually see that the wheel start to fall off with the morph season? Like weak, weak-wise or like in terms of, Yeah, weak-wise. I think it depends on where it started to. You know what I mean? Like how lean was the person. Yeah. How lean. What are the stressors in your life? What about even for ourselves? Because I know myself. I proactively delund. I think I'm one of the few. Do you? I don't care. I'm anything. If I wake up and I'm like two days in a row and I'm like, I'm not feeling it this week. I just want to go to the gym. You know? Yeah, but that's more. That's a little bit more reactive. I mean, I will literally force myself at the sixth seven week. Even if I'm feeling like a million bucks and I preach it to my clients too. Coactive deloding will always have you come back in a better position. It's just hard to do psychologically because you're like, Oh, I can get another week. I can get another two weeks. Once you step into the, I think, once you step into that reactive mode, at least in my experience, then I'm too far. Then I'm the whole that I have dug is just a little bit too big. Proactively, then I always come back stronger. That was my argument when I said, I'm doing this every other week training. I've said it for years. I'm tired of taking a week off and then I come back and I feel like a million bucks. So when I take a proactively, that always happens. And the vast majority of time happens with clients too. But we tend to do them reactively. Not, not that it's bad. But sometimes when you take them reactively, you don't come out of that cruise. That's necessarily at a hundred percent. So that's my argument for the pro. You can't lose. I guess is what I'm saying. Even if things are going great, you're like, I can ride this a couple more weeks. The only time that I think, okay, it's probably a good idea. If you know something's coming up in a couple weeks, where you're going to not be able to train, then I can see extending it a little bit because you know that you're going to have that time. But my boring life with no kids or anything else anymore, I don't get that. I go on vacation to see the kids. I'm still training. It's the same boring life no matter where no matter the demographic or what I'm doing. I usually see the wheels fall off somewhere in that 16 to 20 week range. It seems at least for me. That's about the maximum I can push. And that's what I've seen with my clients with the drugs, the food, the PEDs. And like you said, skip a few programs and D loads in there. I can probably get, I like, I remember it's funny because Dante was doing D loads. Before our D loads were cool. I remember when he was training me back in the early 2000s. It was every fifth week. There was a D load. Yeah, it was four weeks of blasting. I remember in that fifth week was a D load. And then I could get probably three of those blocks. And before I needed like a break. Like I at least that's what I've noticed now. And it's like I, what I've seen too is like, it's weird with the strength. It's like when I pull back and go on cruise, I don't know if you guys have noticed this. Like a lot of times my strength will start going back up. Yeah. When I get out of the cruise. We've talked about that recently too. Like there might be a point with this guy that it's like just too much. Who knows he might get stronger coming off, right? Well, the inflammation is what I ended and I were talking about because I have a similar thing where every time I go TRT, I swear my progress is better in the gym. I feel better. The strength is up. The weights don't feel very heavy. Probably the first six weeks of TRT. And then it kind of levels off. That's fun to do that. Because I've been three weeks on 15 milligrams a test a day. And what it was I work out to 70, like 105, is that right, 105 milligrams a week. And my strength is right there. It's not even a little bit better over the last two or three weeks. So yeah. Yeah, it's wild. That's what I've always seen too. So it makes you wonder if it's not toxicity of the drugs. I always say, don't worry. Or maybe just the central nervous system is over attacks from all the endurgens. That's possibility to all of the above. The other thing is the body does sense in a lot of ways. The PDs as a foreign invader. And that's why a lot of guys have immune responses. We've all heard of test flu, right? I think there's extreme cases of that, right? Where a guy takes 400 milligrams a test a week. And he actually has like those crazy flu-like symptoms. But I do think there is a very immunosuppressive effect on varying levels for all of us, based off of PD loads. And maybe it doesn't exhibit itself as the flu-like symptoms, but fatigue and letter G and poor digestion, more information, all those different markers. And it builds slowly. It's kind of a frog in the boiling water. You don't see it until you finally realize, oh shit. I'm not in a very good spot right now. I was talking to Dr. Dean St. Marda about him. He brought up an interesting perspective. I never really considered when he was pushing antibiotics really hard for a long time. He talked about that. You'll see guys like initially like they can handle it. The blood work doesn't go so. Things hold up, but after a long period of time, you'll everybody ends up where the blood marker start to go south. And he speculated that your body, when you're pushing superficial, logical doses of stuff, eating a lot of food and training hard, that all of your stem cell resources are being used for head purchase, re-relevant and repairing organs. And that you have to pull back the hook, you have to pull back the food, you have to pull back the training, you have to pull back the PDs for a period of time to true TRT. Maybe like a six, eight week, 12 week period of time and let your body recover and get that. You let that stem cell pull recover so your organs can regenerate and repair themselves. That was an, I'd never really considered a thought about that, but that was kind of an interesting thought. I think that's why it's important that we have people who are smart, educated, academic, you know, in the industry as well. It makes for a good combination because that I agree with you. That's not even something that I would have, I mean, that's, that's way over here and then skip is over here. I'm medium smart, I'm in the middle somewhere. Grossmart. Right, right. Body fat percentages. How do a lot of these guy Jim Bros? Look at themselves and say that they have so and so body fat level. My Jim Bud has a decent six pack and he says he's around 10 to 12% body fat. Do they actually know what they are looking at to determine this? No. How many times have you guys had a client come to you and tell you they're 12% body fat and they've got at least 50 pounds on prop. Yeah. That's such a fact. It's, in the 90% of them say 10 to 12. The other 10 is 12 to 15 when really, you can, I mean, sometimes you can literally double it. 90% of the time. Yeah, you say 10% to whatever they say and that's probably our. Exactly. That's not usually very close. I think it's, what is it? Is it just a, I think, and I don't mean this, you know, in a bad way, but it's kind of just ignorance to understanding what a percentage of body fat looks like. You're going to do it. You're going to do it. Damn good at 10%. Because I've had someone send me, there's like a, there's like a meme or an image on Google search of like, what 10% looks like, what 5% looks like, what, you know what I mean? I think they're kind of compared. But they're only seeing like the good stuff and they're not remembering. Oh, yeah. I still got the love handles or I have, my, my glutes and hands don't have any lines. It's just one straight piece of meat going down, you know. But I have one other thing, do you guys get people that send you the in body scans? Oh, I'm not terrible. Please don't. And I'm just like, I don't even look at these. I'm sorry. Like first off, it's a flawed mechanism for calculating your body fat. It's based off of the estimation for one thing. And secondarily, what does it matter where your body fat is? If, if an A if we're in a prep, like it matters what you look like on, you don't bring a card that says I reached 4.2% body fat, you know? The only person I let actually check their body fat with hydrostatic Wayne was Jon Meadows. When he was like 3.3% back when he came out. Yeah. Okay. So like when he went, when if he was measured university, university setting hydrostatic Wayne at 3.3. And I'm like, you don't look anything like him, bro. Like the guy you got your abs and you got some glute lines. But your skin is not translucent like his is when you shine a light through it. You're probably more like 5.1 or 4.9 maybe. I don't think people realize how lean 10%. Yeah. You're not far from being stage ready. You look damn good at 10%. Okay. So let's piggyback off that. Let me ask you guys, what do you think the average person is from a body fat percentage? On stage when they're in really good like they're just peaked and wild. Not like the most ironic guy in the stage, but the average person. 5.5.5.5.3. I would have said 6. I said 6.5. I just said 6. I get my guys to get dexaskins at the beginning of prepping at the end. I always do, I'm not who knows how fucking accurate a dexaskin is. Like I always like 6 to 7 always looks decent. One of dexaskin. I've been as low as the high 4's on a dexa and I've been like last year. I was right at 6 when I got on stage when a dexa. So just again I'm going to piggyback. Which look was better on stage as far as fullness just over all total. I'm batting. I'd have put a million on the same. This was a better look. Yeah. We all want to be sure. We all go after that. They want to put a number on it too. Do you know what I mean? Like we're looking for like something tangible. I'm this percentage. I want to get to this person. Or wait, you know, you see people who are like, hey, I weigh this much. My goal is, you know, I'm going to look good at this way. But what will go on with the long line? You know what I do? They will do all kinds. You know what I do. You don't correct you though. They don't weigh this. They're sitting at. Oh, Jim. No one ever says I weigh. They say I'm sitting at the 20 right now. Yeah. Everybody, everybody severely over estimate. How much muscle they have in and They underestimate how fat. My experience. Everybody thinks they're at 250. We sitting at 250. I was always the opposite. I always underestimated the other way. Whenever I'd send pictures of the John, I'm probably fat as fuck right now. I'm probably four hours a day. Well, that's why you were successful. Yeah, I mean, I honestly will. It's like, well, you're only fooling yourself, right? When you make statements like that, like, because everyone else is like, well, like if you're a coach and you get something when someone's saying they're 10% and you're like, bro, you're clearly 17 to 19, maybe even 20%. So yeah. So it's only playing a game where now I have to convince you right now that you're going to have to work a lot harder than you think you do because we're not going to show up at 10 minus 4% of what you think 10% is. Sorry, you know? Yeah. I tell you something about a deck set that blew my mind. That's that. What's that? I tested at a percentage about a year and a half ago that I literally laughed at. Always, always thought the decks are was incredibly reliable, arguably the best practical measure or the most accurate measure that you could get. And the body fat level came to an end. Like, that's not that lean. She's like, oh no, you definitely said, I'll tell you what. I'll come back because they only let you take at least this place. Only let you take a deck set because they consider it next, right? Every three months. So I went to a different place three weeks later. And I had to literally beg them to do the decks on my stomach almost 4% different. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. And I knew it. I said, knew it. I had a really good idea because I think we all know. I didn't think this when I was younger. I was like, oh, this is bullshit. That doesn't make any sense. But typically as we age, the body fat, you don't carry body fat evenly from the front to the back. I was always lean as hell from the back. And now I can be damn near ready from the front. And I'm nowhere near ready from the back. That's right. Almost 4% different in that three weeks. That's pretty substantial. That blew it right there for me. I'm like, well, don't know how accurate that. Now, clearly it would probably still be accurate with all things being equal to same variables. If I were to always be on my back and I see those numbers coming. So I got a scale, weight scale that's off by 4 pounds. It's still going to read accurately from that first, that first read. So you're either progressing up or down. But it's still at the end of the day. It's not an accurate weight on the scale. It's not an accurate assessment of body fat. At least in my situation. Now it was a different deck say it could be argued that it was calibrated differently. But almost 4% no. I don't think that's a very good margin of error. Well, they have a, from when I understand it's a plus or minus 2% either direction margin of error. So they could be a good result. Yeah, either direction. Yep. That's larger than I would have thought. Yeah, on a big acceleration. Hydration. I thought. Not just hydration. I mean, who knows if that's accurate. Hydration also affects it too. Yeah. Yeah, and not just that stuff, but it's not as accurate as we like to think because I, I remember we had this, you guys remember when Ronnie Coleman did that interview with Joe Rogan and he said, I was negative 2% and everything went off when off on a middle. Like that's impossible. You would be dead, know this. And recording with Scott Stephenson at the time, he broke down how the decks of works and he had said he was like, you know, the reality is it's still going to be a flawed measurement. He explained why I couldn't repeat it. It was something years ago now. And he had mentioned he was like the only way in the scientifically the only true accurate measurement we can get is if we dissected you. That's the only way we could know for sure. Yep. Yeah. Where can we get that done? Put you in the meat. You know, somebody was listening to going, is that part? Oh, no, I can't do that. I mean, the decks is going to be the closest affordable thing hydrostatic panic or an MRI. It's probably going to be the most accurate, but even still is a margin of error. Yeah. So just take it with the grain of salt. All the way, the pictures will matter. Right. Right. Yeah. But the answer to the kids question now your buddy's kind of blown smoke. Yes. I think it's a minute to get that. But that's okay. We'll get to the answer. I think people were interested in hearing about body. Yeah. You know, real real calculator, real visual calculations from coaches that look at people's body fat all day. And the take home point of don't use the in-body scan. Let's get it. Right. I can't keep the look. They're at, like, just usually it's like a gen pot person and they're at their gym and and somebody conjures them into it. They're like, oh, you're doing really good. You're doing in-body scan and they get them. Mike, you know, the trainer at my gym is going to have me weigh in every week now. He says I'm doing such a good job. I'm like, yeah, okay, whatever. And then 40 dollars. Yeah. Yeah. Or the or their fishing for a client, you know, and you get the message all of a sudden, oh my god, I'm, you know, we have to change something. I've lost five pounds of muscle and I've gained three pounds of fat. How did this happen since Monday? You know, the new scales that use B. Yeah, it doesn't get anymore outdated than that. So, you know, people ask me all the time and not in the industry, but friends and family, you know, what scale should I get? One that just tells you how. Yeah. What you weigh? Because everything else is a giant waste of money. Yeah. Yep. All right, question for the next show from late, weight, baby. He says, um, says he's planning on doing, uh, test, decanoate, DACA and EQ. Plans start 100 milligrams of each compound Monday Wednesday Friday. So taking a total of 300 milligrams, uh, each weekly. Uh, is this a good ratio? Uh, I have used these compounds before, but never together, uh, in an experiment with EQ, I once ran 800 milligrams along with 200 milligrams of tests to see what it did to EQ and it tested at 9, uh, PG, uh, normally on 200 tests with nothing else. My Astridile sits at 40. So EQ does have some effect on my Astridile, uh, just that, uh, info might help with your answer. Are you married? Do you like to have sex? Does you want to have a girlfriend like that? That's going to matter. That's got test decanoate. Who the whole uses that? Yeah. That's the first thing I saw. It was on cycle. Yeah. I would also say, well, I guess I would ask the guy what your goals are. Are you just trying to dabble a little bit, I guess? Like to me, that that's not TRT, but it's also like, it's 300 tests. No, oh no. No, it's not never mind. Sorry. I can't get the manager. I can't get the manager. Yeah, I thought for some reason it was 300 each three times a week. That would be a cycle, but never mind. That's what I'd get. That's, I was actually going to be like, if you want to really, you know, see what these compounds could do. 300 of each Monday, Wednesday, Friday versus 100 milligrams. That was especially. Well, if he's coming from, well, I used to run, you know, 200 tests and 800 EQ. It's like, okay, so you're someone that's probably used to running some decent milligrams cycles. I don't think you're going to, I don't think you're going to see what you want out of 300 of each, you know, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. That's just my, actually 100 of each Monday, Wednesday, Friday. It's a cruise unless you're running a gram. There's an honest statement. Double the test. Let the, let the deck in the EQ make up roughly 50% of the rest of the, that's what I would do. Yeah, that's, yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of, spend the wheel with deck anymore, whether or not decks go to work. They're sure. We always get so many in the comments, so they're like, all I do that, go only all the time and it works great. You know, there's always that one just. We're so happy for you. I've been married for 33 years. My wife hasn't had the step out yet. I'm not going to give her a reason. It doesn't mean she hasn't. I just say I haven't given a reason. But I'm, but I'm, all right, we had some stuff at the stream here. Gamboni, Gamboni Law, our favorite lawyer who watches the show. He says a great show guys. Eddie thoughts on adding dim in burberry into my vitamin stack during the summer with a T RT if you are already 10% body fat. And he might as well let you tend to. I'd say it would be him up. He might be a lead. He's a lead. He's a lead. He's a lead. Yeah. I know if I'm ever in any legal trouble. I'm calling this cat. He's a good dude. Yeah. I guess I would ask him, what is the reasoning that he's thinking he wants to add him in? I mean, Burberry is usually a staple in most of my plans anyway, especially if someone's pushing food in any capacity and for other health benefits as well. But is he trying to maybe put on a little bit more mass and he's going to push his food a little harder? Is he concerned about his estrogen and his estrogen recycling and the liver for the dim? I guess I would ask him, I guess what I want to see, what are you taking? And then are you using any AI's with it? Where's your blood sugar at regularly? That kind of just some more information. Because I don't want to just, I don't give a blanket list of supplements that everybody has to take because I don't want people waste money if they don't need to waste money. And so I guess I would want to know a little bit more information. And I guess in this case, using Skips example, I'm reactive to what their labs and what their feedback is in terms of the supplementation. It's not just like he was a blanket list of 20 things to start taking them. Yeah. Do you guys think Deng actually does anything? I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. And then no. No. We've been seeing maybe. A little bit when, and especially I found like with natural, like bikini competitors, girls who aren't taking anything I've seen a benefit there. But not to the point where I would say like, oh man, we got to get our hand. Like it's not like a game changer kind of thing. And I wonder if he's natural because that may be more of the, and if he's a true 10% because he said with TRT. Oh, TRT. Okay. I missed it. My apologies. If he's a true 10% and he's not pushing size. Okay. If he's a true 10%. You're probably quite insulated at that point anyway if it's a true 10%. So yeah. If you're maintaining condition, there may be the thought of, and maybe I'll be a little dry, maybe to help a little bit with estrogen. You know, I'll get a little crisper look. I won't hold as much harder. Dr. I'm not going to hurt. But I don't see a huge benefit there. And I don't see the benefit of burying lessies pushing. I don't think it's bad, but it's the same time I don't think it's necessary. Yeah, you gotta be careful with burying too because sometimes you can check up your stomach too. There is that too. Sometimes guys will get tired of explosive diarrhea from burying. I've had a few situations where that happened. Yes, feel that people treat it as more of an innocuous supplement than, I don't want to say than it is, but then it is. It's certainly not bad, but I can just put it in there. It's almost like an insurance. I call it an insurance supplement. I think I don't want to get over the counter supplements, though. You know, sure. Well, guys will probably take things for stuff that they probably don't need to proactively take them for. I do like some burying in there for, you know, if you're running growth hormone and meat and shit ton of carbs to keep some insulin sensitivity in check, but we're probably for the doodle and TRT just working out just the general probably unnecessary to be honest with the probably both of them are unnecessary. And if you ever an acid in your shoes, just take an AI. Yeah, just that. There is, but yet it's a pretty small one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm going to say take out a DHD. Rather do that, yeah. If you can find it, have you guys heard from your resources about Primo still not being available or what's it? Because I'm not paying attention. Primo, I hear, was not available or hard to find. But put them on the back, but Master on is incredibly more expensive than Primo, right? Really? Okay. Yeah, sure. So I'm sitting in a gold mic. So what you're telling me? How are you going to say? Did everybody's on the, everybody's made the run for Master on? Yeah. Yeah. What do I do now? I think that's because of the Primo shortage. And then it's like, okay, I'm going to switch to masks. And so everyone over bought masks and stocked up. And now they're just a little bit of a shortage of Master on. That's kind of what I'm thinking. I can see that. I don't know what I'm thinking. John, do it's all the time talking about Master on too. So I think a lot of people run his protocols. They're, you know, Chase, all those guys. Master on was pretty popular last year in the Test Mass GH combo. So guys tend to follow whatever what everybody else is doing. It seems like I remember to skip your old, not many. Remember when Master on was considered a shit stare. No, but I would take it. Why are you taking that? That's what girls take. I had it on that list too. I was like, man, it's useless. Yeah, Primo too. People were like, yeah, we know how to run it. Being the worthless drug for a while. And then it just turned up. People weren't taking enough of it. Why remember back in the day, it was like you had to take 700 to a gram to get anything out of Primo. That was the, the thought. It's interesting how things have changed now. We did a podcast recently about like low dose compounds. And people were, I mean, we Dave and I did this. And we, you know, throw out some really low doses, but I expected this. People leave them were like, oh, you think that's low. No, you should be taking, you know, 50 DACA. I've been making fantastic progress with 50 DACA a week. Okay. Okay. Well, placebo's works sometimes. True. There's that. It was a good podcast though. We got a lot of views on what's the lowest dose, the lowest, you know, the lowest effective dose. We had a guy in the stream who says, and I had to how much he took. Yeah. Asked him how much he took. He didn't, I don't think he got back to us yet. But he has said, I took a lot of right at true tide. And I started throwing up why was this. What would you guys consider a lot of redder? Well, I mean, if you look at the phase two clinical trials, they went up to 12 milligrams. Yeah. That's a spicy dose. Yeah. I mean, I got an Amazon. Well, I want to get 75 exactly. I'm like 1.75. Yeah, that's about where I have been going to tune now. I'm going to tune now. Yeah, I was running a milligrams every fifth day. And then I went up to two and it was too much. And I backed back down to a milligrams every fifth day. I'm going to say, like, I think the trend is 1.5 to 2 milligrams is great. And I'm going to use the bodybuilders. That's what I'm seeing. That's what I'm using with people. I think more becomes overkill. And let's say less for most people doesn't really do much of anything. Like if you're trying to stick to less than 1 milligrams a week. But yeah, I'm finding that 1.5 to 2 milligrams is like that sweet spot for most people. I agree with that. Yeah. We got asked about filling out, trying to fill back out while on redder. What if you guys experienced with that? Because I was, you what? I guess, I was. But I moved with my dose to be able to push 900 to 111, 1200 grams of carbs and our high day. So I think if my dosage were higher and I was limited and the volume of food, cool, I'm, it's just a really good balance. If it were higher, I probably would struggle to get that in. I've seen, I don't know. I've seen people have a hard time keeping full. Yeah. Real. Two zip-a-times to that to me, like, at a very low dose. And so I pulled it. But if, if, if, if talking like a bodybuilder trying to carve up for a show and present, I would pull it, probably 10 days out personally. Well, I mean, it is a glucogonag, it is, which is going to affect glycogen synthesis. And theory only with a liver, but I mean, so that is something of a concern. I mean, if you're eating enough carbs and taking insulin, then you're probably conforms to the issue. Yeah, I kept my time. I mean, two meals in. I'm like, wow. Yeah. I've kept my carbs really low and I got super flat to the, but if this way, I'll be more sensitive than anybody else looking at me and I'll be like, oh, man, I look really small right now. You know what I mean? And I'm walking her and I'll say that to like my wife and she'll be like, no, you look fine. You know, I can't tell the difference. But it was at the point where she was like, you know what? You're looking small right now. So if she said it, that man and I could see it too. I was like, oh, yeah, no, I know. She saw it. And that's when I a little bit after that, because I realized I'm not filling out. So I backed the dough, styron, figured out how to fill out. And I needed insulin with that too to make it work. But now we'll see. I'm going to try to push back up. See what I would. I mean, I don't know how you guys are hearing a little bit on prep. If I have guys running and I'm young, can it two weeks or two weeks out? That's what I'm saying. That makes sense for like filling out for now. Absolutely. You also got to tell the person, like, hey, be ready to hit with a wave of hunger. Like a lot of people, it hits them like a wave. And they're like, I want to cheat. I want to eat everything like I eat. Yeah, it's like this, the noise has been like, dold. And then all of a sudden you just put these like high quality speakers in their ear. And they're like, I want to eat everything man. Yeah, I put it back in on the pocho. Yeah. That's a great time to put it back in. Yeah. That's down. My doctor just, I was going to say my doctor just put me on the jar. I'll see how that goes. OK. Stefan had said, wasn't for me. He said, what did he say there? He said, he took 0.5 milligrams of bread and life was hell for a week. Hick up, spurps, nausea through up twice and diarrhea. Whew. I hadn't heard that literally from anybody at dosing like that. Have you guys? I mean, some people are just super sensitive. I had one client that got really sick. And if you look at the clinical, the face to clinical trials, there was a small percentage. I think it was five to 10 percent. I don't recall the exact number that got really massive gastric symptoms. Like throwing out diarrhea. Just there was some issues with skin sensitivity too. Like guys would report their skin burning. Yeah, there's some other other strange side effects. I didn't, honestly, other than the sulfur burps and sulfur farts when I first started it, not went away. A little bit of acid reflux and some, a little bit of pulse, but they went away after a couple weeks. Then it settled down. I didn't really have any problem with it. I did a lot of people reporting that it makes them. How should I say? Constipator? More solid. Not necessarily solid, but if you are loose, solid. Looking bad? No, you do do. You do. Yeah, that's what I've noticed. I've had a trend of staying away from that. I've had to up my protocol with magnesium and stuff to keep things regular. Well, I mean, it's going to slow gastric amptium so that would make sense. Yeah. You know, so that's that's potential. And I've noticed actually, as I have IBSD, the, uh, up-sit problem. You got all the stuff, man. Between them. Yeah, I'm all fucked up. I'm old and old and fucked up. It's amazing. I like I look back and like how the fuck did I get my pro card with all the shit that I have going on? I just ignore all the health problems and just push through everything like a true bro. But I've noticed like it, it actually helped my digest and digestive issues when I, when I got on it, because probably the slow gastric amptium helped me out. And then like I speculate, um, because my diabetes is pancreatic and the way I'm going to be, uh, the way I'm going to be. So I suspect that a lot of guys that are older body builders may be have pancreatic in some efficiency and a lot of the digestive issues that they have is from lack of pancreatic function and then you don't, you aren't making enough digestive enzymes. And possibly the effects of the retratutite on how it increases pancreatic function could potentially increase digestive enzymes production. I don't, just speculation. Listen, me. And I have better not brought a lot of it. We don't speculate like that. And then like five years later, there's going to come a research study that comes out that confirms it. How many times have you had ideas about a compound or a drug? And you're like, this is probably why this is doing this. And then someone did a research study and you're like confirmed. Yep. I mean, that's bodybuilding, right? Exactly. I think I always tell people like bodybuilders are like five to ten years ahead of, of like science, even if they're drugged at pharmaceutical companies have developed, they're true actions and side effects and all the different benefits. Like bodybuilders have experienced that a hundred times over and it's a known thing in our community. But if you tell somebody that outside of the community, they will laugh. I think you. But I think, I think they're like, because I'll talk to people, I'll talk to my parents about stuff. Like with all my dad has a lot of autoimmune issues. And I put him on a whole bunch of different things that have helped. And he was like, well, I ran these by my doctor and the doctor is like, you don't know what you're talking about. I'm like, well, they're supposed to say that because that's the track that they were taught. And it's saying, oh, yeah. They're not. Exactly. And I'm like, respectfully, I'm not saying they're stupid. I'm just saying that like, they don't look at things the same way bodybuilders and coaches do in general on different applications of things. And sure enough, now like the doctor's approved. So how about something that is simple as this? How many years, what, ten years ago, we all started using BPC-157, right? The medical community had no idea about it. And I remember when I partially tore my bicep and I'm going in and I'm telling the doctor what I'm doing with BPC, GH, and TB, and all the other stuff. And he was like, what are these things? And then I pulled up three or four research papers. And he's like, why don't I know about this? I'm a surgeon and I help people get better. Like why don't I know about this stuff? And I'm like bodybuildings like five, ten years ahead of everything dude. And so he had me keep on consulting with them and sending him stuff. And he's like, I'm bringing this to my practice. That's awesome. Yeah. And now I mean, every clinic in the world is talking about BPC-157. So, yeah. They're progressive and they're not 60 year old, white doctors. Why is it white? It's an old white guy thing. We get stuck in our ways. Hey, speaking to BPC, that's a great segue. Let's talk about your surgery recovery, Paul. Let's go and on with all that, man. Well, it's putting a pizza as I mentioned earlier. No. I taught, this was hilarious, man. When I went in to do my surgery, or when I went into do the console before the surgery, the doctor looked up, and he goes, I know you. He's like, I saw you on a podcast with Dr. Mike Isritael. And I'm like, yep, that was me. Yeah. So, I'm like, well, I know you're down with what we do. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's watching vigorous Steve and watching Dr. Mike. He knows stuff. Anyway, like his advice was, and I never really considered this. He told me to wait a couple weeks post surgery before I start through on the peptides in, because the accelerated scar tissue. Oh, yeah. A accumulation, because the peptides are going to increase collagen synthesis. So, I'm holding off until two weeks post surgery. And his suggestion was to wait until I get into refold, I did my first rehab session today, get into the rehab, and then I can start introducing that stuff in to make sure that there's no lip-little body do its initial healing process to heal up the wound site. So, I knew that. But I didn't ever hear it time frame on it. So, he's saying two weeks. That's interesting. He told me two weeks. He told me to wait two weeks. So, I'm going to do that. Yeah. I'm going to do the typical stuff. Some BPC, TB500. I'm going to TRT right now. I'm going to run GH, you know, 5, 6 units, nothing crazy. And then probably a little low-dose antivirus. Antivirus. Good for collagen synthesis and wound healing. It's originally what it was designed for. So that was what I used when I did my ACL Terran. I was able to get back in six months from the ACL Terran. They told me about five months recovery for this. So, if I cut it down like three or four, I'd be happy with that. Nice. Nice. And then it's back to training. And I would like to do a show next year. Possibly we'll see. But I'm the one who said there's a man in the latest. I'm sorry. I think there's a leg. But I was saying I'm the one who said that one time though right now, I'm really downcised. Yeah. To be expected though. Yeah. I was going to add the Dante told me to use collagen. That's when I first got hooked on it when I tore my super spinatus. And I was using growth. No, was I using growth? I can't even remember at the time. But I remember though that I got that. The one thing, yeah, wasn't using growth at that time yet. And I remembered that the one thing I noticed is with GH, I was notice my fingernails grow a lot faster. And I got the same effect from just taking collagen. I was like, there's something to this. So, you know, you can't really tell if it worked or not. But I'm a believer after seeing the side effects I got. Well, it's kind of like you got to think about it this way. The collagen is just proteins right there in amino acids. So your body is going to break those down and do with whatever they need to. But if you have the stimulus there to increase collagen synthesis, so the growth hormone, the BPC, the anover, taking some collagen peptides, to potentially help with the additional collagen synthesis. But if you're eating plenty of protein, there's probably enough amino acids present. Anyway, but it's just, they're just amino acids within the day. That feels the same. Yeah. That's why I always tell it's got to kind of, I don't know if it. I can't tell you a little talk to you about that. I'll tell you a little bit about that. Yeah, no, I'm not saying that. I mean, I always say, yeah, I always say, yeah, yeah. I don't think he works any more. He works any more. He works any more. That's cool. I just on paper, breaking them down. Maybe I didn't have a few guys that I went to school with were doctors. And I'm like, just sell me on this. And they're like, I can't. They're making the acids. Well, you don't skip. There were also a horse and carriage just before their cars. And those people are being like, well, play. Well, that's my favorite. I was waiting on that because I was like, he says, he's so against you guys weren't there with us. I'm kind of trying my notes on it. I did a video on this recently. But yeah, when I looked into it, it's the raw. There are certainly amino acids necessary to synthesize collagen. And that's what's in the collagen peptides. Now your body will do whatever with them. If you don't have the right tools in place to increase collagen synthesis, they're doing nothing at the end of the day. So think of it like delivering bricks to a construction site and there's no construction workers there. Yeah. The HGH, the, the, the, and a var, the BP, C's. I like their construction workers, the collagen's like the bricks to the construction site. Yeah, I mean, I think you have some of your knowledge. I would believe you have some of your own workers without it. But you have to do. Yeah, you do. But you know what I mean with them. When you are old like me, they might not be many workers with the job site. So what's the, what's the recovery on this? Like what are they, what are they say how long is this going to take? Um, tell me about five months, about five months and then I can start going back to full activity, uh, 46 weeks in the sling. Uh, the main thing is with the bicep tendon, the shoulder wasn't worried about the, but the bicep tendon because of the way they drill a hole through the bone and anchor it through. And he was worrying about because of the muscle mass that I have ripping that, that, uh, graft out of the, or ripping that, um, that where they, the anchors out of the bone where they anchor that thing in basically the screwed into the bone. Yeah. Who? So that was, that was the, that was the worry to not have to take my time. I had a, and how did this happen? Well, how did you get to this point? Just wear and tear. I don't think told me. Instead it was just years and years that bicep tendon gets loose and then it starts rubbing across the super spinatus, the labor and the bone up there and it just basically gets soft off over years and years and years and years and years of wear and tear. He told me specifically there's some exercises that are probably at long term calls. This type of stuff like he was telling me like if you, we're always talking about stretch mediated hypertrophy, but he was talking about like if you're getting like big stretches on things like dumbbell flies and, um, if you're doing wide grip bench presses with your arms out like this, it's not much of sweating. But those, those put a lot of pressure on that tendon and stretch that tendon out over time. Pull ups like if you're, or pull, pull down like if you're letting yourself stretch really far at the other end of it, he said it might be best not to, not to go for a full stretch on those things to save the bicep tendon long term. And he talked about like distal bicep tendon ruptures like at the bottom. Um, a lot of guys do that on preacher curls when they get they really long stretch it in the preacher curls they snap that distal tendon that happened to you, Andrew. I didn't snap the tendon, but I tore piece of muscle off the tendon and it, yeah, a day before show or two days before show. So yeah, that's like the worst time to get hurt too because you're so dried out from the drugs. Yeah. It was a 20 or 25 pound dumbbell, like last exercise of the prep literally last set of the probably shit. That's like, I'm like, oh fuck, so I'm just happened. And then yeah, I was supposed to go to Babs gym and pose for Steve and do a photo shoot that day, but I canceled that and I still did that. It was a Eastern USA's 2018. I still did it. And then when I was on stage flexing my bicep in the first front double because I didn't hit a pose because I was kind of scared. I'd done like the very light posing. And the first time I hit a pose, I heard another little poth. And I was like, my mother did I just, I look over. I'm like, did I just tear the whole thing? And luckily I did it. Remember Bumstead when he did, what was it? 22 Olympia where that bicep was like kind of cloudy. He heard that it was, yeah. That's how it looked on stage for me. Like it was the size was there. But it just, the information and all that. It just didn't have the same peak. And oddly though, like because of that little tear, it's kind of like the J. Colbert tear. It gave me a better peak on that side going forward. Once it healed back up. Yeah. It was a better, better look on my bicep overall. So I was like, can you try and tear the other one? Well, I was the doctor. I was like, hey, when he said it was nothing to fix on this one. He's like, it's nothing I can really do. You tore the muscle off the tendon, not the tendon off the, I was like, well, can you do it on this side for me? You looked at me like I was crazy. They did tell me that because they pulled the bicep tendon down lower and inserted it lower that I would have a higher peak. I have really flat bicep to be given with because I really long, long tendon see so that that should give me more of a peak. So I'll have to hide one arm. I don't know if it's for your out of the other side. I just have that side down here. Yeah. Do that. There we go. Well, listen, we appreciate everybody tuning in and Paul. We appreciate you taking the time to hang out with us, man. Yeah, man. How are you talking to us? How are things going over at anabolic bodybuilding? What are you got coming up? Oh, good. I'm just doing my thing, man. I got to the anabolic seed core suck. If you're anybody wants to go a deep dive into PEDs that's there's about 60 hours of content on there right now. 100 or so modules. I've worked on it with Kurt Hayden's. We've put a lot of work into it. I think it's a pretty, pretty solid course. Sorry, my dogs are growing off in the background. But other than that, just making content and coaching and helping people. Oh, yeah. That's cool. And you said you're going to be out at what was that? Masters. You're going to get a new one of Masters Nationals. I'll be there probably at USA's North Americans. I don't think I'm going to do the Olympic of the share. I get some shit going around the Olympia. So I don't think I'm going to make the Olympia. We'll see. Okay. How about New York? You going to New York at all? No. I'm not going up with that one. And then I know you wanted to do possibly Tampa this year before the engine happened. What are you looking at for possibly 2026 or is it not even on the menu yet? We'll see. I want to go through the rehab first. So that would put me back in the training again, full force, early fall September October. If I could get a short off season in and then do a prep for a summer show. So probably I was thinking of the Tampa or maybe Chicago pro. There's not many pro shows that have Masters divisions. So actually, I did look up the thing because I was oddly looking myself earlier today. The hurricane in the same peach show. Either one of them or both of them have the Masters 40, 45 and 50 clients. Yeah. I think there's Tampa. Tampa does too, yeah. But I'm saying like if you're looking for shows even later in the season, if you needed to push that time back a little bit, they're like September, October or maybe November. So you got a little bit more time if that recovery just wasn't happening and you wanted a longer off season before you started. Yeah. I'm down about 240 miles on stage at 250. So I need to put some science back on. But I just been cruising on TRT pretty much since my show. I just, I just, I think. With that break though, you may come back real fresh. That's what I'm thinking. Very well. And you might rebound really, really well. I've been like my diet. I had to just get tired of eating. And I've only been eating like three times a day. That's kind of what I've been doing the last three, maybe four. I don't think you're still bodybuilding food. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're going to break my two good. But I look forward to getting back to a structured diet though. Yeah. We appreciate you guys tuning in. And of course, we've got Paul's link in the description. Head over to see him and a bodybuilding. I'm sure you guys already are. We have a good crossover here, I think, because your channel is one of our more watched channels.

that you will get attached to me but as a friend on a deeper level because then sex is involved. So if you need sex just have it with me and I do with you and you'll see how it will help you. Then we will keep our coach client relationship because I don't want to lose you as a client and then she literally says I've just had all my coaches want to sleep with me so this time I don't want to add that in. Which is I mean that very there when I read that one like wow that's more indicative of the larger problem in the industry that maybe isn't being talked about enough.

Sports Nutrition they've got awesome health supplements if you guys are in the UK you already know about Strom so I don't need to tell you anything more guys we have a bunch of stuff going on we're gonna have a physique critique we have a bunch of listener questions things that you guys comment on the last show speaking of which if you want to take part in the next show comment below we'd love to have you as part of the programming by the way thank you to everybody who's watching live from the Facebook group today we're gonna have some fun record a couple episodes and hang out with you but before we get to all of that we've got uh what could be like a controversial topic I really think after talking to you Andrew this is something that really kind of needs to be said I feel like it's a type of education that um people who are going to work with the coach should have um you know as coaches ourselves they really upsets me to see uh people taking advantage of and to give our professions a bad name so really I mean what do you call the the topic here is this like like shady coaches really is what it comes down to coaches predator coaches um and I think when I first sent this stuff to you like a week ago I don't think you guys were really sold on it like I don't think you really understood what this guy was doing and what maybe some of these other coaches are doing but then I sent you some of those messages that um that I had gotten from a friend and I think it kind of became apparent you know what man I I before you even sent it to me I got it and I understood it and and I knew that the stuff happens and I just honestly I just kind of have turned away and been like well you know what I'm not a part of that that's not my problem sucks to be you know that guy he's a fucking you know loser and I hope you burns and how move on with my day you know but the reality is though that I think that they're you know what there's some innocent people that have gotten themselves into positions where they've been taking advantage of and that really does bother me and if anything we try to educate people with her programming and if we could help people to be more aware to not put themselves into a vulnerable position you know then we're definitely still doing a really good thing with our show so that's that's where my stance is at this point you know sure which probably talk about what we're talking about yeah yeah late honest yeah all right so you know many of our listeners and followers probably follow some of the same people we follow on Instagram but one of my friends John Dorsey who goes by at Goob goob you he uh well he does as he kind of highlights he's ruthless in the fitness and yeah he's worth if he got a lot of some of his stuff but you know he goes after frauds and in the terms of people editing their photos photo shopping making themselves look bigger they're ways look smaller of leaner than they are et cetera and he doesn't hold back with you know anybody it could be an amateur or coach who's using his pictures to get clients to top I have to be professionals that are editing their pictures to look better and their competitors next to them to look worse and then kind of putting it out like well you know how to this girl beat me kind of thing but one of the topics that he does I'm sorry that he did this week was on a body builder and I'm gonna use his name because it's out there in black and white you know we do hear a lot of these things in the industry but you know we can't necessarily judge or point him out because we haven't seen the direct evidence ourselves but in this case it's pretty clear uh bodybuilder Sam Kannon do he he's been he's kind of a predator to his female clients or not kind of what he is should we say allegedly like it's imprint like that you know it's funny it's romantic because the text messages and all the messages are right there so technically it's allegedly because if well I don't want to give any ideas but yeah allegedly it is but it's all right as much as allegedly as Jenny and Phil with the text messages I mean you can call what you want but it's right there and you know what people can make up their own minds because it's pretty obvious yeah yeah but anyway the point being you know asking telling female clients that they need to check in nude making sexual advances towards this female clients commenting on their physique in a way that is very unbecoming of a coach very unprofessional you know talking about talking to them sexually and I think you know the three of us and many of the coaches we know that we count as friends in this industry that is the last thing that any of us are interested in doing in terms of putting someone in a position to feel that they're being taken advantage of like these people are paying somebody yeah yeah these people are paying somebody for their expertise to get them into better shape whether it's you know your housewife who just wants to lose 15 pounds and look better for the summer to top competitive bodybuilders who you know want to one day grace the Olympia stage so I think with that I think we should show some of these pictures just in case some of the people have not been able to watch the videos that gobs done all right so I'm just gonna grab these screencaps you sent me I'm putting those up there I gotta ask you guys this when you read the comments I'll just speak for myself I guess but I'm asking you if you felt the same way it really wasn't like you were reading messages from a coach yeah it was reading messages from like an interested like boyfriend who someone who has met a woman and the complimentary creepy weird yeah that's where it comes in where when you go oh my god this is like this is a coach like for real that's a good point man now you know and some of the stuff you know he's not from this country so maybe there is a little bit of a language barrier in terms of you know some of the syntax of the language but I agree with you like the vibe wasn't you know talking to a coach it was the vibe of like talking to a potential boyfriend or something like that in a lot of this case but I think if you look at the first slide on the left you know he's asking for what he needs as a coach now me personally I don't think it's very professional to do this kind of talk through DM and text message that's just me I want to go through email but that's you know that that might just be my issue no I agree and then that's a regular thing that you're covering yourself with communication but it is to someone who maybe he hasn't been training people a long time new client new coaches they will do things a different way but I just agree with you it's it's far more if anything ever comes back on you that can be far more admissible and easier to get into court than something that you're either text messaging or you know any other what's up or any other bullshit but yeah I generally try to lay it out in an email and I'll say like here's what we want but then after that if somebody needs clarification I will go to I use what to app and I will text from there but I never use social media as a you know and like I'm just to in front of sorry I was just gonna say to like this is him explaining this is like well if you're but tell me look like let's go over this because we do have audio listeners too Andrew so what are we looking at here this is like his I would call like the first email he sends or sorry the first in his case text messages he sends people you know but onboarding basically telling them what to expect how to check in yeah do you want me to read it sure yeah so for me is a coach I need none close and this is where you need to be okay with that because I need to see literally everything to see where you're holding your fat or your underwater if you aren't comfortable with that then it then it'd be it'd be hard to work but we can still work together it's just hard for me to see it's kind of like going to the doctor to get a boob job and tell him you can't show him your boobs see what I mean photos and text will be confidential and sent to my client based phone with the number I will give you so I think right off the bat I mean it's not the same thing as going to a professional doctor who does breast it's not even close to the same that that's not a good analogy whatsoever well even if you can get by without on the first text message to compare himself to a medical doctor with that type of integrity just wait to get to the second or third text message page and you'll see that that's not the case all right yeah all right but oh actually for the other thing you don't need to see everything like I'm sorry but there's there's no way you need to see nipple fat or yeah no way you need you know I won't get as demonetized but there's no way you thank it for every area of somebody's body to determine if they are going to be in show condition or not yeah and you know maybe there are some people that are new to the sport that are naive or they just want to fall in line and do what this coach says I feel bad for one though and I hope that this yeah and that's what will help them exactly yeah yeah again about the photos will be confidential and never exposed and they are store or in a coach and client based only phone this is mainly just for me to see your progress and only me added another and me okay once once I see I'll always share with you where more works needs to be done but then again if you are not comfortable with this then by all means we can work with what you feel comfortable with that we can go from there thank you again and let me know how you want what you want to do maim have a good night I tell my clients if they aren't comfortable with the photos go to a Victoria secret and buy a disposable panties they sell and wear those so then he just continues to kind of ask that person hey you interested and this particular person was very turned off by the nude photography she said she was going to find a coach that didn't require that he was really focused on that you know like if you're going to work with me you're going to have to you know be okay with this and he's like and then he went into great detail didn't he about what you're going to have to say what he was he goes oh I never said nude I asked for none cloth what's the difference there I mean I feel like that's part basically saying the same things but I think those are good there's some other there's some other pictures or some other messages I sent you all right we're going to bring those up let's say here's another one some of the responses though I thought I think that's what the main thing okay so this woman there's a several of this from this woman and she checked in with him sorry about the beanie snowed here and it's freezing in my house so his comment responses damn babe you look hot like so good beanie looks sexy on you hell yes on the beanie I'm amazed how good you look in I love the nails by the way can't go wrong with the French now totally a medical doctor like this adds up yeah I mean I know I've gotten that from my medical doctor before you do where beanie's I mean you said there's like one two three four five five and a half to six sexual and you endos there that he's dropping on her yeah I like damn babe like you're gonna call your client you're gonna call your client but I get irritated when I go into the tanner in the 60 year old girl calls me hun yes we don't we don't know each other I don't need to patronizing I'm old but you don't need to patronize we don't need to say that shit yeah is this the same is this the same one here no this is it but there's more there's more comments I think this was I just put another one up here this is the next one down oh yeah so this is the same person so she checked in again the following week God babe you look beautiful so there's that babe again godly I think he meant the right god oh okay okay okay everything's something is wrong I'm gonna say sick so just ignore me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely beautiful not just fit and ripped but your body looks beautiful like don't take this in a pervert way because it's not what I mean but when I look at your body looks desirable if that makes sense like you don't look bulky or overly muscular or nasty drugged up you look perfect hmm now I think clans are looking for a little bit of our opinion on how they're looking but not in that respect right I honestly I'm surprised this woman checked in with them more than once tell you the truth after that first one unless you know maybe I don't know oh so this one I think she this is a continuance of the conversation and he asked her how old are you I forgot to ask and you said you weigh 120 right now I'm wondering if he's asking this is a younger person just making sure they're over the legal limit but anyway he continues I get so mad and this is just a side note but I get so mad when women want to pretend like they don't want sex even though their sex drive is high I'm single and I only have been single for a couple months and I've been trying to meet I think he continues on to say new people yeah but anyway we continue on it says anyways I'm happy your sex drive is there and your boyfriend and I'm sure your boyfriend enjoys the heck out of it but I was sorry it wasn't it wasn't high because then that means your hormones are screwed up so there's his professional there's one professional analysis of that whole conversation in the end and the technical term is screwed up and referring to the hormones yeah all right I grabbed that next one and I'm just skipped down yeah there's a lot of banter back and forth but listen Friday I want you to take photos with the same underwear and top and naked because I want to see the difference in a week also do them empty stomach please and send me your weight with it yeah just asking for another naked one let's go on to the next series if there's one where he straight up tells a girl that he's yeah she should have sex with them all right I'll just I didn't read all of them so I'm not sure which one that was was this I'll just grab them one at a time yeah it sounds on this line okay yeah just go ahead and let's put up the next one okay so anyway what we're doing is we're sharing like a series of conversations here that these women have have sent to you had sent to go oh anyway so he was also ripping off his his place of employment allegedly allegedly but you know in here it says he's telling the female client to come get some GW cardering basically he says come on Sunday night so I can give it to you super cheap when Marla wasn't there also when you come Sunday for progress you also you will come Sundays for progress picks babe so he's not there either so why would you if you're doing your job professionally not want the owner of the business to be there while you're doing your quote unquote professional progress pictures I know I know skim skip yeah I'm pretty sure you want to have sex I'm pretty sure that's what he wants yeah yeah yeah keep going off this one all right here's a nice laughing isn't attempt at levity it's yeah anyway condoning before anybody you know any listeners you jump on me for having a shitty sense of humor about it that's all it is no way can don't this behavior yeah no no all right here's this is the last one I wanted to actually the second the last one because there's one more basically he's talking to a client and he goes that you will get attached to me but as a friend on a deeper level because then sex is involved so if you need sex just have it with me and I do with you and you'll see how it will help you then we will then we will keep our coach client relationship because I don't want to lose you as a client and then she literally says I've just had all my coaches want to sleep with me so this time I don't want to add that in which is I mean that very there when I read that one like wow that's more indicative of the larger problem in the industry that maybe isn't being talked about enough and he continues to say all I'm trying to do is help you talk to you on it but you definitely need to let go of probably an exploits friends name there and let yourself define the menu want yeah the rest of this is an important that's the fact that he's yeah the fact that he A he's he's literally a one of the string of coaches she's had in a row that has have tried to sleep with her like that's just crazy yeah let me throw something in here too because somebody like this doesn't approach every female client like that what's they get about that goes after he can't he won't go after the stronghold to tell him to go fucking south and they're going to out him and everything it's a feel it's almost like this fucking vibe that they can they can almost pick out and I hate to say this word but I'm sorry because I can't think of a better one there's almost a weakness okay it's almost like I know I know that that's a shitty word because then it implies that in some way that's what a predator so a woman is is the cause they're being a victim but that's not the case all it is is it's they're not as forward and is fuck you and that's sort of thing so they can pick it's it's it's similar to a guy or it's similar to a person sexually abusing a child it's the same thing like a teenager or something where they know or they have an idea that they can keep their mouth shut or that they're in some way intimidated by them or psychophantic in a sense maybe that's not exactly the word but there is an obscene psychophantic type of vibe that they get otherwise they they wouldn't risk being outed yeah and god knows this motherfucker didn't just start doing this I will say I like this last one I like this last one because he picked the wrong chick and uh oh he starts giving it back to him yeah yeah I don't know exactly when I'm there and then but she she got he must have gotten really mad at her to the point where he's saying and all these fake ass braids L-O-M-A-O dirty ass hair of yours like she's he's like yelling at her he's a beat like this is abuse okay flat up you know this is abuse all the way down to you know using the n-word against this woman like yeah I assume this this client was of was a black female yeah um that he probably tried to get with and she probably rejected him we don't have the full you know string of comments but you can kind of deduce that something went wrong in their relationship it culminated with him dropping the n-word with the hard-ar by the way on her so I have a feeling she didn't want to play ball with that is what that came down to and she probably my gasses she called him out is what it that's what I would guess in a situation like that may least so yeah I guess I mean what are we when it go from here because one of my questions is you know what what can we do to help our community because this is fucked up and I don't want to see this continue to happen hey I don't want to see people getting hurt like this is a fun sport I love bodybuilding and I want everybody who gets into it to have the opportunity to have a great experience versus some people they might run into a coach like that and be like you know what this isn't for me and walk away and then you know get cheated out of that experience so how can we help people I think you said bodybuilding yeah you said bodybuilding is a fun sport right and it is but for the three of us on this podcast it's a professional business and we treated as such and we treated the same way as if we were carpenters or we were school teachers or whatever line of business you know and I look out of this way it's awareness like if you like okay we just had our roof done today right well if the roof starts leaking in three days I'm gonna absolutely say something to other people who maybe inquire at me about how did that company do on the roofing job so I think it's the awareness you know talking about this kind of stuff and I even like I you know talking to Google last week kind of got some ideas about maybe starting something but database of coaches and clients and I know Adam McBass started you know trying to do this couple years ago but he wanted to charge money right from the coaches like 30 bucks a month or something like that to get to get judged or whatever but maybe like a database where someone can put the coach or the clients name because I'm including clients and they're also and then just maybe you're experienced with them or you know maybe things they did wrong like hey this guy asked me for you know pictures nude or you know this guy just wouldn't not let me take 2000 milligrams of trying to weak or whatever you know yeah so yeah even and I completely agree with you 100 percent but I just think too that if clients because I think this happens a lot happens in society outside of our industry too you know something bad happens to you if someone treats you like shit sometimes it's just like oh it's not even worth it you know you walk the other way and that leads the door open for them to continue to whether it's a business a person who's a trainer a roofer you know or anything like that it it's it's all the same shit and I think when we don't it's almost feeling obligation myself personally you know some people will think well you're just going after this guy I feel obligated that we do that and if something else comes up next week there needs to be more of this but it would be better coming from the clients because when it comes from trainer sometimes it can be misconstrued to be like oh your jealous or he's got this or he's a he's a pro in his physique and he can't say I don't know there's a main different fucking things but when it comes from a client and then there becomes a pattern then that says a lot and especially with social media I think that if there was this egregious behavior and there was a pattern to it I do think that those coaches would it would it would get attention I don't think it would be lost in the shuffle but the database a good idea you just gotta get somebody to do it and you gotta get somebody to do it for free and it's hard to get people to do shit for free these days are my dual patreon okay what what do you sound about I yeah what do you think about I wanted to ask a question Andrew and I we're on the phone for a minute earlier today talking about doing this topic you would mention another situation with a coach that had a non-disclosure agreement that is clients you had to sign I'm not gonna name yeah I had a question with that that these other stores yeah just and there's a lot of other ones I haven't seen concrete evidence but let me ask you I have seen a lot of different non-disclosure agreements and stuff and I wanted to ask your opinions I mean obviously that puts you as a client into a physician where you would feel like oh I legally can't say anything now but what do you even think about those agreements do you let me and do you guys have like agreements like that or do do your clients have to post three social media posts and take you every week? no okay good client job is not going to get them right and those waivers and the disclosures I mean you're talking about at least most of us if you're good you've been around for a while you're working internationally anyway so not only are waivers useless in the United States other than them basically just being a deterrent yeah but really legally good luck with that but outside of the United States you're at the mercy of whichever international law I mean come on over a trainer look I'm not saying it can't happen I'm saying as they got bigger fish to fry another thing is going on and I think honestly I think that's what pushes some of this this behavior not only train people even scamming people what are the repercussions I mean is anybody really gonna be able to run you down probably not the only other concern I have with the database is this what if you have because I mean it it's not out of the realm of possibility that newer trainers could go after other trainers to kind of discredit or how do you keep the credibility in these are questions obviously that we need to do working how do you keep the credibility of the actual allegations literally ruin someone who didn't do anything wrong so then you have to wonder is there an opportunity for that person to come back and explain to be like are you kidding me this is what happened or is it just matter fact that's the allegation and it's stuck to that person I don't know there's some there's gray areas there a funcels with us as a lawyer and he says an agreement that violates the law isn't valid huh there you go hey guys I'm gonna take a brief

I've least blow to everything thanks for watching thanks for your support so we have a bunch more stuff including a physique or tea coos this let me find these pictures who do we have here Andrew oh well you want to give you all these pictures here let's see sure I see it's not right this rob oh yeah rob rob vansan yes it's a cool name do he should be like I did or a wrestler or something or yeah like rob van damn yeah it's like that isn't it yeah yeah what just got is a broke heart anyway that's a different he got his pro card at the 2021 NPC USA's okay and I can't remember what how many pro shows he's done I know I think he's from the East Coast because I feel like he did the Eastern USA's like I don't know four or five years ago and one the overall there but he wanted a physique critique so I'm really like the detail in the front of his quad like that it's just like I'll twist it in N'arley looking yeah I like that as I say there's almost crickets from from me and skip when there's a someone with a much better physique there's a lot to appreciate here he has a really good genetics and and I'll say too for our audio people I mean you can see what we're looking at here is a well-developed young body builder like his muscle looks young too like he's got like he could keep growing if he wants to like he's got a lot ahead of him you know fantastic quads really nice shape I will let me ask you guys this so when we do you know when judges do a critique they always start with their strengths what do you guys see as rob strings oh I mean obviously a structure I can see a little bit of his calves too yeah his shoulders yeah shoulders and you know it's funny because you said that you know he clearly does have good quads good shape which is a huge bonus yeah but I would also say that they I would I don't want to jump to the weaknesses to stay with you yeah yeah exactly yeah I don't I don't see any major strengths because I just see kind of a really good balance overall especially in that front shot and you know what this is probably the biggest genetic gift he has because he's in his offseason I believe the fact that he stays fairly lean the same throughout his whole body the only the only the only place I see that he holds a little bit of body fat is the glutes yeah yeah I mean you you could show me that front picture and be like oh he's five weeks out and I be like you know yeah yeah yeah you've even closer actually but if you I want to jump to the weakness what I'm just weakness I see is his back yep I think he needs to add more lats and carries there uh to increase that the taper and it actually would just help from the front because he has a really nice vacuum probably not the smallest waste in the world but small enough with that vacuum that with a little bit more lats from the front bang it's just gonna blow that shot away yeah that'll make him a lot more of that everything if you took everything the same and his upper body he didn't increase anything except his back width and the lats as well it would make a huge difference now that takes me to the legs though and I don't want to be the guy you know I don't want it again this is tough because he's got a better physique and I do but he's got really good shape in his quads and his hands I do think that there is plenty of room for more size mm-hmm yeah you know what I mean if I go straight and back I'm like dude it would make a huge difference moving forward yeah it's almost like the attachment um you know on the outside of the kneecap if it was just a little bit lower there I think that would might change your opinion a little bit but but yeah more size overall yeah back and back and legs I got to I will say he's tall is he oh shit I don't know because it's coming from the countertop where he's doing and I don't know he kind of looks he looks taller based because think about how tall a stove is I think stover generally gonna all be about the same height aren't they yeah and he's he's maybe a foot from the stove would you say I feel like the stove I feel like the stove like comes up to my way so it's like he's I feel like he's like foreign just taller than me I think I bet he's five foot 10 I'd see that maybe yeah five five eleven somewhere in there yeah I'll tell her you and your your taller's two and a half but now I'm six one and three quarters I guess yeah I'm gonna see we've got a couple more pictures all throw up here he's got a oh he's got an an am shot here let's see and then we've got a side shot too let's see it blow that up a little bit and then here's this side chest shot as well all right you guys stick with the lats look at his legs on the side yes I shot looks really good but I still say the last like flat in the in the app that I shot will really blow that up and make it a whole new shot form yeah and also this because I looked at a lot of his contest picks on his Instagram biggest knock I would have on him is I got to find a way to get those glutes in at the I think everything else is nice I think he just holds a little bit extra there yeah because everything else is build everywhere else and I know it's not a gluten-handling contest and the trunk's cover up most of it yeah it is a little bit distracting so I think you know it's pushing that it's just a little bit harder or trying something else to to try to get them to come in a little bit more because from the side you know he looks great from the front he looks great it can be the septive when everything else is looking that good you know what I mean like that's maybe that's what I mean yeah it can be not know I mean like it can be deceptive when you're dieting and everything else is looking at that good that you know and then and then I don't know you know it's a trick it's hard to like sometimes you have to even like sacrifice everything else to get them to come in but maybe longer diet and then it's taking a little time filling out you know I don't know I was going to say deceptive in the sense that like because everything is so dialed in and conditioned that the one area that isn't just like a cool dry peel sticks out more the other way like a sore thumb that that's kind of where I was going right I could see that all right what's what do you guys say we jump into some listener questions I know we've got a few floating around here see and if anybody had I think we had I'm gonna run to this one because Alfanzo was so nice to provide us legal counsel in order to keep him from sending us a bill I'm going to bring his question up because he had a he had something I think it was related to the assault bike so while I dig up the other ones you guys can talk about this one he says any thoughts on the assault bike improving ability to do higher rep squats 15 to 20 I've added a salt bike hit intervals just four to five minutes of 10 20 intervals and I think it's actually improving my squat I was already doing other hit with the roar and list with a stationary bike at 180 minutes a week 90 list and 90 hit man that's a lot of cardio how is it assault bike it's like it's like a spin bike but you know like the the ones that broke cells they're a little more comfortable that they're on and they give they can give you more resistance don't they have like the fan got the fan yeah they have the handles they have the salt that's in the salt bike yeah that it's like with the crossfit people use okay because I've seen those shwinn you used to make those in the 80s yeah exactly they're back yeah they're back and they're nice like they have ones with magnetic wheels and stuff they're they're good they're good not is yeah okay so he's asking any thoughts on the assault like ability improving the ability to do higher reps squats 15 to 20 reps yeah absolutely I mean think about it you're just increasing your work capacity like like tenfold by adding something like hit in so anything that's intense you know we we call squats like workout I think it's a full body exercise when you're when you're doing 15 to 20 reps and you're grinding out of widow maker absolutely so yeah you just increase your work capacity a hundred percent there mm-hmm yep I can't disagree with that who was it we were talking about that Scott not well it was when I was rehabbing we were talking about the recombin bike and doing hit on that and it's funny because I still now that I and I don't have my knee issues anymore but I'm not convinced that they're not still there but I always start off with my backwards walking and then I do my uh recombin bike and I take the intensity out to the point where I'm literally blowing like I've got a pump in my quads as I not race but I get my shit and get to the hack or get to whatever I'm gonna open with first so that when I start on there I've already got a pump and there's a lot of blood in my knees and my legs nice so over time it'll be interesting to see how hard I can go with that especially now that I'm gonna be more of a surplus where before I was in you know this deficit that was massive and even then I was getting stronger but I could tell that my capacity my lung capacity wasn't as I don't know just what it's from not training legs for so long I could have really struggled with that so it'll be interesting to see how that comes back but I'm gonna use that it's similar it's not an assault bike but it's a similar process just to see if that's gonna that's gonna help it all with oxygen uptake because let me come on when you usually well maybe it's just me but a lot of people fail because of long their lungs before they do their legs and I know that's the position I'm in right now so until I'm able to get back and start really bearing leg sessions it's gonna be my lungs for a while as I build them up before it's my my legs it actually failed. Do you guys remember or have you heard jump here of folks talk about his crazy leg training he would get on the bike for like five minutes and just ride ride ride ride ride ride or however long I can't remember but it was a short duration and then he just run over to the squat bar and he'd do a set like that it VJ was doing that for a while and that would be back and forth yeah yeah like he would get on the bike I didn't know that yeah he'd go go go go go go and then he'd go get on and go do squats right after that it was kind of made a comeback a couple years ago the the biking like high intensity sets into for quad growth I don't remember exactly who maybe Matt Jansson put it out like 10 or 12 years ago or something like that when he was kind of first you know newer in the sport and I know it was a lot of other guys kind of started doing that I don't think they were going back and forth from like squat rack to to to leg extensions squat rack to to to become a bike or whatever but but there was something about like some cyclist training and some muscle hypertrophy that they were getting and so people were trying to like incorporate that as like an exercise like four sets of like 45 seconds to start off there they're they're quad training routine or something like that okay Andrew no I'm going to increase um Andrew added sled pole and push would be great for squat strength he says this is coming from a competitive power lifter that's interesting that that is brutal too man when you start like digging down you have to get low you know what I mean when you get real low and you push with your legs those sleds can be a lot of fun the pushing I always found to be really really calf heavy I could see that yeah so I didn't come back to it until when I had knee problems and I started pulling and that was one of the first things that I did and was able to do because there was a relatively limited range of motion or you could limit the range of motion I guess it's a better way to put it and that helped me to get my first couple minimal pumps when I was still having a lot of knee pain and recovering from that right on all right let's see what else we have here so I'm going to grab these from YouTube and I know we have some at Facebook I think I have some from Patreon as well he says um question for the next show regarding blood sugar regulation so my morning blood sugar seems to run in the mid to high 90s which is higher than I'd like I test first thing in the morning usually after a glass of water and the time between my last meal and when I test is around nine hours what's interesting to me is that my post perennial blood sugar is always in the high 70s and mid 80s one to two hours after meal so my question is should I be concerned with the slightly higher fasted blood glucose if my post perennial blood glucose is good I am just experiencing the dawn phenomena I know you probably need more contact contact and a better look at my diet to truly answer this but my diet is good carbs are around 400 grams and 60% of them are pre-intra and post workout not training days carbs are 275 thanks guys love the show and appreciate all you do so my answer is maybe maybe because I mean well on the positive side he said is post perennial and post-absorbed of glucose is you know right where you want it to be yeah and what that really means is your body is ready to accept the next meal right blood glucose levels down that 70 to 80 range your cells are now receptive again to the effects of insulin carbs you know and one thing which I probably talked about because I you know we always talk about blood sugar and everything never talk about why 90 milligrams for decilitors and good number okay and it's because that's what the brain requires of constantly to react optimally okay so everything is controlled by the brain that's why you know when people are like well what does it matter if I'm 99 or 100 versus 90 like why's it got to be 90 you know so I always try to point that out to people but now so on the positive end his post-perennial and his post-absorbed of metabolism is good but he's still waking up high I'm not so keen on this seriously saying it's the dawn phenomenon and I used to I used to be like oh it's just dawn phenomenon but it could be that his body is stuck in some sort of fight-rflight response meaning cortisol levels are too high now now now I'll be honest if we if we did see that in the morning we would probably see similar patterns of that throughout the day as well but basically when you're stuck in fight-rflight you're pushing out cortisol cortisol causes a lever to dump glucose your blood sugars taste higher more than it should and there's an easy way to test for that you would there's a company called CRT which does a diurnal cortisol test where you spit in a tube you can either do it once or you can do the four times throughout the day I like people do the four times throughout the day so I can see what's going on with their cortisol throughout the day you know it should be higher in the morning and then drop throughout the day and be lowest you know somewhere around midnight and and you know you you don't necessarily have to be high all the time you can be high at couple different points you could be high at all your points or you could be normal you know or you could even be low you know but I do think that is just one thing to take into consideration here but beyond that I would say are you progressing are you looking good or do you feel like you're getting a good response or you getting good pumps in the gym if that's the case and I wouldn't really worry too much about it totally missed the whole damn thing I just had to look at my mic to make sure it was on because I would hate to be like all animated me can't hear me anyway the one thing because I didn't even catch the whole question one thing I will say is this and I I wonder I would assume you guys back up in this but hell who knows you can run higher you know with blood sugar levels and everything else and still make crazy fucking gains and you can still get crazy lean it's just not optimal and I mean I've seen some pretty bad situations where I've literally looked and gone damn like how maybe this maybe these numbers aren't even right like how can they be progressing I think we know the guy you're talking about one guy in particular you're telling us about it was like using growth and peptides particularly was having like really difficult time could this guy he's not he was he was he was real high that's true but that's not the only reason I say that I mean okay people who are just running and they're so were you know they're they're just I don't want to say obsessive about it because you don't you know you do want your blood sugar levels running optimally and running where they're supposed to but but not like shit man I'm gonna die in 10 minutes I mean this kind of sometimes the like things are not gonna have diabetes tomorrow you know it is something you need to get a hold of but there's time to figure out what's going on it doesn't have to be figured out right now or tomorrow just need to be on it to find these patterns and find and play with things and tweak things and we we'll get it figured out but that's a good example for sure because he ran so high but but I've had other kind not run that high don't get me wrong but other clients weren't running optimally and in a lot of times it doesn't get in the way like you think it would yeah I've seen where people just oh gifted that it does I see that where people like didn't even know they had an issue until they're like hey I decided you know I got a fasted I got a glucose monitor how do I use this I've had people just random people tell me that and like they never knew they had a problem they've been going their whole life and everything's same time you know sometimes it is a problem in question I the first question I was asked people to like do you have any history you know and sometimes they're like oh my mom's a diabetic type one and I was like oh okay well we really want to pay attention to that then you know obviously this might be a different case I wanted to ask you a question and you're about the cortisol thing so if if that was the case would his would it still go down during the day like because his reaction if so he would he could still get those lower levels those low readings okay yeah so you tell it it's a see a four different points throughout the day at regular intervals yeah and there's the gut there's the baseline and a range so when you get those sheet I'm trying to show you yeah where am I so like it's not just like it's not just like one line right it's like it's like a what do you call it like a shaded area yeah where anything in between those lines are it's considered normal so yeah you could absolutely be high you know at 2 a.m and then you know back in range throughout the rest of the day that kind of thing how we expensive is that's what 120 bucks I think okay no it's not something that I'm like hey every new client need to get this stuff yeah you know I'd be curious is all that's I was just kind of interested myself yeah and it actually be interesting to do like say in the summertime versus the winter time especially where in the northeast and or you know where you live where it's dark out in what's earlier and spaced darker out because that plays the role in it as well so coming there's tons of factors but I was gonna ask you in terms of the you guys the blood sugar you guys ask for blood sugar every check in or is it more like you see how things are going let's say you got a long-term client and you just start to get this kind of little spidey sense like hey let's take a blood sugar reading tomorrow or next time you check in because something just starting to add up that like I think we need to pull back a little bit or you just literally every week like I want blood sugar every single check in I ask for it now if I think something's out which is odd be kept not odd but I used to have blood sugar temperature tons of that stuff early on years ago and I think I just cut to the point where the things that didn't I don't know how I'll say this but the things that didn't usually like it ended up being worthless information the large majority of the time that I just phased it out honestly really without even meaning to it's not like I went one day I don't need this anymore it was just it got phased out over time but there are times where it is like you say almost like a spidey sense like oh something's not right what's up let's get a few other things yeah yeah yeah I've done the same thing it's not something I require every time that said I do have clients that like to keep their eye on it and they do send it literally every time but it is a good point because I have the same thing I do have lot of clients who do it without me asking them to do it and I will try to get it at certain points like say like we're getting ready to start a push you know that's like a great time to be like okay let's see where you're at we'll get a big slice here what kind of push that's sorry we're gonna start in I don't like using the word bulk anymore you know yeah mean you so they are gonna start in somewhere is push we're gonna start an upward push about that I'll use the word bulk with like my clients that are like 18 to 23 yeah because I feel like you need to have least one good solid perm a bulk error in your training career so you know what it is what it feels like to really slam food yeah and I do think there's a lot we said about putting on good size I don't think you can do it continuously I think we all agree that just put on on need a body fat is worthless but I do think that in your early formative years that for lack of better terms perm a bulk of like a you know 12 to 16 months of just being big and as large as you can eating as much as you can I do think that kind of sets the at least teaches you how to be a body builder I will say that sure you know the problem or the obstacle with doing that is the large percentage very very large majority of people even when they're young they want to be lean they want to stay lean this is about 15 years ago yeah there's like I'll fucking go big I know even myself like I was cool I look back at pictures I'm like I could not tolerate myself with a face like that now like what a mock so it's just a completely different approach than it was years ago hey we got a check-in question check this out you see Suma Klein of mine he says question for the next episode check-in pictures should they be taken immediately upon waking should you pose run one round first any fluids he's asking because I'm so diligent and I crack the whip and I'm like you're not allowed to do anything take those goddamn pictures the minute you wake up you son of a bitch oh not going to the bathroom no I'm kidding yeah no you guys I just don't want to wake up you wait picks yeah I don't what I said I just say first thing you know whatever first thing means without without eating you know I think it's kind of open if if your some of it always gets up in the first and you want to do is have a glass of water first thing in the morning I'm not going to be like don't drink that glass of water it's cold morning your dry knees or whatever you know if that's just a routine and you do it every time then fine just you want to recreate the scenario the same every time have you ever had guys or girls if you ever had clients that it for them it's just not going to be doable like first thing in the morning where they're like you know what I just I can't do them first thing in the morning I wake up at 238 and I literally have to get out my door and blah blah blah I can shoot them you know after work when I get to the gym you know something like that what do you guys think about a situation like that I'd much rather have them because they're they're just it's a it's a much better assessment if there aren't other variables in there you know I'll get the the client every now and then who can't well buy and large I mean I can't remember the last time I had somebody that said that they couldn't do them until later now they might not get them that one morning and they're like you know I'm really sorry to them tomorrow morning so I typically because you know I have skip loading so I would rather take a look at my clients condition when they are the most depleted or the most you know the flatest so if they load on a Sunday then I want them on Friday morning that way they have a day if something comes up and then we can look at them Saturday morning Saturday morning is better but yet at the same time if I have a client who sometimes may not be able to get that done you know you even go Friday to Saturday if you have a wife who gets up with you and takes your picture she may not want to get out of a bad Saturday morning yeah when you've had a response to take pictures and she'll be mad at you so you know there's a good evidence and things like that be like okay I'd link a tripod with a batter or a clicker I'm like buy this one it's $43 you know what everything that's been money on in the sport it isn't worth it to you to spend $43 to not have to wake your wife up and make her mad at you for a while that five in the morning or whatever I encourage people we didn't you had given us your whole explanation on checking in pictures Andrew I didn't even share what I tell people I was like listen if you can't shoot the pictures yourself like use a self timer I have people just use the video feature and then take screen caps which I didn't I'm sure I forgot to mention that somebody did mention that in the comments afterward but I'm a huge fan of be self-sufficient don't rely on anybody else to do your stuff you know your pictures and I'll go as far as to say like hey that's really great that your wife's willing to like take part of your prep and cook your food but I'm off for cooking my own food too as much as I can you know I've seen too many people making a fucking example that's all I was doing what got go easy it was just an example you guys suck I don't know I feel like I've seen people what wife's get resentments when they've been cooking rice for twenty weeks you for real you know I think you're point about doing as much of yourself and not not expecting I guess yeah do any of it for you I think if they if they offer to help or something like that that's great but I mean this is a you're only going on stage by yourself you're not bringing them with you so you know you're the one that can train you they only look into the cardio so you might as well you know cover all aspects of that as well but I would say this about the people that all right so it's kind of a gauge of seriousness to me on if I say fast you know I want fasted picks and someone's like oh well like I've had people say like oh but I got to be at work at eight o'clock in my mind like there's a million fucking cannons going off my head like okay so get up five minutes earlier than you normally would take the damn picks at six o'clock you know but I'll tell you story back in 2017 I was two weeks out from a show and and Nate wanted to go to the New York pro and I already told him I'd go to the New York pro with him that year and I'd go pick him up and it's a six hour drive for us right I got up and I still had 45 minutes cardio and my check-ins with meadows that day it was a Saturday I got up at two o'clock in the morning I drove over to the place where I was doing my checking pictures I drove back home and did my cardio for 45 minutes or whatever it was shower did all my meals got in the car I was on the road by 445 or something like that okay to go pick up Nate to go my point with that is it like when you really want to get something done there's no there's nothing that's gonna shortage of a bomb exploding your house that's gonna stop you from getting to die and so yeah I use it kind of as a gaugest seriousness if people come up with like excuses like oh I've got this or something like that that morning is it okay if I check I'm like you couldn't have waking up we'll kind of seven minutes earlier to go snap those pictures really like that's that's that's what's gonna hold us back here so that's just my take on it I appreciate that for sure man all right I'm see if I can squeeze in then the one more question here um man this is okay this is gonna be potentially not just like a little quick question but we'll see also we had some funny comments Omar said my wife was shooting if I will grow up at 3 a.m. and Steve told me he was so that he trains it he trains it like four in the morning you guys he got his follow him on instagram dude he's like pressed in like 140s for like 10 reps at 430 in the morning he's squatting five plates like like I got to give him major props because that's like way more hardcore than I've ever been I was got an incredible physique too like he looks really good yeah yeah all right so even one of our long time followers part of the patreon he says uh great episode question for the next episode uh what are the best ways to tell if you were over-trained is resting heart rate uh when you first wake up a good indicator that last one's a little tricky it can be but it's not like oh my resident heart rate's up now I'm over trying to take a week off I mean it's not I used to look at it a little bit more black and white than it actually is which is funny because I don't want to go off on a tangent but this brings up other things like HRV and things like that where you know depending on who you talk to those things they're important and it depends you know and another people don't think they're very important honestly I don't know about HRV but I can tell you with the resting heart rate it's not it can be an indicator but it's not a black and white type thing over training I mean I always say the first the most obvious signs for me and I have to go with me because I don't know what even my clients feel when they're over trained um obviously the most the first one is a regression or a very clear and obvious stabilization of progress in the gym from a from a strength standpoint but there's caveat there's caveats to that because you could be dieting you could be in a cut phase you could be you know if you're it's a workout later you know 10 days after an increase in calories you're more depleted things like that but when you don't want to go to the gym for a few days you're probably the large majority of a silver train because we want to go to the gym so there's a lot loss of motivation and appetite is in there too if you're not hungry I mean unless you're just again there's caveat to everything if you're just forcing and choking down food yeah you're probably not going to be the very hungry but if you're just on a regular on your regular diet and you've been hungry and you're putting down the food and then you just within a week or so you're not hungry and you're choking down the same amount of food that's a pretty clear indicator too. I'll those are the ones that come to mind mind what do you guys say. I think the most the easiest one is what you touched on is is it you know are you are you going to the gym to work out or do you want to go to gym to train yeah I think you know are you just doing it because you're obsessive-conflulsive and it's Thursday and I do my back on Thursday or like yeah okay last week I did this and this today I want to try to go and beat that but whatever it is you know I think that's the first thing blood sugar you know we just talked about blood sugar but that can be an indicator if you're stuck in fight or flight and you need a D-load are you regressing in the gym like not just on one exercise are you regressing multiple days in a row in terms of I could do seven plates on a hack square so hacks go out for ten last week and this week I could barely get let's you yeah I only get six plates lat you know for for eight and my body was just spent and then the next day I tried to train chest and instead of the 130 pound dumbbells man the 115s felt like they were the heaviest things I ever picked up are you getting a pump you know when you get to the gym and you actually start training and moving blood around are you muscles feeling like they're in court dinner they just kind of just stay in flat so I think those are probably the three easiest things that you can kind of pick up on yeah I had a great with all that all right guys well listen we got to wrap this thing up we appreciate everybody tuning in for your live viewers we're recording another episode so hang out with us we got uh we got some fun stuff next episode it's gonna be about DHB and a bunch of steroid stuff all the fun stuff uh thank you guys for tuning in as I said thank you everybody who helps to support the programming through Patreon thank you to skip an Andrew for hanging out with us you guys can reach out to them for coaching go to teamskip.com you can go to bodybarry.com you can reach me make naly diets at gmail.com join me any email and check out our sponsors trnutrition.com user code thank for additional savings like I've always said reach out to me if you have any questions about their supplements but any of their flavors uh supplements source.ca for those of you in Canada and go to strong sports nutrition uh if you are in the UK they've got some awesome house supplements over there for another episode of Blood Sweat and Gear with skip hill and you're very I'm Scott McNally and we will see you next time thanks for tuning in

I feel infancy today. I wore the hoodie this morning. Nice. Oh, look at this. Jamie's got one on two. Look at her. It does. I know. I'm, I do not have one on. That's hilarious. The only, the only one that owns the gym and doesn't have one. Well, I, you know, I thought I'd go all mutant is what I was thinking. And then you guys went and wrapped my jam. So that was nice to be a routine players. We're team players. I'm going to go with these two at home because we're going to bother me. OK. Good to have you, Jamie. Thanks for their short notice show up. Yeah, no props. Apologies for the delaying the reply for the text. You know, actually, what happens? So the text pops straight away. You know, sometimes you think if I reply immediately, like, that's just going to look at you on cool. So I'm going to wait. Oh, no. Oh, no. So you went to bed for eight hours, slept eight hours. Got up in the morning and had breakfast. Figured you better get back to me. That was funny. I just, uh, I thought maybe you, you know, I, I thought you were going to say that you know, when you, you get like an invite to something. And you're like, oh, yeah, sure. And then like 20 minutes later, you're like, ah, I told the girlfriend we do this. I forgot. I, you know, you know what I mean? So, you don't want to jump on stuff too soon, because you got to double check your day. You're like, wait a minute. What else am I doing? I just thought might seem like a weird, I flat the, if I could just put a phone down. Oh, it's quit. I'm going to go every while. I'm not. Like you're just, you're just sitting around the house waiting to be invited on podcast. Yeah. So long. Okay. Ready to go Scott? I guess we're recording. We get the whole thing. We're good. Scott, Scott no longer asks if we're ready to go. I'll just hit the button. We're not live or anything. If Dusty says something that's going to get us in trouble, then I just edit that out later. So, so what's the conscious thing we're doing just to see if it works better? We're just going to avoid swearing in the first 10 minutes. That's the, yeah. So, here's what I'm seeing. So, Jamie, there's a bunch of changes to YouTube and there, if there's frequent profanity, and this is funny. So I never pay attention to how much I should probably say this on the, why don't I should, let's say this on the show. Is this the show? Are we doing that show? Yeah, sure. Okay. We'll say we'll say like share. Okay. Subscribe, comment, and bring the bell at that. There we go. It's just bodybuilding. Jamie, the giant Christian on the show. Obviously, hit up IMU.com. We got the triple mutant assault and Scott is now, you know, receiving, you're getting money from mutant. So you're like with the company now. Definitely him and I'm proud to be too. It's a great company. You're on the payroll. We should just, yeah, that's awesome. So yeah. So anyways, code 20% off, dusty 20, big round 20. And Jamie, what's going on? Do you have a code in Europe with the European sites or anything? Have they figured that out yet? Jim told you say this. Jim, Jim said it's, and your team code readiness. No, they said it's okay. But, yeah, does work for kind of the US. So, you say TNG 20? TNG, the Newton joint 20. Just in case you, I don't, you know, take all the customers. Oh, okay. So your code works. Okay, cool. The mutant giant 20, TMG 20. Okay. Go ahead, Scott. Your first step on deck tells about you, you're new rules. Man, so a bunch of channels are just getting slaughtered, totally demonetized. And they're, so 2023 hit and things are sailing smooth. And then all of a sudden, there's a, you know, bunch of speed bumps that we're hitting. In one of them is Volgarity. And so if you, the thing used to be like, if you swore in the first, you know, few seconds that that you couldn't monetize that program. And then now it's a longer period of time. So it's just to be super careful. We want to just watch the Volgarity, but especially like in that first five minutes. But if there's excessive use of Volgarity, and they don't differentiate between words. So like the assword and the affword, they all, it's all the same across the board. And so I, I thought to myself, our, so last week, Wednesday show got demonetized. And then I go to put out the show on Saturday. And I was like, well, I'm going to try to clean up some of the Volgarity. Now, if you remember, we had a segment that was called things that make Ron say, F that guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I swear, this was our episode is like a Tarantino film. Like the affword is every third word. And when Ron gets excited, he's like, and then he takes that eff and microphone. And he walks up to the front of the eff and stage. You just hear that eff and bass kicking up. And everybody just effing gets on their feet. I'm looking at like man. So we literally, I cut that particular word. That's our favorite word. All of us say it. We said it like at least 100 times in an hour. So I'm here crying. Like, why are they do monetizing us? It's top is a personal attack. Yeah. Yeah. So we just did a beautiful, especially in that first five minutes. But if it's excessive throughout like a Tarantino film, then they'll probably pull the plug as well. But yeah. So we should come up with code words. Like, yeah, you know, like they do like when you're when you're giving off a number or digits to somebody, they don't just say like, hey, you know, it's like out for whatever we could be like, like if I want to say Frank that guy, you know, that's Frank. It's the other. You know, so I've got a list here of movies. So we'll be on most frequent use of the F word. Okay. Nice. What are that? These are the list of the top. How long has this list? Top 165 movies. Okay. So I'll just like, I'll just do a guy quick. Just find sort of I'll just scan through and like pick out a few. The wolf of Wall Street, 180. Nice. We beat that. Leazy. Right. Casino, 178. Oh, no. Straight out of Compton, 167. You know, good fellas, 150. You know, like they're they're they're up there. They're pretty, you know, pulp fictions 154. Like these are the ones that are jumping out of the list, right? Yeah. You know, it's it's funny to see Scarface 170. He's up there. God damn. See, you say you do those words. Now you just trouble. Yeah. I'm just looking to see if there's a 200. No 200s. We can go to West Go. We easily do that if we hit like 60 in an hour and we weren't even trying if we actually put some hard into it. Got Ron talking about music. There's no question. I'm so happy that Ron is the one that stood out that makes me feel a little better. I just assume it's a little bit surprised to have to take a look at my vocabulary. It's when you get passionate. It's like, and that's what it is. Like when you get passionate, you won't swear at all. But then like when you really want to express something, then it's like every third word. It'll be like a chain. And then you go back to, you know, just normal conversation. Just right back into like other, just yeah, change it up. Okay. Well, I'll be aware. Oh, you know, they say geniuses use profanity. There you go. You know, they do. It's a great. You know, so so so let's start. Let's start with Jamie. What's going on, Big Man? Tell us about your podcast and why we haven't been invited on it yet. Yeah, rude. It's three days. First of all, I'm going to find this very difficult not to swear because I swear a lot. Well, you're dropping sea bombs like to your wife and stuff over there. And English. The challenge. Yeah, yeah. Just do your best first case. We can edit it in in you a little bit as is acceptable. They say I think. Yeah. I remember the last podcast we did. Actually, I came off on the thought. Did I swear? That's all it's so. We'll tell you it down this time. But my podcast early days we've done six episodes. We haven't had a guest yet. So, you know, we're not there. We are going to be invited guest by shortly. And there's just nothing over this side and the water really that's doing. And I don't know, like, the water's in all podcast. I mean, not just bodybuilding, but life in general. I mean, you guys obviously speak about movies and films and other things. And that's kind of what we want to do. You can't decide in the sense that you don't want to concentrate on bodybuilding. You want the podcast to be about more other things. But I think you just end up going gravitate towards bodybuilding. Because that's you've made an interest, isn't it? So you've always got something to talk about in that regard. What's the plan with gas? You just want to see how the show goes with like the flow. And you guys get used to chatting on the mics and all that. And then you're going to bring on a few easy ones to, you're going to bunch a few out, bring Jordan on, you know, stuff like that all the guys are really well. Yeah. I mean, we've got a few logistical issues to eye on. I think because JVNJ obviously video and film magic magic. He has this vision of how he wants to podcast the look and it's a bit roganesque. And you know, we're not there yet, but you've probably seen that we've got the microphone set up and we're in a studio kind of vibe. So we envision guests coming to us and being in the studio and interviewing an person. I'm not quite sure if I could, you've been to my house wrong. You know, obviously the house is where the house is and then right down at the bottom of the garden is a summer house. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where the podcast studio is. And the internet is wired from the house down to there. Hmm. So one thing we've got to test is the instrument for the internet connection, because obviously if we're doing it like this via zoom or web call, the internet's going to be able to play because if it's not going to work like that anyway. Right, right. Okay. So you're not going to be doing Skype. You're going to be in person. Yeah, that's the plan. That's that's a, so I respect those guys that do those in person shows because that's like, you know, getting people there is now a huge obstacle. So, you know, obviously most of the time, most of the time those guys live in like LA or, you know, like the big ones, you know, easy to get to typically, well, Rogans at the level where people board airplanes to go to see him, but you know, that sort of thing. But yeah, it's, uh, it is would be a lot more work and, you know, you know, having people come to your place and everything, you know, like it's, it's going to be a lot different than just, you know, hitting a little button, hitting a little button, click record. Hey, hello, Jamie, you got to think about this a little bit, though. We've been doing this show for like 2,000 episodes and Ron and I can't be bothered to get here by 130 and we're in our own houses. Yeah, it's going to be real tricky to get people to actually show a lot, especially body builders. I came down the stairs at the moment. I looked at the clock as 130 and I had nothing on the table yet. I was like, all right, so I'm late today, but I still beat Ron, so that's cool. I barely, I was three minutes away and I trust me, Vin Diesel said that. I seen right, right. So I was, I was talking to Jamie and he was telling me that he had a list of things to get off his chest. Uh-oh, his picture is what he said. He said he was excited for the show because he had a lot on his mind. And so do he just let, let the giant tell us what the first thing on his mind is? He looks very excited. He looks very happy that we're doing this. He's prepared. The problem is now you told me I got to do without swimming as well. Well, I'll leave it behind. I just caught myself just now. I mean, this is tough. We're over 10 minutes in. I've got three talking points that have been bothering me of late. Okay. I'm just going to which one is the, the first one from your start on. This is, this is a good one. So seems to have come and theme on social media that we're obviously in their coaching and education culture. But it's completely beyond me. Why anybody would go to somebody? That has no muscle. Brad Vy's regarding building muscle. You know, I'm just feeling like yeah. A lot of people educate you in Instagram at the minute and YouTube haven't got a physique. And if I'm the kind of person that the proof needs to be in the pudding, if I'm going to listen to your advice, are you in agreement? I'm over sure. Yes. And I saw a great post here today. You keep, keep talking about this. I got to find it. We'll go ahead. Yeah. Well, to me, it's like asking a vegan for a bodybuilder's diet. It's not going to happen is it? Right. They may be in a form of bodybuilder, but the base standard model of a vegan. They're not going to be able to tell you how to build muscle through it's techniques that we might have used wisely. So yeah, that's something that's bothering me. Now, I'm not speaking, people are going to run away with this and it's probably about the right time to say certain people are involved. They're obviously some fantastic educations in the industry and there's people that are a great job of doing so. Namely, the high-traffic coach, you know, he's not the biggest guy in a great physique and in saying about knowledge. Georgian cellos are the same. He's got a great physique and a great amount of knowledge. These are not the people I'm trying to talk about. Open, coming people, people that I think trying to make a name for themselves and with coaching I've found that now Instagram is being utilized by good marketers that are marketing themselves on the business system, make money. And I just think it's kind of unfair and I hope more people see through it. Here's a post I saw the other day. This is I got to give credit to on Instagram. He's at him on a coach at him on Machi from Australia. I don't know if you guys are. It doesn't mint his words. I know it doesn't mint his words, but I love sometimes he just, you know, just fucking says it. And he goes, never once, never once seen so many men with so little muscle get traction on social media by praising smarter techniques. There is a time to work smarter when the basics are mastered and perhaps inefficient for high-perchography. Socials really are the wild west stick to your memes partner. I love that. And I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Because I see it all the time. And also, too, I see it on the female side as well. You know, I see people who've just been training a very short period of time on both, you know, men and women competitors. And they're saying stuff that you know that is like fashionable. Like there'll be something come out about blacks. There's been a lot about, lastly, an elbow path. Everything's about the elbow path and like, you know, all this stuff. And you hear them start to use words like, you know, they've been training two years and they're saying distal and up, you know, like they're they're talking like they're using the bio-mechanical type words. And it just sort of like really shows up to me like they're really trying to be seen as an expert. And I think like being seen as an expert is isn't something you get to pick. Yeah. Other people get to pick when you're seen as an expert. That's just how I feel. I got you could try as hard as you want to look like an expert. But I think other people decide when you're seen as an expert. Do you know what I mean? That makes sense. Absolutely. I think it makes sense. The only I don't agree with is I hate the word fair. Because if you're a great marketer and that brings people to you to help with, you know, diet, putting on muscle, whatever it is, good for you. But I think what you're going to run into is that only works if you can prove that you actually know what you're doing. You know, how many clients do you have wrong action in the answer, but that have been with you for years or they leave to stop bodybuilding or take a break and they come right back. And the reason is because they have proof because they got results. I think results ends up being the staying power for everything. I don't do any marketing on social media. I mean, I mean, I've got to even do my own like before and after is for clients. Like if a client tags me, I put it up. That's it. Like that's all my clients. If you tag me in something, I'll put it on my story for whatever reason you want it. It'll be there unless you put shitty form or something. But for the most part, that's it. And I get people that reach out every, I mean, daily with the possibility of training. So I think results start to spread. And if you're just a marketer, you know, like I said, good for you, we, you know, there's the, I don't ever take something away from someone who has a talent. But if you don't have the ability to close from there and give me the results back at all, you did, you got my money once, you know, it really comes down to who do you go back to? It's like, it's like anything, you know? I mean, I got a real estate agent that helped me buy two houses and it was just said, no, anyone here. And I won't use him again. He didn't work at my pace. I'll just go get my license to do it myself because people don't move fast enough for me. You know, that kind of stuff is how I look at those guys. And at the end of the day, if you can get me results, that's fine. But there are certain things that a book will not tell you. I think that's what people miss is you cannot explain to someone who has never been through whether it be just an absolutely brutal set or a prep where you just feel like am I going to survive this day or a prep where nothing's working, you know, how I mean, we've all done every single thing or worked around an injury for 12 weeks during these are things that when a client comes to you and has a problem, I love that my bag of trips is so deep. I'm like the odds that you're going to bring me something I haven't had, almost doesn't exist. Yeah, it's like this and everything like the results are the bottom line. So you get the odd person in everything that is really good really fast. Right. And most of the people coming up, trying to come up as fast as them aren't nearly the quality. And then there's just one person that just like, oh, wow, it's a person coming on a nowhere. I didn't think the new anything. They're getting amazing results. So there's always going to be exceptions like that for those people that like, you know, seem like they're jumping the gun on what they think they know, you know, like, like dusty set results or the bottom line. But the experience is usually the thing that really makes it difference when it comes to how how deep your knowledge base really is, you know, like it's it's like that with everything, you know, you read all the books and you got all the degrees, but you talked to someone who's worked in whatever industry it is, the any industry for 20 years on top of that. And they're going to just, they're going to just run circles around you with how to solve problems. So, you know, I just think that you got to watch how you speak. Like, I'm really careful. I try to be really careful. I know on this show we give a lot of bull advice, but I, I, there's one for you. I first swear already down. Okay. Okay. You know, I don't remember what I was going to say, I messed it up with the beef. You got a lot of BS advice. You're saying, oh, yeah, I got a lot of BS advice or what you see people giving a lot of BS advice. Oh, yeah, I see people giving a lot of advice, but you have to be careful with how, how expert you, you make yourself sound. You don't want to back yourself into a corner. Like, you don't want to pretend you're something and then wind up looking dumb because you can't solve a problem or answer a question or at top it comes up and you can't fall along. You know, like, you don't want to, I, I think I, I try to not ever misrepresent myself or, you know, Dusty and I will often say, oh, that's out of our wheelhouse. Like, that's, you know, that's not my area of expertise. And so that's, then that comes back to how we've all said that is, that, you know, we respected Asido so much because he quite often says, I don't know. Yeah. Right. And that's, that's something that you really have to watch for too. So beware, really beware the Instagram expert that doesn't say, I don't know, you know, like if you throw, if you throw them a bunch of weird problems and, and they never say, I don't know, that's a problem, you know, like, I have a solution for everything. I think, and I was kind of thinking the same thing because I'm thinking of maybe people, it's easier to spot when you've been doing it for a longer time. But I've seen people who will try to market themselves in a way that makes them look like they're super successful and they, you know, they're just getting started and they're like, well, when I work with my clients, what I've done over the years, it's like, wait a minute, you weren't coaching for years, you know, when hours. Yeah. When you make it sound like you've got like, you know, 50 people, 100 people that you're working with right now and you have space for two more. You know, it's like that kind of stuff. And you know, I think it's important, like I would, if somebody, if somebody was just brand new and they're like, hey, listen, I've done one show. And if anybody wants me to help you learn the things that I learned from doing that one show, I'd be happy to, but keep in mind, I have limited amount of knowledge, but I'd love to share it with anybody else who maybe has less knowledge than I do. I could show you some stuff. If I saw somebody brand new out the gate who came with like that real humble attitude, I'd probably be like, good for you, you know, and that's how you can stay open-minded and learn too versus like you're saying around pretend like you know everything, you know. Yeah, yeah, gets awkward for me, like, I don't, like you ever watch somebody else's content and you're like, yeah. I think what's interesting is also that you're, what you, you will have success early on in spite of what you don't know. Like, I've pepped a lot of people for a few years for free because I told them like, I'm not ready. And they were winning and everyone was starting to come to me. And then, you know, three years after that, you look back and you're like, I had no idea what I was doing. Yeah, the calories were way too low and but you knew enough to get it. Like you said, all results, but if you can't catch that also, you're not growing. You know, I mean, like I look back now, even on things that were facts and I say that with, you know, air quotes, you know, like, remember back in the, in the early 2000s, we believe that you needed a way I slip for after you trained because it got in your system really quickly. But then you needed a casing before bed because it digest slowly and you didn't want way before bed or you go catabolic in the night. I mean, there were so many things and now because like, what progeny should I get? I'm like, I would get the eye so surge to taste the best. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so you learn a tongue. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that we let go, but everybody does that. I think every generation has stuff that they're brought up kind of all thinking because maybe there is like, like the, like the thing you just listed dusty, the way casing thing technically, that is true. Like there is a timing difference, but the, but the does it matter? Oh, there's a first F bomb. Oh, you're the first two. See, and notice he was passionate. He was like, getting passionate. He's like, he's passionate. He's passionate. I started to lose it. But, but, but, but maybe with all, you know what I mean? Like the impact of the thing is it actually a thing, you know? So, so that's what you learn with experience is you, you know, there's lots of things and lots of things non-bodybuilding too that I believe for years and then you get older and you're like, heck, doesn't actually matter. That's not a thing that I've ever been worried about. You know, and there's lots of that that comes and goes and experience teaches you that, you know? You know, think of, think of all the things that that, you know, someone who's, you know, think of someone who's played in the NFL for 20 years and then think of someone on their first day in the NFL. Like, they're both professional football players. But, yeah, one person has, like way more in college than the other one. Like, they have, you know what I mean? It's in the guy that's a year younger. It could be the, it could be better. That's a better, you could be a better athlete. It's in there. But him in 20 years will be even wackier, you know? Yeah, experiences huge. And sometimes we don't think about what experience means. But when you think of something like an NFL player, you, because of the physicality of it, it really sort of like, wow, that is a lot. Imagine like 20 years. Well, that's like, but then he job 20 years, 20 years a problem solving. You know, I think people want to learn stuff too. So I think they may be gravitate towards some of the coaches that are like, I'm going to teach you, you know, because since we do a lot of educational stuff on the podcasts, a lot of people who want to work with me, they come to me to like think like, okay, now I'm going to understand how to do this too. And and I tried to explain stuff when I can, but there's an element. Like, I think I remember back to my, my first coach, my first contest prep I hired a coach. I didn't pay anything. He just worked with me. And he didn't tell me how to do anything. He was just like, okay, take the carbs out of this. Okay, at five minutes of cardio there. But you do learn something out of that process. I think it's important to also understand that education isn't somebody telling you. Well, the reason we're taking these carbs out is so that the glycoces and the glucose and that, you know, this, that you just remove the carbs and get leaner. And then you learn something when it after it's over, you know? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's um, the amount you learn just from how you feel. That's, that's what I think bodybuilders are so passionate about when we talk about experiences is I think the more show is you've done and the more perhaps you've done. That's really a huge thing like people who talk about getting ripped and stuff and in contest condition and stuff. But I've never done it. That's, that's definitely one of the areas where I think the most obvious differences from those who've done it than those who haven't. Because there's lots of things that you could learn and teach without ever having really done them, right? A lot of books to do. Good. Learn it. You could teach it. You never really done it. But something like contest prep. That's, that's one of those crazy, sort of things it unless you've done it. It's, it's impossible to even describe, you know? So yeah, you know, the Instagrams. Hey Jamie. What else is this? Hey, this is New Off Jamie? Well, it's kind of interesting as well. And I think we, we, we brush the cross it. And it was a fact that these guys are trying to be complicated. They're trying to, um, complicated. And it's actually very simple. And yes. We know very, it's definitely some coaches that, in effect, the better you become at something, the more easy it should be. And the simpler it should be for you to relay that information and help others. But these guys, these are all these big words and science is kind of like taking over. Um, I just didn't know when bodybuilding got so complex. And the other thing is when did bodybuilding get so perfect in terms of training? And I think you've brushed over this in the past, are you training, and tensing of training, intensity? And I'm seeing more people again, I'm Instagram. With these essentially perfect reps. But there's nothing on the bar. And I used the analogy to be of a day. Um, imagine you've killed somebody. This is, uh, it's going somewhere to be a temporary. Imagine you're doing it again. You're trying to get rid of the body. And you need to tie some weights to the feet. And which way you're going to have to put on the damn body before the weight's going to sink to the bottom of the river. Right. These guys are killing people with fun. They're all floating on top of the river. That's why. All there, all their dead bodies are still floating. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. No progress. They're not getting away. Nothing. They're not falling anyone apart from themselves. I think what you broke down, Jamie, is what you said, which is over time, you can explain it easier and easier. And I'm sure you guys have all heard that old, uh, our dinosaur in quote, which was, if you can't explain something to a six year old, you don't understand that yourself. Yeah. That, that is the deal. I mean, if you really can't break it down in the most simple form, like that's one thing I always admired about Chris. It's Chris speaks very, I mean, it couldn't be much more basic when he talks. And only one time that I, and I can't even really recall what it was, but someone tried to kind of talk above him in a conversation. And I watched him break down, like scientifically, what he was talking about. And I felt embarrassed for the guy because I was like, oh, you didn't know he had that in the bag of tricks. Did you? Frankly, yeah. Okay. Like, yeah. That's awesome. You know, so I mean, that's, that's the thing is, as you get more advanced, it is, it does get more simple. You know, I always remind kids at the gym because I've kind of taken on that like retired old man roll with a lot of these kids. I'll see him like banding everything in directions that don't make sense. And literally they know now, walk over and remember gravity straight up and down. Keep that in mind. Right. And then walk away. You know, I mean, you're just because you see all the stuff, you're good catch, good job. And I'm like, I want to ask, what do you think you're doing right now? If gravity's, no, okay. Right. Right. Right. You know, too, that does tie in with like the, the misleading people thing that I was talking about a little bit too. And I hate to sound so negative about people in the industry or newer people and stuff. But the thing that I'd say irritates me is when you, when you know that they're using words incorrectly and that maybe they aren't, if you use enough big words and you tie them all together and you speak fast enough, you can sound really smart. And you know, like, there's one guy that I know can really pull it off well, who can actually he knows the words and that Scott Stevenson. So when Scott, when Scott's told me on more than one occasion, he was like, that guy, I don't want to mention names, but he said, yeah, that guy is just kind of learned maybe like 20 of the popular buzzwords. And then he just like kind of mixes them up and throws them into sentences wherever he sees fit. And they don't really make a lot of sense. But a lot of people are like, oh my God, that guy is so smart. You know, he knows so much, you know, so it's out there, you know, but yeah, a lot of times we're just like, oh, wow, he knows a lot more than we do, you know. Just word, just word salad. Yeah. Inflammation, Ron, my favorite word. Yeah, did that. Yeah. Yeah. When we did that, when we did that list of what things we could leave in 2022, I actually had a small list of words and inflammation was one of them. Yeah. I would argue this inflammation though because there is inflammation in the Yeah, I know what you were. Yeah. I hear, I hear people saying stuff like, oh yeah, you know, I've just had so much inflammation in my body lately, like I haven't been, you know, this and not, and I'm like, what do you mean? Like your ankles are swollen? And they're like, no, no, I've just got like inflammation. And I'm like, like, what do you mean? Like you've got like, coffee, like, what do you mean? Like he did that. He got that shit. He got that shit. Ron's never going to be able to speak again because of this. Oh, it's really oblivious. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what I'm telling the story is 0, 0, 0 to 3. We should have a little square board on each person here for the show. Okay. Okay. You know what I mean though. I was that word that word got to me because everyone was using it. It was a real buzzword. It was like a real huge buzzword. The inflammation thing people talking about inflammation and talking about all that food causes a lot of inflammation in me. I'm like, what do you mean? Like do your ankles get puffy? Does your gut, like come out to here? And they're like, oh, just I just have issues in inflammation. And I'm just like, but you have to have like, you have a photo of this inflammation. He's going to do it again. He's going to do it again. It's coming. Oh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the on the beginning of photo is almost almost an affin photo. Oh, that's great. You'll take practice. I might be having more fun now that we can't swear. And by the way, I should add guys, it's not just for the monetization, but if we don't, and I forgot to mention this part, if a show is not monetized, then YouTube does not push it out into the algorithm, so that more, yeah, that's where the real issue is. Yeah. It's not like it's not like we're making big money off his ad clicks on on our views. It's it's it's it's it's it hurts the growth of the channel. Yes. We forgot to mention that whether or not you see an ad for a razor at the beginning of this is not important to me. Yeah. The or whatever it is, YouTube decides to show you a sex doll or whatever it is, it you're going to be showing you. I'm just going to present your based on particular. Yeah. Yeah, whatever your click on your ministry. I believe. Yeah, you know, yeah. That's what I'm judging. Okay. Okay. Jamie. Did I get a rep Jamie? I think I interrupted Jamie. Was he talking about something? He's just triggering you every every he's triggering us. That's what's happening here. I love it. I figured that would not be triggered. I will not be triggered. Go ahead. You had you had some to say. Yeah. It's because I've had last time you're going to meet up and Vegas was a bit kind of off-limits in terms of speaking about. I'm certain you turned me up so able to be talking points. I'm going to do it. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. It's not nothing secret about the company, but yeah, go for it. It was because we had you guys coming in last time, remember? So Sean wasn't announced yet. Oh, yes. I don't even know. Maybe you were just barely were. So that's why it was not talked about. That's right. I was just going to say who's getting this to go. I was ready. I'm bringing these edibles that I have from my last competition as three left. This is it. I had the one and I was eight times my mind. Definitely don't bring anything. Don't bring anything into the country, though, technically you can't bring anything in. Yeah. We'll just buy it on the way back from the airport. No problem. Do it every time. We'll get the van shows up. Yeah. I know. I'm not going to mention any names because I'll increment eight people here and I don't want to do that. I'm going to say, I know a classic competitor at the Olympia that went to Vegas with a suitcase full of gear, literally I'm not joking probably quarter of his suitcase full of gear. I mean, need was the the whole up. Not for himself but for a couple of friends as well. Got stuck to customs and got a market gates his name. I was competing in Olympia right away. Got a market gates his name but allowed to pass through. I was just like, oh my god, this guy is not planned ahead and got it ready while he's there. He's took on himself to run the wrists from the goldler and he's got away with it. Have you ever had a herd of anything like before? Not in the US. No, no. He will chop your off. We he must he must have run in two of halfway fan something. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean. He must have he must have yeah, those those guys liked him. That was I could have been a little bit jail. Yeah, I've never heard anyone getting caught with steroids at the US border and not that amount. I've heard of a couple people getting caught with one bottle and they were like just told to go home. No, you're not getting on this plane. Go home. We could have we could have arrested you but you know like that sort of thing but I've never heard of anybody getting let through to go compete. They definitely don't make it even if you made it to the states with a bottle and they caught you and they didn't arrest you. They were usually send you back to Europe. So like I will see ya. Like you don't get to even come into Vegas let alone. Yeah, that's wild. I mean, I guess that would be in New York but so yeah, wow. There's a lucky guy telling him to buy a lottery ticket for sure he will win. It makes your friends in the US. Well, he's at it too. Yeah, I could have quick phone call. That was a long way. That's what I think. So what are you what are you going to talk? So I was going to ask to us to. I believe these kind of actively gain weight. You got an eat like a bodyguard and they'll say yes. I hope it's been horrible. Why do people do this? That's so much food again. I'm not even back to like anywhere near old numbers but man like last night I got to my ready for this fifth meal and I was like stuffed. I'm like I don't even remember it being like you forget because it's obviously just second nature but I also it's been today is one week and I'm up five pounds so it's working but yeah I'm training hard again which I was training hard but like really hard again and it's it's nice. I forgot what it's like for your whole body to feel heavy. You know that not even just sore just heavy. You like get out of bed and you're like moving everything is like yeah it's kind of fun. I feel like I broke you again. It's pretty enjoyable. I ate five meals the other day like I had five solid meals right and I was like holy that's a lot of food I had a lot of food today. Oh there you go. Five and six back to you told you go in the streams with them. Well hey this will be a good test of the system right we don't want to just put out zero effort shows we want to sprinkle and get away with it so we'll see what we can get yeah you're doing a high sprinkle right now like that guy yeah let's salt. I gotta ask Dusty though because I saw that we recorded last week and then at right after we're done recording I'm looking through my phone looking at Instagram and then I saw your post where you're like hey I'm back at him lifting heavy you know I'm eating I'm an eat five times a day like a real body but I was like we didn't even talk about this he didn't even mention it and this post has been out for hours or a day or something what triggered you to decide to do this. Well actually it has nothing to do with the bodybuilding side for me I think what it is there's this misunderstanding amongst the younger generation that the only way you can bodybuild successfully is essentially to be a loser and every other aspect of life. They do I mean it's just a weird thing to me like you know you I'll hear guys on the rig I've had guys say straight to me like why gotta get an easy job so I can get my food in and I'm like well easy job won't pay you well and bodybuilding isn't cheap so once you get a really good job any faster like I just think it's very overcomplicated in people's it's like you guys are saying about the gym it's the same. Okay you go to work for eight hours okay if you time it perfectly that's I mean how to time previously it's two meals but it might be three while you're at work make one of those a shake one of them's your lunch break okay we only have one more left like I don't see why this is so difficult so last week I just practiced because I got all the the video stuff and we're doing it all ourselves I'm purposely kind of keeping it really raw they got a microphone cell phone that's it I got to leave it I was gonna buy a camera and I'm like you know I want to leave it real basic so we ran through it last week just got to get a field do some adding um but I want people to see everything that happens in a day while doing this and the only thing I changed is the food so I'm not like I didn't like shoot the gear up I'm not taking growth or anything like that it's just putting the effort in but it's really more about like look you can do both like I do understand when you're in prep and you're doing an hour and a half two hours of cardio training, tanning, posing yes some things kind of fall by the wayside but these guys that trade their life in for bodybuilding I think for the majority of us could understand that's a bad trade you know because I think that we lose track of how few bodybuilders and it's kind of funny it can's three of them are in this screen right now but are actually making money off a bodybuilding that aren't winning shows and then how few are winning shows and how little that money really is I mean you get ready for a show you win $10,000 what did it cost to do that show without a sponsorship it took you three or four months to get ready for it let's just get wild and say you made $4,000 after all the hotels and flights in Yadiyata for granite four months yeah it's not a great trade you know so I just kind of want people to see that because the things that in rich like and I did this when I was bodybuilding at a higher level my life was more simple I just had me my wife a business it was quick and easy nothing that involved other people really now bodybuilding is more exciting because it's literally like I mean Jamie I'm no you've we've talked about this briefly like if you leave your house to train to do whatever you you mentally know you're taking away time from your family from other things so you need to up that intensity while you're there but you also have to get your home and get back to life you don't have to sacrifice one for the other and I think again that's another thing you can look at with kids is you could show kids you can have goals and be a good dad be a mom you know be a good husband and be a good wife so that's kind of really what I'm hoping that it shows is like I did not have a sudden go back to one dimensional and I don't like I said I mean I was up to 290 already it was 286 something when I started so I guess a little over 4 pounds I'll be at 305 and of course I just say donuts let's say what the meals were I just said there were 5 of them but you know I'm saying it's it's really more that part and the training will be in the videos but just back where I get into like some fun top sets and stuff like that but the hope is just to people see you can do both because I'm really glad that my career set up in a way that bodybuilding didn't cost me my future and I think a lot of people can yeah I sometimes feel like because I was very all in I was very all in there's a lot of things I immediately sacrificed at a young age I just said no not doing that you know what I mean like I I look back and I'm like very fortunate that as all in as I was and as like you know no plan be to steal uh Clarita's line as as no plan be as I was because I was very like like I fully and 100 percent identified as a bodybuilder for the vast majority of my life my all my 20s and 30s I was like what what do you do I'm a bodybuilder like you know it was 100 percent of what I was and but I still had a couple of speed limits in my head drug use limits right I had these speed limits I wasn't willing to go over and then I had these financial speed limits no that's too much I'm not spending that no right not using growth that that real the farm growth is way too expensive not using it no I'm I got I got this to do I got a buy it got a buy place so I just sometimes I just thank my stars that I had at least those two speed limits you know what I mean because I could have you know I had no other speed limits right and for some reason I don't know just the way I was brought up or you know influence from somebody I just think man those were the two speed limits that kept me from being you know the guy that like you know any money left after and nothing to do said there you go you know what I mean like it no but you know I love that you said that though because the speed limits is a great example um they saved my I'm saying I think they saved me like I could have I would have just like 1000 percent another time since then their time staff's got I'm just counting them but yeah no I think that when you when you see it in hindsight I think that's the big thing that I'm realizing Scott is like again when you have the the near death thing you just look at stuff a little different and I'm like I wonder if I could have been even better then because that's what I'm learning now is like when I got back into training and things like I wasn't trying to go out in the same way but I really enjoyed it and a lot of change I started taking place just because I was enjoying it more than I was just like I did to be here again and I'm not forgetting about muscle memory and all that that would give me wrong but there is something to be said of just kind of being mindful like you were saying run like you were being mindful of a couple things like you do not want to get down the road and and when your big show and get done and go to your hotel room by yourself because you've alienated your family you've lost your girlfriend and all these things because that great achievement will not be a great day without those other things you know I mean and I think that it's it's very similar I mean you find out quickly who's around you and who you impacted I mean now I'm on a rampage a little here but you know when I came back from my coma you started to realize how many people you didn't even realize you were impacting by living your life you don't want that number to be zero you know where they're like oh I don't even know that I want to drive down the street to watch dust to compete because he's kind of a ass you know so that's all I'm hoping that that'll come through if not it'll be some fun for me and I'm enjoying just doing it's harder again now like I said you get you got to practice you lose your skills on certain things like just eating because it's time to eat you know it's not silly but after years like I got I look at the clock and I'm like no okay two weeks metabolism will be moving fast yeah won't be bad you're yourself you know you'd be good yeah you're already you know you're already doing a bent rose like you you're still bent rowing for a playtime you yeah I just wanted to try and see how it went it was good I got 12 so wasn't bad yeah like just crazy like I would have you the only time I ever you know could bent row four plates was when I was doing everything right like just like everything right you know plus anodrol you know that's like that's like that's like I just see how it feels in my hands as it you know just getting some meals in yeah in fairness I had had four days of heavy meals before that left yeah but it is fair to be said I think Jamie will agree with me here like Jamie and I you know as far as Jen Popko we're both big strong guys relative to the average person but then there's Dosty who does it you know it's super human stuff on TRT yeah mine it's American TRT if that matters so no it's it's good Scott what do you what do you think though you think if that's something that people will catch or I'm hopeful because it's going to be the whole purpose yeah I think it'd be interesting to hear you know it'd be interesting to see and I think it's exciting too because I feel like every time and this is just watching everybody that I podcast with when people get plugged into training they get more passionate and excited about that they get more excited about bodybuilding and it comes through you know and I think that that then translates to to the people that follow you and follow the shows and stuff I don't know I know that like whenever I've competed that the amount of interactions that you then have with people goes up and other people get excited and motivated and I think it'll only end up good it'll only be to the world's benefit as long as you you know stay healthy don't hurt yourself and and you keep having fun with it you know and don't see the effort on my YouTube which had the very first video I did because it was after we talked Scott yeah we did a cooking with dusty yeah and I cleaned it too far and I was like I don't care if money it might as I'm bombing a hell out of them this isn't funny I don't care I have to tell you guys something so for people who have never met Jamie and person I don't remember if that was the first time we met in person Jamie at the Olympia just a few weeks ago now was that the first time we met in person that you can remember I feel like we've met okay I felt like we met before but I guess that's just because I've no one of you and no one you for such a long time I I go all the way back to here and you on the size game by the way you might not have known that but dude yeah three chairs for the size game people don't don't realize just how absolutely huge you are not just because you're jackdooed but because if you're height and everything like I could you can't miss Jamie at like a huge crowd of jacked bodybuilders and then you're like oh there's Jamie there's the biggest guy right there yeah it might not translate completely on the screen you know what I'm saying but I just wanted to share that for all the viewers at home you were watching this new home Jamie before I think easily without question Jamie you have the craziest frame I have ever seen on a pro bodybuilder that says a lot too yeah there's nobody with more there's nobody that height with with with more x frame than than you you're you're that there's been some guys you're height obviously but they didn't have the shoulder width the taper the quads then like the the structure and stuff you have the craziest frame I've ever seen it's there's never been a frame bigger than yours in pro bodybuilding ever and when you see it in person like I'm used to you now that's all hilarious it is I'm like used to you like oh yeah it's Jamie and then I see photos of us and I'm like Jesus there's another one no does Jesus count do I probably not not to me because I love Jesus if it helps oh wow I'm really like comment okay so yeah but are you aware of that Jamie like do you do you feel bigger than everybody or is it just normal do you like do you I mean you look down on everyone you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the way anytime I know this is when I have to look up if this is weird this is not the normal so whoever you looked up to like Brian Shaw Vymebrane Shaw not mebride in person but there was this guy at the expert actually brought me some some strawberry flavor rush crispy square balls yeah those were in the back I saw those in the back I might have one of those did make it all of what I asked him how tall he was he says I'm six foot six you know the same as Josh and I think I was just like a back end of the way it's saying Josh just told that me as well so yeah that's a little bit but no thank you very much and you know as well as I do as bodybuilders you're always critical of yourself I mean I went to the Olympian that I wasn't my best because I've come off with back of a competitive season and you get that slope post contest and I've obviously gone through the speeds of going into TOT and not know if I was going to compete again so I would say myself as team as physical nature as low what had a great time there and a car made to get to Canada to train with you guys and I'm actually more worried about Andrea the only female that's good at it but it's not really worked she's definitely better than all of us she's a mental lunatic and I loved I didn't know that until the episode and I was like how can you be so nice and politely slit throats the way you do it's impressive yeah you're you're gonna love in in the gym Jamie because it's well let's tell you let's let's tell everybody what's actually going on because a lot of people from the gym listen to the podcast so let's tell everybody what's going on we haven't we've sort of mentioned it to dozen times now what's going on you just so therefore but go ahead yes so I think my bike flights generally the 29th and there me obviously does see you're already going to be there run obviously Andrea we're going to do Westco's eye into films from content for music and I think we're there until the Friday if like back on Friday so it's like a week's worth of content that really isn't it yeah we're gonna have a lot of fun I know we were gonna bring Clarita but he he's sort of decided to do something do you want to talk about that yeah I'm interested to see you guys think that the Lionel Poe of Role is always very light yeah what's it eight guys seven I was just trying to see where who who has that I just want to look at the screen right oh yeah there we go there we go Charles is pretty dropped out so that's right who who is going to go Charles Griffin's drops out yep all right okay so I mean looking at this I know it's a small list but to see Clarita's name in there with these guys is it's funny because you know he could win could he win this hmm is that possible let me wild I think the comparison between Samsung and Clarita is it's like a little and not met a lot of generally not disrespect for the boy's like a mini version they're quite similar in terms of the radical it's gonna be amazing seeing this is gonna be amazing I want to see Clarita next to Bonac I want to see Clarita next to a keen like you know like and then obviously come all like it's it's it's going to be awesome we're really excited what you know to see to see this move I mean this is an aggressive move by Sean you know he's he's he's stepping in there I don't know to me it just says I'm not afraid to anybody like I'm I'm not afraid of his single one of you I just think it's awesome I love it yeah you know this is a great show I mean the quality I mean you know obviously low numbers but every single one of these guys is awesome so it's gonna be good and I mean Williams one two already has any yes yes I'm saying yes I think Bonac I think Bonac is too Arnold I don't know Scott could check that but yeah I'll look it up I know he won at least one I was there for I think it was a thousand in yeah he was a coin he was a coin flip last year I think that might be the one that we're thinking I think you only won one because I remember I thought he was gonna win the Arnold last year oh he might have won like another one of the other Arnold's maybe I'm thinking he might have won one of those I can be it oh yeah you know I don't know I don't know but says sometimes that throws you off you know I love seeing Samson do this show incredible I just think it's a great like something a lot of people in his shoes would wait and you know what I mean and like he's getting right into it I mean he's he knows where he stands and on this list I mean I would have to assume he's the favorite going in yeah he'd have to be the the highest ranking open guy would have to be the favorite but can you imagine what a hey last call out you know final call out Samson and Sean I can hear it oh man yeah two guys get like you know Samson who stood next to Rami and looked the same size and then next next to Clare like that's I hope I hope that's the last call out that would just be crazy there you go time to see I'm keeping it I'm keeping it so we can test the waters right just a little dash I'm a little surprised to see Justin Rodriguez do this show and the reason I say that is is I feel like his body's tired like he is phenomenal to me but I'm not seeing a lot of change and if the goal in my opinion bodybuilding is always to get drastically better so I really thought that he would do what Charles Griffin is doing and being in my ping smart step and back take a little more time and then coming back drastically improved I would love for him to prove me wrong but based on the what he's brought in and the the Margaran of coaches he's had I just don't know that the coaching is the problem as much as a body who needs a break you know I mean I don't think people realize the stress I don't think I'm about to gear just getting ready for a show and Justin's known to get big really really quick so his perhaps are full perhaps every time this time maybe a little last to just wasn't much of a window to get heavy but I'll be curious to see how that shakes out I say I hope I'm proving wrong and he's right up you know in that mix but I mean I don't know how him shows he last ever had to be like seven or eight I mean I felt like every show I turned out he was in and the reason I think he should not is because he should be winning these shows he's that good in my right to right to to is one to he's one to yeah 18 and 20 yeah the um well man it's dangerous when you got a two-time champ in the lineup too you know bonnet could win this Samson could win this clear reader could win this obviously the other guys aren't favorites to beat those three guys just based off the previous placings at the Olympian Arnold right yeah but you know those those three guys have you know the I'd say the the ability to do this I would I would say Samson's a favorite because he's the highest placing guy this year in the open but and he's made the fastest changes in the last year so I wouldn't put it past him to beat his Olympia look another thing I knew it later think of the think of the mental place that Samson's in right now it would be like full speed ahead absolute reward and confirmation of everything he's been doing he's got no questions in his mind whether he's doing the right thing obviously he'd be happy with his coaching and his circle of people and his sponsors and just everything in his world is click click click right now after coming off that Olympia I would think obviously so so you just think that that makes the guy even more dangerous you know you get on a roll like that or everyone behind you still don't imagine you have all the momentum and all the mental drive you want but to be able to be your absolute best at the Olympia and for a lot of these guys now they're going to be their absolute best again and two months later that's going to be interesting to see what happens you know it's it's you know I mean I did 24 shows but most of the time it was one show a year you know and you know and then obviously looking back in hindsight now on bodybuilding and everything that goes into it I see the guys that do the Arnold and the Olympia the Arnold and the Olympia like like Brandon Curry guys it do that a lot and I just think man you guys are like you guys are super dedicated super dedicated like yeah I just imagine like how tired after doing that a couple times you know you must have the their little system you know like you know Brandon's got all his family time maybe he just shuts down a lot recovers hard you know you know it gets back into it that sort of thing but it just seems like no break to me you know yeah it seems like no break you be doing this thing it um that a keen Williams can possibly win any show he ever does I always when I see his name I'm like that could be your winner just because if he hits he's so crazy I remember his what he needs you know yeah I remember seeing a came when the Tampa I was at that show and I just remember his conditioning there was fantastic I think that was like 2017 or something but his his conditioning was fantastic his glutes were pretty striated and it was just a crushing win like he easily won it was a tough lineup like it was a lot of good guys you know the Tampa was a good show and he smoked it and how high has he been at the yo he's been like was it any six one year I thought it was six that just exactly what I was thinking so it might be right it you know so we know what he's capable of but I just feel like the condition from the back just is never quite as you know just where it needs to be it needs to be like that sick like you know when you turn around and you see the glutes on you know the guys that are shredded shredded and you just say man if a came had that his mask would look even more ridiculous and crazy so I always feel like he's just kind of off from the back that's what always kind of hurts him for me and and but yeah I mean like he's very very dangerous at any show he does and you know I mean he he was where he was at the Olympia in with nine more weeks you know maybe he figured like hey I'm gonna die it for 16 weeks into the Olympia maybe he needed nine more you know and I'm saying yeah who knows what like yeah he could be like the most improved you know yeah I mean I would guess I'm waiting to see the I'm waiting to see the best ever of the team because that's I mean he's one of my favorite bodybuilders like I've trained with them I I he's an amazing bodybuilder and you know I was want him to be at his best so he can place his highest possible you know so yeah I mean let's see how they just go I always want to see you know it's always been fun in our years of watching bodybuilders when individuals do their like they're coming out show where they just blow your mind I mean like oh one cutler when you weren't ready for it you know goon to come out at the Olympia that you're going to check fifth and you're just like how he even qualified like you don't even remember how he got into that show and it's nuts I would love to see that from him at least once because he's been great don't get me wrong but that like yeah you said next level sort of best I ever like he would smash some great bodybuilders if he just nailed it perfectly so I'm hopeful because I'd love to see him in that top three mix too just because like you say it's with my favorite just cool guy plus I think he's a strongest bodybuilder on the planet I mean casually yeah yeah like nothing yeah yeah casually crazy yeah what do you think Jamie did you have anything else on your list we like Jamie's list yeah I like you too uh I'm a bit of a talking point maybe see what you see about this it was actually off through our top cast and I'm thinking I'm going on the show and those they're disgusting so this isn't to a rob somebody else's idea but you you spoke on your podcast about the point system being educated and I feel it's the Olympia's idea to eradicate the point system was to try and get less people at the Olympia that's the only riding goal here which obviously that's not going to achieve that and so how can we get the best bodybuilders the Olympia limit the amount of compare is there so the Olympia committee are happy and everything else and the fans have the best bodybuilders there as well well the ideas from the podcast Ian and Philard was it's twisted but they kind of like really brushed over and I thought that's an amazing idea is take any other professional sport so you've got NFL NHL soccer you've all got professional leagues like a championship league table so imagine each division there was a league table for the athletes top 20 in the world and to get onto this table to qualify for Olympia all 20 people qualify so it would be go away from the qualification system that's what the idea is now I'm talking about it being like an entire qualification system completely people compete throughout the year but they were saying well then it's going to encourage more people to show so it might be deemed as unhealthy but you have like a season so six months of the year is the bodybuilding season and people compete at these shows maybe every weekend to get points in the table to compete at the Olympia at the end of the year I just think that would be like bring bodybuilding more mainstream and make it there would be avenues to make that super exciting as well so you would say only a point system it like let like just kind of plan with the idea of no like it's all point based or do you get in if you win a show no you get in if you're not top 20 in that point system by the end of the year and obviously the chosen going to be tiered so the more points for higher place enough leeks in higher tiered shows so that better athletes wouldn't need to essentially do more shows they could still right they could just set the points up that way yeah yeah but one of the complaints I'm hearing a lot is the better athletes are saving it to the Olympia they're not seeing them on stage at these local shows so this system would encourage the better athletes to get their arts on stage as well I think it would work if like the NHL the NFL and all of them there was a team paying to put them everywhere because that's where where things get lost is you know these guys are flying places these guys are missing work you know because that's where the wheels fall off and these things is who funds it all because it can't be the athlete it's a great like I was just saying earlier you there's just not enough money to make it worth it I love the idea for the show but the IFBB would have to fund it for it to work right you know we I really like I really like the idea of like when we were talking about the bracketing kind of idea like the I don't know I just thought that was cool like if if you beat somebody at a show how I was that bracket where remember we're talking about that brackets got yeah we're talking about like you know just bracketing you know a bunch of people start out and then whoever wins these shows they continue to bracket in and somehow end up with a smaller list which by the way Victoria listened to that and she was like that is not what I was saying at all I was like yeah we just kind of ran with it you're completely misrepresented by idea yep you never say my name and what I said you don't listen to yeah the the the thing about trying to get fewer competitors in the men's open and in the like they're well they're talking about all the categories right just fewer competitors I mean the the so they're just taking away the point system how many guys were even in on points there's like two because Cucleo quite a lot of points didn't go I think Justin and so yeah that's the thing I'm saying like it's not even really going to make much of a difference they're trying to get rid of like what they want to get rid of like 10 guys but only a handful of them around points anyways so it's that's going to be more shows that she had come in oh and I'm and obviously I remember this time it's a top five requalified for the Olympia right yes you just can talk 10 I remember the days when it was a top 10 at the oh get to requalify you know there was a lot fewer shows too but I mean what if they just go back to just the winner just the winner winner requalifies like all the winners qualify for the whole year no one else everyone has to win a show you know that would knock you'd have Nick Walker showing up at a show you'd have Derek showing up at a show just think of that it would drive those four guys in the top five to these other shows which would then cut down on the number of guys come you know what they would obviously probably win their shows most likely yeah so there's five less guys at the show now like maybe that's one of the things that they got to do it just taking away the points doesn't seem like it's gonna make enough of a difference if that's their goal we kind of talk too about like what if they were teared shows but if what if say like something like this say that you say if you do like the Detroit showdown you have to win two smaller shows like that in order to win in order to get it right but if you won the will take like say we had five shows that would be on the caliber of like the Arnold in the New York pro and then we added in a few more there that those would be you only had to win that one kind of thing right you got something like that yeah yeah there's a lot of ideas but you know they want less bodies on stage I also think have to problem is they have to rework how they run the show because that whole you know the whole like show taking the whole the show taking forever uh complaint I think they sort of said oh it's because we had too many athletes but no there was other things you could have done too you know there were some categories that were like wasn't there 58 guys in classic how that held the dot happen crazy you know like 60 of them it was crazy is there's that many shows like there's 50 some shows a year now in classic like what am I missing? do we know that? think because of the time since obviously the left who is in December and then the qualifying system run extra long because of that oh yeah that makes those but that is the issue isn't it um I see men's physique bikini it's the three other categories that cause an issue in in essence because who's the one that's the third you guys in the event you've the best time I'm fine with how how many were there 30? but yeah yeah I'm fine with that I mean 20's 20's a little bit more sensible but yeah I get the point yeah you know they didn't need to be 58 classic guys well we'd think about something for them let's uh maybe you could just start 30 35 and if any then other both 30 just hang them on something you're shaking. based on infections on the physique maybe one's got four toes hang in good. yes yes just eliminate them just every everyone has to send in um their mandatory poses and get compared to bomb stand if they can't stand next to me doesn't come. nope you're not in sorry you won three shows but you can't stand I said never mind I also think I just think yeah you know like the 58 guys in classic this year you think okay so like you know literally what 45 of them must have known they had no hope oh anyways like that's expensive they all have sponsors paying for everything like that's a lot of guys you think like Steve Ku Klow didn't go to the oh cause he's like a f*** you know not my and then these other guys like all showed up that seems a little crazy to me. I think I don't think that everyone takes the full business stance you know because for example and don't worry nobody I don't I don't think it's what happened but if Ron or I slipped and fell in qualified for the Olympia we'd go that's true I'm going like give me my jacket give me last place I'm out of here nice jacket so if I go just to get the jacket I would go if I was a pro just to get the jacket you're so right those are the coolest jackets I would wear every day you would be on every episode of the podcast the be it I'm just done I'd have little ones made for Harvey and Donna my dad took last at the Olympia um and we don't even know how he qualified he was to say Olympia qualified that's the no last. Yeah they're gonna live he guess I might it's like that's not looking at it I'm not looking at the Instagram bio perks I guess yeah exactly got my bio I would actually write last place because I'd still but I was there B yeah good stuff yeah I don't know I do think that they really just need to only my biggest complaint that would save everything for me is put the men and women on separate days you know and and really call that a day because I think if you can quickly cut people in pre judging I mean quickly quarter turns you know who's not the top 15 bye and then get rolling and then as an athlete I think you're gonna be a little more reasonable with yourself too like if you know there's 58 guys and you're not anywhere near that top 15 maybe you're not coming to decor terms of frontier family. That's probably at the end of the day does the I think that's probably the best and easiest solution is for the show the way the show's structured to just be a bit more brutal. You just have to say I mean you know that whole you know at the regional level everybody gets to pose because you want them to all get their stage time and their experience right and obviously as you move up the ranks things get a little bit more app sorry no posing your team at you know you're not top five don't get to pose you know that sort of thing but I have no qualms with that level the Olympia being savage like absolutely savage like I went to pre judging and ten minutes later I'm done you know I don't really have a problem with that because maybe that's all they need to do maybe if they just do that then they don't have to screw with the system or change the points or any of that stuff it just sort of does it for them because those huge categories with all those people that will be where you'll see the the reduction the reduction will be harsh like one year later it will be half as many you know 40 43 people would be cut in the quarter terms yeah first I don't see them again quick and I think the X I do think that you can do that at that point and now you've got to show to watch yeah yeah and now everybody can spend the rest of the night at the night show when they go to the big venue at the arena everybody can spend the whole night looking at the top 15 you know you get a good look at them you know so that would be maybe an idea is to an idea too you know what do you think of that Jamie just being savage at the judging table oh yeah because I do believe I'm in the capital to see seven and I believe this is this character and me also for sure if I was to make it then I would have no ambition of doing anything at the Olympia other than standing on the stage represent my best physique and clap the jack yet see later but the fact that I get there the sense of achievement and just just being there being backstage and so can hardly experience I'm all four as many athletes as possible have been the opportunity to do that and I feel as though the harder it is yeah great for the kind of a family that perhaps aren't compared is because they're only thinking of the end result they're thinking of having the best athletes on stage well imagine putting your life's work your heart and soul and money into something like bodybuilding and having the chance of stepping on stage of the event we are always taking away from you because people have decided to be able to save the money or whatever it is I think as an athlete there's probably only out of circles and on the brink of being able to qualify that is still a huge incentive in your kind of goal system for the year let's say let's say let people get left fantastic be more savage at Olympia fine that's that's got to be expected because it's the book yeah I would say measures at the Olympia perhaps concentrate on those rather than stopping from people actually getting there in the first place I like that I like that too qualified if yeah I know you mean keep the points it drives people blah blah blah but then just make the reality what it is at the oh so I think what people are missing is it didn't get easier to qualify like those guys that all qualified damn yeah you know I mean and that's the part that gets missed it's very similar to you know getting your pro card like on a on a lower tier that alone is like wow now you might never be a good pro ever ever but you you were able to do that I mean when I was chasing a pro card James where you are with trying to get with an Olympia I just wanted to I just wanted to check that box I came to do this did that done I never thought okay now I'm going to go to the Olympia there was no confusion on where the stance was but that was a huge step and you know I can say this and it might be a weird comparison for people but you know the greatest part of turning pro was for me about three weeks after the Olympia guy met me and I said the jam I you know tank top and he's like are you a pro now you know yes I had never got to say that before like that was the that was the big like I was like I got to say yes this is amazing yeah so you know you get to do the Olympia like you said you're not thinking this year when you were shooting for the Olympia you weren't saying and once I get there I'm going to wrecavic and top five you know we weren't lost on the where that was going but you were going to qualify then hopefully bring you are very best look to the Olympia and see what that is that's always killer when somebody does that you know I noticed the odd guy shows up just in crazy shape he knows he's not going to place but like he comes in like great shape because some of the guys in the back of the pack were in great condition this year so yeah so Jamie I I'm going to see in a few weeks eh yeah it'll be great to have you back here dusty it will be great to have you up here it's been a long time I mean I've already had Jamie at the gym lately you know so having my week is fading on the wall I know you got to like re-chains over the new marker yeah because you you signed the wall before we got the the windows tinted so the sun bleest year is off the wall yeah now we'll redo it and it'll be safe now it'll be safe there we go Jamie are you coming into the Arnold as well yes I'm actually this is another talking point but we haven't got time potentially but I think for another episode you could perhaps speak about managing an offseason and in like a busy travel schedule because you were speaking about obviously just this with the youtube thing and join it and showing people that you can do this and make progress with a busy schedule busy life and a good job I look to the time and I was like man we're going to Canada at the end of January I've got um Katie's birthday in Dubai in February and then the beginning of March is the Arnold's and then we've got Feebo yeah I've got a holiday with the kids because they break it from school and it's like what's going to be in June and July and August there's something every month so far so there probably be something every month for the year yeah we're booked every month I've shared and I already looked at it we're literally booked every month that's why oh yeah yeah we got something to do almost every month I think there's actually a couple months in the summer when mutant doesn't do anything with me but then there's all these shows that happen out here like the van pro happens here and all that so the gym is like an event in itself because it's you know everyone's coming to town to compete and all that so there's a few of those so there is something every month for me there's basically like some thing that I usually have to travel for you know so it would be great to see a Jamie I'm really looking forward to it I know the members at the gym that know your comment are excited and I mean now everyone will know and uh dusty there's so much you haven't seen up here I know you have to come up and do come back no no just come in and hang out are you guys bringing the wives what's going on I'm not this trip because it's tight tight window if the kids and stuff five days during school weeks or we're not yeah yeah for the Arnold she's coming cool okay okay and you're not bringing the wife are you Jamie you take in her to Dubai for a birthday so she's good that's wrong yeah and I'm thinking that and what is the table resident and oh surah a big solid off season meal I will know it go there day one straight from the airport if you want nice we'll do that okay thanks Jamie thanks for coming on short notice we've been talking about getting you on and then me and Scott and Dusty were chatting we're like well let's let's just get him on right now and yeah you guys are really tall so it was awesome fantastic Jamie the giant tell everybody where your podcast is so they could check it out yes first of all always a place beyond podcast thanks very much guys I did appreciate it and sorry about the small delay I hope that doesn't

And of course, evalbloodanalysis.com. You can get your lab work done by Dave, which will also help him work to get his pro charger. Dave wants a pro charger. He wants a free pro charger from you guys. He wants you to send money for a pro charger. But I think that a more valuable lesson would be to teach him the value of a dollar by getting your labs done at evalbloodanalysis.com and making him actually work for it. Today we are joined once again by researcher Tim P. at Kawasaki. Thank you for your patience, Tim, with my long intro there. We had Tim on talking all about trunetrition. Quite a while ago now. That episode still up if you guys want to check it out. Tim's from Australia. He's been doing some incredible research, literally about antibiotics steroids for the past several years. We're going to talk today about some of the latest research that you've been doing. Literally, you've got some cool boots on the ground stuff. We always wonder what's actually in the vial. You've managed to get the Australian government to actually help pay for research to answer that question, man. So first of all, Tim, thank you for making concessions to join us with all the big time differences between the three of us. Appreciate having you here, man. Thanks, sir. Thanks, Dave. I think you copped at the worst out of us. Let's see if I'm okay. I'm okay. I'll make it. No, yeah, it's super great to be here, super awesome to talk about this. So where to start? I mean, in 2024 we ran the world's first steroid checking trial out of the state that I live Queensland Australia. So it's been that top right hand corner called the Sunshine State. We ran a steroid checking trial between April and October of 2024 where basically the drug policy and legislation and state change which allowed drug checking to happen. Now, just to give you a bit of history, drug checking is the process of looking at people's drugs and telling them the composition of those drugs and then giving them a bit of a health advice around that. So it's a service that has gone on since I mean, grass roots movements since like the 80s, but first officially founded in the Netherlands. Now happens in over 26 countries all over the world, but no one does steroids because there's a few tricky little bits and pieces to it. Oftentimes you need a really good chemistry team. You need some money, you need community connection and you need, I guess, perseverance is probably the word that I'm going to use for this trial. So it actually started back in 2023 while we were sort of talking, when I was doing that trend research, I also did a bit of research around co-designing what steroid consumers would want out of a drug checking service, what they needed, how they saw that operating and sort of captured that equitable health delivery. Anyway, come to 2024, how to be the money, got the legislation through and via checkpoint, which was the drug checking service we had here in Queensland, we started taking steroids samples in. And so people brought in there, oil, their testosterone and anti-dabroading, they brought in there, and have our own exam drawing as a pill or as a capsule, they brought in, and they brought in, pre-made, they brought in, you know, all kinds of things, someone brought in, meant, no, so you've even got some exotic stuff in there. And then we set about basically through those community submissions, people who come in between 2 to 6 pm on a Friday, drop it off, we logged it, moved it to the University Lab, and then I had a team of chemists analyzing it, working out the method and putting it through, I guess, a bunch of equipment, most of which is worth well over $1 million. Yeah, yeah, so anyway, between April and June we had only about 32 samples, and we sort of scaled up a method, we got presents for 23, we had to buy some reference standards, we had a lot of like learnings that we had to do, I only got purity for one, one test pro, and it was 96 milligrams out of 100 milligrams, so pretty good, but presented that back sort of to community and said, bear with me, we're, you know, trying to make this bigger and better. Yeah, so, sort of kept going, between June and August, I think we got 60 samples, but now we could do purity for all of them, because I'd almost all of them, I'd brought up a bunch of reference material standards and sort of built a library, built a method, so we started. Yeah, so people understand, in order to be able to do purity of a drug, you know, and then pure drug, and what teams refer into when he says references is he's bought pure base compounds, so pure tremble on that he can then run the machines and see what the effective result is for 100% and from that you can work out the purity of the drug you're testing. So what you're telling me is Tim figured out a way to get the Australian government to buy pure trend, it's pretty awesome, nice job, Tim, good work, so Tim has been working with Charlotte from China through WhatsApp and needs to be fine. Actually her name is Mercedes, but no, we scaled it up and I think we reported we got to report brands, purity, presence, the whole shabang, and then, then once we released that report, people got instantly between September and October, I got about another 70 samples in like a couple weeks, it was crazy. Yeah, and then that sort of went off. Well this happened with wedding us in the UK, didn't it? They end up having to stop their service because they got absolutely swamped, which was terrible. I swamped, but loving it, super stoked. So bottom line, published the entire trial report in February this year, the one I shared with you, and 105 samples, bottom line is 50% one, the dosed quarter, 25%, had a different steroid than what was meant to be in there, so something like Stan instead of no trend, just test C, or test E, I couldn't talk to the specifics in a bit. Hardly any overdose? I suppose say what was your percentage variance for what you'd regard as underdosed? 5% above or below the label. Yeah, so if it was 255, that's bang on essentially. Okay. Yeah. And yeah, I think it was 105 with some other samples that we couldn't do because people didn't give us tablet weight, or I mean some people threw that oil in like a sandwich bag, and then just like dropped it. Like dropped it in the UK just couldn't do anything to that. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. So there was like weed ones where it was like unable to analyse or you know, had had an issue going on. It was super cool to be able to just feed that back to everyone and this is what the market looks like. Yeah. Are you willing to share the methodologies? Yes, me. Yes. Please of course. Yeah. Shoulder or third. Sounds fascinating. This is fascinating. And I'm curious, what kind of feedback did you? Did you get a chance to talk to people on the other side, the people that were giving you these samples? Basically, the same kind of people that are listeners right now, were they surprised by the results that you guys found? So actively talking to them all the time because a new effeteute. And they looked, I think some of the comments I got was not surprised at all. There wasn't any kind of anava. But there was funky mixes in there as well. Like someone had testosterone and var in the var in one of the first and of our samples we tested. And that's a methyl test ones that come in all sorts of juice. So that was a prize man. But you don't want it in there. You know, no, I get that. It's a cheap or all ingredient that's very often thrown into to stretch a stock out. No, I'm actually surprised it was as good as it was to be honest. For 50% to be on point, it's pretty impressive. I remember when we were in Australia, I think they were saying 80% of what they tested was under post. I think by nature of the project, I captured people that were you know, both interested and also probably were the type to be monitoring the, you know, what they were using a little bit more than Joe Blow. That makes sense. The more advanced you get the longer you've been in it, the better supply you usually find. So that and they cared. They cared. It's got a reckon, you know, the other thing was they, I don't know if you've got it in US and UK, but we've got pen test Australia here, which is like a steroid testing sort of reagent kit that you can do in time. Okay. So that yeah, that came about in 2022 and you know, sort of get started giving people an indication of what was happening. And then obviously, you know, if you're not in Queensland or you're not able to get your samples to me, it's a good indicator. But what do you think that those home tests in general? We do have those over here. I've seen some stuff that was kind of funky. And I've found that you might be better off testing a raw material. But once you get something mixed into, say like an MCT oil, the different carriers and whatnot, you can get some variation in the results from that. I think they're pretty good here. Better than like the road kit or whatever you guys had back in the day. Yeah, people are still using those to some degree here. Sometimes. I think the well ones want to heroic it. Yeah. The carrier, the carrier oil will influence the whether there's any other experience in there will influence as well. And so, you know, if someone's got crashed or mine or some non-reacted, unreacted compound in there that'll mess it up as well. I think, and now the rules that we get from China to here. I don't know there's always weird stuff going on lately. Where? You know, it's looks in the anywhere, yeah. What do you mean by that? So, I'm going to spring this on you because I forgot to mention it. We also did a heavy metals analysis out of. Yeah. Well, maybe I didn't mention it. I heard, actually Victoria had mentioned that to me. We didn't talk about it untouched. I'm really curious to hear about this. So, in collab with PEDTESS, now, Alie sent off 30 samples to an independent lab and paid for an data ICPMS, something which I'm looking to do under a research project as well. Well, currently sort of in progress anyway. Out of those samples, there was arsenic in there, outside of daily permissible limits. There was cadmium, there was mercury, there was a lead, aluminium, like all kinds of shit. Well, outside daily permissible limits. And then when I did a bit of further analysis on that data and currently that's under a view of the journal, it looked like for oral compounds, particularly, there was a real issue around how that could play out chronically for someone's health. For example, 20 times the amount of daily allowable lead across even four weeks. At the lowest end of a dose, you're looking at serious, serious potential for cancer. What? Yeah. And you can't get rid of lead, for example. You mean that once some of these heavy metals are in your system, they're basically going to stay there unless you go through a lot of effort to get them out. Yeah. Well, I mean, so there's detoxification processes where I think you could potentially undertake whether they work or not or to what degree they work. Yeah, it should light an EDTA is one of them. You did that in under construction, the film, right, Dave? How did that go? Yeah, well, it was your situation. If anybody who didn't see the movie, what would I find? I had no accurate levels of heavy metals measured in my body. It was more of, we know that there, we know the exists, so we'll try this as a route of trying to mitigate that to some degree. I think at that point that truth be told, because it was the results are going to be based on personal experience and feeling rather than any sort of what a Bible data. At that point, the doses were so high, there were so much else going on. It was impossible to really say whether there was a positive or inevitable impact either way. There's, you know, drug stresses were at massive levels at that point. So hard to say, really. But yeah, heavy metals, I mean, here labs of using magsters and stuff like that, but it's more of a token gesture than something that's going to have a huge impact on removing the heavy metals out of the gear itself, because it's chemical buying there rather than just on the surface, flow it about. Yeah. But yeah, how useful that was, I honestly don't know. I think for me, it's a beautiful argument for all of this collectively for safe and regulated testosterone supply, right? Absolutely. That's the issue with an on-regulated market, where this evidence like this, we go, people are going to use testosterone, let's, let's you can, you know, regulate the supply through a farmhouse. How is the mood politically around steroids in Australia? Because traditionally it's been one of the worst. That's hard. Yeah, has this had any reflection on that? You still try to shovel diarrhea or is, yeah. Yeah, no, I get you, I get you. I think so for Queensland, I think, look, there is done a lot of groundwork in terms of creating research programs and evidence that, you know, puts harm reduction, people's health at the fourth one of that. These programs then logically sort of follow and follow along from, you know, evidence based best practice. And so the room to argue or to use these moralistic sort of, you know, standpoints isn't as strong. You can't say when I, for example, based on the steroid checking trial of gone, we tested this many samples, are then interviewed people afterwards, I showed them the results and I said, what would you do with your behaviors now? And they said, I use less, I changed my source or unthrowed away. And 80% of them said that they used less or throughout would discard once they saw how terrible it was. That is hard to argue with from a policy maker or political sort of standpoint. And so, you know, this, this isn't working. It is, it's putting people's health decisions, you know, rather than their hands and helping the make a well-informed choice. And there's a health argument, there's an economic argument there as well. For every time someone gets a bacterial infection from an unregulated steroid, for example, it costs a 16,000 and $250, somewhere like that. Anyway, you can extrapolate that out to say, every time someone, you know, uses a unsteer oil, gets one of these, it costs a sterling government, 200 million across the year based on, you know, whatever numbers. We are saving you money. That's a problem of every $1 million. Yeah. So, I mean, is the political climate the same, Dave, I reckon it is that there's just less room to fight when, you know, or argue when you start to disentangle and make good arguments around what's going to work. Yeah, I mean, because the, I don't mean it's in a negative sense, but the harm reduction in Australia, or the conscientious harm reduction, like the work yourself is doing, and others, is relatively new in the grand scheme of things, isn't it? I mean, it's only in the recent years, there's been a voice to fight back so wrong word, but you know what I mean by, you know, to challenge, not this policy making, isn't working, isn't helping, it's actually creating bigger problems. And that's only been more recent. So, I mean, there's probably a long way to go before you actually eventually get someone who will actually listen and start to create action in the right places, but I was just curious if, if you'd hardly any success, I'm moving that forward in any way, because I know it's been traditionally very difficult. I want to, I want us to move to the UK model. I want us to decrim steroids at the, at the, I guess, user level would be the ideal, right? I mean, there's an irony there that it's constantly coming up for reviewers to whether it should be criminalised here. So, that we haven't had one in a while to be fair, I think it's probably 18 months since we're last discussed it. But I mean, you just fired at each time, right? Like it would be. Well, nobody wants it. I mean, the, the only organisation is pushing for the criminalisation of steroids use within the UK, apart from the odd politician who somebody in his borrower has had a personal trauma within their family due to a user suffering in his wealth. Is UK AD? And that's just because they're frustrated, focus we know power. And they don't like being powerless. They've been given a bit more cloud and have a bit more weight behind them now and, and actually have some ex-police officers join them as well to look out the steroid problem. So to speak, but the police don't want the criminalisation, the research doesn't want criminalisation, the harm reduction community doesn't want criminalisation. Outreach programs, they like changes to normal criminalisation. So the, the real only, only governmental body organisation that the show in for it is UK AD because they know that if it's criminalised, it gives them the authority to prosecute athletes that use drugs. It's a criminalisation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a criminal defence now. You know that, so then it ones that are pushing for a criminalisation of steroids within the UK. But nobody else is interested. You get the odd politician, like I said, there'll be somebody in there burrer who a constituent who's unfortunately lost a loved one or a loved one who's suffocative air elf problems due to anabolic misuse. And you'll get that that pops up occasionally and will drive some interest occasionally. But generally the only consistent one in the account of criminalisation is UK AD. Are you guys aware of anybody in the US doing any work like this? Because I feel like it's, it's very much needed. That there's, there's quite a very search in the US, but I don't know that it's so focused as Tim's work is because Tim is very specific. That's what I'm kind of getting at is, is this type of stuff? I told Tim, we talked about it on text the other day that and I don't know if you're familiar with the situation Dave, but back up until about 2007 or 8, we had domestic testing that we could do. And there became this really popular message board staring super board. It got huge man. It got put it this way Dave. It was so big in things we're so over the top that like there were you could overnight a kid a growth for an extra 10 box. And everything was super super cheap. It got to the point where the guy who owned the board was doing like contests on the message board like you could win a super bike this week. Like the government that's when the government stepped in and there were a whole network of domestic sources that were getting their powders from overseas and then distributing it like rapidly and making up obviously a lot of it if they could wrap off a super bike or a car or things like that. And they were doing domestic testing at the time. And when they clamped down on this they created what they called Operation Raw Deal. They dismantled it hitting all these sources at once and shutting down their ability to domestically test. So we couldn't get those things tested anymore. They were using those tests to promote their products and the quality of the purity plus just users were chipping in on the boards and everybody's popping in 510 bucks to get something tested. We couldn't do that anymore. Of course we have Genoa's but it's still a lot of hoops to send that overseas. I think could really use this. I hope that our government in some ways sees your research to see just how important this is for harm reduction. What I find ironic to decree is historically it was that was legit supply chains in the US. Historically you could you could get your steroids through a doctor. Oh through. You know for for the same use and that stopped the UGL market boomed and now they've got a problem with the UGL market. It's like well then why don't you just take it back to a regulator tax product that makes you money as a governmental body and controls harm reduction and regulate usage because you then know who's using because they're on record. I think it's a test. I think it's a test. I don't know. Testosterone in US. I feel like there's a change in regulation. There's an expopping up everywhere. I love you so what Rick Piston Rick Collins Piston recently. Yeah yeah yeah and they're planning to remove it from the schedule three lists which I mean right now it's with all the other hard drugs or all the hard drugs so that's that's the way it thing though because it's only five years ago they were pushing for a tight in regulation on the TRT clinics and clamping down on TRT supply. There was a big push for that only five years ago. Yeah yeah and a lot that was telemedicine related. Right you know they wanted to have it like more checks and balances where you're seeing your physician in person that type I think that's what that was impart related to at least. But yeah yeah it seems. No you go there. No say it seems like there's this real inconsistency of direction. Oh and horrible contradictions. We just don't seem to go in one direction to any point where it actually makes a difference. I mean I say five years ago it was look you're too flippin with TRT we need to clamp down on it you need to see more of your your client base you need to regulate them closer you need to do this more efficiently and yeah I decided TRT industry in the US particularly and it's growing in the UK as well it is probably free folly in almost in the sense that there doesn't seem to be any particular regulation around doses. Loads and loads of clinics running and being run by people who have shall we say questionable knowledge in the way they treat their customer base and and and obviously very much upsell extra product rather than manage the individual correctly you know what will we'll run your test high so then I can now sell you anti-east regions and I can now sell you this as well. That's my concern with how our clinics are here. And this seems to be more of that going under the river was and I know the UK on a much smaller scale but I mean I've seen TRT clinics in the UK which are decent sized clinics altering the ranges on blood results so that consumers assume they need testosterone from a medical perspective we have soon all that they do. I'm seeing altered ranges here in the other direction to show you that your hematic rate is actually in range because up to 55 is normal now versus like they're giving you five more points and I was confused I saw one of my clients labs and I'm like this amatic rate's 55 but it's in range yeah I'm weird and I look and I see and I'm like oh okay they use a different range they're averages different so they can do that you know. I mean I'm not arguing that the clinical lower-intestosterone is adequate because it is significantly low. The green so for the UK point of view of 6.9 but at the same time each still doesn't make it right for a TRT clinic to put the lower limit at 12 because it's not technically correct you should still be showing the lower limit as it is but stay you know below this margin most people will start to experience significant reduction in quality of life that's fine I've never issue with that but I have an issue when you're falsely portraying someone's test level to be closer and so now we've got I mean very mind our ranges 6.9 to 29 we've we've now got people looking to go on TRT at animal levels of 15, 16, 17 and 18 yeah and it's like you can do what you want at the end of the day is your choice sure well don't be pushed into it because you think well I'm only a full points above the low end of the range no you know yeah actually significantly more why hello I wanted to do something different with my TRT advertisement for today and here's the thing I just got our order in Victorian I we pay for all the protein that we get they don't send us anything for free and that's because I've believed in true nutrition for 15 years now I've been using them ever since I contest prep they have some of the cleanest best quality protein a lot of times I use the team skip but here's the deal I'm going back to the pure way isolate the pure way isolate it just just processes so fast this is my favorite flavor chocolate peanut butter cup but if you want to try just like one pound at a time you can do that just sample it I've never had the cookie butter so I'm going to try the cookie butter this week we got a big old bag a pea protein isolate for the wife this is what she likes to use and here's the thing they're just about wholesale prices at true nutrition plus they don't add the flavor in when they weigh it so you get like legit one pound of protein and then from there they add the flavor after that so every one pound I think it's like 1.2 I'm not sure don't put me on that but hey here's the thing the true nutrition is a great quality protein they believe in us they advertise with us because I literally asked them to and if you use our code think you'll get some additional savings plus of course that's like voting for our podcast so thank you guys I hope you enjoyed my my impromptu ad goodbye well let me shift us back a little bit because we had some more stuff to talk about too not only have you been doing this to him but tell us a little bit about the outreach program that you guys have been doing and I know that you have some interesting stories that you can share anonymously of course of how does that work people are calling in to ask for advice or how does this happen so part of the the funding model is that we do the steroid checking which is continuing to see by the way in the trial they got it was just group results but now everybody gets a unique code for every sample they drop and when we report everything they get their unique result as well part of this sort of package or all of it was steroid connect so it's a steroid peer educator who has yeah ex-body builder she's awesome she works full-time basically gives people guidance advice through a phone line free call phone line that anyone can call or email her or do a team's or resume or whatever base or what she's also at the needle exchanges as well depending on which one and which day so be sure that number here is it so we can do all right I'll make sure to get it up then for anybody and I'll really thanks yeah and so I mean when when people want more when they drop off their steroids for example and they you know instead of having like an intervention or anything it's just a health conversation around are you having any sides that you want to talk about or you know how's your usage strategy do you want to talk about use it just that sort of stuff where it's no pressure but if people have questions and want to make changes or ask questions or anything there's a safe space to do so because it's so taboo over here you would have those types of discussions you not getting bloodstone there's a bunch of online clinics that we can sort of give you don't have a GP we've got safe sort of allied trusted ones that we can refer you to don't have a coach we can start to you know have those sorts of discussions around where you where you are and who you're thinking and where you're at but basically there's always you know Sonja who's the educator or it's comes back to me with the you know fun stories and you know what's happened so one of the first ones which is fantastic she's at the needle exchange and someone's coming to obviously grab shops and they're like early on first cycle about to start and they want to start shooting test us during an antate they go in and they've come in and they've asked for basically the IV the insulin syringes and yeah they're going to load these out and they under the impression that they're going to use that to inject into their glue and that's the site mind you this thing is a 29 gauge or a 31 gauge so tiny you struggle to push the oil through let alone push a whole mill through let alone get deep enough into the glue you can do it but it's not and I think a lot of people are especially with tear teen out is using in a lot of this it's not in a useful group you know you know not in your glue max right yeah yeah yeah the other thing that that they don't consider is they actually increase in pressure you agree by using a narrow ball because that's coming out the end of that life fucking jet and and so Scott and and had you know had the discussion said look you know here's your options if you're going to shoot there if he was saying I'm going to you know um three years in and I need to split up every day injections across multiple sites yeah I'd say guy for it you know you have front rear you got up a trap you got tank like world's a roister oh I loved up a trap don't no I loved up it was you six you just a rovin these to do that back in my dad's the work for me was my dad's friends they had the impression that there were more engine receptors in the trash yeah yeah I mean being said I'm not doing calves but traps oh god don't calves don't don't kind of like a flizzon oh yeah lat lat was like a you know yeah I struggled a lot yeah I struggled a lot no I struggled that's why I have a lot yeah I struggled a chest and for some reason it would just always pull it would never disperse well it's um she had to do some work around that I think another another person you know was was trying to draw had issues with drawing so she had to work through that and another uh figure a girl who were woman called up one time and she she had the old so my coach gave me this bottle of tablets some take one and day doesn't know what they are no idea but says you know I've been experiencing you know I'm going for my beard trim in this small yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's time for laser basically and like oh okay so I had just to work around that another one come through and um had the you know the oil to inject was doing sub-cue injections sounded like it was test E or test P maybe but again had the um growing hair a lot faster my voice has gotten deeper and that and those types of things um what else yeah there's just the the knowledge barriers that I thought that we've overcome and it just brings me back to to uh realizing like no need to need super basic information for everyone all the time said that we're all on the same page the green you know it's kind of a big part of what this show is too you know we we we have fun with it but we do and we do we are repetitive we talk about a lot of the same topics over and over again but we have a constantly there are new people coming in that that need some of that real basic information you know it's shocking how many people engage around the ballads without even realizing that they shut themselves down oh yeah um you know and you conversations you have about well my test is low right fair enough so I'm going to need to take more the mame who's test was a little bit higher because it just don't understand that it's a completely replacement situation it's not a top up you know right through to women doing a middle source to 50 in a military under the week because it's fem test it's T.R.T for females and it's like not even T.R.T for males well I love female but it's I mean we could laugh about it and have a bit of a fun with it but you know they genuinely do not know and it's yeah the knowledge base is very at the same time you get the opposite end of the spectrum when you get people that are very knowledgeable but so much so that they don't consider their at risk and so you get this complacency around people who have knowledge because they they are most and I've done it myself you you're almost overlooked the obvious things that are going on because you're always looking for a more complex more intricate problem I mean when my kidneys first failed I was looking for right why am I not pulling war into the cell works my problem with my sodium what's the problem you know my potassium no my kidneys aren't working right mate that's what's muddy wrong we yeah yeah you know which was was a very simple in the sense of symptoms to diagnosis obvious choice I overcomplicate it and was looking for something for a more daily yeah even coaches need a coach sure sometimes you just need an objective review I think that's the problem it's probably you need to tell you what to do you need someone to look at you objectively and that's not always something you can do personally yeah I mean so there's there's that end right where you need to you know troubleshoot the the top end sort of things I think then we've got the other end where another blood came in and he was shooting with the same needle that he was drawing with like the 19 the 19 so literal harpoon any any was drawing with it and then using the same he said this is hurting me yeah I like of course it is so I think the change the idea what's up here you don't that's a 20 one sure of you yeah it's a 21 21 21 21 I can manage 19 days 19 days you know you know you know you know that's another story funny I mean it's it's hard I think the tricky part is pitching for that and pitching also for people that want general general or genuine sort of you know you should strategy guidance across you know I'm using these two compounds and this is what's been it that kind of stuff so it's been it's been interesting trying to manage that as well I think but we do we do and it's going well it's only been I think this is the fourth month of the program yeah what's the next step that you have in mind if they allow you to you know continue doing this and growing this where would you like to see this go so love this is why love is got so okay here we we've got another year to see out where I've got individual checking going on I mean the NHMSA so our national health and medical research council here in Australia has awarded me fellowship for five years from next year and still checking is the the whole agenda of it so another you know till 2030 yeah so but excitingly enough we have also the organization that I work in partnership with the loop Australia and the other two I should have mentioned so Quavo and Quint the Queensland Drug User organizations but the loop is secured drug checking tender in Victoria now in Victoria it's super cool man because we you know every part of drug checking that as occurred for steroids happens in a lab so it is I use an all-betrap 360 which is like a million dollar LCMS piece of equipment and I use a radiant ice up for the presence stuff we tested a few other things now everything just goes through the orbit because it's easier fast-sepured you know HPLC and things like that because of the the standards of process and everything else takes a little bit longer there now in Victoria they got this cool new fancy piece of equipment that they're shipping and called PSMS which is a paper spray mess spec now what you do with that is you can essentially you've got to dissolve whatever drug you're using into a sprayable you spray it on essentially what is a piece of paper paper goes into the machine come out and then you get your result now nobody's ever so this works for all all drugs apparently no ones have had done this for steroids but if we could do it for steroids this would be the game changer of game changes because instead of people waiting weeks or months for their results with me now because it goes to the lab we've got to do lump you know preparation and and pushing through all the trap needs to run overnight can only do a certain amount of samples or that sort of jump PSMS 30 minutes presence purity hello and you can line up you know multiple samples so literally if that method gets I guess you know validated reliabilitys and check that would be bringing steroids in line with all other drugs then in terms of timing so within 30 minutes someone comes in gives their oil tablet you know skilled chemist gets it onto the paper into the machine there you go I think that's what I'm the most pumped for that would be cool man have you seen any of the light analysis stuff no that you mean FTIR yeah yeah they you'd be light analysis stuff where they they don't do that for steroids yet but I believe they are developing it no no no no I have heard about the handheld you can you've got like us handheld light analysis they're cost about 30 grand you can only do like presence but you can scan tablets and it will give me the whole composition of the case I want to get one of those too serious tech some serious tech coming online obviously obviously expensive tech but there's some serious tech coming online yeah it'd be crazy but I mean that's the sort of next trial phase that that fixed side will go or reckon alive sometime in the second half of this year and then I'm basically needing to advertise just like a little Queensland like steroid community let's go hey I'd be here to help anything we can do if you want to come back on and talk about it you know we have to help spread the word man sweet that are probably good I guess just because samples come in we verify the method and then you know that that that guy's ahead I think it's super cool that you know this is a military grade piece of equipment that we get to you know use the benefit of steroids and steroid communities i love it and I think yeah we need to have been stuck as we need to go to Australia on the part of this research to a podcast live that would be fine with with the PSMS yeah we're in the back right now yeah so rising stuff like yeah I'm just bringing their products as 10 a.m. as the handheld scanner you know we're going to do an analysis So when you write your net proposal, just factor in the travel cost for two idiots to travel And here's what else we have to do. Dave takes a tablet. I take a tablet and then we try to Scast the consistency or we see you dies first. Tim, Tim, I'm like that was 87 Oh, you know, you know, I'm the money. I'm the money. Scott 80's. Let me I didn't tell you this either Scott. So so there was a tablet. So not not part of the steroid checking program, but obviously drug checking does music festivals like film testing and things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a month ago I get this message from the team and they're like, you would not fucking believe this. There was a tablet that was meant to be ecstasy, like meant to be MDMA and, you know, ratsack or whatever they're putting in nowadays. Anyway, no MDMA, this thing had a sheet you were sheet, you know, like a nine different steroids in it. No MDMA. Yeah, just just like a mix of nine steroids and still waiting for them to send me the whole breakdown. I said, I need to see this thing and I need to publish it. But it wouldn't get you hard all. It would probably just absolutely just instant, color, estate, the cut, your stasis, like instantly, the rupture of some of some sort. There'll be a new role on the market next month. 10 years. You can get it. Yeah. Yeah. Someone will recreate it. You can guarantee it. You can guarantee it. What a party? 25 milligrams. It's honestly, there'll be some on the dust. Some of this stuff here, you hear, and read and see you and it's just like, well, you sell a workout where it's gone from sometimes, but it's just like, what the fuck were you thinking? Yeah. All right, Tim, well, listen, man, we appreciate having you on and you know, looking back from the time we had you on before, which has been a while now. I feel like it's been too long. I believe back then, you were talking about eventually you wanted to be able to do this testing. So it's really cool to see what it's become now. You know, from where you were then, to where you are now, it sounds like you've solidified and locked this in. So it's going to continue on for at least the next five years, which is awesome. And I'm confident that with the work that you put in the passion that you and your team have, it's only going to continue to grow. They won't be able to say no to continuing this program by, you know, the expiration date at 2030, you know, so I'm excited to see where you go next, man. Thanks, good. May two. It'd be good if it comes to the US. Yeah. Yeah. We can do anybody who's watching right now in the US that is a researcher, consider what Tim's doing. You know, we'll put your information down below for social media. I make sure to get that phone number from you. And anything else that people should be aware of anything they can follow along with that you're doing now that you'd like to share? So it'll send you a couple things. All right, cool. We'll post that all below, guys. Thanks for tuning in for another episode of Drugs and Stuff. We've got Tim, the researcher from Australia with us. Of course, Dave, go to supplementsource.ca if you're in Canada shop for supplements there. Stromsports.com. You can shop for some great health and performance supplements there, especially if you're on cycle, you're going to need to hit up Strom if you're in the UK. And of course, evalbloodanalysis.com. You get your labs done by Dave and the UK. True nutrition.com. These are, quote, think over there. And of course, thank you to everybody from Patreon. We didn't get any questions out this week. We'll be back next week to answer your listener questions as always and have some fun topics. So load us up with questions for the next show. Plus, all your comments like all that stuff. It definitely does help to booster programming up. You guys do an incredible job at that. And I love the community we have here. So thank you guys for thank you for being you. And for another episode of Drugs and Stuff Guys, we'll see you soon.

I don't think people realize that rapid strength gain can be as much as a curse as it can be a bonus. What's up guys, welcome back to the podcast with Dave Crosslin. I'm Scott McNaley and all of our programming is brought to you by evalblotanalysis.com. If you're in the UK and you're on cycle, you're going to need some labs and you can get your labs done by Dave. Even if you're not on cycle, you should be checking your labs. Go to evalblotanalysis.com, get your labs done by Dave and the UK. We are brought to you by Strom Sports Nutrition for those of you in the UK and those of you in the US as well. I have links below to both of the sites. Definitely check out Strom for great health stacks, especially if you're on cycle. Trutrition.com, use our code thinkover there to get 10% off all your orders. I just got my order for creatin and we got a bunch of the P protein isolate for Victoria, my wife, and I already had a bunch of weight ISO on hand for myself. Less than at least supplement source.ca for Canadians. They have great deals that change week to week. We are joining Dave on his vacation. Vacation with Dave. Yeah, so many fronds. You look more laid back. Dave's not like, all you know, like upset and like I gotta get all these things done. You look like you're having fun, man. I don't push it. I don't have that. I mean, working Mozart today, if I finished about 8.4 o'clock in now, I finished work probably about 1.4 o'clock. Okay, but just to be clear, are you grumpy on vacation? Are you that guy? I'm just grumpy. Yeah, but like you can't be grumpy on vacation in the South of France at your campground. We had a couple of basketball days have been a big push to get down to where we are. So yes, the reason I couldn't do the podcast is it was we ended up doing six hours of driving. Which I know is not the end of the world, but you know, in 13 years. Looking traffic and all that traffic. It, it, but time we got it was quite, it was a bit late. So yeah. But we got set up last night and settled in and so today's being a much more relaxed. Because I've got, we're not going anywhere to the 13th with part up there for a week. Nice. And it was chill a bit and sort some shit out. Well, we couldn't get the show out last week because Dave was literally trying to get everything together to go, but we are back today. We haven't done an anage raw profile in some time. So we're going to do that today. We've got all your listener questions from the previous episode. And if you guys want to take part in the next show, then definitely comment below. Plus all your comments like all that stuff. It helps to boost our programming and the algorithm. And if you're new here, let me encourage you to subscribe and hit the bell because we have a variety of different podcasts. We got me in Dave. We got other shows with the coaching Q&A. We've got Ron and Dusty. We've got science with Scott Stevenson. So we've got a bunch of different stuff for you guys. But to kick it off, Dave, let's do a little conversation. We've had it before. It's no longer on the channel though about a little compound called Green Giants. Oh, X's. Or draw. Hey, bombs. Hey, bombs. I like A-bombs. That's a good one. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I never took those. But that's reference to a brand, I think. Yeah. An applon. An applon was the brand name. And 50 was referring to the strength of the tablet. I E-50 million. I would love to do a poll and find out how popular is an adroll now today. I feel like it's a pretty popular compound overall. I would put it when next to D-ball as far as like gain a lot. But it's a very different compound too. You know what I mean? You're not getting all that crazy. Asteric drinking version though. You can't get a lot of water from it. Well, I think it went through a deep popularisation because there was a lot of fear around its toxicity and it gained a reputation for being the most toxic oral. It isn't actually true. It's medically prescribed. It's prescribed children. It's prescribed to women. It's surprisingly high doses for extra, quite extended periods of time. I mean, as I was saying off camera before we started, I know someone who's prescribed 100 milligrams of oxymethylona day for anemia. It's a genetic situation. And he's been on that eight emails. 100 a day for 18 months. How often does he get his labs done? Because I know that there are situations where people take medications that are going to be toxic. It's not quite regular, but everything is. They're happy with where it is. Obviously, there is some liver stress. It's processing the drug. But the stress isn't increasing. You know, there isn't a downward trend. It's just, look, it's working a bit harder than normal. And that's exactly where it's at. And I do think oxy's suffered with a little bit of a unnecessary bad reputation. But at the same time, that in a way, helps people be respectful of its use. So, yeah, a bit of a cash 20, too. And you know, you want to be honest about things, but at the same time, you don't want people to get too blasé and casual about using any oral, because they all have potential. But it's a solid compound that always has been an always will, but you know, and I don't think really there's anything in the oral market that matches it for strength. I just pulled up the Wikipedia, because I fear like deep dive research, Dave. I've got the deep dive research. I wanted to see when it was first invented, and I don't quite see that yet. I just see what it's been used for like wasting diseases, anemia, to promote weight gain, and muscle growth in certain situations. I mean, I like those situations. I think I need it medically for those purposes. Yeah, I mean, it's being used, like, say, for muscle waste, these disorders and things like that. Yeah. Half life, if I remember why these nine hours. I think okay. Yeah, check this out. Go on. Axi Muffelon was first prescribed in 1959, and was introduced for medical use. But was discontinued in 1961, so like a couple years later, due to high lipid toxicity. Mostly used in the United States. In addition to its medical use, it's used to improve physique and performance, which we knew. It's considered to be a obviously controlled substance in many countries. And so non-medical use is generally a listen. So 1959, and at least I'm guessing that's the US they're talking about, discontinued in 61. That doesn't make sense, because I remember the old school guys that used to get gear in the like 80s would be getting it from the pharmacy. I might be just stateside that you're reading because it's eight still prescribed in the UK today. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it medically usually does it somewhere around 1 to 2 milligrams per kilo. The strange thing now you mentioned water. And yeah, oxymeffelon is dihydrotestosterone based. So it's a DHT. So there's no estrogen. Yeah. But it's believed to engage with the ER directly. So it's believed to have an affinity to the estrogen receptor itself. We know it has binding with the PR, the pregesterone receptor, which is why it's class technically as a proglostin. It's not true, proglostin, but it acts like progesterone to some degree. However, it's engagement with the PR is less of that than progesterone. So whereas oxymeffelon gauge of the PR and give a single less of a gesterone, train will engage with the PR and give a single greater than acqueter of the gesterone. I think it turns about 1.2 whereas oxymeffelon is about 0.78. Okay. But yeah, there is some some for process around it being capable of binding with the estrogen receptor. And there's been a suggestion of running serms alongside as a woman. As a way of potentially combating that. Yeah. No, interestingly, I believe it was oxymeffelon that Scott Stevenson talked about. There were some some tests done where they would basically they would introduce it into the body with a die. And that die would then light up wherever it was active. And they did not find it to be traditionally attached to the estrogen receptor, the way that like most injectables would be. Is that what they call like the non genomic effect or whatever. Yeah. So that's from what he was saying, they're not quite sure then. If it's not attaching to the estrogen receptor, the way we would expect it to, you know, there's non genomic activity. We really don't have a solid understanding of that. It's like what it's really doing. Yeah, there's a lot of from what I've seen. There's a lot of we think it might do this. We think it might do that. But there's no actually a lot of concrete. This is its method of action. This is how it interacts. This is what he told. But there's no denying. I mean, we've got decades of unadult level of evidence of how effective it is at increasing stress. And fullness and pumps, you know, each use free stage of your lean enough to make you incredibly full. It's used as an aid in in strength sports because it is so effective at boost in strength. I love the stuff. I always have to and I've always thought it was a fantastic rock. But, yeah, you know, it's, but I do like oxies. It has its place. It's not an every cycle thing. But yeah, I found my number one side effect from it was that it destroyed my appetite. And I think it's real common for that. It is. I could only use it for short periods of time. I find it to be a really good compound to use intermittently. I know, you know, like talking real world experience, you know, I do use it in coaching. But when I do, it's generally going to be intermittent through the week. Maybe three times a week, taking pre workout on specific training days. It used to be, you know, when I first started cycling, it would be an option to do like a kickstart. So you're doing 10 weeks of test sip or whatever, test E. And the first four weeks or the first six weeks was anadroll. Now days, I, I don't do that. And I don't think, well, lot most people aren't doing kickstarts. But maybe the last four weeks, last six weeks. And even if you're doing it intermittently, like three times a week, I think you can even stretch it out a little bit longer than that, you know, because you're not using it every day. Water retention doesn't get as high in an off season where you're really pushing food. And you can get a nice little boost pre training. I'd say both in off season and in contest prep. I've been experimented with it one year, Dave, on leg day only through a contest prep. No, there is a, there is almost a pre workout, a fact with a lot of all roles and, and obviously, we're following to that very well. So, you know, taking it singularly for a performance boost more than a growth boost is, is definitely an option to help through sticking points. And particularly is your sensitive to the appetite. And the appetite of all the roles, I'd say, it's probably the most damaging to appetite. It will add to it. I mean, I can eat, or I used to build a week through anything. But even I felt the impact of oxies. You know, it was like food was very labored, but I mean, I spent years for it. It wasn't really an issue, but I could feel it. I could feel how much more labored my consumption had to be when I was running the oxies. What were you dosing it out? You to be honest, I generally stuck at 50. I had a couple of points. Oh, okay. Up to 100, just to play, but generally, I did a little period of time, and I mean, let it allows in a week or two max, where I did a 100, 100, 100 on a bar pretty workout. Yeah, I mean, it was, but I, I stopped because the pumps with the ridiculous, I couldn't move. I just fucking pray. I could imagine. I've had a client start quite funny we talk about this today, because this wasn't planned, like we ever planned anything. But I hit the client, started about six, seven days ago. And he, okay. He's first four, five days. He says, I didn't really think anything was happening. And all of a sudden, he's message me today, and he's like, Jesus Christ, my strength is through the roof. He's benching for plates aside. He's never even been near that before in his life. He says, really? Things feel over, but the reps keep coming. It's just, yeah. Yeah. Wait, so I was doing for six reps, I'm doing for ten. He just can't believe it, it's absolutely blown him away. Now, that's a very good response. It's not usually quite automatic, but it's a very effective drug and can be used in quite a lot of different scenarios, like you said, in the single application, just around a stumbling body part or something like that, just two, three days, pretty sure if you're leaning off stuff like that. So it's got more flexibility than I think people actually give it credit for. I think, yeah, if somebody wants to use it for a contest, because it can be situations. You know, here's my thought is that if you're really hard and nasty looking, you're ready for the show, you can only get so hard before like getting grainier isn't going to help your cause. And at that point, maybe a little bit more fullness might be, then like, what do we need to get better? You know, sometimes getting heart, your heart or an grainier isn't going to get you a better, like you're already going to be theliness guy there is and nasty as guy there is, but getting fuller could be to your benefit. That's where I'd consider it. I usually like to do an experiment where maybe a month out if we're already in good shape will add it in and we'll watch and we'll look at my, my guy every morning, and see, okay, how's he look the next day after two days after three days after four days and usually we'll find a point where it's like, yeah, after four or five days, maybe it's a little much. So let's pull it back out, maybe we'll try it again and just to test it out and then maybe we'll use it conservatively into a show that way. We know, you know, what's going to happen each day for the most part. Another side effect, because you mentioned the strength, I would say that a major side effect of Vanetrol is ripping your pack off the tendon because I've seen that happen to guys more than once man getting so strong with it. Yeah, you, you, it's, I don't think people realize that rapid strength gain can be as much as a curse as it can be a bonus because you really have to be conscious about the fact that your tendons aren't gaining strength at the same rate your muscles are. Yeah, and if you're going into ways that you've never been there before, you are going into risk territory. So you do need to push the reps rather than think right. Well, I mean, I've always been a fan of sets of six. I've always liked training on the heavier side, slightly less reps, but I've always done my reps very slow and controlled. So the actual time on the load is still quite high. Okay. But I mentally, I get bored. That's my problem. If I'm under a weight for too long, I get bored. So if I'm doing sets of 12 and 15 by the time I get and I like to think my reps are really like to mentally go through the motion with it. I at least sometimes a bit, if you find, I don't know, but it's like when I'm bench-fressing, I'm visualizing the peck and how it moves and how it contracts and where it's pulling and where it's connected and all that sort of crap. So my training has always been quite thoughtful. Some guys just like to go in there as much shit out of it. There's a very, very ranges in it and that they're twice words for you. Yeah, it's very easy when the strength's not coming to just go more and more. And you've just got to all back and go, no, let's stay at this weight but build the reps. Let's do a bit more volume just so I get the tendon. I get the tendon strength up at the same time. Yeah, but would be a good rule as far as what would you allow yourself how much could you go up, you know, per workout, weight wise? Well, I mean, I, the was a time when I only went up in tens or 20s. As you go older, you learn that that may not always be the best move. So I would say if you're putting five kilos on a workout, that's probably not too bad if it's full you might throughout the workout. But if you're jumping up, literally going, and I remember squatting the first time I used oxies and I was literally going up nearly a plate session. You know, yeah, I had a session. And I went from like three place squats to like four and a five place squats within a matter of a good. That was that was I was lucky I didn't come away with an injury off the back of that because that is rapid. So I think initially you're going to enjoy this strength gains. But if you find that those strength gains are continuing, then you're probably better going right. Okay, let's just pull back on the load in and start pushing the reps a bit more, but with the same weight. So you know, if I've gone off a plate as I don't have squat, that's a 40 kilo jump. That's significant. Let's now build the reps up so I'm doing this for 10 reps or 11 reps and then and then I might look at another weight increase rather than they just gives a body time to strengthen those 10s because the tendons. The standard integrity comes with. The other thing is how you train. For me, always been very controlled. So I've never got on with explosive reps. I've never been comfortable with them. I've never found them particularly enjoyable to do. Yeah, if you're an explosive trainer where you're exposing in the positive, then the risk for injury from the strength increase becomes much greater. And then this sudden power load in where if you're a plotter like me who slow and steady throughout the race, then the injury risk reduces somewhat because you're not having this massive power load into the joint. You know, into the answer. Yeah, I've heard it's two two weeks on average that our tendons strength is behind her muscle strength. So that muscle gets fast or strong real fast and you need a couple weeks to let those tendons catch up to it. So we've talked a little bit about it. Ossies in a little bit about it in a contest scenario. I mean, definitely a really good strength compound. Is there is there any other aspect? I mean, it's available as an oral injectable. We've seen that I've never personally used it. Was it had you used the oral injectable version? I think I have. I don't think I know it's any particularly different from it. Yeah, but I think I have. I've got this vague recollection of there was a time when injectable or rules were quite popular and there were a few flowing around and I'm sure I tried injectable orcs. Yeah, all right. Generally speaking with the injectable versions, you find that they're actually that a little bit more effective. Generally. Yeah. And most of that's down to the root of the administration. Orals and oxies, no exception to this are facts all you've all. There is the potential for some of the compound to bind with non dietary fat, pass through the system when you ingest them. Well, obviously if you inject them, you bypass all that. So you're going straight. That's all of the internal bloodstream straight away you want it. You don't have to go through the stomach and digestion and absorb them in that way. So that's the result you've got to get a bigger hit. I can't say I really know it's the big significant difference at the time. But, I mean, it's probably one of those times when I was throwing everything but the fucking kitchen sink in there and wouldn't know. And anyway, if I had it, you know, so. Yeah. It's hard to say. I don't for anybody who's newer. I guess that's thinking like, hey, I'm putting my first cycle together or first cycles. It's not the first thing that I would jump to. But if you were to respect it, I mean, gosh, even though it comes in 50s generally, I mean, I wouldn't be opposed to even running it at 25. If you were going to run it, you know, for like a month straight or something. I've seen five and 20s as well. Have you, okay. It's one of those oldels is actually very well tolerated by females. Yeah, I think it can be, you know, depends on the individual, right? It's always a individual tolerances, yeah, but the general because he's got that projection action in the background. Yeah. That is what normally creates some of the problems within a male, which in a female is really well tolerated. Like, decades and other compounds that's actually quite female, friendly in that sense. And yeah, I've seen some quite impressive stuff with females and in doses as well as five milligrams. Oh, yeah, yeah, super low for for females. I think five is absolutely plenty. All right, listen, I think we have a bunch of listener questions lined up here. If we didn't cover anything about anadroll, then and you guys wanted to know, then definitely just comment. We'd be happy to talk more about it. If you're in the market for protein powder, check out truenutrition.com. They literally have like every protein powder under the sun. I go with their cold filtered weight isolate or their team skip blend. I go for the chocolate peanut butter cup, but there's a few flavors that I like. Let me know if you have any questions about that. Victoria, my wife, she gets the P protein isolate. It's rare to find a P isolate. Most of them are concentrated. So the isolate is super low in carbs regardless of your diet that they will have a protein powder for you and you get to flavor how you want and buy it by how many of your pounds you want. So check them out. Trinutrition.com. They're the first company that ever supported our podcasting. So we support them. You can support us by shopping, literature, and using our code think. I feel like we are forgetting a couple little odds at ends, but we did cover mostly everything. So let me just jump straight into this stuff. If you guys have any other questions feel free to comment with them as well. That's kind of what keeps the show running. You guys ask questions. We give you guys answers. So a guy who listened to the last episode, Scott is his name. Nice name. He says viewer question. Do you guys think that a taller guy needs a higher gear dose? I'm six foot two, 270 pounds, but I've always wondered if due to me being over six feet. Do I need to account for that fact with higher doses? Highest I've ever gone is one gram of test. But I like to run 800 milligrams of Deca and anadrawal topic of the day compound at 100 milligrams, etc. considering the vast majority of bodybuilders are shorter, is there any truth to needing higher doses to fill out? This is an interesting question actually. And it's something I've pondered most medicines are body mass, linked. So when we discuss stocks, he just now, the medical prescription rate is based around milligram per kilo. But TIT isn't. We don't change TIT dos in because someone has a greater body mass. Yeah. And I know there's a few people within the industry that work on a milligram per kilo pro, a co-one it comes to dosing. I know something broad rig does. And I'm not convinced it's necessary. I think there's so many different variables from a bite of you of genetic sensitivity to the compounds, to your own baseline genetics on protein absorption and you know, you can use and all this sort of stuff in any sense, sensitivity. And all the other factors that fall into driving must get a growth. And then on top of that training efficiency and everything else from a stimulus point of view. I'm not so sure the way to dosing is that direct. I think there is a general that the more muscle mass you carry to an extent. And I think there's a limit to this. I think there's a cap point where beyond it just doesn't any more effective, particularly. But I think there is definitely a link of the more muscle muscle carry. You are going to need more drugs to a point. But I think there's also a point where the stress side of things and the toxicity elements within, of all within usage become counterproductive. Yeah. So I don't think it's as simple as more, more and more. I do think there is an element of muscular mass to dosing requirement, but I don't think there's an element of body mass to muscular requirement. Yeah, because if you think about it, I've seen plenty of people of all heights and sizes and T or T that it doesn't seem like, oh, he's a taller guy. He's going to need an extra half CC to get in range. Yeah. You know what I mean? He does this work. You're going to skin a little guy that weighs a book 20 that needs more tests than the guy that's too eight. Yeah. So I think probably one of the deciding factors is not body mass, but muscle mass. Yeah. So you could have a guy at six foot three, weigh 130 kilograms or whatever that is. What's that? Two, three, three hundred poundish. But actually a guy at five foot six at a hundred kilograms carries more muscle per inch than the taller guy. And the taller guy is way is more skilly or way and connective tissue and you know organs and the rest of it. And the actual muscle mass in the taller guy is less. So in those scenarios, I could see the smaller guy and the lighter guy actually requiring more antibiotics than the taller heavier guy because of where the weight he's coming from from a point of view of how much muscle mass of emotional to how much skilly or frame and everything else. Yeah. I would just say this that, you know, it sounds like he knows the dosing that's worked well for him. But hey, I like using a gram of task, 800, DACA or whatever. And if that's what we're like use the least you can to get the results that you need and just continue doing that. And if you get down the road and it's like, hey, I need more. You know, I'll tell you this day, there is one thing that a bigger guy will need and that's going to be more food without that. Yeah. Bigger guy is going to need more protein than a smaller guy is bigger guy is going to probably need more carbs and not across the board, but overall. More mass need more food. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's your basic running engine power requires more calories to to maintain. You've got more structure. You've effectively got a bigger engine. Yeah. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that engine stronger. And if you're into cars, which some people have to watch is there. You know, they're the two Lee, um, Japanese engines producing a thousand horsepower and fucking six lead of the eights only producing 300 and 50. So, but the eights going to be less fuel efficient because of the size of the capacity of the cylinders. So, that's very similar to people. You know, a big guy is going to require more calories in respect to it. But yeah, it's one I've never quite signed up to the milligrams per kilo approach. I don't think he's accurate to be broad spectrum of that. Going back to this individual, 1.8 of injectables and 100 grams of oils at 100 milligrams of oils a day. There's no light, gold, good doves. Yeah, no. You know, it says that's a decent lack. And I'd argue that pretty much anyone on the planet is going to grow off that. Yeah, I would hope so, at least, you know. All right. Let's see. I heard that there are hard to get products. Master on it is a big one. And a trend hacks is if he as well. But Primo is still good from what all my sources tell me. But my source also said that India is picking up the slack and that the cost has gone up some, but the quality is good. Have you guys heard the same? I know, indeed, it has the capacity. Now, previously, the quality has been the issue coming out of India. He's been the father of the quality he's never quite being there or never been consistent. Okay. That may be because India couldn't compete with China on price. So in order to compete on price, they lowered the quality. If they've now got an open market, I price isn't an issue because there is no competition because China's not producing. Then I could be, yeah, see if it's costing a little bit more, I could see the Indian quality improving. I think previously, they've been priced out. So they had two choices of crack quality or not finatore. Where I think now they've got an opportunity to produce quality. He's costing more. But people are paying that because they have no alternative. And it could establish India as a supplier gun. India is big in the medicinal trade side of things. A lot of right. So in the UK, the Stores supply chain is brought from China for injectables. But most support drugs are remodaxed around the scene, letters are all cave, that's all India. So all that sort of stuff is coming from India. Yeah. H-C-G, Indian generally speaking. You know, so there's, there is India has the ability to step in here. And as long as they produce the quality, they could very much change the market actually. Yeah, I could see that. Alright, Billy says, question for you guys. Scott always talks about how much he loves wind stroke. I don't know if I have. I mean, I guess I've talked positively of it. I guess he's referring to the oral version. What do you guys both think of the injectable version? Wind stroke suspension. So he's talking about the water based. Is it worth it or not? If so, would it be good to go pre-contest similar to some of the other orals that are made into injectables like injectable deboling injectable Andidral, etc. Thanks in advance. Dave, I just had a client lay out his list of everything he had setting up his cycle. And he's like, I really want to try wind stroke. And he has two 10 milliliter vials of wind stroke suspension. I said no. Let's not use that. The issue with wind stroke suspension is water. Yeah, it's the sterility of the water. If you're getting and getting an abscess from an injectable, he's usually water based that will cause it. If you can get the effectively non-estid version in an oil, then I'd be much more comfortable about using that. I would be very cautious about the water based injectables. The nice thing about the water based injectables is, did I have to be wasted because you can drink them? Now I should be. Yeah. Can an oil, but at least you can use it. But I would just, it's just that medium for carrying the drug in the soft pottings of milk. I've never liked water based. The vast majority. You don't see a lot of water based now. We haven't done for a long time. But there was a time when there was quite a lot of white milky injectable liquids floating around in the world. Yeah. It's also quite a lot of people have in problems, posting injections. So there's a link there for a reason. Yeah. I mean, in principle, I've got no issue with the injectable version being used. Just don't mind that medium as a suspension now, so for me. Yeah. I've mentioned this on other shows. And I guess I have talked positively about windstroll lately because I do feel like it's been an underrated compound. Yeah. You know, you're obsessed with windstroll. I'm obsessed with obviously. That way you're talking about. I'll tell you what, man. You get a nice, like, really grainy dry look with windstroll going into a contest. I would say that there is nothing quite like that before trend became popular. It was like the go to contest compound for hardening up. I think you don't have to know a lot though. We've, with that changes in drug trends. Yeah. Old drugs that actually did a really good job. But if almost just being neglected because, yeah, that's what we used to do. Yeah, but they used to do it. Yeah. Fucking reason. Because it works. Yeah. But then compared to trend. And there's, I think, a reason why it may be got, you know, because it cast a shadow on it, you know. You don't get devolstuff windstroll either. Yeah. Yeah. You might not. So here's a thought. Other issues with the injectable suspension version is if you do get, and you were going to use this stuff, you want to use some type of a micronized product. Otherwise, it's known these, these injectables like that or suspension. They can clog a larger gauge, even like the larger gauge needles. So sometimes you have to jam that in with a really, you know, large gauge in. If I'm already helping somebody doing a contest prep, there's a real good chance that, especially if they're an advanced guy, you know, the standard, like, go to bread and butter of a contest prep is going to be test trend mass, or test trend pre-mo. Generally for me, it would be test trend mass. And then if we wanted to add something as we closed in, and then, and then, though for me, those are staggered in as we get closer, if we wanted to use one stroke, it would be in that last four weeks or under, but we're already doing three regularly administering injectables. I don't want to add another injection on top of that. The logistics of that as you're getting close to a show, you've been taking shots for the last 16 weeks, you know, by the time you get to the show, that's, you're going to be a pin cushion, and that and itself, I feel like, yeah, you're going to increase your risk of infections, regardless of it being, you know, more likely to carry bacteria since water is a great medium for growing bacteria compared to its oil-based counterparts, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Oh, 13 weeks in to my first cycle. Let's see what it is running here. Again, or is running, test it 450 plus primo recently lowered from 400 to 200 due to low estrogen at 18 PG per ML. Mid cycle labs are solid, and all markers are in range. I originally planned to run this for 16 weeks, but I'm considering extending it to 20, because everything looks good. I was 320 pounds last year, and as of this morning, I am 199. I'm pushing it to, is pushing it to 20 weeks reasonable for the safety and results standpoint, or does the risk to return at 42 years old shift with bloods, even with bloods looking good? It was on the whole answer, but they do help obviously. Yeah. I'm uncomfortable with the doses in the first instance. 450 test plus 200 primo. Yeah, but it was 400. I mean, so it was on 85th. Yeah. So I'm uncomfortable. For a first cycle. Yeah, I'm uncomfortable with the dose for a first cycle, and I'm uncomfortable with the duration for a first cycle. That's me personally. That doesn't mean it's wrong, just for me. It's like, where'd you go from here? Yeah. So personally, I would have run a short cycle with a much lower dose in, but you know, it's don't what it's done. Without knowing when it's test levels are based on what it's dosing it hard to have any estimation of how good quality the drugs are. And is he getting what he's actually taken? Obviously the primo. Yeah, there's that. If he's got low yeast, and so what would suggest that the primo was genuine at least? But there's no reason for me to say, no, I think you should come off apart from just, I feel for the first cycle, a 20 weeks cycle. With at least half of that being at 800 plus meg, and then the other half being at 600 plus meg, he's excessive. But that's the only reason. These are not showing is anything where I'm thinking all you need to come off because of X, Y, it's ed because it's not there. However, that's his interpretation of blood's being okay. Yeah, that's true. I don't mean any disrespect to the gentleman, but does he know what he's actually looking for? Does he know what things he needs to be looking at to see if there's problems developing? The blood's who I'm sure the drug stress, but as long as that can be factored in by how he feels, he says he feels really good, he says he feels really un-point. So, you know, there's a lot of positives in the sense that he doesn't seem to be having any adverse effects. And then, am I just being boring and sort of know this is what you do? And I wouldn't deviate that one to any certain sense of sort of thing because of, I said so, which is a bit shit. Isn't it? I mean, it's like I've always stuck very well. For me, a long cycle, 16, I know you tend to run a little bit longer with some people. If everything is right, I've never liked them being much longer than that. I do tend to stick around the 10 to 14 mark with a lot being around 12. And I don't like big first cycles because I just feel that if you've done 800 in your first cycle, then what's your second one going to be? And if you've learned what's your third one going to be, and where are you going with this? Yeah, because you're generally going to want to go up next time. On another compound, you know, or whatever. You're going to want to replicate or improve on the previous results. Yeah. And as we know, dosing increases in relation to results increases are not parallel. And if you want to results increase, the dosing increase is going to be significantly more than you expect. So there's loads of factors as to why I'd be wary about that, but on the surface of it, there doesn't seem to be any issues. So he's really down to him. Yeah. Another consideration all throughout there to him is that he was 300 pounds and now he's 199, you know, congratulations first of all. Yeah. And he keeps trends in, you know, that's major, you know what I mean? That said, how long were you 300 pounds for? I've seen it happen a number of times through bodybuilding where there was a guy that maybe spent a good chunk of his life very heavy. And he got into shape and he sees himself now as his healthy fit, you know, 200 pound guy. But that being heavy like that, put stress on your body. And that stress doesn't just go away. Like kind of look at it that, you know, you're already potentially somewhat compromised health wise. And just consider that, you know, moving forward. It would be a shame, I guess. And I had to tell a guy that I work with recently because he's done just that. He was like 300 and I think 318 pounds. And now he's like 186, like, and in great getting into great, great shape. But, you know, now he's also into gear. And now he wants to grow as much muscle as possible. It would be a shame to have gotten into such great shape only to now compromise your health with gear by going too far into it. So they just be as conservative as possible, you know. Yeah, there is an aspect of you're not coming from your potentially not coming from a very healthy position. Yeah, yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying. Not probably going to have fully resolved itself just by the weight loss. I either is an element of time required as well. And you're not giving it that opportunity because what you've replaced from weight, you've got toxicity and stress was of course from weight. It's not going to go as far as my drugs. Rascal comments on the last one he says, so with the shortages would test in an AI be just as good as test in pre-mo. Yes. Ding ding ding ding ding ding. I mean, it's funny because we're coming back to circle to maybe something we've been saying for a long time. Yeah, you're getting I mean, isn't AI going to be great for your health is it great to add any in-sillary listen the fewer in-sillaries you can take in your cycles I think the better. Yeah, I'm going to question you know. Yeah. Well, I feel scenario so I don't know we can't say that these doses are accurate. Okay. 500 megatest. Y

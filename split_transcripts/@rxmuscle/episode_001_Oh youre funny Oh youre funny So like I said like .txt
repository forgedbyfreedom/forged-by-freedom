Oh, you're funny. Oh, you're funny. So like I said, like I said, like I said, do you like my title for the first year? Oh, yeah. Welcome back to Iron League. Jump deep, love out here with Lee. Actually, I think it's, oh wait, Darth Vader. What did you do with Lee? He did a demonetized us with his music. What? Has never demonetized him. How dare you say that? Thanks. You made his friends with the person for his demand. I'm here to put you back on stick. I'll show you more of that. My man, I'm on this bus. I'm not having a second. I'm with you. I will never go as you dive Vader. I'm a Jedi. Shave, it's really me, but we can't release that it's really me yet until Kenny Kayo calls up George Lucas and does an inquiry to find out on the fake Darth Vader. But until then, let's let people believe on the real Darth Vader. Okay. I want to know how Darth Vader had a coffee break. This is very old on Dave. I want to look upon you with my own eyes. Oh wow, he's got the real one I know, that's pretty. Jesus, I still can't see. Oh no, let me, let me wait there my son. It's been a long time since I was your father. I'm going to take my collar off. Ah, that's better. It's lead, please. Who were you? I don't know. I got worse. Hold on. Look at this one. Hold on. Another one, just in case. Oh, I'm going to fall out of my seat. The things I do for Kenny Kayo, I tell you, Dave. The things I do for Kenny Kayo. You're really, you're just a fake Darth Vader. That's what you are. You're fake. Hold on. One year if Kenny went out of business, they were you're me. Hold on. Hold on. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I am not the real robot Danny Jr. Okay. But it's alright. I can. It's my hands, man. What's going on here? Man, man, man. Man. Man. Are you the fake Iron Man or the real one? Oh, no, no. My lighting systems now functions. You've been doing a lot of fake stuff lately. What? This is real. I like it like this. Good. Fake a real wager. That's the question. Kenny Kayo says you use the fake weights. Oh, well. That's pretty cool. Get to the lights up though. Hold on. Let me just do my. What? They're back on. What is the battle mode? Well. I like it. Very nice. Yeah, you can see it. When they've got all the cool toys, you know, that every kid would wish you had. Like on Batman with Jack Nicholson. What is he gets? That's wonderful toys. That's right. That's right. That's right. People don't know that. They were. I don't think Tyler was born when that movie came out. What? The first. The first thing. Yeah. 80s. He was in the morning. He was still swimming in the boat. He was still swimming in his father's bowl sex. Oh, yeah. So, so Kenny Kayo, which is the. You know, he is the obviously the the judge. Oh, no. I know. Kenny. Kenny Kayo is the um. The one that calls out fake fake people fake girls on the butts. Yeah. Fake everything. Kenny Kayo is the one that um. When we're talking about fake isn't Kenny Kayo to one that. Put on 28 pound a muscle in two weeks. Yeah. 28 pound with coach. 28. Tony. Tony. He's 28 pound a muscle in two weeks. And he's got the hide. The say anyone else's fake and bullshit. Come on there. What he should have done was a video because everyone kept sending it. His fake video one did he did and spent hours research. I think the guys just came looking at my fucking bicep. Yeah. Trying to work if this thing's fake or not because he's weird. But I want to see him do a video on how he put 28 pound a muscle on two weeks. But how he lost it all in fucking 12 hours. He took a diabetic. Oh, give me 10,000 dollars. You say it's the proof it's true. Kenny. Keep your 10,000 for food and steroids. You fucking need it. Fuck. So he did just take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Just wouldn't fucking be right. He probably makes more of a the bottom of us with his YouTube channel. I don't know. I don't know because what I looked at it. It'd be not for a while. And he's got like 400,000 subscribers. But he only had like 1500 watch each video compared to Nick put up the video of me doing a Nick was at like 250,000. I think. Same fitness was close to 100,000. So he has already subscribers. But no one watches this shit. So what's that tell you? I don't know. Yeah. Let me let we're talking about is Kenny Kay. I'll put up this video of you doing a like a strict bicep curl with some of your friends. I don't know what's going on. But I didn't want to even trick because when I put up the first time I said it's not strict. Because of my injuries and stuff from stuff like this. But what people felt the sea was. Let you know the secret, the bars real. The collar's a real. The 20. The 20 kilos on each side of real. And the red ones are real. 2.5. I never. I never hit the fact because this is. This is how a rowing a reporter here is. if you go to Sam's fitness where he got the video from and probably from, well, there's probably six videos of me using those red plates on Sam's fitness or I'm curling two of them on each side. I got two red ones and then a black one and I'm doing straight bar curls, then I'm doing reverse curls with it going into a press. So the roving fucking report of Kenny didn't have to go to a far if you really wanted to see them. Well, I think that's where he found his evidence for those from those other videos you had. Now, now someone, he said someone else sent it to you and they said, they didn't even see those videos. I've always, they would have brought him up. Well, they did bring him up. I think it was in his video. They put those videos up. Now, now somebody sent him something saying, oh, this and that, the company makes these fake ones that he went into it and he had the zoom in on that a red one, the show where we scribbled out the point. Rather than just going to the other video where it shows me doing reverse curls with, that would have been 110 kilos or more. That's right. And then like that from revenge. I know you don't give a shit about that. Was that like the sand put you up to that to do some kind of, you know, sensationalistic videos? That way you did it. Wait, look, look, look at my same videos. That's all we do is just riffing into people. And then the whole thing, too, is you see when it comes out even more, the full length is new slash Kenny. I'm wearing a defund immediately at the show. What I'm doing at talking about. Hate news. So what you say is it was taking out a context, you know, and understood the joke because they didn't see the whole video. Is that what you're saying? Exactly. I'm just showing how pathetic the meat area is and you people believe, fucking anything they fucking see on whatever. It's not crazy to how people love to, and because you're about the most authentic person. You're actually too authentic. I tell you this sometimes you're too honest and that's why people get pissed off at some times. But, you know, if anyone's going to pick on anyone is being on, you know, authentic, you're the last person I'm going to go after. Probably would, you know. Oh, well, I just thought I'd get in. I have the final because the first video I ever sent Nick of doing that I just had a five kilo on each side. And I struggled with the five kilo. So I progressed Dave. I progressed a bit since then. And then and then people I said, in that one point that I say I'm going for a world record and I wouldn't do that. Look, if my arm was better, would I maybe because you're in the back in the day, like I said, it will. Jim, I called 300 pounds on a stripe. But it wasn't strict because as I was, because I was going to get ready for Olympia. So when I got through a bad here, you got 300 pounds. I said the lean back just to counter the way back. Exactly. Yeah. No, but I didn't swing it off. I brought a lot of norm would then just let back with it. And that sort of thing. But now, now, it's always going to go for the record and this. But I'm just proving a point that how many other people that they're doing their videos. You can't believe what you're fucking see, babe. Or Jesus fucking Christ. If Trump hasn't taught you anything in life, that is fake news. Hey, but listen, don't get mad at me. People with, you know, what Nick and everybody look, you got 250,000 of more stuff. Keep going up. I fucking made your money. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it's also, I think what's, what's, what's causing? You're not trying to hide you to anything like that. You know, some of these guys, like, if you were trying to like, you know, justify what you did, you would be like, but I think way to know, but you're like, I don't give a fuck. You know, here, this is the way it goes. Let me just say it, but I lost it in a half or more same, and I've been sitting back having a good fucking life. I was gonna, I'll imagine you probably wouldn't do here. And when I saw Kenny's, that just popped it off the way he went into the hole. Fucking, you know, this was almost like a round. I opened up fucking alcohol, a pound's bolt. Yeah, it was a round of people who even don't, we thought, a rather rare idea to show where he was going to open crack open the secret vault of alcohol. And it was like a, our special to wait to the very end when they actually opened the vault, but there was nothing in there, right? Yeah, I was empty. Oh, oh. Look at why Kenny's going into that he's doing, you know, so I just such told me, and then I went to the site and then I did this and then I did that and I was like, well, he even figured out why he even figured out the rationale, why you didn't try to break the record with the fake weights because he figured that then if you broke the record, more people would screw it nice in the record with what you did, the left. So you thought you were trying to purposely, not if I was going to break the record, I would have done it properly and actually look, people on the secret, if I do go to do it properly, I'll do an unedited video of me weighing each plate, putting it on this scale, but then you're going to get the people go, well, I've seen him in a movie is what I can catch you, have you got to win them at a what way you do? No, unless someone's in there. Kenny's pay, oh, say he's going to fly out to you and then in Australia and then witness it and then you're going to give you $10,000. I thought would I let him in as you got a criminal record? He probably come out for the, he'll probably come out for the game, mighty girl. I think that's in January, February, Kenny. So you can come out and show that body that you built. I don't like the promote stuff and I don't promote anything really, but apart from supplements and whatever, and these show and stuff. Well, now you can have it to challenge that. He put it out there, Tango ran if you can do the weight for real. You think would you start maybe practicing now and really do the weight, you've done it before. I have to work on the strength here because even when I did that, cause this side takes most of the weight sort of a lock side of thing. It's almost like you go to squat and you've got the bar a bit crooked and all the weight seems to be on one side. So it feels a bit weird if I do anything like that. But well, the last time I properly cooled outside here, I had a 28 side of 10 and a 5 on an easy cool bar. And I asked me what that is. That's a 20 35 kilo each side plus the 10 kilo bar. So that's 70 80 about 80 85 kilos I did out here at home. But that wasn't strict. That's just doing normal cool. That's a nice 7 pounds. That's pretty close to 2.10. Yeah, so that's what I did properly. And my friends at training with me can validate that. But yeah, if in a 14 gram would I probably go for at least 20 in case I did get injured. You know, yeah, you only got to go one rep though. So right, you only have to do it once. Yeah, but still, he takes one rep to fucking, you know, I took me one second when I pulled the two there at the box to tear the 10 that off my shoulders. That's true. But then again, 10 grand is 10 grand, you know, you like to do those crazy lifts anyway. So really, but I've never done one obviously. I've always in all my training for out my years. I've never done a PB on anything of always. I was always on the impression if I can't get six reps. I'm not going to try it. Maybe at least everything was five, but I was never a four rep tree rep go for a personal best of one. I always had to do at least six repetitions before. I think you can do it. I think two 10 is doable for you. Hey, look, it doesn't matter. When you still got fucking 21. He jumps. You're getting 80. He's not in now. Hey, Kenny. Fucking Kenny. This is real. No fucking oil. Go investigate the oil in people's fuck. Hold on. I think I see a simple markedair. I see a zoom in. Let's zoom in on that. I don't know if I'm right there. Lights are a bit bright, but fucking hell. Look at that different. I'm fucking alums the Olympia. Fuck, I think I'm going to be ready. I think you can. He's going to have a forensic expert analyze that arm now to see if there's any kind of marks there. I'm by the way, Kenny. This shirt here. I got from Rebels Sporting Shop. It's actually as the true underarm is sure. It's not a knockoff from piloting. Oh, yeah. I've got to say big thank you to VP. Thank you to Cardillo. He sent me a belt. You sure that's out of faith? Did you burn that on there yourself? Hold on. Let me read the tank. I heard you're a leather tanner now. Is that true? I did. I was from Cardillo. 1,800, 272. Built. That's the style. I'm going to show you what's on it here. I'm here. It's got a machine gun and bullets. All right. And on here it has me. That's pretty good. And then me. And then oh. Me. Oh, the Punisher. The Punisher and me. And on the inside it has the Punisher. Wow. Did you have that made? Did he say send that to you? He made it for me. And then it says banged and then the Punisher. Yeah. But it says on the back it says banged. Lee priest. I did it my way. And then just a couple of pictures of me. Me flipping off the bird. So thank you very much. It is real leather Kenny. It's not our streets leather or fucking whatever you want to call it. It's a. Actually I had to measure my a tell you my waist didn't I because I scared to measure it. Go as early. I need your waist size and what is it? I can't remember. I can't remember the last time I measured my waist. So what do you think it is? 32. Are your clothes. It was just on 33. That's not bad for an old man. That's great. That's great. It used to be 29 when I was competing and that was with a real tape measure. Kenny, not a fake one too. You know what the point is? I actually like most of Kenny's videos. They're pretty good. And this is actually sad thing is so. The sad thing is the last time I even thought of Kenny or saw Kenny was on that huge doctor Tony huge document where they were all shooting up their insulin in the restaurants and taking their gear. And from the beginning of the show that ended it I couldn't see any difference. I knew that fucking Paul Paul Zach was going to die or something. And then the other guy could have could have trained because his shoulders were too sore from all the fucking injections. And the other guy had a towel on his head. He's like, he's just the train today. And he's breathing like this and stuff. That's like, Jesus. And then he goes, and Kenny's put on this much muscle and I'm thinking, he looks the fucking same. It's almost like if you had a pile of steam and dog shit and it's like brown, steam and hot and then a week later you got the pile of dog shit. But now it's white. But it's still the same dog shit. That was like Kenny in the beginning video. He was fucking red and shit from taking all the injections or whatever. And at the end of the video, he was still the same shit Kenny. But now he was pale. So it's just like a piece of dog shit that just changed color. But the shit was still what it's saying. So I've got analysis of the movie. Thank you. It's only the priest can do it. That's for sure. So to reiterate, will you be taking Kenny up on his $10,000 challenge or no? If I'm, I get a bit better. Yeah, I might, but that's a thing to the injury. When I watch it to you guys, I do not believe Lee did this with his injury type thing. Can you was talking like the injury was just yesterday? Yeah. Kenny, the car accident was five and a half years ago. But the injury problem is just due to that nerve being crushed. I've only got half the strength on one side. So I'd have to try and work out it because as I said, the hardest bit is when you're lifting all the weight goes to this side. It's like if I do back now and I'm doing a pull down. Most things I have to do, I have to do single. Maybe I have to try to do a stripped dumbbell, because I can put a hundred key on this hand. I'll put a 80 key on this hand and a 60 key on this hand. But if I do a pull down like this, the bar goes, er, this pulls more. So I've got to try and do isolated, you know, isolated type shit. Anything that's joined on a bar, this will just go. Right. What's the, what's the, what's the topic of today? Kenny Kio. The top it was does Lee Priest lift fake weights and the answer you gave us is yes, you did lift fake weights and was this sensationalist. We can't say it was all fake. It was half an hour. But again, it wasn't, it wasn't two ten. But they can't put the, yeah. But Kenny is doubting your act, your, is doubting your, and I think you can do it. I think you can do the 10 grand. When did I get it? Back in my hey day when I was young, I did it the 300, 35 whatever it was. It was, there was the smallest straight bar at World Gym on the balcony. What's the smallest straight bar? Wait, 10, 15 kilos back then. There's, you know, the smaller, they had the free 20s. And then there was a five on each hand. So that was it, and it was there. Like I said, Eddie threw me the fuck off because I've had my wrist straps on. I think I've told you, just putting the wrist straps on, I'm just picture in it. Joe Golds got his head out the window. Come on, if that thought you come with that boy. And then, I'm wrapping, you know, because Joe Golds got a name for everybody. Even in shape, I was fat boy. So I'm wrapping on, I'm pictureing in my mind, you know, just picture it. You got a focus. There's a couple of other people there. Steve, the long here. I remember Steve, he did the drawings to a lot of stuff. It looked like a tall Viking guy. I think it is last name. But these are one I'm trying to track down for the photos. Just see took the photos. And here I'm psyching up. I'm about to lift it. And he just walks over. So I put his hand on my arm and go, he's Lee. Don't teet your bicep. So I'm like fuck, they're fucking unwrap the fucking straps and standing there. Go, thanks, Eddie. I didn't even have that fucking image you might. Yeah, yeah, you're trying to like focus. Yeah. They're all at now. Well, I see these fucking bicep coming off my house. I'm just going to never find minutes to try and get that image out of my head. And then take take two. Yeah, just put his hand on my arm and go, Lee, don't teet my stuff. And then stick my arm back. Eddie. Yeah, but the whole thing like I said, it's like the only had to go to Sam's fitness room, muck it around with those plates before. So there wasn't an end-depth thing, but there's mainly just the proof how to media and people believe anything they see. And half of these other people do encourage unambilip. Yeah, we have a time I used fake weights. I think was in my life was Robert Reef. Remember after while and people get injured doing photoshoot sort of time? Yeah, well, because they sound you. Chris, I'm glad you had the fake weights too. Yeah, I didn't really use them with him, but it's mainly Robert Reef. And yeah, maybe because he had those dumbbells that look like they were probably 160 pounds with downy weight, like 20 pounds in a single curl with them. Then he had those 20 kilo ones that were metal, but they probably weighed five pounds each. Yeah, well, that's because for photoshoot because people don't want to get hurt during photoshoot. Yeah, well, not good. Remember Chris Lung, Chris Lung, you didn't give a shit. You put the fucking real weight on. No, he would never really. Yeah, yeah. He was three. And that was like two weeks before a contest, you'd have a photo shoot with Chris Lung. We're doing legs and sadly, remember he had hooks when he told both his fucking cords doing that. Remember the worst thing with Chris was you'd want to heavyweight, which was great for the photos, but the thing with Chris was like I remember once I was doing squats. So you got no shirt on which I don't know why he's squatting around a shirt. And you got oil, you got oil all over here, so the bar is slippery. And you just start going down with five plates. Or magic, hold it there. Hold it there. Go a bit deeper, go a bit deeper, hold it there, hold it there. After what I said, look Chris, I can't fuck you know, if you hold and stuff and hold and stuff, and if you're heavyweight, that's fucking, even doing dumbbells, it's like, even just holding it. Yeah, it's a good idea. You're asking for trouble. The funny thing with the jump here was able to do the weight. It was an easy squat for him, but the problem was he had ready, he arranged finished the photo shoot. He was leaving the gym and and lung wanted to do a couple more shots. He had already cooled down and everything like that. That's why he'd score his quads. And nothing, he said the weight wasn't a problem. It was a lot of weight for a normal person, but at the end he was squatting that easy, you know. Yeah, but the thing was, I said, just say the Chris listen, I'll use a weight that's heavy, but what I'm going to do is I'll just do the reps at a nice slow pace. And as I'm doing the reps at a nice slow pace, you just put you little fucking finger on that button and start going. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to say, even if you hold it at the bottom for like even three seconds, hold it, and then push halfway, hold it, hold it after what you're like, there's nothing left to push it. Yeah, I thought that sort of so that was it, but then they as I said after a few injuries happened, they brought out the fake ones, but the thing with the fake ones, I'll zoom it up a refold say, okay, Lee grab it now, you know, similar to Tom Platskart. It's like, I can't fake that it's like, you got to act at me. Every time I did it, he's like, Lee, you look like your laughing or something like that. Like give me a real fucking weight. And so it actually shows me that I'm struggling, you know, but I'll be like, he's like, you look like your laughing again. So if you were, if you were one and you wouldn't be able to fake an orgasm, basically, you'd not get access. Is what you said? No, I wouldn't. No, I would be able to fake that. Now, and who'd want you? It's like Jesus, who's on a fake and all guys in this life? Yeah, but to me it's like, you know, everything's a contest day, it's like you just get as long as you get your stay that sort of matters. That's what matters. You guys sucked into the whole thing. I don't even know how you got sucked into trying to do this whole trick rep thing. I didn't get stuck, you know, I'm just showing people how it done. That was, that's why my first video I did do on five. My very first video I sent the Nick Ditty put up was me struggling. I mean, struggling with five kilos inside. I mean, I got the bar and I'm leaning back and a little bit in the bars going sideways. So I just thought I'd just show how pathetic it is because it's getting old people. It's like, everyone now's just doing these stupid strict curls and this and that is like, really? You know, this is getting Nick. He's got a big far, I see, he creates these weird like, I guess I'm going to put on a natural fucking strict curl contest. What are we going to do? What's people doing these strict curls in their garage? It's got to be in the same place that the same time as the other people because otherwise it's not a contest, you know. And it's got to be like I said, I had my bar against a poll type thing because the wars had stuff on, I'm so it's like, too. And then it's got to be the exact same war that everybody can be caught in the back against the exact same war. And then, you know, like I said, and then do you go by, because I noticed something when they lean against the wall, do you know, you make the heavy heels against the wall or how far can you feed me? Because some people have their feet down here like that. Yeah, that's your elbow. I'm up and down, twisted around. Elbow shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes, heads, shoulders, knees and toes. Yeah, so if they kid how far do you put your feet out? It's like, some people have the feet right out, so even that, against the wall, it's like the sort of leaning a bit than some are standing straight like that. There's so many rules we've got to look at here before we have these contests going on for people. It's like, you know, but anything, I've got enough. So you were making a political statement about how ridiculous you felt the kind that's was. And just to hold how people believe shit, everything they see online, they're like, oh, wow, look at him doing that. It's like I said, did the fun, the media shirt should have sort of been the first question of any tip. So people have to when when Lee priest has to have to always look for the clues to get the true message behind what he's doing. It's always a metaphor behind what you're doing. Exactly. But I said, if you look at Sam's fitness videos, I've never been serious in them once. You know, even when I talked about that whole the secret to bodybuilding is when you're ejaculating, you get the coming, you're rubbing on the muscle. Larfo, Larfo, you want people actually wrote in asking is this true. And this, I told him, I told him in a serious face like this, you have to do it straight after training, because once you've done your training workout, that's when your body, you know, really produces a lot of testosterone. So I said, it's highest point. So 10 minutes after your workout, you need to go and get a change, or you reject your leg. And cause your warm, the cause of your skin, the, you're rubbing into the muscle. I said, but this secret has never come out day because cause you imagine if all the top coat coaches and bodybuilders like me was training a young boy. And I said, you got to ejaculate and rub it on your muscle. He'd go home and tell his parents, and I'd be charged, he's been a purifier. I said, they're close. The closest the secret ever come to getting out was in pumping iron. When Arnold said, the feeling of the pump is like coming, I'm coming all the time, I'm coming at home, I'm coming in the gym. That was the first time the secret was almost released about this transdermal semen, indenomussel, you know, anabolic effects. But you know, if you're watching those videos, you can see, but if I ever was the breaker record, I'd make sure I had people like you there, or people that had no, had no ties to me whatsoever who would be like, what is, Lee's mate, of course, are going to say he didn't blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, he's willing to come out, so we'll get him out there. He seems to be the official validator of the industry. He's like the referee of referees, though. Well, hack and we trust team. That's a guy that's hit he put on 28 pound the muscle. Yeah, he's stuck on the stomach. Yeah. Well, he was put up to tank grand, so, you know, he's going to make sure you did it right. Really? Do you think Kenny, Kenny, look, look, they're why he looks and stuff. Do you really think he's stuck gutting grand? I think he makes a lot of money, but his YouTube channel, I think I got it. I was given it the charity. He's given it to you. If you can do the two of it. I like to see Kenny with the girlfriend. I think that's what he's lacking. Is he going to go for a never-save him with the girl? You can ask him when he comes out there to make sure maybe there's a 210 pound trick girl. Maybe we should look into that. Does Kenny have a girlfriend? Or boyfriend? Do you stay in age? It doesn't matter, so. Maybe he's afraid that you're still a, or her away. I did after the last, I don't know how he's because I'm up thinking of boyfriends all the for some Steve fucking popped into my head, but I did after the last hit that video. I was the sitting by the tool and then they incorporated the puppets and that whoever did that, that was pretty nice. That was my sugar daddy is something or another. You got that video handy? Tyler? How about that? Tyler? I'm an aminoide. C-B-D. What was he? At permitted then when I first looked at him, I was like, oh, I'm playing it. Get the other one. I don't like the one that I saw. Get the one with the CB2. There he is. 22 billion in 2022. High-pot CB-D is way ahead of the science. Latest research shows that CB-D could lower dopamine in the brain and may inhibit long-term brain and race-based dopamine more than a month.

Until next time, remember knowledge is knowledge. Wow. Power. I'll age his about. When I first saw the guy sitting on the pool first, I thought, wow, that guy is really impersonating Steve. I thought it wasn't impersonating him. I'm gonna be like, oh, he's not really Steve, and he's sure enough. And he's sitting there. Oh my god. This is like, he's fucking, someone got left behind on fucking Epstein's eye. And then he's fucking fucking sitting there by himself. When's the Clinton's coming back to get me? I feel like I'm back.

You gotta come back. Jesus, I need to feed the women up inside. I'm really gonna go to school soon. Let's go and on. Oh my god. What's with the shirt off? And then the other one, I was just like, oh my god. What's pretty good for guy 70 years old? Oh my god. Oh, I thought it was a lease. Was he, I'm looking at his recent videos on it? I think it was a reason though that they can have a dab of dial one year. CB-D, you know, the hottest news in town. That's the new one. But he's just discovered CB-D, you know, whatever the latest fan is, he's gotta go out CB-D always been out for a long time, but I guess like I said, newsy slogan, Did he Island Epstein Island?

Hey Brian Hillbrown with our Exams of that calm. So selling our took a couple days of hard and before we came to the Big Olivia Weekend to hear in Vegas and we're staying at a really cool joint called River's boutique hotel. Look crispy this morning, sorry. We give her a couple days just to hang out and relax. Have a couple cocktails and sit pooled, saying unfortunately it's been a little rainy at the time of your story. So I have an out-of-the-all-up pool time but it's been a great time. The rumor staying in is called the Swayer Suites and we were upgraded to this room not quite sure why because the hotel is reasonably empty. Straight out vintage 80s porn room, vinyl furniture, vinyl pillows, the baddest super comfortable on one bus and it just like that had a long time. So let's call this a stay-of-the-steel fridge which is super important to store cocktails which we have several hours. Now I'm functioning to Chrome bars unfortunately, let me get some salad and do some pole work for me but not a chance things are going to hold up to anybody. We can see the bed. Actually, it used to be comfy and a bed, I was a little bit angry. Again, what I was talking about, we are late with the course and up there. There was a couple air brushing things around and I'll show you another one of the bathroom in a minute. The vinyl furniture is got the black sparkly basketball kind of thing going on. The vinyl pillow is super cool. Really good. And it's stepping outside here to the one eye, nice comfy places to lay down. Great poultry is poolside. Kind of quite a few girls out there today, but not too many. It's kind of a nice day. I'm finally getting a little warm and sunshine. They're 60 inch on the wall, it's always important. My favorite part, by far my favorite room in the house. The bathroom, this is the bathroom later on. Again, we have that vinyl sparkly basketball furniture going. Another plows moment. Sir, what did you put on? What's that? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. The favorite part is this. A little walk through shower. Dual heads, super comfy, toasty warm, beautiful black vinyl, little slippery though. We have found that out the heart actually. And then I come up the other side. They see it's nice and clean and very well-appointed. The toilet I think was a bit of an afterthought. It's buried in the corner over here, which is a really fun convention. I'd very excited back there. But we made it work. Anyway, here we are. We're going to start the rumors boutique hotel. And lots of things about it if you have an opportunity to come stay here. It's cross street from her rock cafe. Her rock hotel is all right. If you have a chance from stay, awesome place. We're going to bring the thumbs up right in hell. We're going to throw our explosive out.

I think we have it. Oh yeah, yeah. In my performance ofâmity, I think we have this. Anyways, I will show with BLM!! The work of our team. And have a unique childhood life in our country. Honestly, I'm sorryBarara Sharipay's Our We are what we have determination of We're going to be a big hit. We're going to be a big hit. Brian held a band with our ex muscle dot com. Here with American Strongman superstar and the hero of the Olympia weekend, Mr. Brady Baki, how old are you Brady? And who made your implement that you pressed earlier? My dad. Who's your dad? Does he lift a lot of heavy weight too? When you guys train together, who trains heavier? You or your dad? That's I'm going heavier on something. My dad thinks if you're me. I'm quite certain that you push your father as far as possible every time you guys work together. But what grade are you in? Um, fifth grade. You're five years old. You're in kindergarten, correct? Nice. Have any girlfriends? Yeah. You have more than one girlfriend? Yes, this has two girlfriends. Oh, two girlfriends. Brian, where are you? Where are these? He talks about a brand a bit, but I don't know about the other one. Good. That's secret, I guess. Is this right in the family? Yeah. Where's Jennifer? She's competing in bikinis, so you know, maybe she'll be another girlfriend in line over there. Well, terrific. Brady will really proud of you. Thank you very much. Nice job today. And Ryan, thank you. Awesome. Awesome display. You are the new superstar in American Strongman. Don't you forget it. Until next time, Brian, held a brand of RxMuscle.com. Thank you.

We're in hell to grab with our XM also.com and Mike Johnson, a huge Olympia weekend. Absolutely fan, absolutely fantastic production. Not a hitch, nothing problem, no broken equipment, no issues at all. Hey, we don't do broken equipment in American Strongman. I'll tell you what, we use big dog strong equipment. There are exclusive equipment manufacturer. They take real good care of us. This stuff is top notch top quality. So we usually don't run into issues like that. But always the second day goes smoother than the first. You get all your hitches out of the way on day one and then day two it runs right through and these athletes were absolutely amazing today. Some amazing performance today. And now we had Mike Coruso three event wins but it wasn't enough to bring them to the top. I'll tell you what, this is his first contest competing as a pro. But he did not let that big stage bother him. It didn't affect his performance at all. He knew what he had to do and he went out there and he did it. And Mike looked terrific. Tom McClure, pros and 2,000, five, a horse of a man. Tom McClure is absolutely a monster and you talk about the split between Mike Coruso and Tom McClure, a half-point difference between second and third place. I mean they just fought for position all day long. And today Mike Coruso snuck in there, half a point victory took second place over McClure as third. Now our winner who took third at the Arnold Strongman, amateur last year to win his pro card took third behind Travis Ormire, Dave Osselen at America's strongest man. And Hock's Prince Ormire this year comes in with redemption today. Are you kidding me? And actually it was this year, 2011 amateur Strongman World Championship at the Arnold. He took third on the big stage earned his pro card as a top-facing American. His first pro show, like you said, America's strongest man, he finishes third. His second pro show, he comes out here to Vegas and he wipes the floor with everybody. I mean, five point differential between second and third. He really, really, really nailed it down. I'll tell you what though. It's kind of reminiscent of what happened in 2009. The first inaugural Olympia's strongest man, Andy Vincent did the same thing. Ernest Pro card in Orlando came into America's strongest man, finished third. Olympia and wins the whole deal. Close race, he had back in 2009 when Vincent, with Van Hatfield, a Michael Burke, shot the door on the competition today. And I tell you what really did it for him. His overhead pressing has improved tremendously. He looks strong at America's strongest man. He's with the opening axle. But here today, he just flew through that meddling. Oh yeah, he was much better with that today. Little trouble on the O'Ket and started today, but he really cleaned up. To work on his course, strength a little bit, I was talking to him, get his deadlift up where it needs to be. But this guy really doesn't have a chink in the armor. He doesn't get a zero. He's got tremendous grip strength. His overhead first, tallazies. And frankly, he's pretty lean guy. He's got to be six foot five. He's not a 390 pound guy at all. So he's got plenty of room to fill out and gain some more muscle. And he's got to go in the next season, strong and confident. And he's got endurance and gas to get him through those events where some of the other guys struggled, especially with the cardio related events. Oh yeah, the suicide medley is the test of everything that you have. 90 seconds of hell. And you see a lot of these guys didn't finish, but they were pulling for a full 90 seconds to try to get that done. Mike Burke lives in Colorado. It's got to be to his advantage to have that high altitude training on a daily basis. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Mike, thank you very much. We're going to see you again. I'm not sure what I'm going to see you again, actually. Well, hopefully you're going to come out to the 2011 North American Strongman Amateur National Championships. Also, we're going to have the 105 kilogram light, light, strongman pro championship and America Strongest Woman in Tunica, Mississippi coming up the first weekend in November. I guess I'm going to see you the first weekend in November then at the NAS event. Mike, thanks again for having us. We absolutely enjoyed being here this weekend. Glad we could help spread the word of what you guys do. It's a great partnership and really look forward to working with you again. It was my pleasure. Thanks for coming out. And again, MHP Olympia Strongman challenged huge weekend. It's finally winding down. The booths are starting to close and we're tired. It's been a long weekend. Until next time, until November, Brian Holibrand with ourXMuscle.com.

. Brian Elderbrain with all right muscle.com. Here at the huge Olympia weekend in Vegas. My carousel turned pro-lastry in August in Dallas. This first show since then and absolutely smokes 410 pounds on the log press. Thanks Brian. Appreciate it. Yeah. It felt good today and when I pretty easy I was about I didn't have to do 420 dollars. I was getting kind of tired. Tom McClure picked up the 390 and strict pressed it. Like I've never seen before and I thought I'm not sure he was going to have it. You picked up the 410 made it look easy. It was really nice lift. Yeah. Tom's an animal. I thought he was going to get it for sure. That's why I was getting ready for 420 but I'm glad it didn't have to do it. Good. All right. Well, hopefully we'll see you again here in the winter circle. Over the next couple of rounds. Good luck with the medley that's coming up next. Until the next time, Brian Elderbrain with all right muscle.com.

We're going to be back. Brian Hilderbrand with our XMuscle.com here. Quick wrap up video of tonight's events for events Mike and Scott Weech right out of the whole sets of record. I know on the second attempt he breaks the American record, Derek Poundstone, former record of 414 pounds, the 423 pound axle cleaning press was absolutely amazing. He was a little hampt after that. He's jumping up and down like a schoolboy. I think he had way more in the tank too. I think he probably could have gone higher, but you know, second attempt he doesn't have to take a third, saves himself a little strategy there. He won his pro card back in 2009. So he's got a couple of years on. He's kind of a veteran now sort of getting to figure out how things work. And the second attempt, the yolk and the Harley drag pull, Travis steps up and had some quick feet and looks really good. All those medley type events are absolutely awesome for Travis. I mean he's so long and lean, but he's in the best shape of his life coming in. Like 295 pounds are so hard. He's doing Nathan Payton's diet, Nathan Payton of RX muscle. He's been working with him for a number of years, kind of lost a lot of weight there for a while, but now he's kind of solidifying it and bringing it back. Travis looks absolutely amazing, but he absolutely blasted that. And that was a very heavy sled pole. And on these slick surfaces too, kind of hard to get a footing, but definitely a thousand pounds sled there. Yeah. Absolutely. They had great feet, which is a key to that event. It's keeping the feet and keeping the momentum. Now the third event, newcomer, first pro show, Michael Burke, steps up, had a little bit unorthodox grip and nailed it. Yeah, his grip was definitely different from everybody. Michael Burke remember though, he's from Colorado, training in that high altitude. You know, air is not so much of a factor for him, but absolutely he comes in third at the amateur world championship at the Arnold. You know, on the big stage for the first time, his first pro show, America Strongest Man, it doesn't look even look like it faced him. It's like he was walking through the park out there. Absolutely. Great feet. Just kept going and going. Remember, our fourth event, the wheelbarrow with that Chevy truck tonight, the winch or the hitch of the back looks like a ticket of beating. Oh, yeah, the piece of equipment that Big Dog Strong made, that was holding up, but the actual physical, you know, the receiving hitch, it just, I don't think it was up to the task, but I'll tell you what, Alan Tilary, they did a really big favor for us. They put that on a brand new truck, they put that hitch on for us so we could get that event done. But you know, that, that Colorado, we even had the hold up the suspension because some of these guys that was just those tires were hanging down, but absolutely amazing. That was probably, I don't know, 800 pounds, 750 in hand. And at the last minute, we made a last minute decision to allow the guys to use straps and still it was testing their grip. Those handles were coming right out of their hands. Yeah, the lots of wraps, lots of straps popping off for sure. A little bit of a scary moment when Dave Oslo took a tumble and we heard a well, allowed the truck thought he took his head into the tailgate. Yeah, he's a veteran, you know, no side of recovery for something like that. But yeah, it's always scary when somebody goes down or gets injured or something you never want to see it to shows. And you try to do some events or a little bit on Orthodox. I mean, it is odd lifting and strong man. It's not supposed to be in the box. It's always supposed to be out of the box. So it's the risk you take, you know, a couple little mishaps on this event, but all in all, really a crowd favorite, I think. And again, the veteran Travis Ormire, he puts it together. 29 seconds, absolutely a mate. Yeah, he was seven or eight seconds ahead of second place. Ryan Bracewell having a great night tonight from our ex-Muscle. He was a little skeptical. He took essentially last last year. And he was really looking forward to this. He's strong and he's looked terrific so far. Oh, absolutely. And he's celebrating. He loves the crowd. He loves the attention. I mean, he's at the biggest moment of his life already this year with the birth of his kid and everything. You know, so this is just gravy for him. And one of heck of a performance. He's a first guy to finish that incredible wheelbarrow. So I mean, just a great accolades to him. And so Travis is our leader going after four events going into tomorrow. We'll be back here at 12 starting at 1 o'clock. And we've got four more events tomorrow. We've got the cake toss for height. We have the Atlas stones. What else do we have? Tomorrow we have the, actually it's a cake toss, medley. 16 feet, they'll throw over eight cakes, a cocoa beverage, cake toss. And following that, we have the push pull medley. That's a new one that we're adding this year. One of our state chairman Ashley worked from Texas, kind of developed that. And that's a combination of events where the guys will actually be pressing overhead and deadlifting. So they'll go five implements. They'll have to press a 200 pound dumbbell. And then they'll move to a 675 pound axle deadlift. Then they'll move on to a 330 pound axle clean and press. And then to a 715 pound deadlift. And finally a 340 pound log clean and press. And then we'll move right into the Alan Tillery Chevy Cruz car picking hold. That's a favorite. They really just test all of your body, your grip strength and just your will and determination. We'll have two cars and sort of have the guys facing each other. So that should be a really a crowd favorite too. And then finally of course the American Strongman Atlas stones. The quintessential event for every strong man show and the around the world. Really looking forward to bringing this back to you tomorrow. Mike thinks for your time and just an absolutely amazing day. We got an American record, a ton of PRs and really no problems or issues at all today. No real injuries. Everybody's going home safe. We think the fans enjoyed it. And I mean really just these guys get out here. See all the little kids running up to the gate. Just an amazing, amazing day. And thank you guys for being out here covering. I appreciate your time. No absolutely thanks for having us. And again, here with Mike Johnston of the American Strongman Corporation who put on American Strongman's tonight, there's 2,011. Until tomorrow, Brian Hilderbrand with ourXMuscle.com.

I've been stuffed in your pocket for the last hundred days. When I don't get my bad, I take it out on the sleeves. As soon as I sum your baby, they're full of ball on the hill. I'll polish them rockets down and swallow those pills and say, oh. Space lo and muggle muggle. There's a car in the sea, or now it'll be a collar in the flame. With two doors to cheap, no respect, only one there's your name. You've been drinking my blood, well I've been making your wounds. Well I shave off the pitch now in a scopa Yorking. You'll see my heart. Space lo and muggle muggle. Come. Snow falling above a wave, a drizzle of love tosquaredверs of love. I breathe from life to the sea with notable worth.

Brian Hilderbrand, our exp muscle.com, wrapping up the 2011 American Strongest Man in Hot Springs, and I'm here with Dion and Mike, and let me tell you the both of you, an absolutely awesome show with some terrific performances Mike. Tell me your thoughts on the first day. I mean, the first day was very exciting. There's always a couple of kinks when you get out there the first time, but the staff was amazing, worked very hard, and the athletes were very impressive. A rare of the gate, Scott Weech, I mean, just hammers up, breaks the American record. You know, that kind of set the stage for the rest of the night, and then closing with that Colorado pick. It was just almost an impossible event, but just to see the strain on the guys' faces and watch the crowds where to get behind them. I mean, it's really awesome to see the emotion that the competitors have when the crowd shares that emotion and they get involved in it too. I mean, that's really what it's all about. It seems to elevate the athlete too. Another psychological level to keep them in the event. Oh, absolutely. Some of these guys, you know, you take particularly somebody like Travis Ortonmire. I mean, they actually feed off the energy from the crowd. You know, Brad Duns, another one, he gets out there, the crowd gets excited to see him. You know, it's maybe not always the biggest strongness athlete, but the fans are really receptive to the people out there and the personalities. And I think it really makes it worth everybody's time and effort to put this kind of thing together, to entertain the folks and for those guys to have that moment in the spotlight. It really does seem to benefit everybody. Yeah, absolutely. So, Dia, not to keep you out of this, but today, today was kind of quick. We went through this real fast today and under four hours, I think, give me your impressions about the events today. Well, like my just to reiterate what Mike said, you know, we tried to move events this year. So, events that you've never saw in person a lot, or even indoors such as the cake over the bar. We're the first people to do it. I think you gotta start sending it a lot whole lot more. That was impressive for the crowd. Obviously, we want to go probably higher. Higher, higher the next time. The Colorado pick. That was again, a first move for us to do in a contest. So a lot of new events. The athletes love it, the crowd love it. Yeah, the push-pull medley. A lot of the athletes were like, well, I'm really looking forward to this. And when they finished it, they were like, what the hell just happened? You know who was weak on what event? You know who was strong, who was the day-boss and as a veteran, obviously in the sport. And it showed on the push-fillment. Yeah, absolutely. It was a terrific day. And then Travis and Dave Oslin, in the last event, the Atlas stones. Travis was in an early lead. He was in a lead of the fourth stone. Tell me what happened with five. Well, I think that maybe Travis might have sensed that he had a wrapped up, and he didn't push himself all that hard. But you can't take anything away from Dave Oslin. He's an amazing stone motor. At six foot 70s got those long arms. As Deon said, I mean, he is one of the veteran strongmen that's still on the circuit. You know, people don't think about it. Dave kind of went to World Strongest Man. You know, early on when the ifs to split happen. But this is a guy that's been hammering it out and growing year after year after year after year. He's amazing deadlift. You know, that kind of experience pays off. But there's Travis right behind him from an experienced standpoint. Both these guys around the world stage. And I would say that they really both deserve to be there. I mean, to me, it proves that they went up against the youngest in America, the best and brightest up in coming. I mean, look who finished in third and fourth the youngest guys. But those veteran movements, those tactics, making sure that everything is just perfect, making sure that you have extra attack. I mean, you watched at the end there, Vince Erbank ran out of attack. He's got the hide. He's got the strength. He's got the leverage to pick up the stones. But he made a rookie move. He made a rookie mistake. Those veteran guys really earned what they got this time. Absolutely outstanding performances by Michael Burke and Vince both. Deon, tell me when what is next for America strongmen, American strongmen, core president. Next for American strongmen, core president and six lead to have the Olympia strongman competition following that. There will be a world competition in China that the athletes will be going to. But not to take away from any any other international events that we haven't really mentioned. Next week, Travis and another athlete, myself will be getting on the plane going to Russia for USA versus Russia. The following week after that, America strongest man is on the road again with the American strongest woman as well as the 105 team championships against the Ukraine. So we'll begin another plane going to the Ukraine. So a lot of things in the store from the American strongmen. I'm reckon up the frequent fire miles. And not to mention two, seven American strongmen and core president athletes will be competing at the world strongmen competition in North Carolina. You know, whether they came through us to get there or not, all those guys all seven of them, Nick Best, Travis Sortmire, Derek Poundstone, Brian Shaw, now David Oslin, Michael Jenkins, and the seventh who am I missing. Oh, Bergman, Jason Bergman. Every single one of those guys was an amateur with North American strongman. Every single one of those guys earned their pro card and they're now competing at the top level and they deserve to be there. However, they got to World Strongman. They absolutely deserve it. But it really just proves once again that the NAS, ASC, the amateur to pro system, it's the best in the world. Bar 9. And I think that that is exemplified by Dave Oslin taking second place behind Travis. Travis already had his invite and now he's been invited. Whether he's an alternate or has a spot in the final group or world strongman, come up next month in North Carolina. No matter what, he's still inviting. Absolutely. And so terrific. Forms is by everything. From a production standpoint, I can tell you, Sally and I have had an absolutely fantastic time. The production value was amazing. And I can't think enough for having us here. And we will see you in six weeks at the Olympia. Appreciate your time. Until then, Brian Helderman with ARXMuscle.com.

Brian Helderman with RXMussel.com. Here in Hot Springs, Arkansas at the 2011 American Strongest Man. I'm here with Mike Johnston, Dion Wessels, the the impetus behind American Strongman Corporation who's presenting today's event. Mike, I know this is the second year in Hot Springs, correct? Oh, that's correct. It's not the second time we had America Strongest Man, but it is our second year here. The crowd was absolutely fabulous last year. The facility is great. The venue is great. The staff has been amazing. You know, so coming back here and bringing our biggest show, the biggest show in America back, you know, just something we had to do. Absolutely. I talked to some locals earlier today and last night at dinner and they said, oh, they had a great time last year. So the folks here in Hot Springs should be packing the stands and making this a fun event. Dianne, I know you've had your work cut out for you. You guys have some really good news this year with the world strongest man, which tells about that. Yes, the winner of this show this year for America Strongest Man will go directly to the world strongest man. Terrific. So these guys actually have an opportunity to progress into that next phase where that relationship has an existed before. So it's really good to see that these guys have an opportunity to make it to the international stage. Now speaking international, there's another show coming up in China. Is that correct? Oh, that's right. It's going to be a team show. So the top three or four guys from this competition were not sure exactly on the logistics yet, but it'll be three or four the top three or four athletes will get an opportunity to compete in China. And so tonight we've got four events. Tell us about the events. First event you're going to see is the max axle press. And that's an iron mine. Excellent. We're set hopefully going to break the record. Currently Derek Pounds down close. That record at four 14 and a half. So hopefully we'll see that record go down tonight. And now that's what the guys are warming up backstage now with the act with the axle. What do we have after the axle Mike? After the axle tonight, we're going to have the what is next is the Yoke. Oh, the Yoke and Harley drag. So it's a lander's Harley Davidson. So they'll have a 950 pound Yoke for 60 feet and then they'll drag a fat boy motorcycle sitting up on a 425 pound sled. So you're maybe looking at a 700 pound drag. They'll drag that back 60 feet. And that'll be followed up by the Hussa felt stone. Big dog strong, Hussa felt stone. 400 pound Hussa felt stone carried as far as you can. And then finally an event that we're really excited about. Alan Tillery Chevrolet, the Chevy Colorado wheelbarrow. That's going to be interesting. They're going to pick up the back end of a Colorado pickup truck and walk it 60 feet. So that'll be a fun one. I assume that's fast as time when that event. Fast as time correct on that. Another some there's some returning names here. Travis are winter last year. Returning again spoke with him earlier. He looks fantastic. He certainly looks healthier than he did earlier this year. He had an issue that he's overcome. So and he had a chance to meet with a number of the guys. You can see those preview videos on our X muscle.com. The muscle central. I want to thank both of you for having us here this weekend. Looking forward to a great weekend. We got four events left tomorrow after this. And we're going to put all this together and hopefully put a good presentation together for you guys at home. This is Brian Heldobrand with ourXmuscle.com.

Brian Hilderbrand with ourXMuscle.com. We're here in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The 2011 America Strongest Man. I'm here with the Great Travis Orton. Brian, I'm Travis, you're already qualified for World Strongest Man. That's correct. Yes. And what brings you here today then? I just want to retain my title. I won here last year and I'm going to take it back again this year. That's pretty sound reasonable. I understand that. You look healthy. It looks like you put some weight on since I saw you at the Arnold. Yeah. I had a known list that finally shook earlier this year. I took about two and a half months off. It actually kicked my butt. I got down about 251 pounds and now I'm 295. I was competing last year. Yeah. No. It's a bit of an ego boost to have somebody else notice you that you put some weight on as a guy in this field. So Travis, you look terrific. I'm looking forward to tonight. Good luck to you. And thanks for your time. Brian Hilderbrand with ourXMuscle.com. I'm here with the much esteemed Brian Brace. Well, the co-incre of the RX Power on ourXMuscle.com. Brian, first congratulations on your new edition of the family. Thank you. That's going to be my excuse when I get last. That's my excuse why I'm doing bad. So I don't even want to keep it going. And keeping it going way too soon. Yeah, not too bad. But we have nights where it's every three hours. And even if I'm not feeding a my get up, you know. And then we have nights where he'll sleep six hours. So it's a hidden miss. So you're wife's not too upset with you that you're sleeping through the night. I'm sure she's not. No, no, I get up. I feed actually I take the feeding it like 3 a.m. Because she has to get up at 5 where I don't get up till 8. So, you know, it's not too bad. I can fall right back. Sleep. So about today's competition. This is your second show. Second one. Third. Third. Third pro show. Yes, yeah. First time doing this show. No, no, this this show last year was my first show and did horrible. Got a second to last in front of a guy who was injured. So it wasn't one of very good showing, but then I kind of redeem myself when we went to the America Strongest Man in Vegas. And against virtually the same competition got six place. So it's just a bad showing. I'm hoping to improve that this year. Absolutely. It's understandable. But it's a pretty interesting field this year to minus the big names that have already qualified for World Strongest Man who are going to be in Poland. Mike Jenkins, Brian Shaw, Jason Bergman, Nick Bass Travis is here, of course. So it's going to be a really great show. Good luck to you tonight. And hopefully we're going to see a few times for interviews after you have already met. Hopefully I do pretty good. Then you want to interview me because I did well. And not just because I, you know, go with our acts. Because we worked together. Brian Hilderman with our acts muscle.com. Brian Hilderman with our acts muscle.com 2011 American Strongest Man in Hot Springs, Arkansas. I'm here with a big Dave Oslin. Dave, you know, you're just coming back in and in and you've done a couple of two-note events. Is that correct? Yeah, I did just a local show in Rochester, Minnesota at the M.A. June. And then we can after that drill up time to hear you. Did another one. So this will be my first big one back. I'm kind of a test to see how you're physically. Yeah, I mean, you know, I've done a lot of this stuff in training with training and competing are two different things. So, you know, I've see how I hold up in this one and hopefully have a good result. Now, when was your last appearance of World's Tournament's been? I was there in 2010 in South Africa. So you'll be able to hopefully you win this. You qualify for 2011 and in North Carolina. Yeah, I'd like to go back to for 2011. I mean, the big picture though I really want to be in shape for next year's for the 2012. So, obviously any time you can go there as a bonus. So that's what I'm working for this year too. Yeah, the exposure is terrific for not only for you as an athlete, but within your community, I can imagine as well. Yeah, that's good. I mean, that's kind of the big one that everyone sees on TV. So, you know, people can't know you because of it. Right. Good. All right. Well, Dave, hopefully we'll see in the winter circle a few times for interviews later today at tomorrow. And the till then is Brian Hill, the brand with the original.com. Here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, 2011 American Strongest Man. I'm here with returning competitors Scott Weeach Scott. You didn't do this competition last year. Two years ago, you were here. How'd you fare then? I did okay. I qualified for the Olympia that year. I'm going to do as I want to. This year I'm coming back. A little bigger stage. I got some really good competitors. Hopefully fair a lot better this year. Yeah, we had interviewed several of them today. Everybody looks terrific. Travis is put some weight on since the Arnoldy looks terrific. Dave, look at the show. And I think it's going to be really good competition. A lot of good athletes here this weekend. Again, considering a missing people like Brian Sean, Mike Jenkins and some of the guys have already qualified. Going into this, what is your favorite event between the eight events that we're doing over the weekend? What do you like to do? I think overhead, I wish we could do eight pressing events, but they just wouldn't have it. So I think the axle will be a really good event for me to start off with. I got to start really strong there. I'll at least the top view. The push pull medalist should be really good. Three pressing events there. Go with stones. Mainly the pressing events that are going to be key for me to do really good on to get the points and those events. Nice. We're looking forward to hopefully seeing winter circle a few times. I get some interviews. I saw you in Orlando at the Europa and the APF. Yeah, the Rally APF. And it had a terrific week. So I expect nothing less this weekend. So good luck to you. And hopefully we'll see in the next few hours in the winter circle. Cool. Alright. Hill to Brand with rxmuscle.com. Here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the 2011 American Strongest Man. I'm here with the ASEs News Pro, Mike Burke. Mike, you took third of the Arnold Amateurs last year. The first overall is an American. Third overall out of 50 sum up competitors internationally. It was a huge showing for a lot of people. It was a huge showing for a lot of people to be an ASE pro. And qualified to come and compete here this weekend. Tell me what specifically looking forward to event-wise here. I don't know. I expect to do pretty good in the who's felt in the Cag's. The axle, I've got a pretty decent axle. So I'm hoping it gets me up there in the points and then just trying maintain and the other stuff. You know, not have a horrible showing. I'm like first showing out though. So, you know. This is a great show. Lots of great history with American strength athletes with pound stone and Fort Miron and Sean and all the other guys that have come through here and done well. I moved on to international competition. So I think this is a great platform for you. Good luck to you. Hopefully we're seeing the winter circle for a few more interviews later tonight and tomorrow. Alright. Thank you. Mike, thank you very much. Brian Helderman with rxmuscle.com.

Brian Hildebrand with OrxMuscle.com. Here with the winners today's second event, the Yoke and Harley Sledpole Travis Orton from my or Travis, 950 pound Yoke is a big pain, how much gas did it take to pull that sled? You know, that was really happy with the Yoke first off. I was probably one of the best runs I've ever had with that. So I saved a lot of energy and the sled actually felt pretty good. You know, it's the secret with that, with a slick floor like this, is to really get a hard start and get the momentum going and fight to keep the momentum, the amount of how bad your legs are burning. Just keep going. I knew you had incredible foot speed in the Yoke and just absolute determination to get through the line, not let that sled stop, which is really a key. Yeah, absolutely. I really had to fight the pain in my leg from that ankle break in my steer, but you suck it up, take the pain and it feels better once you get that first place. Yeah, first place always feels better, right? Always good. All right, well congratulations. Then a good start with the axle today too. How heavy did you go? I got 393, it was should have been my second attempt and I wanted at least 15 pounds more than that, but sometimes you got to take what you can get. So it was a strong press and women heavy today at the axle, which was really great to see for the Americans. Yeah, there was a lot of over 400 attempts and really strong guys, I mean, 363 pounds took last place. So yeah, that says a lot. All right, I'm here again with Travis Sort and my, America's strongest man, 2011 Brian Hilderbrand for rxmuscle.com.

So that comes from Spain from Madrid, we are at the Arnold Classic Europe and behind us the exhibitors for tomorrow's expo are working very busy at the boots and for my good I'm have some some part for the strongest man from Germany, Patrick O'Wing and say a lot to all users. Looking for the top three positions for this contest I guess we got one major favorite for this contest and that's its victim Martinez. The victors are already qualified for the limpio so I'm not sure if all the other guys are very happy about this experience here in this show. What you say that some other guys from Ronnie Rockford, extra Jackson are able to beat him tomorrow. I guess Victor will come and shape then there's no one who could beat him so it depends on the shape, the victors in and if he's in shape no one will beat him. The Spanish country is a very good place for Ronnie Rockford because he won two times here and the last time it was in the spring season so maybe he got some some luck here in the show and can be some kind of dangerous for Victor let's hope so but I think it's very very hard to get the two left tickets for the Olympian in this show so let's went through the competitors who are able to hit the finals tomorrow. I guess Ronnie Rockford is someone who's for sure in the finals. Yeah he's in I guess there's a couple of five guys that are maybe a little bit class for their own so it's Victor it's Texas Jackson of course Rocky maybe Ronnie Rocky yeah we call him Rocky and of course he did it harder and I guess Flex Lewis too. Flex has a very good placing in this spring season this year he placed shirt at the Mr. Europe in the open class if someone from the beer guys have some some some flaws or didn't do his homework tomorrow I guess he's in the spot to catch this place. But I forgot one I forgot Tony Freeman the X-Men of course the X-Men is one of the dangerous guys. You know of course it's one here in the lineup. Yeah he will surely be a eye catcher because most of the guys are quite short so he will be a little bit separated just just because of his height. I guess Flex Lewis will be dangerous if some of the veterans will open the door by being not in shape then Flex can be dangerous for all of them. At the Sheryl Classic in Union we saw quite equal results that we have at the Olympia so we got the Olympia play things and compared in here to the Arnold Classic Europe it might be that way that Victor Martinez is placing prior to Dexter Jackson who placed six to the Olympia who places prior to Tony Freeman who were seven to the Olympia then Ronnie Rocker and then he did that. What means that Ronnie Rocker has a very hard work to do tomorrow to even catch the Olympia qualification. Exactly and there's another point that we have to think about because we're got mainly European judges in this show like we didn't have at the Olympia so the European judges are judging in a whole different way like the rest judges do because the US judges are searching for something special while the European judges are searching for which with us and false in this the main thing where one Rocker is placing high in the Europe and placing low on the US. Yeah exactly I guess the US style of judging seems to be more like looking for eye catchers and here in Europe they are looking just for harmony and symmetry and so on so that's a little bit bit of a different culture of judging. So it's maybe the main reason why Robock felt your COVID from Poland placed first at the Mr. Reo in the spring season and I think he didn't placed any place at the Olympia. So we're looking forward to a very exciting show for tomorrow for the very first Anos Classic Europe show here in Madrid and stay tuned on our ourrschema.com with Patrick and me.

Brian held a brand with our exmuscle.com here with the frame carry and farmers walk medley and your palmers are winter. You just eat down a win over Mike Burke. Yeah by a split second we've had several medley in the last few contests where we've been just tens of a second apart. So you're training in Seattle. There's a big strong man community because Jesse Maroonie being from there and you're training out of a power lifting gym. Yeah mostly a power lifting gym in downtown. So yeah beautiful. It rattles my home and I can understand why you live there because it's a beautiful place. What's the next event? The next event is Conan's wheel. So I've the one we walk in a circle within the crooked arm. So about 800 pounds I understand. I've been told 700 I've been told 800. I'm expecting it to be about 800 in hand. Mike brought it up earlier. He said it was going to be about the girls from MHP coming over about 800 pounds. So he said it is a 1-800 pound girl or several girls are going to equally 800. I honestly don't have an answer to that. I assume I think they were going to have a motorcycle before it didn't fit. So they're just loading a bunch of random weights and bricks and cakes in there. We'll see what happens. Throw girls on their make-and-event. Those are going to sit on top of their way. So we'll find out. Perfect. Good luck next in the next event. Until then, Brian Hill, the Brand with ourXMuscle.com.

This is Dave Palombo with RXMuscle.com. I'm here at the 2011 Mr. Olympia Contest. We are here after the finals where we had an incredible, incredible decision before we get to that. We have Lonnie Tipper from Iron Man Magazine and Chris the technician, Asito here to assess all the action here in Las Vegas, Nevada. Started out with a hookarachid dance in the hotel. We wound up with Phil Heath as the new 13th Mr. Olympia where you happy with that decision. It was a right decision and all three of us won't want Jay Colour and the predictions we did. In the predictions, yeah. And all three of us had Phil Heath ahead last night. Why did Phil Heath win this contest in your estimation? Well, he's just got beautiful shape. Jay came out last night and he just was not at his best to begin with and he's going to have to be at his best to be to kid like Phil Heath. I thought Colour definitely was better than I did. His color was way better than I. But he wouldn't have made a difference. And he had some good makeup on that arm that was all bruised up. You know, and I looked at the arm closer day, but it really to me wasn't that much of a negative when he hit that left by his a pig and still you could didn't affect the muscle, the shape of the muscle. Did you agree with that? That it didn't affect the shape of the muscle. Yeah, yeah. What about the arm? Did the arm detract from his physique? Of course it did. Of course it did. I mean, if I'm sure if you asked probably the most straightforward honest guy in body field and Jay, he would say of course it did. I mean, do you think that Jay actually thinks going into the pre-judging with an arm like that that it's not going to affect the way he either feels or how he's going to pose in a presented. So I mean, did it affect his, you know, the judges? I don't know, did it affect him? Yeah, I did. Did it affect the outcome? No, because if his arm was, you know, perfect, then I think the seal ends. No, he still wins. Yes, with the perfect arm, he still wins. I understand, I don't know what happened to his arm, but he obviously had some kind of a hematoma in there. He bruised it in some way. I heard they had called in Chad Nichols as the expert to try to help them with the bruising. I heard he had suggested they apply he to it, which obviously anyone who knows whenever you have a contusion or kind of hematoma, you want to apply ice to that to detract it. But I think Jay did the smart thing. He probably went out and got a very good makeup artist because they did cover it up. I didn't notice it as much. I noticed the lump, but I didn't see the discoloration. Yeah, you know, the night show, I don't know if I would use to it or the fact that it was covered. So we didn't notice it as much. You think color knew that he lost the show. He seemed almost very consulatory. He was kind of like being nurturing to fill. Do you think he had a time he kind of knew that he was not going to take home the title? Yes, I do. I really do. And I think you could tell in his speech that he, you know, like he said, he was telling Phil before they even announced the results. Congratulations on this victory. And I think he knew it was just pretty much an impossible task. Phil Heath was even better than he was last year. This was a very controversial decision in 2010. Now you come back in 2011. He's even a little better than he was last year. Jay wasn't quite as good as he was last year. Where else were they going to go? This Jay was higher after this or does he say, you know what? I screwed my bicep up. I'm going to come back and I'm going to try to regain the title. You know, he now we're talking Thursday night. He always talks about retirement. Come a limpia time because he's in such a long year. One difference I really noticed between those two guys is Phil seemed so energetic and refreshed. And Jay seemed tired last night. He just seemed drawn and tired. Head more energy tonight. But, you know, he's on the road almost every week all year. He's 38 years old now. You know, who am I to tell somebody wonder retire? But if it was, if he asked me, do you think I should? I'd probably say yes. I would agree, Lani. I would say that, you know, Jay is a great champion. But at this point, he probably can make more money not competing, not at the subject as body to the rigors of what he's doing. Jay is Jay getting all of his body's not responding or is he just not got the right formula to bring him to the point where we've seen him in 2009 when we saw him in 2001 when you helped him. What do you, what's your assessment? You have a better understanding of Jay called it than anyone. Well, I mean, the formula, if you, if you be backtracked, oh nine was great. Oh, ten was down and oh, you know, here we are 11 when talking about not as good as oh, ten not as good as oh nine. I don't know if it's age related and it's certainly not. I don't think anyone can doubt Jay's dedication and drive and you know, focus on what he wants to accomplish when he focuses on something. So maybe it's in the formula. You know, I don't know. You know, that's something that only he would know. But you know, if there's somebody who, I mean, we've said this before, if there's somebody who has the ability, the mental capacity to come back, I mean, a lot of people can't from even any type of loss, let alone, you know, losing something like this, it'd be Jay. You know Jay though, just hearing his speech that he gave, is that Jay saying I'll be back next year or is that Jay saying, you know, it's filled you're in the new man now. I'm moving on. Well, goes right back to the arm. I mean, you had he had. He had perfect excuse, right? Well, no, not excuse, but he's he's going to, you know, you, you, you, you have to wonder when he walks back stage thinking, okay, I'm second. I've been here before. Why am I second? What's going to factor in there is, you know, possibly, you know, the arm. What would have been if my arm was a lot of worry with the arm, which made him cause, you know, to hold a lot of water, it's called all levels go up or whatever. But, you know, another point is Lonnie saw him and other people saw him on our site, looking wild, ten days ago, wild, unbeatables far as I'm concerned. And what happened to you think? I don't know, maybe the arm injury was in that last ten day period, but Lonnie saw, I saw Lonnie a couple days ago, and Lonnie was speechless with the way he looked. And, you know, Chris, another thing when we talked about this last night at the Pre-Judging, take away 2009, there's always seems to something go wrong with Jay. In 2008, he had an infection. And to last year, he barely made it through the Pre-Judging, this year he had the injury. I think the biggest thing to think of it and going back to Chris's point, whether he retired or not, when he lost in 2008, he lost it to a 225 pound guy, it was 38 years old, Dexter Jackson. Tonight he loses to a 245 pound guy, three inches taller than Dexter Jackson, 31 years old. You know, that's a lot to come back and beat. I want to call Phil Heath rather than the gift of the prophecy, because you told me that when you were working with Jay back in 2003, he had seen Phil Heath backstage at a show he won, I guess Jay was guest-posed. Hey, is this, was that a prophecy was Jay seeing Phil backstage almost like what was to come before shadowing if you may? Well, I mean here, this is April 4th. It's funny that Phil mentions it. It's my brother's birthday. Jay calls me that day and said, there's a kid I saw this guy and the quote was, he reminds me of Kevin LeVron, he's going to be Mr Olympia period at the end of the sentence. Little did you know he would beat him for the Olympia? It's unbelievable. So let's talk about Kai Green. Third place here tonight, not the best Kai Green we've seen, but the guy has got enormous potential. In my mind, Kai Green lost the Olympia. I think Kai Green comes in the shape here. He's the new Mr Olympia. What do you say to that statement? So here's the thing, Dave, as I was talking about earlier in the Iron Man rap, does Phil Heath now went at five years in a row like every Mr Olympia does, like Mike Lacknuss is don't forget about Kai Green. And like Chris said last night, I said if he comes in 10 or 12 pounds lighter, Chris has come in 20 pounds lighter, let's see what he brings. When he brought that package to the Arnold Classic in 2009, that was freaky. You put that Kai Green on the stage versus this Phil Hill. Phil Heath, Phil Hill was great too. You remember him? Who in the, who got that? I got to go with Heath right now because he's Mr Olympia, but let me tell you, I have a lot of Ethan Kai Green. Was this Kai Green's show to lose? Yeah, it was. That's why when we had a fire side, Lonnie wasn't there. We had a fire side chat. It seemed like we were just dogging on this criticizing the hell out of Kai, but the point was, I think we were doing it is because everyone understands what he can achieve and we've seen it before. But we've seen, you know, last year of the year before the Vegas heat, we've talked about the humidity, you mentioned at the, you asked him about his weight and, you and I were concerned that it was so high and we knew that that was not a good weight. I think Kai was 10 pounds lighter from yesterday to today and he still needs to be 10 pounds lighter and I like 20. Yeah, that's your 20. Yeah, and so we, at that fire side chat, it sounded like we're dogging on him because the expectation other people have for him is what is just, you know, is unbelievable. And that's what he's capable of. So yes, was did he, you know, through it was his show to come in and decide where he was going to play. When I saw Kai eating for a full straight full hour through the whole press conference, I knew he was in trouble. Kai Green, I think there are phones where I said, Derek said they should start him for two days before the show because he'll probably look bad because I've never seen Kai be flat. Yeah, you know, he's, he was much tighter tonight and he was very impressive tonight and you could see that crazy thickness and he just, he's got to be frustrated because this is a show. You can see it in his face. He was frustrated. You know, the one thing that he definitely lacks at Phil Heath now has consistency. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It was great at the 2010 Arnold where he arguably could have won the Arnold over Kai Green. He was great at last year's Mr. Olympia. And he was... Exactly. Yeah. And he was great or at this year's Olympia. Kai Green's like the stock market. I don't think Kai Green is found the formula that works for him and when he does, I think that he will be very dangerous. I don't know, you know, if, if, whoever's helping him, who's ever been helping him is just feeding him too much, I think his food consumption needs to come down. There's no one bigger than him on stage. And I think that he's missing the boat, so to speak. Let's talk about a guy he helped for 28 days, Victor Martinez, who I thought was one of the most improved body bills of the Olympia. You know, arguably you could put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a put a a little bit tighter and maybe Chris had a little more time with him. He might have been second place tonight. I don't think anybody would have, would have argued with that Victor Martinez was back. I want to congratulate Chris for the short time. He worked with him whatever, whatever he did 29 days. That's okay. It wasn't a long as time, but let me tell you, I'd give an up on Victor Martinez. Always thought he had a beautiful physique, but now I was in the stage, you know what show me, I'm tired of it, you're just not nailing it. He came back, there's a best we've seen since 2007. Now he's back in the mix too. We talk about Kai Green being a threat to fill Heath. I think Victor Martinez is now a threat to fill Heath. If you have 16 weeks with Victor Martinez, does Victor Martinez win the Olympic classic? Yes. I think so. You know what, you got to put it into context. Jay's not going to do it. Fill is not going to do it. Kai's the most dangerous in consistent bodybuilder and bodybuilding. So I think it comes down to the Kai versus Victor. That's really what it is. That crazy, unless psychotic Texan can decide to jump into it. It's a real matter of being a champion. It's on the next Olympia problem. He'll have to try to qualify before the Vahacer. He'll qualify. With the new rule, you have to win a pro show to qualify for the Olympia. It's going to make it a lot more difficult. Top three. And the Arnold. Just the Arnold and the Olympia. Right. And the Olympia. The branch is not competing till next year. So I think what Branch will do is he'll probably do that aeropic. He's in from Dallas, Europe. I've got a Dallas. Let's see, once we wait to see one of the week before. I don't know if it's that. And they'll, but probably see Branch Warren at that aeropop. Victor Martinez now, real curious about him. I'm real curious about Brandon Curry who I've really liked. The numbers of guy that didn't make the top 10 that I think's got a lot of potential is Sean Road. Yeah, obviously a future star. Let's go back to Victor Martinez. You said he was a little resistant to the water depletion with you on Friday. He listened to you on Saturday. Arguably he was very much better tonight. Does Victor have trust in you again to say, if you start cracking the whip on him, he'll listen. Well, I always like I tell Troy. I've trusted me, which means that I can't force anything on people. I trust my instincts and if somebody can trust me, that's fine. I think that's part of the formula going forward is part of working together is if he can go back to the old 304 where it's like, okay, this is the dick. You tell me what to do. I trust my instincts. And if I think if that, you know, formula pans out, I think he's capable of winning the Arnold. Let's talk about Dennis Wolff, who in my mind is Mr. Olympia from the front and the sides. He turns around. He shows vulnerability in the glute hamstring calf area. Is this the best that Wolf can expect fifth place here? Probably, like you say, you know, and certain poses he looks like Mr. Olympia. And then other poses, you say, hey, may squeak in the talk, 10. At the post down he was next to Kotler. He looked better than him from the front. He's big and wide. He's, if you want, and need somebody with a smaller waist, really wide. I don't know if you guys tell me, you guys competed, you guys were, you know, work with people. I haven't. I don't know. Can you fill in those weaknesses now after competing for 15 years? Anything can be fixed, I think. But you know, whether he's got the mindset or to do it isn't, you know, what is he willing to do what it takes to do it. Sometimes you have to go back to the drawing board and retake yourself how to lift. Some of these guys are so stubborn with what they do that they can't do that. Yeah, you know, I agree with that 100%. You know, when he came out in pre-judging, I was doing the play by play and I thought, well, Bictis in trouble for sure. I thought like Jason trouble and I figured, well, you know, maybe he just was really impressive when he first came out. So when you put him next to each other, people, you can see some things that need to be filled in. But I think they're like, you know, focus issues, training issues. Can he, can he, he's improving? He has improved. He's improved a lot. And throw him in the mix for the arm when he said it's the guy. He could be, he could be a winner. And put throw and Dennis Wolf and that, that trifecta. What's, let's maybe I said Victor Martinez in the comeback show of the year. But, you know, maybe Dexter Jackson might be because Dexter looked terrible. He'll like he's sweet that a few wins in the beginning of the year. He really came back and looked a lot better. But he's still really suffering from lack of size compared to some of these guys like, you know, Wolf and obviously color. And they just, he looks small next to these guys is Dexter back in the mix or is he going to still remain in that fourth and fifth-page slot? I think because of the lack of size, if these other guys are anywhere near in their top shape, you can't beat him. He's given away 30, 40 pounds. I don't know. He says he weighs 235. I don't think he probably weighs 220. But too much to give away. And he's going to be 42 years old in November. I don't think he's going to be getting any better, you know, physically. He, you know, conditioned wise. This is as good as he's been in a long way. Really when that mess is pro world championship at the end of the year, you think? Who's actually doing that? I think Tony Freeman's right-eels, you know, all the 40 you plus guys, Marcus Haley. I would say right now, the Dexter Jackson. He wins it. It's 100 grand. Dexter's looking to shop. The 100 grand in Miami. All right, this is the Lining team for addiction. It's always in the show. Tony Freeman will play, I heard best of Mayor Benoots in the show. Yeah, but similar Benoots. I went to high school with me. I loved the life in the 11th home. And unless it's a reunion pose now, you know, no offense. And you don't get mad at me. He's got a bad temper. You know, I love the guy. Tony Freeman finishes in seventh place. Chris and I said he's trying to glutes away from a top three finish. Yeah, well, they're judging him. I think on whether it's fair or not. And it's fine with me is that judging him on his weakest link, which is really the condition of the back, but also the glutes. And I think if you know, the strategy for him going forward in the show like this, big show with a lot of money on the line, contracts, whatever is bringing him in at all costs. Whatever your body weight has to fall to, just bring him in. And I think they will overreward him because they'll say, OK, wow, something different Tony pushing up right there. And he's got the shape, you know? I know he's upset, but he's on the cost, but hopefully he'll be back for the Arnold. He's another guy who could be in that mix for the one for the win. And when any show as far as I'm concerned, I like Chris said he's like this far away. The certain things that's such a beautiful shape. He's six foot two. He's wide. He's got a small waist. He's in good condition. And in some poses, he looked the best out there tonight. Yeah, the X factors always a title factor to me. Let's talk about the 202 Olympia or 202 showdown. If they like to call it here in Las Vegas, Kevin English repeats. You know, a lot of this, what a point out. After pre-judging, English was really very depleted because he had trouble making weight. And the way in this year was a day earlier. Okay, usually they have two days to fill up. Kevin only had one day. He was very light at 198. I know he said he did a colonic the day before. It sucked down. He might have depleted too many electrolytes. He looked like he was having trouble posing on stage at the pre-judging. He couldn't open his back up. He looked real out of it. He did come back better tonight, but he was winning by three points after pre-judging. Do you think that was a good decision? Not if I was voting and I picked Kevin English to win. So I'm actually going and saying my pit was probably wrong based on what I saw. I would have flexed Lewis winning the tonight. You know, could have gone either way. But after the judging, I would have flexed Lewis. Matter of fact, I did an in-depth interview with Mike Catt today. It was one of the judges. And he was saying, you know, who's that guy from England from the UK, the little blonde guy and I'll flexed Lewis? The judge's a me who knows name. That's a problem. Well, it's probably better. You know, he's a me who might be a problem right there, Chris. Did you think there was any way English had the lead after the pre-judging? No, I didn't have him winning any shots against Flex Lewis. Arguably tonight he was a lot better. He was radically better tonight, but I didn't have any, you know, I never, there was no poses against each other at night. This is a lovely me confused. Lottie, you seem to be up on everything. Why was there no two-out two comparisons tonight? Because I know 50% of the score is tonight yet. They don't judge the posing round. And all there was was a pose down. Did they forget to do the comparison round? I'll remember now. The two of you guys, I don't even think last year, the top six, even got to do their posing routine. So they've always been kind of like the stepchild. I think it's because we got to fit this in and we got to fit this in. Oh, they, they, they think, takes two minutes. But I think that's what they're thinking. Either that or they're just, you judge the night show though. I don't know. I think that that's a major mistake. And I think that's one thing that needs to be correct in the next year. You got to compare those guys. Who was your top three for the two-out two, Lottie? I had Flex Lewis first. Because I actually had Jose Reitman's, Ron, Jose Reitman's second and Kevin English third. After pre-judging, I had Jose Reitman first, Flex Lewis second, English third. After tonight, I really did like English the best on stage tonight. I do know if you have enough points to win it for himself. But obviously the judges had him winning after pre-judging. So that made it easy. I did like Lewis better than Reitman tonight. He has, you know, people have criticized me for saying it on the boards because I was such a big guy myself. Is Reitman too big? Is he bordering on possibly putting too much muscle on that frame? He almost, you know, well, first of all, I'm pre-judging. I had him, you know, I was leaning towards him and at the night show, I kind of switched with Flex and Jose second and Kevin, I, you know, second and third. But he looked surprisingly to me a little boxy in the pre-judging. And I've always been a super fan of his because I've always thought he had a, you know, really significant V-tapeer. He still has it. Not as good. It's not as good. He's just put on so much muscle that it, well, it's, it's still crazy and impressive. It doesn't help his balance and symmetry. You agree? Yeah, he's getting, and the worst thing it can happen to him is that we're going up to two, twelve now starting November. Yeah, it's the worst thing for Jose Reitman. Well, he, I thought the worst thing is, as long as he doesn't try to get up to two, twelve. Well, but I think, but their mindset, Dave, is I have to get up to two, twelve because everybody thinks they know how much, you know, if I come in at 200 pounds, even if he looks spectacular, this is what they're thinking. They're going to hold it against me. That's why everybody lies about their weight. You know who the two, twelve is going to benefit the most flex, Lewis, because flex, Lewis has a lot of room on that frame to add the muscle that he needs. And if he does, he could challenge English, I think. But then again, English is going to be able to come in that much better. Is Seth Farochi going to compete in the two, twelve? I don't know. What do you think? Would Farochi give these guys a run for their money? You know, Farochi, I mean, just do. We don't know, like we've said before, but we draw to Korea, you know, I do it all. But there's people, we don't really know their weights when they come down. Dexter Jackson is probably 220. So, I mean, they have to make two, twelve. I mean, seriously, and Troy Alves. Troy Alves should be able to, you know, maybe he can suck it down. Sean Roden, he needs to put size on. I think he should go up. But if he does the two, two, twelve, now he's got a choice. He doesn't have to put that much size on. He's going to, well, body bills want to get bigger, ultimately. I think the most overlooked guy in this Olympia was no dot Chris Cormere. I mean, Chris Cormere, let's get him over here. You're only 20 minutes late for the wrap up. Who was given? Yes, who? We had to club. We had to club. He already's going out. He said they have to party. No one was there. He came back. We're trying to roll one over there. Chris, talk to me about who you had winning the Olympia. Was this the right decision, Phil Heath? Oh, yeah, he was the right decision. It was the clear winner in the show. For me, it was sort of what I've envisioned even a couple years ago when I was making predictions that Phil should be beaten Jay. I just liked that type of style of physique and what it brings to him. It's come around in the center of yours. Yes, kind of he did the old coming in. No, the old small waist trick on Jay. No, the Jay did a great job. Had a great career and he has nothing to be ashamed of. Jay retired? Well, I mean, I was just like health reasons. Not a penalty to help you as things be walking around like that. Oh, really great Chris Quarmea retired. Or did he? Yeah, this is vague. You're on the, what about going to class? What about the two or two? Did you have Kevin English winning this or Flex Lewis? Well, I just liked, I just liked that Flex Lewis is brought a package that he's never had before that not too many two or two is had before. I mean, he had the cross-dracings on his glues, which was like it was like a reminisce of a, like a like a gritticus barrier from his day. He was totally just like rich. Well, the great Chris Quarmea agrees with all of us. So he's, you know, Kevin, the Kevin I thought he was like 70% coming up. Like he was like in between being like he was tonight as he could have been in the pre-jazin and I thought that homeboy kind of brought it. We're a bit more in that book. They're both neck and neck and I was then after night. You know, they were, you know, they started catching up at the end and it's not over till the end, but, you know, I thought that I thought that it could have been, could have swung the other way. Yeah, I had no problem with English winning tonight. I'm glad to fill Heath is now the 13th Mr. Olympia. One more, let's talk about the figure line because you and I were arguing back and forth. Nicole Wilkins regains the Miss Figure Olympia crown, beating the defending title, the title holder, Aaron Stern. Good decision. I think you asked me that on the radio show. You said make a prediction. I said it's too tough to call you said you have to make a decision. Pick one and I think I said Nicole Wilkins. Yeah, you did. You know, I thought that Aaron Stern was going to win tonight, not because I don't like Nicole Wilkins, but she was the reigning Miss Figure Olympia. You almost have to give the edge to the reigning champ. She was the best that I've seen. What do you think won it for? I just, you know, I just think she's got that wow factor. The pops out at you with the blonde hair, you know, and I think she wanted because she's on the current issue of Iron Man magazine. I heard she is. And that was the final deciding factor. I don't know. They're both great champions. I mean, Stern won it last year. Nicole won it the year before Nicole's the first athlete ever to win the Arnold and the Olympian the same year. That's one of those apples and orange. I didn't see the score. She had, I don't know how close it was after the pre judging, but I had no problem. I'm not so sure Aaron was better than she was last year. I think what happened was they really liked Nicole Wilkins in that figure Olympia stunt. She was off last year. They punished her. Aaron won. She got her game back on. She won the international and now she won the Olympia. She's again, Ms. Figure Olympia. So we have a lot of great champions here tonight. Nicole Wilkins, Ms. Figure Olympia, Phil Heath, the 13th Mr. Olympia. Kevin English three times two-o-two Olympia champ Chris, any final words? No, this is happy for Nicole. We got out thought she ran, kind of like ran in her physique. She just told you to try to prep for it. That's what I like to see how to athletes, male or female. I think she was like the pin of me on the sport should be for a figure. I don't have the great champ but she was a little bit less curbish and hervazied. A little bit too little. A little bit too little. I was a little bit afraid and I thought that kind of did her in with as far. She was just perfect presentation. Your score mirror has better insights into female figure, turn, turning and presentation and bikini presentation than the women do. I've never seen anything like it. Why do you want to explain to you why? You're not sure. You're not sure. I mean you spend enough time with him in the room and have him do turns and all. I had to eat. Yeah, yeah, he's right on the spot man. This is on this spot. Hell, posing. Where's the after party tonight Chris? I'm probably going to go to Oncourt and then into Drainys Drainys must spot. Drainys is like we're all the dead and zombie. The vampire is going to head out with after after in the hotel room and then we're going to have the pool party next day. So I got my next 48 hours. I'm about closing the car and I'm ready for it. You're up to the next 48 hours. I'm ready. Yeah, I'm on it. Yeah, so we went out with after the USA. Who? Me and I haven't been the same since. Yeah, we went out. Chris, can you imagine if they wouldn't saw you with the feeling I'm taking a lot of people out? Are they ever to keep up with you? Yeah, he left out. He was on the room soon. He got in there. He would like, man, this is crazy, man. You're the real deal. He is the real. Now was somebody on his arm. He didn't even have to. I'm not a vampire. I'm a lot of pantheon here in Las Vegas. Devada outside of the Orleans Arena. I'm Dave Palumba with Lonnie Taper from Ryan Man Magazine. Chris the real deal of Kormir and Chris the technician of Cito are axmusl.com.

This is Dave Palombo with RXMuscle.com. I'm here at the 2011 IFBB Olympia weekend. I am here with Ruth Silverman from Iron Man magazine and Chris the Technician Ascito. We are going to do the Women's Rap Up here specifically Women Body Building Fitness and Bikini Ruth let's start right off. Iris Kyle seven time misalimpio what she deserved tonight. I think in the end she knocked him off. Yeah. You want an ally? I want an ally. Because the morning she was not quite as crisp we were all sitting there in the press pit remarking on it and I think that tonight she brought a little sharper but also Yaksanne leaned out so much which was a big wild factor for the judges but when they stood there and they did that little lats spread you know Iris just overpowered her and I think in a lot of times Iris beat her in the back poses too. Was this the most vulnerable Iris Kyle's been in recent memory too? Oh yeah I think it was she was very vulnerable. I don't think she dominated the show by any means. I agree with Ruth that Yaksanne she leaned down. It's almost like she went a little bit too far. I think it she just stopped you know she was a little on the flat side and it had she had a little bit more fullness than I think you know could have been tables could have been turned. Iris Kyle was a six time misalimpio going to his dad had a count for something it had to give her a little edge. I believe that she wasn't the misalimpio and Yaksanne had been misalimpio. I think that Yaksanne would have walked away with this with title tonight. I think the answer to that is look at their ways. Iris has just got a smaller way to Yaksanne. She does. Yeah she does. I think that Yaksanne even though she's large and she's majestic doesn't that nip in little waste. Iris is is and I think that counted shape counts. I think the Yaksanne orquins I guess the thing that hurt her was that her legs are very straight up and now Chris she doesn't have that sweep that Iris has when she puts her leg out to the side. You just see crazy crazy detail that you don't necessarily see from Yaksanne because she's got a little bit of straightness to that quad. Yeah you know at the end of the day from the front there's some parts of the pre-dech and during the front where Iris puts it away. It's her structure which is a little you know which is unique. She's got the sweep to the thigh which kind leaves the other girls a little vulnerable. And she's still got the cap delts with the small waist so even though she's not at a best and she was very vulnerable here I thought and and from behind I didn't think she was hard from behind really. I thought her glutes I've seen her glutes so used to seeing this that honeycomb and ask looking for a seat up here and she didn't have that and I think maybe that's why we're being a little bit more discerning about her but I guess you have to say when all said and then she's still the best body of the other stage. I think that's how the judges are and that's how you know pretty much the you know experts like Ruth's are. What is Yaksanne do now I mean I mean she feels like obviously she should have beat her last year she thinks she should have beat her this year people are telling her that does Yaksanne come in a little bigger maybe. Can you lock Sanne come in a little fuller and still be hard that's all that's her dilemma right. I don't know the answer to that Yaksanne did win at the Arnold Cup of years ago when ours faltered. I mean clearly she's number two she's this her 13th Miss Olympia I saw her in the first one in Prague in 1998 I mean she's a great body builder I don't have an answer to that. Brigitte Brezhervic come is in third place here tonight I thought it was a very good decision. She arguably has the best image she on stage not the biggest body builder but very pretty shape especially from behind the glute hamstring lower back insertions yeah that's what kept her right I mean from the get go I think you know had I been judging the show I'd have her third because of her condition her natural shape she has great presentation and and she was she was hard so you know if you want to know how like you know to critique let's say Iris if Iris had that hardness from behind then this would be you know a done deal like piece of cake with that Iris you're expanding maybe without Iris here Brigitte could be mislipi for how many you know tens of years maybe ten years you know because she's got the beautiful structure we I would say that's correct but what about Elena Popa also with the structure I wanted to bring up a let's bring up a Elena Popa we skipping over double chef's who took forth but but but Elena Popa has an interesting dilemma she was third at the Arnold I actually thought that she could have been as high a second here tonight and I don't think anyone would have complained that's why I was sort of surprised that Brigitte slipped into that third spot and you're saying you expected it all day so you know different folks looking at the bodies if you're not going to go with Elena Popa as as second or third then obviously this something they didn't like about a maybe too blocky maybe maybe so they're going for shape so then I'm thinking okay Brigitte slips in there obviously that shape on stage what is devilishewski fit into the mix here because she's arguably the hardest girl in the class and and per height maybe packs the most muscle she absolutely out muscle Iris she definitely was harder than Myers I don't think I think Debbie is fighting her structure I don't think there's anything she can do I know I think she thinks she can keep putting on size and be direct but it hasn't happened yet you think it's gonna is it a mistake for her to put anymore muscle on I think it probably is I think so but the more I listen to Ruth she's the female tape female technician I agree exactly that was a perfect assessment from from from Yaksan being long and majestic too

We're in Helderman with our ex-Muscle.com. Here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, 2011 World Strongest Man, America Strongest Man. I'm here with Mr. Scott Weach, who won a first event at Axel Cleanup Press and set a new World record. Yeah, it feels good. Don't enjoy it when I second attempt. So I got to say, I'm going to introduce you to the next event. I've always been pretty good at pressing. So, you know, worked out good for me. I knew I needed to start off strong with my best event. So, it turned out good. Yeah, it was terrific. And your toe was forward 23. Is that correct? Yes, there are forward 23. Second attempt. Yeah. Next event coming up is the yoke with the Harley's sled pole. What's your thoughts on that? It's not an event I like. Hopefully, the floor won't be too slick here. It's a finished concrete. Because sometimes we get pretty slick. You pretty good with the yoke. So, it should be another good event for me. All right, looking forward to it. And we're going to be back in just a few minutes to catch up with the next event with the yoke and the Harley's pole. Until then, Brian Helderman with ourxmuscle.com.

10 and 9 You must and I will repeat There may for two guys who can handle the truth The truth you can't handle the true but we can be Lomble Chris Asito Orangemuscle dot com presents Every muscle Leave your watch out Welcome to another episode of heavy muscle radio on the Day of Palombo and I'm joined as always by the technician Chris Asito On this July 30th, 2018 evening and Chris Big weekend and body building at least amateur body building The USA championships one of the best shows In the world I should say for amateur talent It didn't disappoint We weren't there you and I this might have been the first day The both of you and I weren't there but Family calls and crazy stuff going on and I was talking about that a little bit and But the show went on as it always does over a thousand competitors and We have a new overall champion in Shane Stewart now Shane Stewart was a light heavyweight And for those of you want to little wrap up actually did a wrap up on our site with some pictures Something that but I wanted to just talk about the Shane Stewart as the overall trip light heavyweight You know another light head I do me a light heavyweight last year wasn't lunch for the light weight Yeah, but Shane Stewart is Reminds me of a young branch warrant Did you see pictures of him? Yeah, I think he's very good. Yeah, he's good, but he's got that like you know he doesn't have it You could tell when he first started probably people told me and that could be that could have a body But and they put he's got like that grainy nasty norley muscle He's got a lot of muscle on his body any any I pick he's whatever he's done with his physique it flows real well He's got a big back he's got big legs And he's a he's one of these guys that will be to a lot of guys in the pros and no one will ever never believe it people Like there's no way this guy's gonna do well. No one will ever put him in like there. Well, they're gonna they're gonna look I'll tell you what have the people gonna do is Signal look at pictures and they're gonna not know that he's actually better than he is because the lighting at the show is His bright it's intense. You get a very bright background You get a very confusing background and that it's not just plain black or even plain white Yeah, we like what they did at the night with they did used to do it other shows a lot of the pros shows They did they think they're a pro used to do as to is they would do pre judging and black and then it then they would bring up the set for the night show And you'd have like your your normal. You know your fancy little USA background because you're right. It is a little distracting when you have like you know words and stuff like that in the back of the back drop But it looks great. I don't know if he's old the young or I don't know you can't tell what the guys anymore. Yeah I'll get him on the show. But he'll find out everything. We've got some maturity wise. He looks old. You know what I mean? Meaning he's density of the muscle and the quality of the muscle is it looks like he's not a spring chicken. Meaning looks like he's been training a long period of time I've had he hasn't been but I'm just telling you this guy has got branch horn written all over it. I'm telling you These this reminds me. I just the best thing I remember when branch turn pro at that 2002 NPC Nationals And He just was Shredded you know I think that and I said to myself wow, this guy's pretty freaking impressive. You know and I didn't I didn't really know who I knew branch horn They might have known his the extent of how long he had been competing for but He probably had been competing ten years before that and I'm from teenagers and everything and look at Brand and I don't think anyone would have said branch horn was going to you know with normal twice and it was going to be a second If you want to be a Some people know pun intended some people who are there twice but I'm not saying he wanted much But no, I know you mean meaning Six most muscular words Yeah, you know it's so funny Well, I won't even say a good judge when he was somewhat some people did you know Some people thought he was going to go all the way I don't want to call them all in the power or somebody I mean it was in a complementary way Some people did they were like behind him and said you know this guy he's even when he wasn't doing Super well as first you know year and a half two years as a pro He pushed Jay that one year you know when he came in second with the Olympia I mean that was I don't I think people always say when the Arnold twice I think the highlight really of his career was placing second with the Olympia That was the first one because he beat he beat the extra he beat the extra that year was raining Mr Olympia Yep So Anyway, this is not branched for him but this guy is a very very very good. He's very good. It's a good line That mean light heavy was without a shadow of a doubt the deepest I'll bet you he does the Tampa Pro next week this coming week I should say As a two as a one It's got to be crazy not I heard the heavyweight kid Lucas Carroll is doing that So I know what is the heavyweight cut off 225 but you know he's he'll suck down through 222 he probably wasn't a full 225 anyway this guy Yeah, he's he's very good. He's got tremendous vacuum hose right? Yeah, probably Fundumbles off the hook Yeah, I thought his glutes could have been a little a little harder. Maybe they're just a little flat But because they are pretty he's pretty ripped everywhere this guy Like I said a friend of mine There's personal friends with him And he he sent me pictures before the show and I said that and if he wins I said I'll interview him So he won I'm going to be a very good good good back double good front double Now it's interesting because this guy is going to drop down from heavy to to 12 And the and Shane is going to obviously just go into 12 or probably You know hopefully he won't come and you know he won't say I can gain weight now and I'll get him comes in smoother But eventually they both do tap it you know and I mean to see who wins it on the pro stage you know Yeah, because obviously Shane won you know the overall here but coming into the 2012 he's still the Carol if they both compete I think there is zero reason for either of these guys to like well I'm going to wait a year And I mean it's not the open they do and they're doing the 2012 you know So no Still demon process you know you talk guys you know I mean you're People were online saying bashing the how the week the show as I don't think the show is weak at all I'm looking at this sixty people and some of these classes you know some of the classes like light weights only any guys and Banems had 10 guys all right, but that's that's always stand well look this two class wonders I both think I've kind of been around the block. I think they look really really impressive. Yeah, and I'll tell you why I don't I don't get those four guys in the class. Those two winners right there are really good I'll tell you what the super heavies weren't too bad either. They were really good. I mean Henry Jackson the third is a guy I interviewed Two years ago. I think it was he won Junior USA and I was impressed with him that he was I mean the only big I think was his second show or something like that I said this guy's this guy's gonna be real dangerous in the future and I hadn't seen him since then He kind of waited kind of you know taking his time to put some sighs on and you know he's a pro now now I thought the top two Henry Jackson and Ron Gordon Once again, if you want to see pictures NPC there's online has the pictures I thought there was it was a very tight battle And that effect I thought the second place guy from the pictures now. I wasn't there of course. I need to wear you. I thought he was I think he looks like a young Ronnie Coleman this guy Ron Gordon I think he looks let's see does he look like a Coleman Look at the front last word You know I mean he's he's phenomenal he's good he's got the cold he's phenomenal because I'm gonna put in context He's probably even training right he's well he's find up in training a long period of time That's my guess look at his arms that is not it if that's not a Coleman. I'll look the side The great is pex of full hamstrings of great from the side he's in very very good condition He's in better condition than anyone in the class. I think right. Yeah, I think he's better than the winner Henry Jackson I think he needs to fill out his frame a little bit more, but maybe you know, but I mean that front doubles pretty deadly right It looks like a young Ronnie Coleman. I'm telling you I I remember the young Ronnie Coleman to you did it Dave. Yeah, you know at the back does right the glutes and ham It's like when you haven't had the before Coleman got big not facially he doesn't look great Ronnie I'm talking to physiquized like Ronnie He probably has a better waistline because he got a long torso too Ronnie never had a running head or short torso He's probably from Texas too I've changed the metro flight right home He's in terrible we don't know anything about this. I'll get I'm gonna get all these guys on the show These this isn't gonna crop so I'm gonna get him on the show because I'm gonna get no like no no no no You know no variety go tight and interview with you unfortunately Well, you know, it's a quiet show. You can say that right I like the one that we see new town like this Don't how often do we get like a crop of new guys that really we haven't really you know heard any buzz about you know That's exciting especially in the opening Like yeah, I went to heavy season then they've to the fifth time Yeah, I mean usually it's a guy who's like 35 eight years old and interviewing because he's about 20 years to get the pro card You know it's funny. I think when does the hand sharp turn pro he can tell you I think it was his because he'd done a lot of shows It was like his third year What the North America so people like oh, it's just like your tenth time here. It's like time What are you talking about it? It's my third time. Yeah, it's just that I've done multiple shows You know so people know the face sure Where's you know, I don't know the face of these guys any of these guys The top five at the here in the super is a good. I mean obviously Matt Perzacot I you know if I would as a betting man if I was going to if you were not going to handicap the show before the show took place Yeah, I would say Matt why don't you know because he's next in line and that tells you how good Ryan Gordon and and rejects it on Yeah, I'm just lining up Oh, that has to go to settle the third Good you Yeah I like Daniel no C. Although Oh no C. Oh he He was good too big big front last bread You know conditioning could have been a little better I think the biggest disappointment well and Brett Swanson who's really good. That's uh, Autumn Swanson's husband Yeah, he's got a good experience He's got an inch he's got a great quad. It's good legs, you know He doesn't have the smallest waist but he has he's got super great conditioning You know this guy who was six is the Jose helps he looks like a road-nish type Federico Gordy Yeah I think there's a lot of you know future talent in this lineup that we see Think about how good the lineup was like Vincienzon, Massoni who we were you know, Vinnie, Massoni who we were really high on at the nationals I thought he was going to come into the show and win you know, obviously way too smooth here But he's one of these like future talents you know Jerry trains with Jerry's policing in the gym Old school you know type of physique he's probably one of the most popular guys in social media And that you know you do follow your begins to grab guy Well, I don't follow anyone but I'm just post You know all the Instagram gossip though All but I thought that he was going to come in here and really do some damage But he yeah, if you look at the pictures he just wasn't in good shape No, he was a good place he can he can suck it down to the North American yeah nice spirit very good and something so good Yeah, no, I'm telling you why I think that's really good. That's a reflection of the depth. Yeah I think I think what people got all I'm tired about was the fact that was only 10 heavy weights which You know usually the heavyweight classes stack you know there was there was 16 super which is which is good for super heavy weights usually I still don't see why more people do national's the end of the year than than you know Yeah, there's two programs per class but they give me at least you I say is every class gets approved I have you myself don't 42 heavy with the national's you watch people like if I dumb that you are saying I would have been top three Yeah, I don't know I don't think anyone was beating this look as Carol guys so Pretty big and I just said top three yeah, but you got to be you have to be first to really win You know it is nowadays no one wants to go to a show to place they all want to go to win I could guys I know guys that did one show they're like I'm going to I'm going to USA and one national's next year or this year I'm like what are you guys not are you nuts? I knew nuts you just wanted like the you know the local you know state show you go to nationals you're competing one year Yeah, and they go in not just to say hey I want to place they go because they I got to get my pro cards Because you know what you can do that in men's physique you can do that in bikini in figure you can't you can't do that men's body But you know you might even be able to do it in classic body building, but even now that's getting too hard What do you think of the classic go over a one of Brian Jones What do you think gave you reminds me of like a young guy queen doesn't mean not just because they're You've got like that tygrene is very awkward. I know that I stopped doesn't show up and well in pictures But I'm sure in person he was wacky looking from what I was going to be alive It's pretty impressive Well, it was the most packed just for a statistic what was the most packed class? I mean in terms of numbers bikini Oh, yeah probably absolutely bikini in figure men's physique was huge Men's physique was huge, so But it's not always the case. I heard there was 250 bikini girls in the show As my grandfather would say, mazultuff Yeah, there was there was four women body roles in the whole show and they gave her poker You know if I'm advising women's physique, yeah if I'm advising women's physique Well, if you're a women's physique, you better just do body building if you have any of these eyes I know I've said it, but no one knows how people think it crazy, but the girl who one is looks good She could have won physique if you look at the picture Marla Maria Marla Maria Marla Maria Marla Maria She definitely could have won, which she'll be a great women's physique pro She was smart. She was the smartest one there She figured you know what I got a better chance of body building I don't know why I don't know why the women's physique women wouldn't cross over or do the just do body building All you got to do is come in the shape What did they give a classic body building? Brocar of somebody One, two, three, four, five, six, seven pro cars You know we had, yeah I don't have to even determine that It was a two per class, it's why they give the classic two per class But they give them the men's body building, one per class That's what I mean, isn't that weird? Well that's why they have that's why all the classes have 35 people in it Well I mean if you, if you, if you, if you gave a four I'm just saying four three pro clients to each light heavy heavy super I mean you wouldn't get 10 guys in the, in the, yeah Look, every one of the national's everyone, let's assume that 50% of the classic physique guys would have been men's physique Before class was around and 50% would have been open body bones Right? Yeah, well there's, there's the people you lost That's why the classes are not the stats, why open body building doesn't have as many people's usually Because here, you know, there's a certain percentage that went off the classic And that's just the way it's going to go And that's, that doesn't mean you're going to, I don't think it's going to water the Pull down necessarily in the open class. I think you're just not going to get as the numbers That's all. Yeah. The guys who are going to win classic never would have won open anyway, not on amateur level Maybe as they got, if they got bigger and went on a pro level they would So I don't think you, you're losing, you know, your, your top tier talent You know, it's just a matter of will these men's classic guys stay as classic guys in the, in the pros If they do then you might lose some, you might lose some talent in the pro ranks Because these guys could theoretically, you know, grow into, into open men, competitors So I heard the lorry still wants to go up to open men's body building next year I'm going to get them on the show interview before they look there. I'm going to ask him I heard he gained 20 pounds already. What do you think by that? He may have, I mean he, he may have but, um, for open body building, the thing to win the Arnold classic, you need more than 20. Probably, yeah. I mean, a couple of, if he's willing to, you know, put the work in over a couple of years I think he could probably do it, you know, people did it all that's how people in the past You know, you're looking at a guy and see there's no way this guy can be an open guy No, of course he could, that's, that's where everyone starts, you know, he's got the structure The question is, does he, can he put the muscle on, you know? That's, it's just a matter of, you know, time. Time over tension, right? Is that what, what's, that's what is that equal? Time over tension. But it's some kind of, I remember that from first. That's two scientific from me doing. Yeah, it's a little too, Chris, I'm not even doing the show at 12 30 and I was one in the morning, so. That's okay. It's so alert. We, our brains don't work that clearly at that time. No, time over tension. It's a training, it's like a, who came up with that time over tension? Yeah, I know it's body building the way that we, I think it's Ellenton, Howard and Howard, how are you put out, you have something like that? Yeah, work equals more mass times accelerated. That's our move from physics. Because people say, people, I hear that all the time. This is, you know, Chris is not scientific enough. I, I'm serious. Some people tell me, I hear that. This is, you know, Chris, you're not scientific, you just like, make stuff up or lucky, I said, or lucky is okay. So I'm scared by help when? Time under the tension is the time your muscle spends under load during a set. Okay, and I guess that's associated with hypertrophy, right? No, it's just, in other words, how long you take before you do the positive and negative contraction, eccentric use. I mean, you know, you, you, you could, you could take a hundred pounds. And then you can take a hundred pounds on the bar and bring, take 20 seconds, 30 seconds to bring it down and 30 seconds to bring it up and do lots of those. And I think if you mentioned 450, it negates everything under time under tension. I, I was found that I liked it to really control the negative portion of the eccentric portion of the movement. Like, very, very controlled. And how quickly I came down with the movement was basically based on, on feel. So on bench press, I really control the negative because I felt that that was really important, you know, to the, to the set. On squats, I controlled the, the, the negative or the eccentric, you know, going down, but I, not as much because I just felt like I didn't have to. In other words, so it's important to control your negative, but the rate with which you do it is, really, depending upon how it feels. And you can't teach someone that you can't say, well, you have to take 25 seconds to lower the weight. Now, because not for everyone that's going to work, especially if you have long, long legs, very short legs or long arms for short arms, it's got to work. It's got to feel. There's got to be a, a feel aspect of it. But when you bring it down, when you bring it down, bring the weight down, and the negative slower, you don't recruit more muscle fibers to you. Well, I think you, I think you're, I think you're breaking down more tissue. You're thinking about the muscles and the contracted position at the top of these state bench press. And then you're lowering the weight. Now, the muscles that are contracted now are tearing or, are shearing apart, because the slower you're moving the weight down theoretically, the more shearing force on them. And so that that's the theory, if you can, if you can create more shearing force over long period of time, time on the tension, you're going to, you know, you're going to, you're going to get better gains. But I think it's, it's, there's an, an individualistic type of portion, or, or, or, or, I guess, aspect of this because if you lower the weight too slow, you won't be able to bring it up again. You know, necessarily, you might actually do it yourself. You might need to do it yourself. You might, you might, to take the muscle too much, because you're taking too long to do the set. You're not going to get enough reps out. Now you're reducing the amount of reps you're doing because you're lowering the weight too slowly. I don't think you're going to get as much development. So I think this got to be like a balance between, you know, I always found that, you know, when I went super heavy, you know, the try to stimulate your muscle growth, I had to move the weight a little faster. I couldn't lower the weight as quickly with, say, 500 pounds on the bench as I could with 400 or a 315. And if I tried to do that, I would get stuck in the end of it. I would get no reps with it. So I think at some point, you might need to move the weight a little faster to get into that groove of building more strength. And then once you have more strength, you can slower, you know, you can do your, so in other words, on the lighter sets, you do, you do, you do slower reps, as least the negative portion. And then on heavier sets, you might go faster because you want to use that in a little bit of momentum to try to be able to get pushed through that barrier of nothing on the lift. So I think that that has to be that balance between it. And that's, that's why there's no, there's no formulas in stone for lifting. You just can't make formulas up, is it this is the way to do it? Because that's, it's not the way to do it. And then this, this variability to everything you do. And everyone is different. That's why you can watch Branch Warren do those crazy ballistic, you know, type of movements that he does in the gym. And it works for him. He built a ton of muscle doing it. If I did it, I would be injured and an ambulance problem. Sounds like you're explaining, Joe, we just instinctive training. Yeah, Joe, Joe, he took, Joe, he took credit for every, every, every training principle. And he found it out with Joe, we just naked of gravity. He had to actually have like a naked of a gravity principle, which was when you bring the rap sounds slower. Well, you know what he did? He just, he just basically named all the things that people don't know. You're ready, you know, which is good because now we have a, we have a language to talk about it. You know, we can describe these things. It's important that sometimes give names to things because otherwise how do we have a conversation about what we're doing in the gym. We have to say, oh, you know that movement, you want to do it. It's better to have these, it's funny. It's funny. It's all crushers. Who gave up with skull crushers? Well, because when you got two tires, the fucking bar hit you in the head, you cracked his skull. You know, the way to principle, we'd have then stick to training, virtual gravity, you know, there was a principle for every contraction principle. What's when you hold it and squeeze it. Can you hear him coming up with those things? Because you know why it was easy for him to come up with those? The same reason was easy for black men to come up with the headline to articles. Well, you know what, Charles, you were talking about. Charles, that's probably come up with a couple. You probably have a whole book of principles that he's got for all his exercises. Charles, I was pulling on principle. Yeah. I'm saying if Charles was an Ego maniac like Joe is, which is not, he could have made up his own list of principles. I was so surprised. No, Charles is like the training chip, but if someone went to the gym and watched Charles training people and started quantifying everything that he's doing, you can come up with a whole new set of principles that no one even heard of before. You know? The Charles Glass Interangular Production Principle. Think about that. We think we know what the exercises, Charles could probably come up with, with 50 new exercises, no one ever heard of. You know, he can make his own names up from, and he can put it in a book and probably sell a million copies of the thing. People are obsessed with training. I can't tell you how many of my clients asked me for training programs. I hate doing that because I was an instinctual transit, but I've been writing down different programs for people just, and I've been saving them as files because people get bored. You know, I used to just instinctfully change things up here or there, but some people like to just follow routines, you know, and I forgot Chris that there's no magazines anymore. So the magazines did have those cookie crazy workouts that they pretended that the body bulls used. But they were there. Iron Man magazine was notorious for putting out a tremendous, different muscle back to different variations, and we would follow them. You know, you probably follow a lot of my probably follow a lot of them. There's nothing like that anymore. So it's actually not a bad idea to put out some new articles as well. Okay, here's some of the weed at principles and just Google it. Thanks to Google. The first rep principle, right? That's when Dave can't do any more, and I lift the bar off on the bench press and help him do it, and then he'll all right, right? Oh, wait, no force rep is you can't do it anymore. Yeah, okay. The pre-exhaustian principles you're going to do pecs, and instead of doing bench press, you're going to do like pec deck, peruscable crossover, So you can lift lesser weight, less weight to get the more out of it, right? Yeah. The muscle confusion principle is when you've been training chest on two, even training chest like the other, really, really tired of the gym. You know, I can play that breast. Did you train chest on Mondays? Yeah, and then you could use the body by starting with inclines rather flat bench. I purposely never train chest on Monday because I didn't want to fight with people over the bench, So I would do back on Mondays, and then on Tuesday I'd come back and do chest when no one was on the bench presses. Oh, I can play it. It's staked of the instinct of the instinct of the instinct of navigation of the gym principle. Wait, did we say muscle confusion? We said muscle confusion. Wait, the muscle priority principle. Now that would be when you're tired of the terrible, so you come right in and you target calves. It's funny that we both know that all these things too. The partial rep principle. The partials if you can't get the full range, you know, you're going to get the partial build up strength. You know what, you know why we know these crisps because we read the magazines like they were the Bible. And there was nothing else to look at. There was no internet. So we knew everything that was in those magazines and we were brainwashed by them. So that's why we knew and I can have this discussion and we don't even, we don't even know why we know this stuff, right? It's just in the spirit principle. Do you know that one? Oh, go faster to get more reps. Yeah, do faster to create explosive power speech strength. But that's what that's like I was saying before when you were using newer, you know, more weight that you've ever used. You're going to go faster because you're going to be able to get more reps and get used to that weight a little bit. But one of you say that you're going to give a notation to back to Joe. The descending sense principle. The descending sense. That's drop sets. Yeah, drop sets. That's drop sets when you do it, you know, you're doing by-seps with 50, 40, 30s. The staggered sets principle. I don't know what that is. Training several muscle groups together alternating, oh yeah, the muscle groups. Is that joint sense? No, no, that's a giant set. That's another principle. That's when you do like chest and you fatigue on chest and then you'd go do a set of back and then you come back and do chest and then back. Agingistic muscle groups like that. Yeah, and tacking the stick. You got it. And then you got the giant set principle, which I think Leo needs to give. Joe, credit for that one. That's it. And then the instinctive training principle, which is- I wouldn't just do it. Yeah. When you use all those principles, but you don't know why or when you use something. Or you just go to the gym and you might train chest three days in a row because you're instinctually thinking that's what you got to do. Yeah, that sounds like, who would do something like that? That would be like a- Riding course. Yeah. We'd worked for him though. I'd lose muscle. He'd grow three inches on his pecks. Who used to train back every single day? I'd get them with somebody, both said that's totally built it back. I tried to do that once. I tried to do like pull ups every day. You ever hit these people to do that? I get my back at smaller. I got 10 to 90s to my shoulders and everything was hurting me. I couldn't- I couldn't recover from doing back once a week. I needed to do whatever he ate days. You know, these guys were doing it every day. I always tell people, if you have a week body part and you're- and you're instinctually thinking that you should just- You listen to someone else and train it every day a little, like a couple sets. I said, do the opposite, train it less. Because if it's a week it probably means it's not recovering from the workouts. It's probably not the inner training and hard enough. Unless you just- a lazy trainer. Suming an unalazy trainer. I think the worst thing you can do is over-trained weak body parts. Usually that doesn't sound so weak. I mean, maybe for a week or two, that's it. But if you do it more than that, they can think of anything. I'm gonna be terrible. I don't know how people did two body parts a day every day every week, rather. I don't know how they did that. You know, they would do like a chest twice a week and back twice a week. I would be so burnt out on that type of a training regimen. It was terrible. Never worked for me. Works for some people. Doesn't work for me. Ronnie for his whole career did that, right? Yeah. Every three days he was doing it. That was a little he-hany, you know, pretty simple. Every three days you trained body parts. Can you imagine those leg workouts Ronnie did and doing those twice a week? Oh my god. That's why he can't twice cripple now. No, I think he's crippled because of his- Because of his- the weight he was lifting. But yeah, the fact that he wasn't recovering from those things. But he was recovering because he was getting you from this. He was probably doing something. Yeah. Who could train with callmen if he's doing chest? Chest rolls try back by legs, repeat it. And doing it in 150 degree heat in the summer and probably zero degrees in the winter. With no heat or acne shingin' and metrophlex that. Those are like jail-like conditions. I mean, it's crazy. No. No. Don't let's see. One. And figure Diana called the, a cadena. One, the overall there. Sarah Davis, one bikini overall. See you, Ross. Some more. You see. You'll say, I don't give credit to you. We classes anymore. I told you, I talked about bodybuilding was Marla Maria Marathoo. Brian Jones, we talked about classic. That's my, my chide green look-a-like. Yep. Men's physique, Carter Montgomery. Great physique. This guy's got it, wow. Great show. Women's physique. Ashlyn Richardson. She, you know, she's a little more on the smaller side. For women's physique. If you put it in a pose, she'd be like, figure in the pose now. It's weird. I haven't seen too many good like women's physique at the, at the amateur level. They're the pro level. They're great. But the amateur level that they're, they're definitely smaller. There's definitely a big gap between the pro and amateur level and women's physique. Side of things. I've known the least. I don't know if you've known that. No. I know it was a lot of classic. Well, classic is not a good gap because you know why? Because the weight class is a different, which I still don't understand. I don't know why the weight class is would be different for the pros versus the amateurs. But I guess they think the reason I'm sure- Well, they think when you turn pro, they want to have some, I grew up to grow a little bit. But why not just have it in the amateurs and you're right to the pro? That's- that's- that's- doesn't make sense to me. But I guess you know what? Look, there's two-12 in open and pro body playing. So, it doesn't really correspond to the weight classes in the amateurs at all for that respect. But I guess that again, I guess classic is the only really classic has a weight restriction on it. If you think about it in the pros, we're, you know, for every single person. Because your weight restriction is your height, you know? Which is kind of weird when you think about it because if you don't make weight, okay, in a classic physique pros show, right? What's your option? Now, I guess if there's an open or two-12 you can do that, but, you know, assuming you're in there, you can, you're on the, two-12. But you kind of screwed it away, right? Right, you can't compete if you don't fit any of those other categories. Imagine you do a show that only had- Imagine you could travel halfway across the world to Vietnam like this last weekend and to do it to a two-12 to do it. To do it to be a classic and you don't make the weight class. And you got it. You can't compete. It's crazy, right? You can't compete with it. I'm crazy. By the way, speaking of which, let me pull when we pull this up first here. So I'm accurate with what I'm saying. I get emails from people at the time. I don't know what you're doing. Where is this show? There was a show in Vietnam. What's there in Vietnam? Let me pull this in here. Everyone sends me the controversial stuff. And, you know, it's enough to take away the grain of salt because I wasn't there. Let me see what I'm looking for. Oh, here it is. I'm not going to say the person's name. I'd like to highlight you. I guess English is not the first language. But the recent muscle contest show that was in Vietnam and the Philippines. They are using non-qualified I-FB Pro at Judges. Judges from other federations even people have never judged before. I don't know anything about this. What do they want you to do up all? I don't know. They want me to go back to something. First of all, there are no freaking part judges who live in Vietnam. But they want to expect. They want to fight against the same people. Well, you know what? Let me translate to you. I coach who I think should have won gets grew. That's probably where it's coming from. Unqualified Judges. Like, what's that mean? They have no, you know what? I hear that all the time. They're unqualified. He never competed. Well, I mean, it is nice to know that somebody competed. It really, really is. I mean, I would like to be on stage and have gay plumbo. Judge me or, you know, sort of judge me or who's a Raymond judge me or a black slowest judge me. But at the same time, there are damn good judges. Some who don't even look like they work out. Maybe they never have. I mean, I still kept in touch with fans for like 30 years. Who I still say, hey, who do you have in the top five in the show? Because they have a great eye. And some of these people who I know, I swear to God, if you saw me, it's a, what's he doing at bodybuilding shows? He just a fan. Yeah, no one's ever happy, you know that. They have a show. I thought maybe it was, you show, they have a show in Singapore, this coming weekend. But that's obviously not what they're talking about because they're talking about a show that took place. If someone says to come to Singapore, they've mean you'll go, well, abandon in the wives, abandon in the kids. I said my wife down to see them. And they get down to the home school woman. We'll go to Singapore cover the show. Yeah. If you actually told you wife, Dave and I got to go to Vietnam this weekend. I can say that on the radio show. I did it would never happen. She'd be like, you're not going to. He, he, he. Lose the power, Dave, somebody told me once you lose the power when you get married. My dad, that's my dad. So I think he took it. Yeah, he took it. That's right. He warned me. Speaking of my dad, he's, he's still hanging in there. I don't know how he's doing it to be honest with you. My dad hasn't had any food or liquids for four days now. I just wanted to thank everyone else. I've been getting a tremendous amount of text and emails for people, you know, setting prayers and giving all kinds of emotional support. So I, I appreciate it. I, I, I, I put it out there just because I, I like to keep my life out there and let everyone know it's going on in my life. And a lot of people responded. I didn't even think that they were going to because you know, my dad's a daddy. He's just, he's dying, but he's not dead yet, but we've been trying to go there and spend a lot of quality time out and going there every day and spend several hours, you know. I don't see, I go in and out of the room because he's kind of like, you'll fall asleep and he's not really speaking much anymore. But although he yelled, ma, ma, a couple of times today. There's a nurse for me. It's my dad. If my dad was only if they got my dad can't speak because if he was alive, you'd be like, you know, because the nurse looks just like his mother. She does. I can understand where he's coming from. It's not even like that he's like screwing up too much because, do we get a load of this one? So, you know, man, it came by the kids. My son is like, he just, he would try to explain to him the whole process of like, my father's like, it'd be very difficult, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What can he really get? Right, well, man, as like, explaining, you know, that the pop is going to be with Jesus. The Jesus is going to come take him. And, you know, like he did. And then, it's funny. She was explaining to him, and then, well, since she sees, they walk up the driveway, there's like a dead snake on the driveway. And she's like, you see the snake? Snake? But the Jesus would stake there. The snakes with the Jesus, you know. Yeah. He came it, understood the whole. Oh, but I think he does. I don't know. But he goes there and he likes to say pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Which every time he does is my father, you can tell my father is responding. He definitely hears what's going on. It's amazing how your body can shut down, but your hearing seems to be the last sense that still stays. And I don't know what that is. You think it's something of like evolutionary thing, you know, for survival. It's a good point. I really, I really get it. Well, what comes for us? You are safe when you, when you, when you, when you're being formed in the womb. I don't know. I forget. I have to get my embryology. But I'll tell you this, what's the most important for survival? I guess would be hearing, right? To hear a predator coming. Because what if it's dark out? You know, your vision is not going to really help you in the dark, right? So I guess hearing was always like a very important sense. You know, for survival before we had houses and, you know, when we were in the wild, so to speak. And that must be why these two, these two, these two, these two, these two. Because if you say the right thing to him and he, and it's touching or whatever, it's some kind of emotional thing. You can sometimes like, see, a tear and his eye and man, it was saying, look, Salve, you hear me blink, you know, he's blinking. So, I don't know. He's hanging in, I like I said that. I never heard, I always thought you couldn't last one two days without lick fluids, but my father had nothing to eat or drink for four days and he's still pretty safe. I mean, he actually looks pretty good. He probably did seven days for the do your girl. So, you know, fluid. That's why he made the way. Yeah, my father's getting stride to glutes now because he's, his body's absorbing all the fluids. You know, you have to make my father would say the, and I said this to him. I said, dad, you know, you taught me that you got to find the absurdity and everything in life. And so, this got to be some absurdity and something ironic about what's going on here. You know, you're going to a better place. You know, it's funny that you, you told me the absurdity is that he's, that he's on wuffy and, and it's a decrease from, it's like the way they decrease principles. Yeah, you know what I mean? I couldn't figure out why you'd be like, we were talking about pain principle. I couldn't figure out why father was so sensitive and everybody's, so in touches on him. And then one of the nurses said, did he drink, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he, did he did that a drinker? I said, well, I don't know, was a bottle of wine, a day of drinking. She's like, yeah, that would probably qualify. And I said, well, what about like, the 80 millionaires of oxy-content twice a day? Which he was not, he was actually on less when he was living in a system living, because he had no stress, he was only 20. But I guess what happens is when I give you a morphine drip, my father's actually getting less pain kill of the new, he was getting when he was taking the pills. So he was, they were under, you know, they, they think they keep it uncomfortable on an IV drip of a morphine. He's actually, he's in with the draw for this stuff. So he had up his dosage. What is this? What, what would be the way to principal, the weeder says to desage, I suppose, desage, desage. Yeah. So anyway, it's kind, it's very sad, obviously, the whole situation. But you know, my dad's 88, and I, I think, once again, I tell people, and I said this, and I know my father would agree with this, I would rather my father pass on knowing who I am than getting to a point where he didn't remember who I was anymore, because I think that would be horrible. Because then it's like, had he, comfort someone who doesn't even know who you are, you know? Yeah. So he's like, me, he knows me. He knows my son, Logan, if you mentioned that in 80, and see, he knows that. He knows my cousin Michael, who he was very instrumental in raising, helping raise. If you, if you tell my wife's name is Claudia, even though it's a man to, I'll know Claudia, you might know man, I mean, you know, Claudia knows her as Claudia, consistently as Claudia. And that's my, that's his brother's ex wife's name, I don't know where he came up with that, but that's what he always calls a man to him. It's a sincere matter. And so he's still in there. I kept going every day, I might go there, and I'm like, I think this is the last day. He gets through another day. I'm trying to just enjoy all the time I got with him left. But once you get back, you guys, I appreciate what out there. Who sent their well wishes and everything like that. Crazy. Crazy. And didn't hear. I put up a, a man, if reminded me that I did a, ask, ask, we did a, on the old movie must of TV show. I remember that, that video, I remember you sending that to me. It seemed like it was 2013, it seemed like it was yesterday. Yeah. And he was, I, I told you many, many times, I told everyone I told Dave, you got to give him his own show once a week. Talk about Dave, so what, what did you get to talk about? It said two cares. Yeah. I should have, well, I should have taken more of them there because he was, he was so animated, my phone that I forgot how like with it he was. He was still losing. He was still, he was still, he was still, he was still, he was still, he was still, he was still there right? I don't know what he was doing. But that's what he was just like really, really, we should have taken tons of wine. I know that. That was the, like right in the beginning when you started to really lose his memory. So I, I was doing this, what would dad, what answer, we did like a quiz show, what would dad, what would Dave's dad say? And I would ask the people in the studio, I'd give him a question. And then I go to the clip that we filmed with me asking my father a certain question. Like, what's, when's my birthday or, you know, how many times have you been married? All these, like, things that he should know. And you got it. I just go rewatched, I don't want to run a friend of mine. It's pretty funny, you know. And the funny thing is that one of the people on the show I had was a very long time childhood friend of mine, Larry Ushah, and Larry jumped off the Verizano Bridge. I had given him the nickname, the Bridge Jump, because he actually won't have only two people, however, lived from jumping off the 200 times. I told my son that story the other day. How's that? Go ahead. Unfortunately, he wanted a couple years later. He's successful though. Yeah, I believe he owed it on heroin, yeah. Some kind of drugs. I think it was New Year's Eve or something like that. Kill themself. But terrible, but he was great on the show. No, and he knew my dad really well too, which was pretty funny, because he grew up around the corner for me. And so he was used to shovel my dad's walk and the winter, and he would break the leaves and remove the lawn and the summer. While he was going through the loss, actually, he probably was still a lawyer. He was just going through it. Then he actually read that a room in one of my rental houses for me for five years. So I just knew this guy. So, well, it's ironic that he was in that episode of my dad. And he'll probably be mowing my dad's lawn and heaven up there somewhere. He never knew. But how's your dad doing? My dad is not doing well. Yes. He's, you know, he's a good guy. He's got dementia. So it's, you know, you never improved. You only have good days and worst days. The progress base. Well, you know, they fall on the falling. Yeah, falling again. Um, he broke his hip and it never healed. Oh, it didn't. Because he was too stubborn to do any type of therapy for it. So, but I don't know if it was being stubborn or, you know, because he's by nature stubborn. Well, it's probably safer because now he's not walking around. So he's not going to be, you know, true. True. You know, it's so blinding there. So, um, but, you know, holidays where he seems decent. And then, you know, right when you think like, well, he's really not that bad. You know, he's not that bad. And then he realized, like, he could visit another day and you say, yeah, he's not bad. Yeah, they have bad days, they have bad days. So, and he would have, you know, bad days, of course, one, you know, any day. So, you know, I hate to make this show about death because a lot of people who died, I want to just mention, and you know, this person, I didn't even know he died. His girlfriend contacted us through our ex-Muscle's Instagram account. Carliske Doi, his wife, he's sorry, his wife. Carliske Doi, you remember my friend down in Brazil, he's the cover of the Brazil. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, amazing. I give him a hand. Because he's driving us around and he was our translator. Great guy, you know, he was, I don't even know what the cause of death is, but men, he's got a young baby, you know, he's leaving behind wife, and he had been sick, but he had beat it and I don't really, we have to be in a blood disorder, and I don't really know exactly if that's what took his life. But he had started a website like for us, I remember, like we did, like, after our ex-Muscle, because we had, you know, worked with him so much, he started a Brazilian website, site and he was covering shows and he had a YouTube channel and I actually named his YouTube channel for him a game of the name. And he was at the Arnold this year. I mean if I got him press passes I validated because Matt Loris called me up because if you know if this guy said yeah he's a good guy. Game press passes. So he was really doing well with that and unexpectedly got the freaking phone call terrible. Then I saw in the news you pointed out to me that Jerry Lawless son Brian Christopher and said he got arrested for DWI he was in his jail celly hung himself. What's going on with people? What's with the suicide Chris? Is depression that deeply rooted in our society? It is. It's a successful people. We talked about Anthony Bourdain a few weeks ago now this guy. Wow. And then of course Nicolas Volkov dare to die. Nicolai Volkov another WWE Hallfamer from. He was like who was he the tag team partner with the particular guy? Yeah he was the actual number he was. The one you mentioned before the iron sheep. They were like tag team partners. They won the championship belt. Boy, very, very back. And he died. He was the 70s. But a lot of people died in the sweet unfortunately. Here's a good story for you. Do you follow gymnastics women's gymnastics a little? I don't think you can follow these. Well Simone Biles is probably the winningest. Yeah, everyone's Simone. She's the most winningest. Probably the best greatest gymnast of all time. She won in the Olympic gold. And she's making a comeback now. And she did her first meet back. I didn't even, I didn't even, for a year or something like that. Or over here. And she won. And I'm looking at her physique. This girl's got the greatest genetics of all time. She, if she wanted to be like a figure like pro, she probably would be a figure pro. Or at least she would certainly be a fitness pro. They would be no doubt about that. She probably would be mislump if she wanted to. Just crazy genetics. I always love it when I see someone who's like a super, super talented person who could just, they could take time off and then come back and just still be at the top of the game. Unbelievable. I just, you know, just some people have a genetic gifts that are just leaps and bounds above everyone else. Of course she happens to be one of those people. Most gymnasts stop competing after they're teenagers. And I think she's probably got the kind of genetics she can probably compete until she's 30 if she wanted to. Crazy. Crazy. What else do I want to talk about? I have a quarter of the week, Chris, which I think is important. And it, and I'm going to prophesy by telling my dad story first. My dad, the least, the second half of his life, I think, was just a very pessimistic person, which is ironic because I'm the complete opposite. I'm like, I'm almost two non-pestive a second. Maybe his pessimism led to your optimism. Maybe. Maybe. I always try to convert him. I couldn't do it. And the, the quarter of the week is you cannot have a happy ending to an unhappy journey. You cannot have a, yeah. Do not have a happy ending to an unhappy journey. No, you're miserable at the time. And it's not good and well, fear. You're not going to have, you're not going to achieve what you want. You've got to change your mindset first if you want to have success and anything you do. I always, I, you know, I see there's a lot of people who battled the pressure in the body-pilling world. And those people, they always find a way to screw up the contest prep. I don't have a deal with it, but it's true because I think they attract negativity to themselves. And if you want to have a happy ending, meaning if you want to do well, achieve whatever you set your mind to, you got to eliminate the negative from your life. You can't be sitting around miserable. Time where you're going to attract more misery and you're going to find the way to screw it up. You have to see these people, Chris. You're like, how do they held this guy screw up two days before a show? It's everything in the, in the, in the Chinese buffet and then screws it up. Or how does this person get into a car accident? You know, the, the day of the show, what the hell they doing driving around? You know, it's like people, they, they, they find the way to screw up. Well, someone said to me, someone that probably could be considered depressing. I mean, a bodybuilder said to me today, they, it's, it's not someone I help, but it's, it's a good professional bodybuilder. He made me. And he said, he was talking about going to extremes. He said, I think my body fights extremes. You know, like when I, you know, fight extremes in the process of dieting and unworked, you know, make me go low carbs, high cardio. And I think it was just, you know, way of seeing what I would say to him. And I said, um, I said, well, there's always a time to be extreme. You know, you don't have to be extreme all the way through, but, you know, being extreme can be beneficial. So don't rule it out, you know, just because your body, quote, you know, just work well with, with extremes. And he said, well, maybe I go, maybe I resort to the extremes for paranoid reasons thinking about, you know, good enough. And I'll just, you know, do the three hours of cardio in 10 carbs a day just because of fear, you know, unreasonable fear of it. I'm not going to be a chea. There's not way higher coach so the coach can say, don't do three hours. You don't need to do this. Yeah, they, they hired you, but they said, you, you could do the same thing. I can't be one. That was my next subject. I was going to talk. I didn't really want to talk about it. I didn't really want to talk about it. I, I wanted to give you a chance to divorce a big as Nick Trigilli. Um, was, well, I actually like, I actually thought I, I interviewed him on our show a couple weeks ago, and then I went on his show. And then interviewed to help his channel on YouTube a little bit get some notoriety. So I noticed he's not competing for tire from competing and he's looking to make money. And obviously coaching people. And you know, but he came out with some kind of products, you know, that I did not, and I'm not only going to go into it, but you see, watch, but I, you can watch my response video on our channel to see what I'm talking about. But he came out with some kind of sight injection, oil, not even oil. It's a sight injection, a hyaluronic acid product, which doesn't do anything when you put the muscle. And I did a, I did a video on it, basically saying that there's no science behind it, and it's ridiculous. And that's what I do. You know, I'm not going to endorse something. I'm not going to tell people this is great if it's something out there that's irresponsible. And he obviously took offense to it, and he went on this channel two days in a row, and it was bashing my coaching, which is ironic because your people, 25 years, you know, I have more pro cards, you know, for people that I've helped, you know, than he'll ever get his entire life. And the funny thing is that he was bashing the fact that I give similar diet to, to, to multiple people who happen to be in, and claiming that I am overcharging people, and I'm taking the initiative, like I'm like some kind of like scumbag or something like that. And, you know, he even mentioned your name, also that you charged too much money, and this and that. And I don't think I charged enough, but yeah. The funny thing is that I'm the manager, I charge whatever I want. If people are going to be stupid enough to pay me, I can, you know, now it's a feeble attempt, obviously, to get people to leave people. Because he badmouthed the Matt Jensen and the couple of people to obviously. So I'm not giving you tomorrow's Jose and, uh, saying more, sending money back this year. No, but he's doing it, obviously, to drum up more business for himself, but the irony is, and I went on this, I went on this rant that I basically explained what coaching. You know, if you, let's, you know, let's say you're helping someone for 16 weeks, and over that 16 weeks they give you, you know, 40 updates, you know, 40 checkins with you probably more. You know, if you're depends on, you know, how much you need to interact with the person. And if you're changing their program 40 times during this week, or you've let's even half the time to change it, changing it 20 times, then the program you initially give them is not really the program because it's not a static program. And if someone waste 220 pounds and they're a male and they're competing in body building, how many different diets really are there, right? I mean, if you would give someone a different diet, then you'd give the other person to kind of visit the same category, okay, and try to achieve the same goals. You'd actually be cheating one of the people, just because you're trying to be different and make it seem like you're giving them something unique. You'd be actually a Charlton to give someone a different diet than you know, was the perfect diet for that, right? The perfect start diet at least. This is nothing stays the same because some people get more food, some people get less food, some people get more cardio, some people get less cardio, some people get more fat burn, some people get less fat burn. And coaching is how you craft and change and mold the diets that you pick the person to be the best that they can be on contest day. That's what big of coach is about it. Now he wouldn't know that because he's not really a coach, he's a guy who just started helping people using other people's programs that he's used in the past. And he's trying to learn how to do that, and that's fine, and that's maybe one day he'll be a good coach. Takes years and years and years to obviously have experienced to do that. And I found that I arrived that he was attacking me for that, and that's just really because he was just mad that I put down his product. But then he started bringing up your name and Matt Jensen's name and a few other guys out there, which he couldn't hold their jock strap these guys, as far as coaching goes. So I thought it was ironic that he would do that. I think a lot of people agreed with what I said on the thing because it looked on them, I'm not trying to say I'm better than anyone, anything. But I certainly know what it is to be a coach, you're a matter of fact, they train coaches with my secrets to becoming a thai guru, of course. And I get people different templates, and that's that's what being a coach is about. It's taking templates and applying it to the person that you're using and then changing it as necessary. That's what coaching is, it's a dynamic program. And a lot of people don't understand that. They think it's about, okay, I'm going to give this guy 14p's to eat with this meal, and the other guy will give 16p's of corn, and the other guy I'm going to give, you know, ground turkey, and this guy I'm going to give, ground chicken breast, and just trying to make something unique for the sake of making unique, just make sure that it's better salesman doesn't make it, you're better coach. And I'm sure you've written thousands and thousands of diets over the years, press and I'm sure most of them are pretty similar. Because that's what works, you know what works, you know. Yeah, I don't even bother to bash them back, I don't want to laugh. That's the bash, I just, it's more about education, because I think that a lot of people don't really know what it is to coach people. They don't understand it, they think it's like, all right, I'm, you know, I have this, this goal to win the USA championships, and I need a unique program. Reagan, you're not getting your money back. I need a unique program that's going to make me better than the next guy. And I'm paying Chris Asito, you know, a hundred thousand dollars, he'd better give me something that's going to be just for me. The bottom line is, how do you look on contest day? That's the bottom line, isn't it? Yeah, it is the bottom line, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what type of diet you used. No, it's a front line. The coach shows how to manipulate whatever they're giving you to get you to that end point. It doesn't really matter, the process, you know, everyone has their own process. And when I train coaches, I tell them that, I say, look, here's the starting point. This is the science of what you're doing. Now take this and make it your own. And you're going to develop your own techniques with your own templates, with your own ideas of how you apply this to people. And that's what's going to make you a great coach. The only thing you can do now is you've got to get experience and do a lot of diets for people. And you're going to learn on the way how to manipulate things and how to make your own changes. That's just the nature of the beast. They say to be great and to come and master it anything, Chris, you have to do it for at least ten years. So, look down on the shadow of a devil. And I believe that because I believe that. I believe that, ask anyone who's going to successful business, take some ten years to really get it fine, fine, tuning. You know what I mean? I thought I think it took us ten years before that this radio show got good. We're just about to ten year mark this year. It's actually our 10 years. So we should be great. We'll be masters of radio next year, Chris. We'll be, we'll be other people. We'll be a master's degree. What's happening with the radio? Great idea. The top 70 by building podcasts. Yeah. That lead. She probably like took the surhead on the sand every time a stone probably. Yeah. And he from friends over there's got to be someone who knows this person. Yeah. I, by the way, did I did a rant also on Dyside and had a dry out for a bodybuilding competition about how to do it? I really did. How did different direct work? Yeah. Give me this. Give me this. You know, the close no, the close no, the plan. Well, I just explained what, why, what the different dioretics do for out act on versus like a dioryside versus like a LASIX. And why Dyside tends to be the dioretic of choice because it's very predictable because it's not. It's potassium sparing, but it doesn't stifle out us around if you cramp on Dyside. It's because you're so re-inducated. And it's an easy fix. And so, you know, I explained why I felt I felt the Dyside was the most that that beneficial dioretic to use. It's very predictable and you can cut, sort of problem solve easy with it. And obviously Dyside has different names in different countries. The maxide and dietyde and moderetic and this different version of it. But it's their old dual dioretics that kind of balance sodium potassium loss. So because whenever you give dioretics to obviously, I don't have to tell you this. If you're losing potassium and sodium and something goes wrong, you don't really know how to remedy the situation because you're not doing blood work for the person. So you don't really know what their electrolytes are doing. So it's always nice to have a dioretic where you know that the only thing that you can possibly be losing would be sodium. So that was the rant. And you know, because a lot of people, I did we take for granted that we know this Chris, because we've been doing it so long, but there's a lot of new people coming at the point they know nothing about those that last week of getting rid of water and carbing up and using dioretics. And it's almost like it's scary for them because they have no clue. And you know what, you and I once again, we take it for granted because it's so intuitive to us how to do this that we've forgotten what it's like that when we were first doing it for the very first time. You know, I don't know what to do, right? Bob probably told Bob Grush can probably told you what to do and you just probably listen, but you didn't know. You know, of course, you know, those coolers. And you were lucky to hear Bob Grush can most people don't have a Bob Grush game, you know. No. So, nothing down. We have to get the girl club. You get the girl class. Right, yeah, that's I teach all that stuff in the garage. I have to make the new class that's probably going to be in October. I haven't made it. Maybe you could give like a like a little water or something from like the Bob Grush in a word for best like a 10 to a student. Oh, yeah, it's good. It's good, you're right. I like that. Guru have a Guru of the year, the Bob Grush and Guru of the year award. They can give it out to Mr. Lepia competition along with the whole fame ceremony. You know, what's happening? I keep saying, you know, we used to kid. Shouldn't they do we would we would we would we would kid on this show. Dave, hold on. We used to kid on this show years ago about I used to say, we're going to have a Guru summit. And that kind of led to the Guru of the classes. It did because I took that and said, you know, you're right, Chris. And I thought I started holding the Guru classes. Because I used to make fun of a handy and and George, you know, and say, we'll invite them or fly them to like to heady and what would be how. We'll want you know, the people there and you know, bring the rock into fishier. If we get fighting and and then we used to also say. We used to talk about. And nobody built in class. Right, classic. Yeah. And I remember you saying, I think we need a new class. And we were talking about the ball of chicken. Oh, it was a big ball. I was going to do a little. And in lowly holds. Here's classic physique. Yeah. We were talking about that way back. We knew it was necessary. Once once men's physique came out, it was absolutely necessary. The bridge that the two because they were too far apart from each other. And that's why if they never came out with men's physique, we wouldn't need it. We wouldn't have a middle ground because people were stuck in the middle late. They didn't know what to do. And that's why it was that's why we we weren't crazy. I did an iron rageous pass. We also with Lee priest about who the toughest mr. Limpi was. And I wanted to ask you your opinion on that. Not the best mr. Limpi the toughest. The guy who was the hardest to beat. And I'll tell you, you probably didn't watch the video. So I'm not going to say who I. Lee and I kind of agreed on this way. The hardest one to beat. Yeah, who is the hardest guy to beat? In history, you mean? Yeah, like which of the mr. Limpi is. Who is the guy who we like? Oh man, this guy is just he's just he's relentless. You can't beat him. Well, you mean his physique or him? It doesn't matter. It's the same thing. Who is the hardest mr. Limpi to beat? Well, I would I would. You'd you'd have to go back to Dorgon probably. Yeah, that's exactly who we said. Do you know because he was able to fend off. The grand silence of our history. Well, he he had to fend off. You know, the best of room we ever saw he had to fend off him. You know, we all are. You know, we all are. He had to fend off now. He had to fend off. Sean Ray. Yeah. He had to fend him off all the one show. He's one thing is one thing to fend off. You know, to beat like a really good the room, which a really good the room was the first year I run if we never ever owned it the Limpi out. Yeah, 97. And that was the best without a shadow of a doubt. That Sean Ray had ever looked. But also to you know, be we were in 93. You know, people forget how crazy we will look at that show. Sean Ray looked unbelievable with that show. The only reason Dory in one that was because that was his best year. Yeah. So, you know, when you do it year after year. He was, you know, his tough as nails. You couldn't beat this even wheel of city because I never really thought that I could beat Dory and I thought so or him is unbeatable, which is weird because Dory didn't have like a Ronnie Coleman physique. He had a flex wheel or his physique. He just he was mentally so strong. That's what the problem was. And that's why I'm saying I don't think Dory and had the greatest physical time. I think he just was one of the hardest guys to beat because he was relentless. You know, he was going to be his best every time. And it didn't matter if he had injuries. He was not missing that show. He competed with more injuries that guy than any other body but in the history of the sport probably. He didn't branch. Branch Warren looked like a jug. His branch would get the injuries after the show. At least he wouldn't have them at the show. You know what I mean? Dory was like a peat with torn biceps and torn triceps and the quads that were like you know half attached. So he just he was just tough as nails. You know that's all that that's all there was. You couldn't you couldn't budge this guy. Mentally either. He was just too too damn tough. You'd never be able to on stage. He was like Roberto Durant. He was like you couldn't even catch him smiling on stage. Right? No. Was the interest in smiling? Yeah. He was there to do battle. You know, and that's it. And no one and he got involved in no one's drama. He didn't know anything that was going on. He would hide out and you know, England the whole year and he'd come out to do a little guess posing here and there. But go right back to the dungeon over there. A temple gym. You can't get through to a guy like that. You think he if he was competing in today's social media. He still wouldn't get through to him. He probably wouldn't even be on social media. He wouldn't have a social media page. Right. You know who don't. Yeah. You know what? I don't even think he does but he doesn't. Craig Richardson won that show and he doesn't really. I mean he has like an Instagram page but he has like 10 posts. And like nine of us family. I think that you know maybe that like one body of the picture. He don't care. Yeah. Well, that's that's why he's he's able to focus in and he doesn't he doesn't even worry about what the people. Probably doesn't even know who after people he competing is. No, he doesn't. He doesn't. He doesn't. That that's the best way to be. Somebody these guys. Somebody these guys have lost the battle because before they even arrive at the show because he's so worried about who they competing. Of course they've seen the filter pictures of their competition. They come to get killed exactly. Well, anyway, next this coming weekend is the Tampa Pro and Chris you'll be down there with Rafael Novalo photographer and John Hanson. You'll be doing some good coverage for us. And John. John. John. Yeah. Well, he lives there. So he'll be there the whole time. Oh, then we do it all time. Yeah. I'll go. You know what? I'm going to go by his house. He must have a little haul thing going on. Yeah. You should go back there and do you guys should do a video. I just had his place. I mean, you should interview him at his house. I think. Tell John to pull the video camera out and have someone hold it. You interview John in his house. He'll probably show you every the trophy that he got when he was like six years old. Yeah, this is me. The teenage Chicago land. I was 14 years old. I got second and actually the open glass. You know what the funny thing is? I saw pictures. He put it some video up of like his first show or something like that. He looks exactly the same as he does now. Doesn't he? He looks like he looks like this. Yeah. He looks like this. He looks like this. He still looks like he's like 14 years old. You know, John. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was like a recent thing. He looks exactly the same. He has not changed one bit. He hasn't lost the hair on his head. And he still got a great physique. You know, so it's really pretty funny. But that's John John. There's no one that I know that loves body building. And lives body building more than John Hanson. I'd say that. He has a secret hall of payment is based on it. But I can say that because you know it. At some point I stopped. You know, it's with the competition. It's a bit like this. There's the inies. He still eats. I bet it can brass, you know, every week. I thought that's a Chuck. That's this is. You know, you have a little weird things in Hall of Fame. Yeah. That's a Chuckly any use of use for the 85 Olympia. New York City first year 243 pounds. You. I got that chart from him. He gave that to me. Thanks to him. I put it in the Hall of Fame in the future. Yeah. That can't. That's a that's an actually. Starkest canotony is for Loufrey knows come back in 1993. Blue first class with Dave Blumbo. You know, been up at canotony. I'm just too scared to write it. Yeah. You know what the funny thing is? If I was going to start a Hall of Fame, I would. The job would be the first person I would call. To get all the collect all the, you know, all the fact, to wait and all that stuff. You know, this. You know, this. You know, this. You just go ahead. Well, if you ever go to a Hall of Fame, you see they have like quotes on the walls and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. He would be needed. This is a syringe used by great Valentino for the movie. The exploding arms. There's probably a vessel. No, you got to get Peter McGaff and you get John Hanson in a room. And with someone taking notes in video tape in the whole thing. And you got to get a strong, you need an actual star for like in the court. It could type of thousand miles a minute. To get all the information down to to be accurate. Who knows, I might do that in my later years. Hopefully John Hanson will still be alive. This is a pipe. Come here. Use when you enter the sound factory after this. Here's a crackfight. Oh, man. Chris, uh, I don't know. We give up the power. You give up the power. That's the theme of the show. Yeah. Remember, you can't, you cannot have a happy ending to an unhappy journey. I think that's the core of the week. And on that note, uh, until next week, remember with heavy muscle radio. The truth hurts. Good night, everyone.

I'm gonna be launching the tasty pastry with a low carb hot tart. We've got three and four grams in that carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back! Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is Friday, June 18th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Happy Friday, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. Again, we have another great show lined up for you today. Starting with the brand new list of invites for the Arnold Classic that released a few days ago. Besides the fact that seeing the list right in front of us really hammered home, the idea that this is real now one of the other things that jumped off the page to me was the depth of this lineup. In pretty much every division we have current champions coming back to defend their titles. Four champions trying to win their titles back and five or six other athletes who could be a serious threat to win the whole goddamn thing. This is basically Bodybuilding's version of a winner take-all conference championship game that sets the stage for the big final showdown less than a month later. So buckle up because things are bad to get wild. Being catch yesterday's show, we did a segment on Sergio, leave a junior's decision to pull out of the Chicago pro. But the thing we didn't talk about that you all know now was that he had already confirmed that he was planning to compete at the Arnold a few months later. Even though the official invite list hadn't been released yet. People might not remember this because it feels like it was 100 years ago now. But Sergio actually placed fifth in the Arnold last year behind William Bonac, Dexter Jackson, a big ran the instee of Ku Klou, which would tell you how good he must have been in that top group. And considering the fact that two of those four names I just mentioned aren't competing this year on paper that makes him a top three contender. And I don't think we can talk about potential winners without mentioning his name and the conversation. Before I wrap up the Arnold coverage for today, I want to highlight one more athlete who deserves some recognition. Sung truly. We haven't talked about him before on this show, which is my fault because it's long overdue. Now, if you're staring at your screen, trying to figure out why his name isn't ringing a bell, it's because he's only competed once in the IFVV. But it was at the Olympia last year where he actually placed 12th ahead of people who had a lot more coverage and name recognition heading into that show. I heard some rumors a few days ago about him potentially competing at the Tampa Pro, which could be huge in terms of boosting his profile considering the other names we already know will be there. He's underappreciated and underrated, but I wouldn't bet against him being a sleeper at one of these big shows later this season. If any of you are going to be in the Dallas area this weekend, you might want to drop in and check out the Dallas Europa show. And if you get there early enough, you might be able to get a front row seat for 20 to Varys, making his season debut in Classic physique. I don't know if seeing his name on the Arnold invite adds more pressure or motivation, but from a fans perspective, I do think it raises the bar to a certain extent. He caught a lot of people by surprise when he won the Savannah Pro last year, but that element of surprise is gone now. So if he's going to start building some real momentum heading into the big showcase at the Arnold, this is the perfect opportunity to do it. And that does it the end of another edition of Lassal in the morning on Dave O'Lumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Thank you.

Dave Alamo here with an RX muscle news update the Tampa Pro 2012 has led out and we have a new champion, Carruth Bajo, Wednesday event, he is going to the Olympia to his first Olympia and it couldn't be proud of for him because I actually worked with him and he's worked his butt off of his last couple of years, winning his pro-quart at a master's event which a lot of people think doesn't translate to the open division. I knew we had the talent to do it. He's worked his way up the ranks, he plays third, a lot of people 40 couldn't have a little higher in Chicago two weeks ago and I said look you're going to come back, we're going to bring you an even tighter than you were before and that's exactly what we did and he came in, he was probably right around 2-12 for the Chicago pro and I had him down to probably 208-207 because I knew the conditioning was going to be the key factor for who wins this show especially going up against guys like John's here with who's known for his conditioning, almond el de saudi known for conditioning and structure. I know Carruth has tons of muscle on his body, it's put together and it laid out well, he really has no flaws in this physique in terms of gaps and I sit to myself Carruth, you got to come and peel through the ball, he's got a suffer and that's exactly what he did, he did in complaint, he suffered, he dieted, he cardioed, he virtually went, you know, no car is held fact for a couple days just to really bring him out a little drier to bring in every little detail and that's exactly what the doctor ordered for this show because conditioning I think was the winning factor looking at this lineup and looking at the pictures and the videos that were up there because Carruth has a lot of wealth with physically know that but when you bring him on stage and he turns around and hits a bad thubble by step and he's got to loosen hamstrings that's impressive with his physique and his structure and that's what won it for Carruth guys out here. almond el de saudi from the front, you know you see that front double by step of almond and man it is you almost get scared it's so good his waist is so tiny he's got those big arms but I felt it from behind he could have been harder and I think it had he really run it out from behind he could have won this show because he's got a lot of bells and whistles to his physique he's got a lot of wow I really I've been a very big advocate of his physique from day one I think he's going to be great pro he's going to be on that Olympia stage battling it out he's got to bring him better conditioning from behind he's got to bring those glutes and hamstrings ridiculous not just lines but ridiculous and what he does that he's going to be very very dangerous. Boluas look this guy is super impressive we've set up before and he's one shows he he's a guy who you know when you're competing in a lineup you don't want to have to stand next to it because he'll make it look bad but once again he did not bring the levels conditioning from behind that I felt he needed to really take home the victory here. I believe it's hot anyone that's hot for could have won this show. Hi they've been if they're best character with his and his best this year and on this day in this show John's do it he's the guy who's always the most condition guy in the show but he's also the guy but if he doesn't bring the ridiculous conditioning and he only brings good conditioning he can be beaten and I think that's what happened here today he brought a full look rounder look but he gave up a little bit of that insane conditioning that he brings to the stage and maybe he was you know maybe the judge is told to come and forward but I felt he lost a little a little bit of sharpness from especially from behind a little bit even from the front and the abdominal area and I think that's why he wanted to be forth you because he easily could have come in here and won this show he's got the tool set to do it we know that everyone that top fork win a pro show on any given day terror badge however was the man of the night he brought the goods he brought the conditioning and he is going to the Olympia congratulations to character I couldn't be happy if he am my friend and that's going to take us to the end of this little wrap up tomorrow will be the man's open and we will be back highlighting what happens there for now though I am capable of both with an Rx muscle news update

It's Humpty here at Muscle in the Morning and I'm the Palombo and today is Wednesday, July 18, 2018. And let's find out what's going on in the world of body-building and fitness. Just when you thought you were going to have to call off work today to avoid another Humpty Disaster, there comes another live and direct edition of RXMuscle.com's World Famous Recap Wednesday to help you through your morning. We're going to kick off today's show with a full rundown of the hottest ticket in the week in the London Murray Classic. In the Men's Music Division, veteran Greg Brandt continued his resurgence season as he managed to earn his first win and his first Olympia qualification in one wildly emotional night. Pop owners in the Bikini Division went to Ashley Janell who seems to be getting yourself back on track at the perfect time now. And in women's body-building Swiss import, Jacqueline Fuchs was brilliant in her win over one of the last line of that we've seen all season long. Right up until a few days ago, the only thing I really knew about Portugal was that they were one of the only countries in the world to decriminalize the use of all drugs. But apparently, they've got themselves a strong body-building scene over there as well. Right there in the heart of Lisbon, we had an all-out war go down that might have just given us a snapshot of what the future of the 2012 division looks like as Hotty Schuppen in Nicholas Vulliatte, bowled it out for 2012 supremacy. And when the dust finally settled, it was Schuppen who managed to come out on top. But the highlight real effort we saw from Vulliatte in this season, a view was definitely worth mentioning. Overall, on the Men's Music side, Italian star, David Amazalari, collected his second win of the season with another monster effort here. And the top owners in women's physique went to check native, Linka, Farenca Kova. And in the bikini division, Ukraine's Ludmila, Nassanava, outpaced the rest of the field, and wrapping up things in the figure division with the decisive victory with Italy's Zulima Durair. If you and your friends are ever sitting around wondering what the temperature in hell feels like, well, all you need to do is go out and hit the digger strip in mid July right around 3pm. And now that Enfuego bikini star, Jennifer Duria is about to crank up the heat index this weekend, all of a sudden we're talking about a whole new level of hot. For only this week, Duria now is the choose planning to bring her talents out to Cincinnati this weekend for the battle in the desert. We're shall be looking to keep the momentum going from the her monster's second place effort at the Vancouver Pro two weeks ago. Duria has been a beast of epic proportions in every step of the road this season. And now that she's using this mid summer stretches her personal tune up for the Olympia, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if she marched out of there with another win, tucked safely in her back pocket. With the amount of talent that we've gotten the men's physique division right now, sometimes judging these shows feel like it comes down to who timed the best. And from where I'm sitting, it looks like the time could be now for better and stand out to Nell Rodriguez, according to my sources, Rodriguez and his camp are in the process of reloading the chamber to take another shot at clenching their third straight Olympia birth. Over the last month or so we've seen Rodriguez put together a handful of top six finishes, including the top three finishing pulled off down at the next go super show, where he's probably at his all-time best. So as long as he treats his body right and doesn't try to do anything crazy, I can see a scenario where he ends up qualifying on point by the time September finally rolls around. A few weeks ago LeBron James almost broke the internet. When he single-handedly shifted the balance of power in the NBA, when he's styling with the LA-akers, and based on what I've seen from her lately it looks like third year figure star, Melissa Bumstedt might be trying to shake some things up at her own right. Two weeks after she put on another clinic where their fourth place finished up at the Vancouver Pro, Bumstedt and her crew don't seem like they're showing any signs of slowing down. Rumor has it that she might be planning to hit the LA Pro this weekend, where I think she'd come in as a lot to settle somewhere in the top three. And if you're a fan of the figure division, you can't help but love that long-lead, almost statuesque look that she has as she gets it all clicking. What would take is a few minor adjustments for her to come in and basically cruise to a win, there in LA to really help build some momentum for this next phase of her season. And that does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the morning. On-date, Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Thank you.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo, and today is Monday, August 24th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. In the words of the late-rate notorious BIG, if you don't know, now you know. And in my head, that's why I like to imagine Boluus was thinking after he brought the thunder to the Tampa Pro a few weeks ago, even though George Peterson captured a lot of the post-tamp headlines for the two 12 fans, guys like Beau and third place finisher Derek Osslen were just as much of a revelation. I think you can make the argument that Beau's second place performance was as good as anything we've had so far in the regular season, which makes him must see TV where I have very land next. This guy is a force to be reckoned with, and I think the best of Boluus is probably still yet to come. I read once that native Amazonian tribes used to control burns in the forest, as we've replenishing the soil and bringing back new life. And I think if Chris Hester could describe what his approach is, heading into the NPC nationals in two words, controlled burn might be the perfect way to put it. People I've talked to have told me that Chris' ultra-focused heading into this year's contest with the number one goal being to come at as absolute best so that this time around he's undeniable. From a raw talent standpoint, Chris is right up there at the top of the list in terms of athletes who are expecting to see on stage this year. But if you can find a way to dig in and use that controlled burn method, he could easily end up as the last man standing. When it comes to goal setting in personal development, experts like to save a sweet spot is to focus on something that's a little bit of outside of your comfort zone. Somewhere right there seems to be the intersection between where you are, verse where you want to be, and that's the place where Ricky Moten's pretty much made his living these last few years. Over the weekend, I heard from a source that Ricky and his team are putting together a plant to smash his previous best at this year's Olympia. And that they believe he has the potential to crack the top 10 this year. Considering there were already seen Ricky be a consistent top 4 finisher at the Arnold 2 years in a row, it's not that big of a stretch for him to do something like that at the O. And if he says, good as advertised is a real possibility that we see him land a spot in that first call out. Two weeks ago at UFC 252, heavyweight champ, Steep Aimeo Uchich put on a clinic when he successfully defended his title against former champ Danielle Cormier. And of Kamala Gorgny was watching that fight, my guess would be that his big tape away was that he should come out swinging. Kamal's first title in the fence is less than five months away now, and by all accounts not only he's ready, but this time around he's looking to make a statement. And the top 5 of the 212 should be as deep as it ever been at this year's contest. So if I were Kamal, I'd be channeling my inner Steep Aimeo Uchich because landing the big shots early on will send a message that the champ won't be going down anytime soon. And that does it, yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Belumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions to make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I'm gonna be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car hot tart. We've got three to four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods, a muscle in the morning. Today is Tuesday, July 20th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. You know how people say it's not about whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game. Well, I'll tell you right now, playing the size game with Justin Rodriguez is something you don't want to do or be any part of right now. Because you're probably taking an L there, no matter how you try to play it. In Justin's latest, the Wimpy Update, he said that he was 293 pounds and getting better every day up to this point in the year. It's a safe bet to say that this is the best version of Justin that we've ever seen. He's brought himself up to the point where he's a legitimate threat to be a top 10 contender now. So as long as he doesn't end up sacrificing conditioning for the sake of coming in bigger, he's going to give people some serious problems. Now, if Justin Rodriguez is playing the size game, Breon Ansley is doing whatever the opposite is for his Olympia prep this year. And one of the most recent updates Breon said that he was somewhere in the neighborhood of 198 pounds, which is 17 pounds less than he was at the same point last year when he weighed around to 15. The difference between last year's version of Breon to what we see today is almost like night and day because keeping his weight lower really seems to highlight some of his structural gifts. For a two-time Olympia champion to be willing to completely shift gears like this should tell you something about how bad he wants the title back. And if the new Breon ends up being better than the old Breon, then we might have ourselves a new champion. This is an interesting time in women's physique for a lot of different reasons. But one of the main things that makes this division so fascinating is the way we're always seeing new talent bubble up to the surface. And looking down the road, one of the people you might want to keep an eye on is 2020 North American Chef, Kyla Mann, according to Kayla, her goal heading into the offseason was to do whatever she had to do to add more density to her look. So that she can come in and be ready to make an impact when she makes her debut with the St. Louis Pro outside of a select group at the top. We see a lot of parity in the division which opens up space for so many athletes to make a name for themselves throughout the season. So if Kayla can deliver the goods, she'll have an opportunity to make a splash from day one. Definitely a few days away from the Chicago Pro, the question on everyone's mind as far as the two 12 division is concerned is whether or not anyone there will be able to stop Kyon Pearson. Over the last few days, we've seen a handful of photos and videos filtering out of Kyon's camp. Pretty much everything they're showing you makes this feel like a coronation which feels weird to say because you won the show last year too. But for whatever reason, this year feels different. The momentum behind Kyon makes him feel like a juggernaut who's about to blow through everyone all the way to the Olympia stage will be running headfirst into another army of guys who are also juggernauts in their own right. But if it does go down that way and he ends up steam rolling everyone this weekend, get ready for the height machine to shift into overdrive because that's what's about to happen. And that does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Day for Lumpo reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

When you crash on Spat, load up the barbell, baby. You mean cable curls, don't you? Most people don't realize is that the secret to big arms is concentrated movements. The reason being that by-seps and triceps are small muscles and overloading those muscles with heavy barbell curls stresses everything but those muscles. Right then, let's rock and roll! Here we go!

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Food Expo, there's 30 year in a row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love this show. This is our best place to be in LA. I'm Dave Palombo, founder of Species Nutrition. I created Species Nutrition with one mission in mind to provide body builders and serious athletes with no nonsense supplements that work and are backed by science. From my earliest bodybuilding days, I believe in only putting the best in my body, and that lives on in the Species Nutrition line of products, we use only top of the line formulations, toast from maximum results, and the best flavoring systems available. I've put my name and reputation on every bottle of Species Nutrition products. If you want to be your absolute best, join the evolution. Welcome back to Live with Brought to You by Species Nutrition. I'm Dave Palombo, and today we have a very special guest. I've been so excited to get him on this show. As far as I know, he's probably the shortest bodybuilding ever-wint in overall title in both classic physique and men's open bodybuilding on the NPC amateur level. Of course, the guy I'm talking about, you guys have probably heard me mentioned in before. Hector Gabriel Amazor, here with his two trainers, Tomo, Marsha. A lot of it and our good friend Andrew Makata. Welcome, guys. Thank you, Dave. Thank you. Amazing. Amazing. That's the only that can say, because your foot, not five foot, four foot, five inches tall. This is your first bodybuilding show ever, and you won't only men's open bodybuilding overall, but classic. How'd you do it? Where'd you come from? No, she's good. Well, I didn't know how well within, the only thing I could say turned hard in a well-fired structure for my goals. The back, when I first started, bodybuilding, I had a lot of good for all school, I get good for this one, be a peer, I don't know such an angle, but I don't know how those people are doing. They're all sweaty side, they're sitting in the fridge, and when I get myself defined as a... There we go. We lost you for a second. We lost you for a second. All right, let me take you back a little bit. 10 years ago, you started bodybuilding, which we were 14 years old. Now, you were given a diagnosis by the doctors that basically, you were going to be in a wheelchair your whole life. What? Explain to our audience exactly what your medical condition is. You have a lack of growth hormone in your body. Why are you so short first on what? And then what was the diagnosis that led them to tell you that you wouldn't walk? The last one, my disease dysplasticale, is one of the senior born, they know growth property, the reforms, the serious curiosity, as opposed to no access. I think on part of most of the people, I'm Puerto Rico, but then the doctor and Puerto go to the same high-end diagnostic. This is like a crisis. So if I manage to say how I draw something like a day walk and don't have, you know, cure up. So as my mom, also they want to be a serious, for my school, I see my next, they have cords. And a lot of people left me to enroll in the school, they made a picture of the school. And I have a teacher, looking at the 14th of a school. It was very hard for me, very hard for Braucala, Rose, and my mom, one also to do surgery. So I started reading, and you, on books, and you, to comment, how can I exercise for medicine, how I can start, you know, make my mom so strong as I can protect my bones. And then by the week, week time, I do it also exercise. I get stronger stronger. So how did NASA, what I am right now? So you have a dysplasia? I have a lot of your bones. We're actually, they call a brittle bone syndrome. Like, the person who you can fall down and your bones can break, right? That brittle? Yeah. So they were afraid that if you exercise, it sports that you were going to, you were going to basically be breaking bones and, and, and, and full of parts, actually. Yes, I can. Yeah. And you said, I'm not going to take this diagnosis. I'm going to go out and I'm going to start strengthening my body. Yeah, I remember when I started, I started with, well, plastic, both of those go gene, then you might put $20. Right. All right. So we pulled your heart right in the back. A lot of people have made a loss in the school. You want to do a body-in-in-champ. How tall would you? How tall were you at 14? Well, 14. Wow. That was a close, probably. Four feet, four foot. Yeah, four foot. That's it. Wow. That's crazy. Now, um, did you, along the way during this 10 year journey to where you got to now, which you looked amazing, by the way. Did you, did you injure yourself? Did you break any bones? Did you have any injuries along the way? No, because I've been trying to do, I've been trying to do the right thing. Me want to do the exercise. Um, this is pretty much my son. When I do it, because I wanted to tell me that. I don't want to get injured. But by the time, yeah, sometimes I feel so pale, but never, I have injured people. No, no. It's interesting because a lot of guys that are short, you know, like you below five feet tall, you have weird proportion like that, you know, sometimes their upper body is big and they have short legs or their arms and not long enough. You're like perfectly symmetrical. Is that like just five year walk or, I mean, is that just good genetics? What do you think that's the tributable to? I don't know. I hope that you said that, um, the, the medical kind of because I don't want to be here, as a whole, like say, running moisture. No, my head needs to say, yes, I don't like a boat getting the only play play stage or, and that's it. But that's what I can say. I don't, I don't have a explanation for that. And when you went back to the doctor after they gave it his diagnosis, and you started as you starting to increase and get stronger and stronger, um, what, what's the doctor thinking about all this during this time? Is he, is he telling you keep doing what you do? I don't want to see you think you say it, does he tell you like you're crazy? What you doing? Like, um, like, well, this only they say, then I'll explain, like, explanation, what happened to me? Well, it's crazy. This, uh, is all good friend there with, uh, Angel of the Batin, uh, backstage, and, and there on their knees, and, and there, that's the same height as you. That's amazing. That's what you had us, oh my, that's the one thing. Now, when, when you went, I see, you, you, obviously you set up, this is a hit as a good, I want to see those cuts, this is a great picture. It's just to give people an idea of, um, of what you guys, what you look like next to the other competitors. Now, when you're backstage pumping up, all right, get ready to go on stage, and you'll look at it, and that's all these guys, and you're, this, by far, this, the shortest guy after. No one's even close to you. Do you have any inkling in your mind that you have a chance at winning this show? Well, like, uh, my friends and tell me, um, I put in my, uh, I go to do my best then. I got to do well. And when I train say, whatever it takes, I want to win, right? And whatever it takes, I want to win, I want to go to the station. Yeah, I don't hesitate to tell you, I just focus on my, when I pop in backstage, um, pop with what I have to do. Again, I said, this is my game. So, not joy. I actually have to, I want to play some people in my house. I want to play something, you know, I don't know how to feel the wind, show my memory, my comfort for being the first, the smallest body, being to be a problem one day. But what, what do I do, I want to be a, you won the overall, all you got to do is win the Bannerway class in the national, and you're probably by far, what did you weigh on stage at four foot. Why? Why? You could, you could do the women's library class and still make the way classes crazy. Andrew, when, when you train this guy, what kind of way to see you's in the gym? If I tell him that, believe, I told him, I told him, I started to everybody, one day I was been chest and he asked me, go, you can help me get, I'm doing shoulders, sure. So, I walk in the extra hand and he has an 80 pound dumbbell at the floor. And I'm looking, I'm getting very nervous because I hope I'm thinking to myself, please, don't try to show off. Don't hurt yourself now. And he gave me one of your cards, that's it. So I put the weight in his, in his legs and he basically curl 80 pound dumbbells. And he's a, I got it. He pushed 12 reps with 80 pound dumbbells with them. Wow. I don't even know what to say. Because that's like having one of himself in each hand almost. Yes, yes. And the other day he's in the video, he's a squatty. 315-480-435-4300 reps. I'm like, don't do this again. You show you that pretty bone syndrome? I think they've decided no if there's something. I know. I know. Definitely. That's incredible. I see this. Wait until you go, Caesar. Don't do 45 anymore. He's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's training the way he likes to use a lot of reps, a lot of volume. He's simply similar to me. He doesn't even know who me loses. But he's very similar to him. He jumped on the gym. He jumped on the machine. He goes to the gym at the time. There's nobody there. He jumped with squatty, squatty, squatty. Yeah. He's like, and I think in the way he's safe. You know, you got good genetics. I could get you in real life. You thought you got, you thought you got, dealt the bad hand, and then when you actually went to the gym, you realized you had a good hand, actually. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, he's amazing. Like the way he leaves the gym. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. He's a body of stop just so you can believe me. Because I don't believe. You know? I love this picture, by the way. With Brandon Curry, Mr. Olympus. My favorite picture. He looks like you make Brandon Curry look like Shikiela Niel. And now he's a little bit emotional. Yeah, he's actually five thin. I don't know. Who's the, who do you think was that was the tallest Mr. Olympus? Arnold? I guess? I think so. We gotta get him a picture with Arnold, right? Wouldn't that be great? I don't know. If you have a picture. That's the plan. That's my goal to be. Yeah. I have to be both. I've got to give it a chance. Yeah. The end of class, the future with him. Right. That's right. The end of the year. What's the next show? You guys going to go to nationals? I mean, you might as well, right? Or USA or whatever. Yeah. You can't go ahead. You can't go ahead. You can't go ahead. Because I mean, he's just kind of win the Man-of-Wake class. Although, I mean, those guys are going to be obviously better than the probably the guys he went up against in Tampa, but you know, especially with this crazy COVID year we got going on here. No. No, Tomo, what's going on with the gym? You guys, the gym's open? No problem? The gym's are open here. We got no problem. That's where I met a movie a week before the tank approach. That's where we were going to start. You know, what's the spy or rejuvenation clinic? Give us a little. That's my clinic. It's a clinic that deals in home and replacement therapy. We do have the aging medical health structure. Yeah. We're here in Orlando. I've been a little in a Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. And we're going to be expanding out to more of the country as we go through hopefully away from COVID. Yeah. Are you sponsoring a. Pacta? Yes. So I met him only a week before the Tampa Crow. And they were asking for a sponsorship, you know, a little further out. And let's take a photo. Yeah. So for the state and they were looking for a small sponsorship. Somebody to cover his costs. And when I saw him, you know, because they told me, you know, there you little guy. Yeah. And I'm thinking in my head, same thing you probably, most people thought the relationship with the people. Yeah. And I was wondering if the people were going to be looking for a portion of the office. Okay. You know, I mean, so I'm here's under five feet. I'm like, I'm like, I'm a portion is going to be off. It's going to look a little funny. Maybe. But let's see what he has. And the guy puts a pose and routine on. And I was unbelievable. I'm looking at him. I'm like, you just post better than 90% of the body builders. I've seen on stage. I pro shows the last 10 years. Who the. Who taught you how to pose a. Who taught you how to pose? I'm going to do it. Well, I did you work in Seattle. Did someone sit down and teach you? Oh, teach me. Well, nobody. I just looking at a big video. Tutoria. Wow. Both parties. I saw some of the party in the brother. Look at this shot. I have up on the screen. This is an amazing shot. How big is your waist? Like like 15 inches. I don't know what I'm going to make. I'm going to make you a star now. We did the bed. Yeah. His waist looks like it's the price of some guys thighs. I mean, probably more than guys thighs. I do a lot of fasting. I'm asking. And I'm going to exercise. I'm going to put my quams on like a twist. All school exercises like for my chair. But I think my back in. How big your arms? What? How big are your arms? I don't know. I don't know. I've never been to a match. I've never been to a match. I've never been to a match. I've never been to a match. I've never been to a match. I've never been to a match. 13 inch arms. I knew it was like a 27 inch arm and like a six foot guy. No, no, no. Did you ask me? I actually want to pick a match. Yeah, you got to do. We had to do measurements in this guy. I know. It's funny because my I have a good friend of mine. Then he brass guy. I don't know if you don't know him. He's about a small guy body builder. And he's he just got in the Guinness Booker of Records. He's four foot one. But you might be the first guy ever to get your pro card under five feet. Or maybe not Marvin Ward is probably four eleven. But four eleven four four foot five is a big difference. That's seven inches. Unbelievable. So we'll see him. And what? And Nationals in Miami? Yeah, that's the plan. That's the plan. Yeah, yeah. We asked the judges. You got to sit back if you should take that off. They talk off to the baby USA. And the judges told me it's all about definitely not. I want to see him in Nationals. Okay. That's the only one. Now, what do your parents think about this? Active. Name? Well, you're parents. My parents? Oh, my parents. They give me a lot of support. I say my mom. I always with me or my process. And then before. They so happy to. To my mind and control. Did they think you were crazy when you first started? Yeah. But not not not believe them. Not believe them. Yeah. Yeah. But they're giving you. I'm treating a lot of food. But they're okay with buying you all that food. You're eating it on the protein. When I say I eat a lot of, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's what I'm going to teach him. That's the tip of the river. So that's why I know the time. You're pretty good. For example, everything is right. I mean. There you go. I was going to ask you. You a big meat eater or chicken and you'd appreciate what you're protein source of choice. I like to get in with my own. I also fish from Montsey. Not to Monte Lafa, but sometimes when I have to do that, I do a full effort. He's very, very fine. He's very much the butcher life in junior. Please, go. Don't put your life here. It's a dirty fish. It's a dirty fish. There are taste care on the river. He's very, very, very much the butcher life. I have no idea. I have no idea. That's you. I imagine you know, he probably has to eat a lot less food than like a bigger competitor would. What's a typical like protein portion and like car portion for for Hector is opposed to like, you know, someone like, you know, who's five foot ten and three hundred pound. And then I'm going to say, sorry, I'm not necessarily. That's how training him. He has some some people. This someone gave it to him was was real bad. He went 38 pounds and I started doing his diets and training. They're going to do give him a lot more rest. He's going to be less. No, don't damage your rest. He trained straight to the vegetables. I'd be dead. Oh, really? Yes. You have no idea. You want to be dead? Yeah. But of course, if I don't train somebody is going to be training somewhere. I said, no, you're fine. Yeah. But I started just by any food to his diet. He went from 98 to 98 pounds to a 20. Wow. He was dieting. I'm feeling him walking forward. Right. He's going to wait. One thing. Well, he was over training is what you're saying is that that was the thing. And by the portion, he did a six houses. Wow. That's not a friend. Yeah, I tried to go more, but he shoots to blow it. Yeah, I don't like it. Yeah. Six is a good number. Yeah. He's probably doubling his weight and protein probably. I'm sure. I'm just because I'm a person. Yeah. I put the number together. I'm trying to get the chew up. And the syrui belief. Right. And it works well for him. You know, it did cost. Six times a day, is he? Yes. Six times six ounces. All right. Here's the question that everyone wants to know. No one cares about the body. Yeah. I want to know when you're four foot fought and you got a physique like Flex Wheeler. Okay. What kind of women do you track? Tall women, short women. What's what's your type? I don't really write on. What do you want to have for me? He'll take it more. No, seriously. No, you like tall women? Do you like short women? I've been with somebody. Go with my hand. Hand by hand. We made a bad thing. Your process. My love. Give me support. So in this for because I don't want somebody. I don't give me support. I love this. Right. And the right thing. A lot of competitors out there. I work with some girls that are on the 5 feet tall. I mean, with that piece, something. I mean, you can. If you can date a girl who's like six foot. You can be like. You can be like. I can. People can think you're a kid. You know, but. I'm trying to get your date. Heck, come on. Give me some information here. I'm trying to get my dark hair like there. Or we can live in a time. Do you like Spanish? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think. I. Anywhat is interesting can contact you. Now you have a great. YouTube. I made an Instagram account. I'll pull that up on the screen. Yes, people would see it. It's Hector motivation. And I like that because we wanted to see motivated. I've seen motivated a lot of people. Now, here's the question. When you do nationals, I see. This is, I didn't even see this picture. This is a great picture because you were very emotional. This is when you won. Yeah. Yeah. What, what you, what you, what you, what you crying. Well, I have to say both. I say thank you. I cry because I, I couldn't believe it. I didn't really, I couldn't believe it. I, I, they, or I. I tried to. I'm cry cried when I saw it. And I was not even up there with you. I was crying. Oh, congratulations, man. You overcame the odds. Even if you don't ever do an up the bodybuilding show, which we know you will, you beat the odds already. My friend. You should be proud. Yeah, I'm proud of all your, your helpers there and trainers. And because you know what, it was a team effort. And you guys, you guys, you guys kick butt. Now, here's the question. You do a nationals. Are you going to do classic physique or you're going to do men's body building? What do you go say? Well, for those of both. Can you do both in assials? I hope so. I thought you could. I don't, I think they were before I don't know if you can now. I don't know if you can. Yeah, they always make, they're always changing the rules. I don't see why you can. But you know what, they don't let you do both in pros. You have to pick one and the other. I don't know why. Body building for short. Yeah, it's going to be important if we have to pick one. Body building. We're going to go back to the way body building. You think that would be the case because it's been a way. But you know what, he looks so good in, in classic, too. He's got a classic physique. It's almost like, well, you know, the only promise he might be too much shorter than the shortest class guys, right? And I think I think the, I think it's, it's weird. It's weird sound because it is. I think the lineups are deeper in classic physique now. You're probably, unfortunately, you're probably right. Yeah. Then they are audio building. So actually, in those lower class levels, yeah. The lighter classes. We, without, we don't respect anybody. I'll let it do the research for the national, USC, North America. And I see a lot of those bunkers with you guys for a second. They all look great. But I think he got a better chance. They got their proportion is not as good as this because a lot of those guys are too full. Here's the question now. Here's the question. On the height wage charge because for those of you know, in classic physique for you, given height, you can only weigh so much. Do they even go down to four foot five? No. So what's his plan? They stopped at four eleven. I think there's a shortest. I saw that any chart. And what, and what's the weight for that? I don't want to fight something. I think it was one thirty seven or something like that. It doesn't sound like the proportions are corrected that lower. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I probably, probably no one was mathematically gifted enough to figure it out. I don't want to think. I thought it would relevant because you know, who, who's going to do these? They've been falsified one or four. He looks like what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, you guys, what's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the factor congratulations on the big, the two big wins, I should say. And the qualification for nationals and I'm looking forward to seeing you at that Miami Nationals and hopefully winning your pro card at the young age of twenty four and overcoming all the odds and having a tremendous tremendous story to tell. Thank you for sharing with us. No, thank you for your talking. We're doing a interview. It's all for Asia. Thank you. I'm here. Absolutely. And for all of us here at our Ex muscle on Dave Palombo with Hector Gabriel. I'm a Thor for live with. We'll see you next time.

Welcome back to RX Muscles Spotlight on Dave Palombo. And today's guest is a very special one I'm going to tell you why because I met her back in the 1990s. I used to compete with her in the same shows. I actually started as a coach. Together we actually won the 1996 NPC Junior National Women's Body Building Overalls. She placed at the USA after that and then got hurt a little bit. Life happened. She had a family. We're going to hear all about it. And she's back at a 50 years old. She earned her IFVV Procard. The one I'm talking about is my good friend, Donna Sterling. Welcome to the show. Hi Dave. Hey Donna. I call you missing or missing credible because what you went through how long it took you. I have to take three hats off to you because it's a miracle. I'll take them all. That you were really big into body building and the whole scene back in the 90s as we all were. You compete on a local level. You moved up very fast to the national level. You did really well. Very quickly you had to look. You were very pretty. The great shape on stage. Your conditioning was awesome. When you were in that stage of your life, what was body building? That was pretty much the thing you lived for. I loved it. I remember seeing Corey Everson the first time and that was it. I wanted to look just like her. I thought she had everything. I got into the fitness world. I started working in it, doing aerobics, being a personal trainer, got into lifting weights, started to meet everybody in the body building world. In fact, then it was a tight family like new everybody. It was really nice. And to this day not to jump where I had fast, I still see the same people. So it's nice. That's funny. It's funny because you know, Westchester area was really hot for body building back in the 90s. Really, you really good body balls that came out of that area. And the shows were super competitive. If you could place in that New York area at a regional show in your class, you were almost guaranteed to go to a national show, at least at the junior national level and do well because that's where the best competitors were coming around that time. And so, you know, women's body, people don't realize when you were competing women's body building, there were no other divisions at that point. I don't even think fitness come around, right? I think fitness just started because on the cover of the NPC magazine, it's me, the men's winner and then there's a fitness winner. So just coming out. Right. I think it was like one or two years old or something like that. So like I mean, if you wanted to pose and you wanted to hit, it was no women's physique. It was no figure at that point. If you couldn't do a routine, you weren't doing any words to a body you weren't competing. So that's really what it amounts it's now. At some point, you know, you had the potential obviously to go pro after you won that junior in that junior essay title and you placed at the USA, what went on in your life, tell us what stole the career so to speak and stopped it because you guys got out of that for a while. We were really tight, we were hanging out all the time and then you also kind of moved away from body building. What was the moment that did that? Well, I remember I was practicing my posing routine for the nationals. And I went from a transition movement and my knee cap slipped over to the back of my knee and that was it. So the doctor told me I never would compete again. I didn't know he said that. I was like, okay, that sucks. And I started a family. I had my triplets, triplets, two boys in a girl. So I do everything big. Now, let me ask you, I asked you, I don't think I've ever asked you this. When you did the, when you had the triplets, was that like just randomly occurring? What were you doing for telly or I made that? No, I had to do IVF. Okay. But I'll tell you one thing, besides the IVF part, I mean, that's a whole story in itself. My body building career helped me with being pregnant with triplets. Like the whole routine and you have to feed yourself and you have to do this and you have to do that. We're up right and swept away into it. Yeah, there's a reason we just put it through a shot up there if you're an IVF. No, I had to do IVF. Why I don't know. But we weren't looking for triplets. We were looking for just one. Right. So we got lucky. We got three. Did you, they implanted three new, because I know usually they implanted couple just in case some don't make it, right? How does that work? Well, I went through the whole, I went from flow myths from them trying the least amount of work that they needed to do with me all the way up to IVF and I went through two rounds. This was my third and last round. Oh, wow. And two rounds didn't take. So they did the last round they put four in, you know, just hoping one would take. Sure. And I was lucky three took. And now they just graduated high school, right? They just graduated high school. Sick. My, no, what sick is my door to once to compete? That's right. You tell me that. Yeah, that's awesome. I think you're going to be like with me forever. Another generation, I got to work on it. It's like Star Trek, the next generation. The thing that was amazing, because I remember when you hearing that you had to triplets because we kind of lost touch. And here they are, 18 years old. It's like, it's like a blink of an eye almost, you know? It is a blink of an eye. They're 18 and oh my gosh, driving, doing everything. And I don't even want to get into that. The whole, I got millions of stories to say. I'm sure. Now, did you stop competing? Or did you just kind of tone it down a little bit? What were you doing during that time period? I stopped competing. I was just working doing my personal training, but very little bit, because I was going to people's homes and staying home, taking care of my kids. So when they got into, I think, middle school, I was walking in my neighborhood and I banged into a friend of mine. And she was like, oh, I'm turning 50. She said, now I get to relax and I'll have to worry. And that just got that bugged in me. I was like, you're relaxed. Well, how are you going to be relaxed when you're 50? You know, your life is just starting. And I wanted to compete just to try to inspire women, 50 and over. Don't give up. Don't give up. So when did you realize that your knee really was functional again? Do you think all that time off, let it heal? Is that what happened? You know what? I'm not sure. There was one Christmas Eve. My son was sitting on my lap. And he just moved a little bit and I felt the whole thing. She started to shift. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know if it's healed, where we'll never do it again. I just think working out and keeping the muscle on, it's just keeping it. I think it was just the freak accident as what happened. And I think it just, you dislocated it. And maybe because you have loose joints. And then I think with the more muscle you have, you would think it would keep that knee tight in that knee, the patella tighter. Well, that's what the doctor and doctors don't always know what they're talking about. Sorry if there's any doctors out there. But he said my muscle was so strong that when I went to move into the other position, it held my knee while my whole leg moved. Oh, I see. So it was a freak accident. I don't know. It was a freak accident. So freak accident. So what point, how many years ago now was it that you started this comeback when you contacted me? Was it like five years ago? Five years ago. Okay. So your kids, I mean, yeah. So you basically were out of it for like 15 years? Yep. That's a long time. And how hard? It's a long time. How hard was it to get back into? I really did. Yeah. Oh, not hard at all. Well, I love it. All right. Were you really sore when you first started? It made it feel good. Yeah. What? Were you really really sore when you first started back in the gym? And were you like starting over again? Yeah. Yeah. Very sore. But you know, that happened. That happened after COVID when everything opened up. That very sore again. But I just love it so much that it feels good. Yeah. Even soreness. When you first started sending me pictures, when you first started working together again, I think it was like I said five years ago, you didn't have any muscle. It was amazing. You lost a lot of muscle. And you wanted to do figure. And I said, all right, whatever, you know, look, I'm friends with Don. I'm going to do whatever she wants to do. We'll help her out. But in the back of my head, I knew that you could get the muscle back. And I was hoping that you would want to. I didn't know if you wanted to because you were dead set on figure. Matter of fact, once you did add back a lot of the muscle, I said, all right, we're doing women's physique now. And you were like, it's a last minute. Like you change your mind. I'm doing figure. And then you get deterable. And then you'd be like, I don't know why I didn't listen to you, you know. But was it a fact that you didn't think you had enough muscle? Because you were comparing yourself to back in the 90s? Yeah, I never feel big enough. I always feel like small. I remember that show. You told me to do physique. I was like, there's no way. I can't. I'm not big enough. I did figure. Everybody, everybody in that show said, you know, if you did physique, you would have won. I was like, OK, OK. I got it. Dave was right. I was wrong. Got it. Yeah. I was the year you finally. And I can almost say, I think you might have been better this year than you ever were in your entire career. I think you finally added back to muscle plus extra muscle. And I think you were bigger this year than when you first, when you were actually competing, you know, in your back in the 90s, which is amazing. Because people think you can't make progress at 50, like you said. But you really can if you really put your mind to it. You can. And I mean, not to say I don't listen to you. Well, this time I fully listen to you. I used all the species products. OK. And that's like the only change. And I really think that helps. You know, I think that just helped my body recover. Build, it helped to do whatever it needs to do. Those fat burners or my God, I was sweating like a dog. So I think everything that really pulled everything together. I think you really mentally were ready to do it, too. I think you felt very confident in yourself this year. I noticed that in the updates and stuff like that. And your body responded better. Your legs were absolutely the best that I've ever seen them. And really, the reason I wanted to do this interview is because it's a testament that, no matter what happens in your life and you got COVID and all the other craziness we can go through. But it doesn't even matter. You overcame all the obstacles and you found the way to win. And you know what? I tell people true champions don't complain about, oh, I hurt this. I injured that. This happened. My grandmother thought they find a way to win. No matter what. Dorian Yates was a master at that. And that's what makes a champion. And you did that. You were able to overcome it. It took you 25 years to get back to the stage. And then even with all the stuff that was thrown your way, you know, your marriage ending and all the other stuff that went on, you found a way to win. And now you're an IFBB pro. I mean, it's got to feel amazing to have that validation. It feels amazing. I can't wait to compete again. So you definitely want to compete as a pro. I have like really big goals. Now, here's a question. I want to throw a wing right here because we were kidding around about it. But body building was your roots. That's where you came from. I mean, I always felt that if they had had women's physique back in the 90s, you would have been a champion for sure. Because that was your look. Would you ever want to do women's body believing in? Do you feel comfortable in this new division? That's so funny. You said it. So my goal for this offseason that I'm starting is I want to try to put it on as much muscle as I can. So I would like to do body building because it seems like body building is going in and out in and out. I don't know. I want to see if I can, I don't know, maybe do something, bring it back. There's a lot of older competitors that seem like they're coming back and they look fantastic. So I mean, they should drop the ages and just let us all compete. I think that's what I think. I think, you know, I mean, I mean, you could, everyone can compete in the open anyway. But I guess they do the master's divisions in some of these shows to give people who turn pro as a master a place to go if they don't feel that they're able to compete with the open people. A lot of people in the reals, you're still getting better. And I think that's what's inspiring you because now that your kids are graduated, you've done your job. You've graduated essentially. Now you have more time for yourself a little bit, right? I would assume. Can you imagine? I can't imagine. Well, I need this a little bit more time in my day. I got three kids in there and I'm just starting still. You're done. So I got another 15, 20 years of hard training. It goes like that. It goes so fast. The difference is that when I'm done, you and I will both be 80. Yes, we'll both be 80 and I'll be like, you can help me. You're still decommating. How many in a wheelchair? Donna, I wanted to say I'm so proud of you and I'm so happy that you were able to get this pro-card after all these years. It really is a pleasure to always know you as a friend and to continue working with you, you're stuck with me as long as you want me. And I think we're going to do some great things next year. Dave, all I can say is thank you. You're the best. Oh, wait. Always the best. Thank you. And when you do it as ready, we'll get her on say, hopefully she could be misalipia. We don't want to, we're not taking any 25 year gaps in her training. No, no, no, she's working hard. All right, well, once again, this is one of those interviews I love to do because I love to show success stories and I've been waiting for Donna to finally get a pro-card so I can interview her and showcase what she got through. But if you guys are sitting there in your chair and you're saying, I can't do this, I have too much going on in my life. I have kids, I have job, I have to find a way. I'm being spying the way to win Donna found a way to win and Donna Sterling is a new IFB pro. I'm Dave Palombo with an R-X muscle spotlight.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Motor 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car cocktail. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning on Dave Palombo and today is Friday, August 28th, 2020 and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. I'm starting to learn that social media can be a real confidence killer if you happen to scroll past the wrong video before you hit the gym, especially if James Hollings head is the man on the other side of the screen. A few days ago I came across a video of James that made me stop dead in my tracks when I saw him rip 705 pound deadlift off the floor for eight clean reps. All things considered numbers like these have to put James in the world strong as bodybuilder conversation with guys like a cameo aimbs and whoever else you want to toss into that mix. But for me it's the way these used this style of training to transform himself into a really high level pro that makes it even more special. I've said it a million times before if it ain't broke don't fix it. This weekend's Savannah Pro already looks like it's shaping up to be a good one on paper. So if you're a betting man and you're still in the market for a dark horse candidate in classic physique, Tony Tavaris might be your guy. Tavaris is a former universe overall champ who's actually making his pro debut in Savannah this weekend and so far he and his team have been pretty bullish about how they think he stacks up. Now to his credit Tavaris has done a lot of work to make improvements over the last 12 months. And it looks like he'll be in great shape coming in here. The classic physique is full of monsters and it might be a tall order for a rookie to come out and slay some of these beasts right from the jump. Speaking of monsters in Savannah, one of the biggest threats in that classic physique lineup we were just talking about is Jonathan Hamburg who looks like he might be ready for war. On Monday we saw Jonathan release some of his final updates before this weekend's contest. And one of the things that really jumped out to me was how much his conditioning is tightened up over the last few weeks as soon as we started to get back into the flow of the contest season. Jonathan was one of the few athletes who I saw that was ready to jump at every opportunity he could. So it's no surprise that he's dialed in for Savannah. And if you look at this line of on paper, it feels like Jonathan will be right up there with divine Wilson battling it out for the win. In sports like boxing and MMA fighters stay in shape all year round because they never know when their phone might ring with a once in a lifetime opportunity. And that's one of the things that I love about combat sports. They require you to be the best version of yourself 24 seven. And there's no room for excuses or to put it in the figure division terms. Forces you to walk around like a vina of vusic this week. I've got a released new progress photos where we see her clearly looking like she's ready to start working the way through the early phases of her prep for a lot of people. These photos just underscore her commitment to adopting that MMA 24 seven mentality. So whenever that next opportunity does come knocking, you know that she'll be ready to answer the call. And that does it the end another edition of muscle in the morning. On day polimbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is our 1992 USA Lightweight Champion. It's got some story to tell us here today. I want to welcome Joe Tracoli to his show. How's it going? Dave? Thank you, brother. Thank you, man. I'm a pleasure. Absolutely. It's been a long time. I remember when I was just starting to really read the magazine to start to compete. I remember seeing that layout. I think Flex Magazine had a big layout on the USA championships. And you were in there as the winner. Mercury Clairborn, who just recently died, we'll talk about him in a second. And Danny Hester, the first classic physique Olympic champion, was actually third in that show. Tell you how long he's been competing. You're great, Danny Hester. Yes, absolutely. He looked good, Danny. He knew he was going to go somewhere. He had a beautiful body back then. You know, Mason, when you were competing, bodybuilding was like a big deal. There was no other divisions. It was all about bodybuilding. And ESPN would cover the shows. You know, I remember seeing you. I think it was like American muscle magazine featured or something like that. The show. You got like a little pro star profile. You remember you were with a fire department at the time. They showed you, you know, with your uniform and driving the truck and everything like that. It had to be like a highlight of your life back then, huh? It was so much going on in my life. I had just gone through a divorce. And yeah, it was a nice positive thing as a time. I had gone through a divorce. And when I always found that I try to turn negative times into a positive. And it really reinforced my attempt to bring out something positive. So I really put 100% into it. And having that video kind of validated at the time that really was a game. You have a little attention for the people at the fire department who, they were always seeing what kind of fanatic I was. So that kind of validated and theorized that hey, this guy can do something. Right, right. And we have some stuff we're going to put up on my video. I've put up while we're talking about this and showing you what kind of shape you're in. And I mean, at the time, you know, conditioning wasn't what it is to that. I mean, some of the guys got better and better obviously, I progressed to the 90s. But you were one of the guys that I got really, really ripped on stage. And I think that you will kind of like the embodiment of what we say, conditioning when shows, because you probably be guys with better genetics than you. But you outwork them and you were like, uh, you didn't leave any stone unturned. So to speak. I put 10 to 12 hours a day into that for a full year train from that one specific conference. It was actually two full years. I had kind of like fourth and fifth at the 1990 nationals. And as a matter of fact, I lost a mercury moor, it's played one night. You all year. And I just put everything into it for two years, because being at the time natural, a few remember Dave, 80, began a span where they were testing. Right. And 80 and 90. And I didn't know that 92, they were going to go back to enhanced. And so I was like, stupid me goes into this thing. What I did do with the very end is I had to take a diuretic because I couldn't make way. Right. I simply couldn't make way. But up to that point, I had been, you know, one hundred percent natural. So you didn't take 80 out of all its terrorism at all? That's zero. Zero. I took some worse because it's a long story, but taking those diuretics, I blew up 30 pounds in a lesser than a week. Oh, everyone had that first band experience with diuretics. No one knows what happens when you stop taking it. You guys didn't go the other direction. But you know, back then, you know, guys, you know, you were passing drug tests, but they weren't natural. You know what I mean? You weren't using drugs at all. What you're telling me? No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, I was so fearful of doing it for four weeks. God used to deliver our supplements to the gym, I used to run goals gym. And I took, I knew you'd take supplements. I was afraid of taking the motorolvitis. So for four weeks, I took them from the six week mark out to two weeks. I said, I can't take a chance. Right. And I stopped at two weeks out from the show for fear of what it was going to be. Would they really drug testing you guys? Did you have to give urine samples and everything? Absolutely. And you know what the funny thing is? It was arbitrary. They would pick like three or four from each weight class. Right. Because back then, you had to take the drug test also to qualify to go to the universe. Right. And so they'd walk you. They would go through the chain of custody seal it, sign it like you would normally. Right. And I was always one may pick because they knew I was married. Oh, I see. They purposely picked. Of course, of course. Now, what a lot of people don't realize is back then when you won you class at the USA, it didn't mean you got a pro card. They only gave it the overall win in the pro card. You could apply for a pro card. But most of the time they didn't give you one of you in the lighter way classes, you would have to win the nationals. Right. Exactly. But that year, a side story real quickly, is mercury according to him and confided in my wife and I that waned to me, he promised him that because they had just come off the span of tested competitions, they needed to enhance the competition by having some big names in it. Right. So it said, if he went in and won the lightweight, he would automatically get his pro card win promised. This is what mercury told me. So I mean, that's who he is. So you basically ruined that party for him. Honestly, as I look back now, I'm kind of really twice over sad for him. Because I know that devastated, that loss was something that he never got over. He really thought, and for good reason, I was a nobody. Right. I was a nobody. And he really anticipated he was going to win. He was telling my wife and I, he had got relatively close. I mean, we went out, but we got relatively close. And he told me that he fully anticipated winning. We really didn't know inside of me. I was quiet and home. Yeah, yeah, you were invited to beat him. And finally, this fire was burning and every time he spoke, you didn't know what he did to me. Yeah, yeah. It did, it arranged me to do more squats. But I heard he was a big motorcycle enthusiast out there in California, John Ramon, a Tommy. He was always riding speed mics in all the place, you know? Yeah, he got pulled over. As a matter of fact, he sent me an article that was in the newspaper. He got pulled over arrested because of driving. He would drive on the freeways and the canons. And he knew what he was doing on a bike, though. He did. He definitely did. Now, he died recently. Do we know what a quote with the cause of death was? I'm sure it was a result of being a quadriplegic, he hadn't spoken in 10 years. Oh, really? Quadriplegic. He was totally fed in everything by his family and... Oh, he had the trust. Yes. Yeah, the stroke 10 years ago, correct. Do we know what caused that? Anybody can speculate, but I don't want to attach something negative. God, I don't know. God, I don't ask the patient. All right. He was a good person. He was like a little many slikes wheeler back in the day. He wasn't it? He was muscular as you can imagine. Every fiber of his body when he moved. It just was, I don't think I took to that point. I never seen anybody that had less body fat. Well, you did, you obviously did because you beat him. Now, when you beat him, you actually had to go into, speak of Flex Wheelet. You had actually posed down with Flex Wheeler in the overall for the 1992 USA championship, huh? That's sadder, yeah, that's true. I did go up there and I did kind of do my best, but it was a four-concomment. Yeah, I know, of course. A lightweight, not going to be the heavyweight, 99% of the time, let alone Flex Wheelet that year, he was unduly. It was devastating that year, yeah, yeah. It was an honor to be next day. As you know, he became French from that. He's a phenomenal person. God, I love that man. He's a good man. He's been through how awesome the last, you know, a couple years here. I mean, think about it. Yeah. Yeah. One of the reasons I say I'm so blessed is I look at, I'm going through myself, some things, but nothing compared to what has gone on. Let's talk about your story because, firstly, you trained at Pembroke Pines Goldschim, where Vince Taylor, that was his home base, and I know you even were training partners with him for a little while, correct? We trained, I wouldn't call us training partners. I would say we did body parts together. Right. I pretty much trained on my own. He Vince always trained on his own, but I was trying to figure out what his secret was. Because you were probably training heavy in you, because Vince lifted very light, right? Oh, Dave, I would beat the living crap out of myself. He ain't coming in there. So, helped me, God. He would do the most unorthodox exercise with a machine, take a back machine, and hold it totally different, and just pump it out. Sit on either, little end to his blueberry pie. That's called genetic. That's called genetic. That's called genetic. That's called genetic. Joe, the funny thing is, you know, Chris Isito used to come down to that Pembroke Pines Goldschim because he would drive his boat, I guess, down from Maine, and he'd park it or where you would dock it right there. And he said, he'd him and Laura used to come in and train at the gym. I'm sure you guys used to see each other, right? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, they're both beautiful people. I've drilled Laura home on many occasions. You know, Chris couldn't make it or had to leave her only. So I don't drive her back to the boat. Yeah, because I've tried to live on the boat, if I go, that's cool. That's funny. They had the light, man. Yeah, yeah, they had the light. Now, let me ask you this question. You worked for the fire department throughout this time. And now, at some point, I think what you told me was 2006, you had there was an accident. What, what, walk us through what happened with the fire department? We had a call early one morning where some guy tried to break into a restaurant. He was hanging his, what other happen was we ended up forcing our way in, getting in there. I guess a police officer, someone had seen some legs dangling from a ceiling. So we broke in and some guys legs were sticking through the shoe, which was hanging over the oven. In the middle of the night with the guy tried to do, was squirm his way down and rob it. And he got stuck. He went away to die. Oh, my god. He went away to die. Well, we didn't know he was dead at the time. So I volunteered to go in there as a paramedic. Right. Felty had no petal pulse on his feet. So I went to lift his legs up to see if I can get some blood flow to his lower body. Right. And in doing so, the fusible link with a chemical tank was, was embedded into his back, but I didn't know that. And as I lifted him, it exploded. It discharged into my face. Oh. And I'm lucky one. He ended up dying. Was he alive? Was he alive when he was hanging there? He was alive for a while, but he ended up dying. He succumbed to. Yeah, he died. Wow. I ended up dragging myself out and held a tremendous amount of chemicals. And over the series of several years, they did testing on me. And they kind of diminished it first. Oh, it's just an infection of your lungs. Yeah. They kept you manned by products and kept thinking, that's what it was. Right. And my, our yearly pulmonary function test, which is mandatory, I started diminishing. I started feeling awful. I started, I just couldn't feel like myself. And as time went on, I just started getting to the point where I was always short of breath. Right. I tried to work that I was always doing the stair master to try to figure maybe I'm just getting old. Yeah. And you know, maybe in stubborn, I only knew the new color way. You went down to more. Sure. And then up over a while, I ended up having, when morning was hot as hell, and it's an August morning. And you were on a call and I ended up having severe dire for recess, I couldn't stop sweating. I was lightheaded, I felt nauseous. Take me to hospital and they kind of say, well, we're not sure what's going on. Except for tomorrow card, I'll just sign up and have an heart attack. Wow. But I did a cath and I was, there was no blockage. But my lung pressure was extremely high. I was very, very high in, it's called pulmonary hypertension. Right. The pressure in my lungs was extremely high to vessels. And so ever since there, I've kind of been on medications. And as time and I'm supposed to be on oxygen 24 hours a day. And I am for the most part, I have pride. So I'm not going to sit here and find you guys with oxygen. But that's one of the reasons I work out my garage now to this day, because I work catheter when I'm working out with nasal cannula. And I don't like to go in front of people and do it. It's like some theatrical thing. So I people always ask me, what's wrong? What's wrong? Right. So my wife and I work out in our garage. Now, you have this diminished lung function. Is this something that's getting progressively worse or has it stabilized? There's a medication that, thank God, I went to a doctor, I'd stabilized to answer questions, exactly. But it's stabilized. I'm on a medication called Rabatio, which is, um, has a sylden of the lid. That's actually what it was at first invented for. But there wasn't a lot of financial back money getting back from the pharmacies who were selling this drug. So he found out it was much more money in the sex business. That was, that's, that's, um, sylice, right? Um, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's it's very accurate. But that's bad. That's bad. Okay, I'm sorry. I always confuse the two different generic drugs. So they give you that. So you have a permanent erection from that, take a minute. Well, if you could notice it, no, it's not. I'm sorry. At first, yes, yeah. When you first start using it, it was chronic. Yeah. My wife and hangar, my wife and hangar tall on her. She was half. You get used to it. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, your body just gets, it gives you a headache, a flush hearing. Right. Kind of blurry vision. I don't get any of that in. But it's, but it's designed for reducing pulmonary hypertension, hypertension, correct? It dialects to boss vessels. They're, they're by reducing the pressure. Gotcha. Okay. Correct. Correct. So you take that and so everything that kind of was stabilized and then you find out what tell us how you found it the next problem. I continue to go every month to get checked. Right. And I'm under the greatest care. I have to give a shot. I thought you were on filming this stuff or incredible people. It's like family now. But anyway, so they do all kinds of tests and they, and my voice continued to get worse and worse and worse as you complain we hear. And in two years ago, I ended up outing a tumor found in my larynx. It's a fix to my rightful concord. Okay. So went to the University of Miami, which is an amazing facility. And they ended up doing a surgery, which they removed part of it because they thought it looked like what's called rabdo miles or coma, which is a very rare, but very bad form of cancer. It had me go to a oncologist and a bunch of people. And of course, I'm going through that. They found another tumor in my media styron coming down from my thyroid. So they're talking to me about, you know, possible stage four cancer. Right. That's what the conversations were. Are you free? Are you going to stay? I got to stop you. You must be freaking losing your mind at this point. I have to imagine. Yes, and honestly, I felt my wife had lost her father to cancer. So she was freaking out. So somebody had to be in the strength. And I didn't want to present this to my parents either because they're still alive. They're old. Sure. Well, they don't have all their faculties. I didn't want to freak everybody out. My kids. So I kind of, internally, I was not happy. But I said, I was a paramedic for 30 years. They've, everybody that I've treated had something they didn't expect to happen to them. So why not me? You know, I haven't different perspective. Okay. But yeah. So then they removed parvacus. They didn't want me to not be able to speak again. Did a biopsy on. They said it's odds will have to continue to come back. They sent me to a thyroid specialist. So recently eight weeks ago, I had another surgery. I don't know if you could see this scar on my dad. Yeah. Um, you know, they removed the left side of my thyroid because I had a two and we're coming down to my media stionum. Okay. Which is behind the sternum. Do they think this is all linked to this that one gas explosion? Absolutely. Have you ever, can anybody actually put a finger on it? Only God knows what? You think you believe that to be the case? Because the doctor said that. Okay. Every doctor I said, we can see no other reason for this. Because he's at all very unique odd things. And to have the series of them, for a place is very rare. Hmm. Yeah. So they removed parvacus thyroid gland. The tumor that was on the, the last year, party of Volklquord was benign, right? So they're going to keep an eye on that. So right now you're theoretically. Everything's removed. That should be removed at this point, right? The tumor that was, that they were looking for to remove, connected to my left side of my thyroid was in fact benign. But they found another tumor on my left road of my, low of my thyroid. After one after the, the media pathology, they just tested that that one area. And the pathology while I was still in the anesthesia, showed that it was, that it was benign. But over time, they froze it, did, I guess, whatever, a more extensive pathology on it. And they called me up on July 9th. And they said, it is in fact cancer. Hmm. But by the position of it, they think they got all the margins. It looks like it was, in fact, just only in the one area below. So I still have my right thyroid low. Oh, good. And I'm undergoing testing now to see further if there's anything else in there. Right. So now you, you can serve that they wanted to chemotherapy, or they wanted to radiation or anything like that. 10 years ago, they would definitely have done radiation or radiated the thyroid to kill all the thyroid. So nothing reduces. But there's a new technique that they do. And they're just going to kind of watch it. And the bottom line is they feel good about it. So I actually feel excellent. So I see you had no health. You had no negative health ramifications. You just just, they just found this on a routine checkup. Correct. Wow. Exactly. Well, my voice, as you can hear, my voice has been getting more and more raspy. That's the point where I'm always clearing my throat. And you sound a little mafia boss now. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. That's it. Or Fauci. You said, yeah, you know, Fauci. Fauci, you have the Godfather. One of those two. Yeah, I'm not sure we're trying. You look. Yeah, let me ask you this. Obviously, body building has been a staple throughout this few. I know that you, that's got to be a therapy, right? Going to the gym and or training even in your house. We still get up at 3.30 every morning, my wife and I'm out. Wow. I gave seven days a week. What are you going to do 30 in the morning? So she could be ready to go to work. Oh, okay. She's got work. I got you. She's a dental assistant. So she's still working. And so it accommodates her. In the weekends, we don't get up that early. We'll get up at 5 or 30. But five days a week, we'll get up at 3.30 a week. That's it. What time have you got to bed at night? 8 o'clock? Oh, I say nine o'clock. Okay. I'm going to clock. We're not, we're not exactly the life of the party. No, but you know, I have the complete opposite schedule. My kids, I'm the only people. I mean, only person I know who's kids want to go to bed at 11 o'clock at night. When they're two years old. So we're always fighting with my kids to try to get to the sleep early or early. But I don't, then does it, does it work for me? So then I got to go start. That I first thought working was they go to sleep, you know? So I'm up for, I'm up. When I go to sleep, you're waking up pretty much. That's, that's my experience. I'm not sure. Yeah. My kids rebel against that lifestyle because I've been doing this 40 years. I'm getting up this early. Right. When you're a firefighter, that's why you need that. Right. My kids are night owls. They feel sleepy. Yeah, I'm like that too. So what do you, when you looking back at your body building career and the discipline that gave you plus the fire department, you know, I have to, I always believe that the things progress in our lives for a certain reason. Do you see that whole body building, regimentation, mentality is what enables you to get through these tough times with, you know, your breathing and the tumors they found in there. Obviously because, you know, obviously keeping your health and shack and taking your vitamins and your, and you're keeping your immune system health is super important and obviously overcoming any kind of disease process. There's so much about this is dealing with it mentally and it goes back reformed by the building years. I don't want to get too extensive in it, but I went to a Catholic school back then the nuns would beat the living crap out of you. So the homework we got back then was so overwhelming that it was at first to the point where I couldn't deal with it emotionally. Yeah. I feel like in some ways it robbed my childhood, but that prepared me for the regimentation that was required in body building. It gave me the sentiment to never give up. It gave me the philosophy that I am going to do one more rep than anybody else on around no matter what. In the fire department, there's a joke. It used to be to have everybody's go to the chalkboard and draw different pictures on different quirks about a piece about different people. Right. And they did this Monti's Python stick with me. I don't remember when the cut the guys legs off, because I don't remember when someone's still on to fight. Yeah. They said that's me. They're always joking around about that was me. Yeah. You know, I was relentless. Me being short, 542, I always had to prove myself. Right. You know, so I had to be a fighter because, you know, if I fly for 4, believe me, if you didn't learn how to fight, you're going to get your ass into it. Yeah, I imagine so. Yeah, I imagine. Yeah, I remember seeing that footage of you as the firefighter, and I was like, and I saw you standing at the other guys, I realized how short you were. I didn't even realize it. You know, please, you can't. When your guys are on stage, all the light weights are the same height. So you all look around, you know, Danny was a little tall that you guys, but everyone else is around the same exact height. So you kind of don't look, you can't see relevancy of how tall you are. Until you see you guys in the overall, then you see how big flex we're all understanding next to you guys and that posed that one. The only place I fit in was it was it was it was it was it was. Ah, that was it. Wait, now look, it's 60 years old now. And I've talked, I've interviewed a lot of guys, you know, in your same from your same era, you're a little before me. What, what do you see your future from now? Like, when you look back, you got grown kid, you got a 36 year old, a 32 year old, obviously you did your, did your work already, you put it in. I know you went through some tough times with that with custody battles and something up. But now looking back, it's really about you now your life. You see yourself, what's, what's your future goals, I guess you could say? You have to constantly set new goals or you, you get bored and you don't want to, you know, be around anymore. I have to imagine that you have something in your mind. I always, I tend not to make too many long-term goals at this point. I find myself making many short-term goals and we're going to be celebrating our 25th anniversary my wife and I. So a lot of what our focus is is I'm, as my friend, we're going to go out to the Olympian. That's going to be the way we celebrate. So we're going to go out to Vegas hopefully and celebrate our 25th anniversary. So that's where a lot of our effort is. Are you afraid of COVID seeing that you have one issue's already? I mean, that I would be a little nervous about you. Yes, and no, I am. I'm cautious. I always, you know, I wear a mask. I always wash my hands. I'm a fan of how to, since being a paramedic. And I am that way. But you know what, I look at it a little bit differently. My body has been subjected to so many viruses. I have an uncanny immune system. Yeah. I've been in that in a hospital. It's my whole life taking care of people and environments where the average person probably would succumb to something. But I guess by subjecting myself to that, my immune system was super charged or something. Yeah. So I kind, maybe I don't take any chances. But I kind of feel like I would be able to handle it if it was a minor case. I'm very active still. I will not allow myself to lay around waiting to die. It's not my philosophy. I'm going to do whatever I have to do. Right. So yeah, I worry about it. I'm cautious, but I'm not fearful. No. You know, you lived quite a life. You had a lot of adversity overcame. And you know, I think that a lot of people could learn that maybe their life isn't so bad. When they look back and see all the adversity you went through. You know, you won a USA championship. You know, you be guys that probably would genetic that your superiors because you outworked them. You proved that anything can be done if you set your mind to it. And I think that you're a really good role model for people to really look up to in the sense that you were able to defeat all these obstacles in your path just by your mindset and your work ethic. And that says a lot about your character. Well, I appreciate that. I was good friends with a path of pre-sure many years. And right before he passed away, he commented often about my character. Because I'm a walking dichotomy Dave. I have every temptation that everybody else has. I really did. But growing up in Catholic school, being an altar boy, being all that stuff, it kind of kept me in a position where there was like that good angel band angel. I'm not sure there's time to make. And right before he died, he asked me to write a book. And that's the fact I was going to bring that up. This. And it basically what the book was. It wasn't. I didn't write it to make money. I didn't write it to sell it. He asked me on his deathbed. He said, would you do me a favor? He said, a lot of people out there, they see your body. And they see that this outer shell. And they have no clue what it takes to be you. So he kept referring to me as you're so much more than your muscles. And so that's the part where the book is more than muscle. And essentially what it is is exactly what you said is the character behind that. It's not just what I did in the gym, but what it takes. And it isn't just about me, really. I think you could take my main narrative and flex wheel around and put the any has to put many other bodies. Put their story behind it. And it's essentially about what it takes to be that psychologically. And people could pick that up where it amazons.com? Yes, Amazon.com. More than muscles, guys. If you want a good read, a good inspirational read, checking out, Joe Tracoli's story about his life. And Joe, thank you for joining us today and sharing your story with us.

I can't, I don't think anyone remembers anything anymore. But those 90s were the heyday for sure. Absolutely. I have a passion for it because it certainly wasn't to get notoriety. That's actually.

Since it's wrestling night, hot, cold, cold, and Hell's angel president Chazito, who are actors about Patrick and musician Evan Seinfeld, to name a few. In the body of the world, however, his close friendship with Mike Mata-Raza and four times Mr. Olympia J.Color is much more interesting than he did right down to him. I met Mike Mata-Raza in 1990, and he was a two early three. I met him through Ed Conner's, which was one of the corporate owners of Golds Gym, back in the day with Pete Grimmkeowski and him, Ed flew me out to Venice Beach to do a photo shoot for a calendar that he had, and Mike Mata-Raza was living in one of his houses. And he said, hey, you know, why don't you train what Mike today? He needs a train in power and I'm so sure. You know, I knew Mike from the magazines, and I went in there and we banged the workout out, and we went to dinner, and we started talking, we just hit it off, me and Michael hit it off from that day, and never been out of each other's lives. I mean, the years that I was away, a letter every month, a phone call to my mother, to see how I was doing checking on me. I'd call him up, you know, when he had a home phone, I'd call him up, and he never left my side, you know, and that's how we are today. When he had his hard problems and stuff, I was out there flew out there, I was making sure he was okay, you know, and checking out him constantly. We just made that bond and never lost it with each other. Mike actually gave me a call and told me that that Jay Kotler was flying out here to do a guest pose. And Mike, like Jay and they knew each other from the business, and he said, you know, are you going to the show? And I said, yeah, and he said, okay, cool, why don't you go see him? He knows who you are, and he would like to meet you. And you know, I think you guys will hit it off. And, you know, I went to the show and I went to meet Jay, and we talked a little bit, and we had nothing in common. Nothing. I mean, it was like the odd couple. And we went out to dinner with some people later that night, and you know, spend a day or two around each other, and that was really it. He went home and I went to my thing, and I was like, okay, he was a nice guy, but Jay was a little relaxed, you know, relax, back then quiet guy, you know, a little bit in the shell and stuff like that. And he was just, you know, very low-keyed. And then, you know, we just kept, we started talking on the phone, and he'd come in there, he'd come in here, I'd fly out to California when he was out there, see him, and that bond just started like that. And then it just grew into that, where I became friends with his wife, Carrey. Every time, you know, when I was in prison, when Jay was in here, gaspose, and I'd come in through here, he came here to see my mother, and it just, we unfolded kind of the same way that me and Mike did. You know, we're our friendship blossom from there. Five years, I mean, I see myself. Hopefully retired, sitting on a beach somewhere, but I mean, I really don't know how to answer that, because I never know what's coming down the pipe. I mean, you know, once I think like something's done, got through something in front of me, and apart from a movie comes off, this comes off, you know, a possibility for a book. So I don't know, I just know that, you know, I want to be relaxed in somewhere, and just live in a nice, low-keyed lifestyle. If had to be you, I met Mike Grolf from Melissa in 2004 in Florida. A friend of mine was a head of construction company, and he took his construction company out there, because they had a hurricane. I think it was Charlie, and he got the work out there, and he started redoing all the ruffs, and he told me, like, man, bro, you got to come out here. I met some nice people, it's a nice town. And I mean, I was traveling a lot, so I flew out there, I think in like, October, and I met her, you know, she owned the bar, I met a bunch of the friends, there was a big group of friends that they hung out with. And I became friends with her, and like two months later, I got indicted, and then I went away, and she was writing me letters all the time. You know, make it sure I was okay. We stayed in touch the whole time that I was gone. So I come home in the end of 2007, and I ended up dating a girl locally from here, and I flew out by Melissa in Florida, because she had a big house with a pool, and I was taking my girlfriends out there, and you know, spending some time and hanging out, and Melissa was dating the guy that she was with for some years, and you know, that was a rocky thing, but I didn't get involved in it, because you know, I just, you know, we're just really friends. And it wasn't until 2009, it was after I won the Illinois in May, and she had called me up, and she said, when are you coming back out of here, and I'm gonna visit in a while, and I said, I'm really swamped right now, what pride worked, we're traveling all the body, building shows, and she goes, I'm booking you, taking for the fourth of July, you know, and I said, all right, just book it, I'll get out there. So I got out there like the second, I stayed through the seventh, and we like, I think it was the third of July, she just told me in a parking lot, because her and her dude were arguing, and I said, listen, if I won it, and I was single at the time, and I said, listen, if I wanted to come out here and see all this, I could have just stayed at home and argued with the chicks at home. I don't want to even see this stuff, and she goes, you don't understand how it is for me, I said, hard for what, she goes, I've been in love with you for all these years, and you haven't even known it, and I'm like, go figure, you know, I thought she was like, you know, my little kid's sister, the way we got along. So that's how that started from there. She told me that, I was single, she was having problems, she wanted to get away from her dude, and she said, I want to move the Chicago. And I said, you want to come out here, let's go, I'll get you a job, we'll see you, you know, start a life together and see how that goes. And she's been out here since two years. We met a little over seven years ago in Florida, where I'm from, the hurricane hit my town, and his best friend came to help rebuild my town. So he brought me with him, and I just remember seeing in the first time and going, oh my God, who is this moose? But I used to joke around with his best friend, and say, oh he's just I can't, I've never dated him, he's crazy. But over the years, we got to become really good friends, coming back and forth, except for when he went to college for a little bit. But we still stayed in contact, writing. I see how she was for all the mirrors, and what a loyal girl she was to a dude that wasn't doing the right thing by her. And she's Italian, and you know how a lot of women stick by their men, and that's how she was. And I said, well, if this girl was loyal like that, to a dude that was mistreated in her, you know, acting like that. She's definitely, you know, going to be a loyal girl to me. So, you know, I weighed everything out, and I said, let me try this, you know, because, you know, everybody knows, you know, from the articles and the magazines and stuff, you know, I just kind of bounced around, you know, I dated strippers really all my life, because it was the easy thing to do. As you could tell, I don't like a lot of hard stuff. I really wanna take the easy route. So, it was easy for me to date strippers because really, I mean, not to digreg it, I'm not saying nothing bad about strippers, but they're kind of in the same lifestyle I am. You know, everything's physical for them, and you know, you can get with them, those strings attached to a lot of times. So, you know, going from that and wanting to settle my life down, and I ended up getting a listen and being a, you know, a blessing. Honestly, I think there was always a little something there, because like I said, I used to call them eye candy, but just over the years, we just became very close. We talked a lot, visited a lot, and I always just got so excited when he would come to visit. Two years ago, July, he came out, and I just looked up at him, and that was it. I just told him, I said, I've been in love with you for the last five years of my life. Months later, he flew down, picked me up in my hammer and drove me out, and here I am, and now we're getting married. I had a necklace, and it was a gold necklace with a lot of diamonds, and just back in December here of 2010, and I said, come on, let's go take this into my jewel, or I want to see what this thing's worth of, it's a lot of gold. And I thought it was only worth about 1500. That ended up being he gave me three grand. So when he told me it was giving me three grand for it, I said, okay, bring some engagement rings out, and the jeweler looked at me, because I had never met him. I saw bring some engagement rings out and let her look at him. She was overlooking at watches, so she didn't even know it was going out. So he brings these tray of engagement rings out. And as he does that, I get an email. Now the email was from a guy that wanted me to be in this movie that was coming up, and he, you know, he'd mail me at the time. So I'm emailing on my phone, and I said, hey, go ahead and pick your ring out, design a ring. And she looked at me, she goes, what? I said, yeah, pick it out. I said, I got to go sit down and answer this. And as I'm walking away, I turned around, I looked at the jeweler and I said, don't kill me because I'm not balling anymore. So there's a funny story because I really never asked her. Well, you married me or we did it the right way. I sat down and sent some emails out why she, you know, piece to ring together. We are in the jewelry store, literally building my ring together. I put it on and he goes, are you ready? And I go, for what? He goes, let's go. And I said, you mean I can keep the ring? He's like, yeah. So I looked at my go, you know, fat ass. You still have to ask me. It was not too long ago. It was only a week or so ago. And she said, are you ever going to ask me? She goes, when you ask me, you know, you're going to get me another ring, right? And I said, what are you kidding me? I said, I didn't pay all that money for that. I said, you know, she goes, we're going to arrest me. I said, okay, I'm going to ask you, now I actually think we're laying in the bean bag. And I said, I'm going to ask you now. I said, you know, what are you marrying me? And she said, yeah, of course. And you know, that's what it's said. Is it going to get thick wedding? Huge. Huge. Me being Italian, Melbing Italian, and you know, just his friends and fan base alone. I'm sure it's going to be insane. bigger than the Arnold probably. Hi, I'm three now.

Welcome back to RX Muscles. Iron Road to the Olympia 2018 brought to you by RedCon1. I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is the owner of RedCon1 and a good friend to the show, Aaron Singerman. Very good. You got to see big, big, big, big booth set up at the Olympia. You might be one of the biggest out there and today's topic, Aaron, is going to be called the Anatomy of the Olympia booth. Because I want to talk about what it takes to set up a booth. I mean, we talked the last time we talked, we talked about how to make a million dollars in the body building in the supplement industry. Today, I want to talk about how you set up a booth at a show of this magnitude and what the strategy is business wise. I think a lot of people really like to learn the behind the scenes happening. You seem to be very good and have some skill at it. You're also a good risk taker, which doesn't hurt as well. Talk to me about what made you decide to go ballistic this year and make this a such a big party, so to speak, at RedCon1. So first of all, I don't know if we're the biggest, the world certainly be the best. We'll certainly be the best. Every year for shows like the Olympia or the Arnold, you definitely have to take a make a judgment call about how big you want to go and what kind of statement you want to make. So if RedCon1, we're only two years old, it comes September 2nd, will be our two year anniversary of actually selling supplements. I think that for a brand, still trying to make its way, to make an impression, I think that it's always a good idea if you have the funds to do it, to make it big. Now, the Olympia and Arnold, more of the Olympia even is important because international buyers come to the show. And a lot of international buyers, they may not even hurt her right kind of one yet. I hope that they have, but there's a chance that they have it. So they walk through there looking like a kind of like a looking for a new ship to sail on, so to say. Right. And then, on the other side, who is the big dog, they don't know about, so they can walk down an exclusive in their territory. And whether it may be a bad way to do it or a good way to do it, a lot of people go strictly by the size of the booth. Interesting. I never knew that. Yeah, that's crazy. So it's important in your mind to make a very good first impression on these international buyers. Yeah. So I mean, okay, let's look at this way. He has spent $100,000 all at the Olympia, right, on the booth and everything. And a buyer comes from, let's say, India. And he walks in. He doesn't really know, but he wants to start getting some exclusive, some additional exclusives for his distribution from a supplement brand in India. He looks around and he says, man, I've never heard of that. I want to. But the end of that booth is really cool. That person will come up, talk to hopefully me or one of my main guys, you know, business card. And it's a past. We've had some really big new accounts come from exactly this way. So you can justify spending that kind of money. Now, not everyone needs to spend $100,000. And what you're, you know, that 100,000 encompasses not just the booth but flying people out and putting them up and feeding them and getting talent at the booth and shipping stuff and setting up the booth. It's a pretty crazy process. I mean, I'm sure I know I've done smaller caliber booths and it's a lot of work. It's a lot of stress. Do you have certain people that you allocate to take and care of that? So for one, I just want to back up for one second for an answer that and say that I definitely would not suggest a booth like the one that you'll see me doing or the one you may have seen me do last year to 99% of the company. I don't think that. I don't think that. People are like, oh, I'm sorry, I suddenly company where I have a peril business. Should I spend, you know, a majority of my budget on a booth at a show? The answer to that is absolutely not, you know, this is, this is needs to be a very calculated risk because the, the return of investment of a booth at a show is generally not a good one. Especially if you're looking for a direct response kind of investment. So like if I do a Facebook ad, I want to spend 100 bucks and I want it to bring back four or five, 600 bucks. Right. A booth will never be like that. It doesn't work. So we sell a lot of supplements on our booth. I would expect to see a sell somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in product at the booth. That is extremely unusual. And for a, you know, species booth did great. You're not selling. You're not coming in there and saying you're going to sell 50,000 or 30,000. It doesn't. It's hard to do that. And even me selling a hundred thousand if that's what we ended up doing, it's still won't pay for the booth because you got at the cost of goods, the cost of getting everything else. It's not that one break us even. So is it a difficult and stressful process? Yes, it definitely can be because if the product comes late or there's any issues at all, it's on you. And the worst thing, worse than even spending the money or whatever, even losing the money is having no products at the booth is extremely, I can't even imagine a more definedly embarrassing thing. It happened before when me and, you know, my old business partner, we had to, we spent some money to the product and come for the first day. I want to show up at the DM booth because I was so embarrassed to stay at the front of a booth with no products, right? Has that ever happened before? No, that guy was we used to drive down the product actually most of the times ourselves because I was so afraid of that happening, you know, because you're investing so much money into it and it was like, I would always drive it to the Arnold. And that's the one booth I did at the Olympia, we really didn't have a lot of product. We had some product, but because I was once again, it's so expensive to ship product to Vegas, then you have to have the people, the union people bring it in. And it is a big, big expense, like you said, and if you don't get that return on investment, you're really risking a lot, you know, and so in a sense, you know, you're rolling the dice, you know, and I guess, you know, you've rolled it successfully so far, but not everyone does roll it successfully. I've seen a lot of people spend a ton of money at a booth and almost put themselves, and a lot of times put themselves out of business because of that. Well, you've seen, I mean, how many times have we been to shows over the years together where you will see a booth somewhere, and then that company will, we like, oh, shit, who are those guys? And then actually, they don't even exist anywhere. No, they don't make it past the Olympia. Yeah, they'll spend 100,000 on a booth and they'll make, oh, that's all the marketing budget we have. We just went bus, trying to make an impression in a place where realistically at the Olympia, you're going to see, I don't know, maybe 25, 30,000 people. It's not like a crazy amount of people. And at the Arnold, you may see a hundred thousand or whatever, it's 150,000, but of the actual people that you're seeing, how many of them are actually concerned? Probably. You see all the people that come in just to take the samples and run off. Right, right. So how do you pull that trigger? I mean, it's nerve-wracking, because you are taking a risk. Do you think you've got lucky a little bit? Is there a luck involved in that? Or is there a calculated plan all the whole time that you actually carried out? So, you know, I think that some of the booths for me have probably been losers. I just though realize that they've been losers. Right. So for me, how I kind of mind philosophy for RedCon has always been either go big or don't do it. So if I wasn't prepared to do it like the first Olympia we didn't do for the very first one, not last year, but the year before we had started going and we had supplements and we were thinking of doing the Olympia, but I would have had to do a small booth, I would have to do it like a 20 by 10. I would have had to, you know, have normal backdrop up there and it would have been really limited and I said, you know, what I'll wait until I can do it where I feel like it's impressive and we're making a statement. And I think to myself, you know, how much longer will it be important for me to do this every year? Because at some point, I think there's got to be a tipping point where it's like you've already reached a level of awareness. Right. Is there a point to doing it other than like just wanting to be there? So I would imagine for me personally, you would see me do it maybe another year or two and then it maybe one year off when you're on or maybe an Arnold and Olympia or something, you know, where there's some space, some of the big expos that we've seen really big success with have been internationally like Fibos or Dicolas. Right. Did you have your own booth at Fibos? Did you're distributed there? Have a booth for you. The distributor Lars from Peruvius, paid for the booth, our help to us get the booth and it was in his group of booths. But the cool thing is, is the amount of distributors that came up that weren't in the area that he distributes in Europe was amazing. I mean, just incredible. The amount of people from Asia, the Middle East and like places you never had heard of, came up and gave me their cards and were interested in the brand and we got a ton of interest and then it's kind of sales based on being there for an artist distributor in Europe. So it's really depends. They just want to tough because you made a good point about the unions. So one kind of crazy thing with Vegas is you can't actually bring anything to your booth. Right. That was crazy. Right. That. Bring it to your booth. And in the last year we had some really crazy shit happen. You remember the booth at the big hanging screen around the street? So we had a booth price. In the booth price, we got a very reasonable deal for that such a great booth. And we paid for it. Obviously, we didn't last year, we didn't sponsor the Olympia. This year was sponsored. So last year it was 17,000 bucks for our 20 by 20. Yeah. I went to the college and I knew I was going to get off for all of our artists was empty. This year it's more because we're a sponsor. But we had that space. So I figured out I had a budget and I knew exactly what we're doing and then come to find out all of the rigging charges to rig that thing up. Yeah. Stabilize the big screen. So it ended up being $17,000 for the union to pull up to secure the screen. Oh my god. Wow. Yeah. I had no idea. We were, they had our MX for some reason. I don't know. I guess it's part of the deal I had to give to them. That's seeing all these charges. $25,000 for power. There was additional power for the screens. There's screens. Everything. Anything. Little thing they were hitting us on. So it ended up having $27,000 in additional charges that weren't expected. And so after I was like, dude, how did this happen? And I couldn't believe that this was because they were their billing us. And so it was kind of like, that's why I say it was a winner. I love doing it. But I never, I didn't realize that they could just charge you whatever they want, essentially. Yeah. We did. And they did. So this year's nothing's hanging from the ceiling. Don't say it. No. You're going to see it's 27th foot tower. It comes up in the middle. It's going to be awesome. It doesn't need to be secured from the top. Because there's nothing hanging. Well, you learned, you learned a very expensive lesson. It was what you said. Very expensive lesson. But these, these are good things. This is good information. Because I, this probably people out there thinking about getting a booth maybe next year. And now they know, don't get anything to hang from the ceiling because you can get nail for that. No, even a banner. Even a banner would probably cost you five or six thousand a hang. You know, just a big banner that you see hanging. Number rich pina used to always have the really big banner at the time. I don't know what it costs to put that at the LA FedExP. But at the Lempia, I would imagine that serious money. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. We've had that. You just tell you, because you have no other option. You do it or you don't. They get you. Now, another benefit. Now, red card one, obviously, is the official sponsor of all of RX muscles, Olympia coverage starting this week through September. And the great thing about that is that we actually get air and sing them into do some of the wrap-ups with us. And I know you like to do that type of stuff. And you're good at it because you did it with us for many years and all the show coverage that used to do for RX muscle back in 2011, 12, 13. Now, are you feel like you could, you're still up for the task? I mean, you know, because you got a little rusty because you know, you've been behind the an office running a company now. You think you can get that net old, you know, flame back in you, that old, you know, hunger to, you know, to really analyze the shows and break it all down again. So that there's two big benefit. Well, one, first of all, I'm not rusty. I'm rusty yet, doing the shows. But I do videos all the time. You see all the commercials we do. Yeah. I feel like I'm in front of the camera more now than I was then, if you could believe that every morning I'm doing Instagram live. So I just like, I'll see that my wife's watch is all your Instagram's. Oh, good. Good. Good. By the way, happy birthday to you, Sunford. I should tell him. Oh, thank you. My middle son, eight and his three today. And I actually went to the beach this morning with him and if I'm a little bit red at all, it's because I've been at the beach this morning. So, um, so what was I saying? Oh, and from the camera. And then number two, the other thing is that I don't have to censor myself at all now. Right. Or I'd be worried a little bit like, oh, if I say anything bad, this guy wouldn't like me or, you know, the powers that be will be upset with me, you know. And now I can say anything I want. Because it was never whatever. I'm trying because everyone wants your body. Yeah, right? It's still be nice to me. I don't want to. Yeah, I could say something bad about that. One of the athletes and they'll come up and ask for sponsorship the next day. So, I'm going to give you, I'm going to throw a couple. We're going to do some official Olympia prediction type stuff over the next couple weeks. And, you know, that's going to be all the fun stuff. But, you know, right off the bat, you know, obviously you're very good friends with Flex Lewis. He lives in your back yard essentially. Flex actually texts me. We texted each other back and forth, you know. He's no longer with it. It seems like no one's with A, am I anymore? So I guess there's no more contracts from what you understand? Uh, I know Phil is not. I think that they just got somebody back on because if they did the whole action. I want to say that it, that it is a chem, Williams a chem is from now because, you know, MHP has always done this. Strard, Dante, now that he's back, he's always back. But there's no magazine. So what's there? What's there? What's the relationship? Well, he loves to advertise magazine. So you probably. But there are no magazines of Aaron. Right? I guess he's done. I think the portion of muscle and fitness that is Flex. I don't know. But I know that's how it works. This is why why would he? As much as I love the chem. Doesn't make sense that MMI would reach out to a chem specifically. You drop, flex and fill and everybody else. But then pick up a chem, you know. Sure. Doesn't make sense. So yeah, that I mean, so I know Flex Lewis is not with AMI anymore. He's only talking. Talk. He's not showing any interviews. He told me until after the show. Yeah. I'll really want to talk to nobody. He's keeping it. Yeah, not even mainstream. I guess media have been contacting him according to what he told me. And he said he's just going to hold off. Obviously he's got a losing level like 12 to 13 pounds. So he's really focused on doing that. Now you see him on a pretty regular basis. He's obviously a backyard. And he'll kill his coaches right here. We're going to work out as Jeff. So I see him two, three times a week lately. Oh, yeah, he's been asking me. He's like, when do you come into my gym? I said, well, I haven't got an invitation yet. He's like, oh, he's like, the car. She can come to my gym. So I said, I got to do a field trip. I'm going to go down to see RedCon. I'm going to see Aaron and then I'll come to you and Jim and I'll just touch you. He would love. Trust me, he would love to give you a good tour. He's very proud of it. As he should be, and does it say, it's amazing. Yeah, I heard it's incredible. Now who trains it? Like certain people have a key or how does that work? You know, I didn't get to train to flex his gym. Well, it's invitation only. So it's very exclusive. And he makes it like that's a very big yield to him. It's very exclusive. So I should feel I should feel honored. Oh, if you bring, because you didn't show his you're out. Yeah. He means you're somebody for sure. Oh, that's good. I can't even bring something like a friend comes or my family member comes. I can't even take my key and bring him in. Oh, no. He but he in. That has not been vetted by him. So you actually have your own key? Yeah, have a key. Yeah, we keep. So I can do it for our dairy. He'll also out in my wife's lot. And Eric Hart, who's my vice president, Sylvie, too. But he has a key. He's best. How do you qualify to get into the gym? I mean, because obviously, you know, like, you know, like some people that can go in some people that can't because he have to like, you know, you like, do a Google search on you or something like that? I need not look 99.9% of people can't trust. OK. There's there that people ask all the time. We'll say, how do I get in that? Say it's impossible for 99% of people. So what do you like if that's friend? You think is a big lining wanted to go train there? You'd let him know. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Please, my phone. Jason, you know, they could sit outside of rest of their lives. He's not kidding. It's like it's like the night at the rock spring when they were trying to get into the club. They would never let him in. You know. Yeah, exactly. Literally. It's like that. You know what I'm saying? You'll be able to hit the ruffle. Hit the ruffle, Johnson trains there. A lot of the MMA guys usually has celebrities that train in there. You know, mostly athletes, a lot of professional athletes. And he's very selective. I mean, you, like when somebody comes in and athlete comes in, if you like Jeremy Pothrin, my athlete, you know, top five at the Olympia. Yeah, I don't Jeremy. He's good guy. OK. So they're he's very selective. Very smart. Is the gym like is there someone who staffs the gym or it's just like, you come in with your key and you turn light on your train. You come with your key, but there's usually people during during business hours. You know, he's there because he's there a lot now. Yeah. Hit his wife, Alir there during the day. And then around five or six, it gets kind of crowded because a lot of they have a whole crew have to come in around that time. And then in the late evening or in the weekends, it's, it's sporadic. You know, does he sell like supplements there and something like that? No. No. And that's probably one of the big reasons why he's selective is because it's like a private, I mean, it's a private area. I mean, you could hypothetically, you know, anything that's in there, you could remove which he has here. And now the thing I find ironic about this whole thing, Aaron, is that you obviously have the key to flex his gym. I know you go to the other gym busy body, also in bulk of there. But you also have a really good gym in your, in your warehouse there too. I do have a nice one. Yeah. Well, if I had, I would never leave there. I would always just train at my own place. I'm sure you have all the equipment you need, right? I got bored of doing it. You know, I have, I need a little variety. So in my own gym, the only people that train in the gym with the office here is usually me and Eduardo. And then I buddy Joey will come and work out with me. So, you know, it's kind of not a energy of the atmosphere is pretty limited, you know? You know, but aren't you working all the time? You're always in meetings and busy and traveling. I mean, who has time to go to the gym separately? Do you actually really have time? So flexes gym is less than a mile from the office. Right. You can literally get there within three or four minutes. Oh, okay. So it's very close. It's very close. But I don't, the reason why I don't go there more often is because it does slow me down a little bit and there are people that want to talk. Of course. Usually by like, if I'm there at 7 o'clock, my wife will start being like, what's wrong with you? You'll just forget it. You forget you was track of time and then you realize, holy shit, you know, I'm going to get in trouble now, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, you go there, I usually get a trouble. So that's why I never went to bed because when I went, when I lived in New York. I said, I was a Steve gaming and I had a free membership there in my whole life, my whole career. So even till this day, and, and Steve, you know, liked when I came to the gym, but when I went there, we take me double the time to workout. Oh, yeah. Because I talked. Even when I was in there with you, and we're shooting people who is where like, pulling you side, trying to talk to you. Yeah, it's, it's because you know everyone and I guess the same thing can happen. It flexes gym there. Or busy body. Put that back. You know it. Busybody is terrible. You're going to busybody, you'll be swarmed. There's lots of competitors there. It's crazy. Busybody is not. Also, I had a store at Busybody. We had vocal nutrition at Busybody. So when I opened that store, it allowed this sounds bad. Because I do like talking to people. I'm a friendly guy. But when we open the store, people now had a reason to come up and talk and have a legitimate and you couldn't beat. I couldn't be like, I'm sorry, I'm training. How much protein do you think I should take? And then I answer, because they're going to buy the protein at my store. But anyway, do you still on that? Both companies are first? I close it down. When me and PJ split, blackstone and everything, I kept it open for a month or two. And then I realized that it really wasn't making any kind of significant money. And the truth of the matter is, like, four stores, my opinion on retail locations is you need a really be there. You need to like, you need to be there. Because the people that we had were nice and everything, but they weren't particularly knowledgeable and they weren't super motivated because it's not like to high-paint job. So you need like the brick and mortar retailers that do really well, educate the shit out of the heat. I agree. You've got to really teach them the products and then understand what they're doing. That's tough. Now, where do you see the, the supplement world going in terms of these brick and mortar stores? Because a lot of them are just not doing well because of Amazon and all the online places you can buy stuff. Do you think we're going to see the decline and even, you know, closing a more like GNC's and Vitamin Shops and all that stuff in the future because of the fact that it's not sustainable? I hate to say that. You know, there's a lot of brick and mortar owners that I've become friends with and feel very close to. But I think it's a, it's a tough proposition to beat Amazon and really the online thing. I mean, how often do you go? I mean, do you take all kinds of supplements often? Do you go into a store in buy it? Never. Never. Neither. Neither. But I know what I need to know. If I was starting out and I was come getting into it, I probably would find a store like you said with someone that is knowledgeable that I can go in and ask questions to because that's something that that's how I do all my learning. You know, you got to find someone who you can who can answer all your questions and sometimes online it's not good because there's too many different opinions, you know. Right. Now, I agree. You have to the way that a store can work and be functional is have somebody or people that are very knowledgeable that can provide value to the customer when they walk in. We just, I just literally got back from yesterday, got back from the vitamin shop product education conference and I spoke to some tents. I spoke to groups of 120 people, me and Eric Hart and I'm in Brian Shaw. I had him play it was really cool. They love Brian Shaw. So I talked to these health enthusiasts and man, the store owners, the store managers at the bottom shop were so into it that it gave me hope for those guys because they really wanted to learn and we talked to so many of the next day at the expo. I felt really good about it. But all in all, you're going to have to be or it's going to close down now. How long is it sustainable? I feel like it's going to no matter how good they are as they are and not continue to progress. It's going to be tougher and tougher. It's almost like the magazines. We knew where their days were numbered and now they are done essentially now. I just feel like that might happen to the brick and wood. Is there at least some of them? I think the specialty stores will always be successful. But I think the big chains where they just hiring the kids for minimum wage are just not going to be sustainable. That's just what I see it. I mean, just look at everything else. I mean, look at it when I was a kid, JC Penny. Remember, JC Penny being huge and everywhere. I don't even know if it exists anymore. Seriously, it's for her gone. They're still around, but I think in much more limited amounts to this point. The good thing about mall shopping malls is people like to go there because it's a social type of thing. So maybe some of the stuff that malls might be successful still because people like to spend the day with their family there and especially their reigns. But yeah, I mean, at this point I have no time to do anything. I do all my shopping online. I give Amazon probably, I would say 95% of all my business. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. Yeah. We saw Red County Amazon now. We're actually a seller instead of just selling to people that saw Amazon. And the amount of money that is there is pretty mind blowing that even for a settlement brand. It's very important to control Amazon and have your product sold on Amazon. Do you think you think that you should just have your own store on Amazon? Yes, 100%. No. Why is that? Tell us to give us here in Sainland. So originally, we sold to people who sold on Amazon and we sold zero. We had no sales on Amazon. We didn't have our own store for anything like that. And we were approached by Amazon. The consumables department, not this last Olympia was so last year. And they said they're looking for brands like ours. We have no actual representation. But we sell to other people. And when I visited the Amazon, the consumables department in Seattle. We had an Eric and our market director. And they told us that $500,000 a month of Red County products were being sold. This is six months ago or seven months ago. She's free month on Amazon. And they're like, but of that, that's actually being sold. How much are you guys making? And they actually broke down the numbers. You'd be retired, retired not to have your own store and control who's getting it. So we did it. It was not an easy decision, but to cut off every single person who sold on Amazon. And then made all of our current retailers sign a contract saying that they wouldn't sell on Amazon. They wouldn't sub-distribute to something selling on Amazon or they'd be responsible. And we lost a lot of sales. We lost a few hundred thousand dollars a month and sales. Like that. It was scary. And we went from, so about six months ago, we had about 275 people selling Red County. Because Amazon, and of course we were not one of them. And now you have less than 50 people selling on Amazon. And we have captured quite a bit of those sales ourselves. And man, it was a really good decision now looking back. But it was scary at the time. Yeah, my, you know, don't let anybody sell the product sell your own products. Amazon. And also don't sell two Amazon sell through, through a seller central, not vendor central. So if they buy themselves, it can be scary because they can price it whatever they want. They don't give a shit where your back is. So they search the internet for the lowest price. And then they match the lowest price. Because you got some of these idiots. Like some, like a crash test dummy right. You're just going to put your price so low and look at your product as like a lost leader. Well, if the internet, if Amazon finds out on the internet, they will match that crazy ridiculous price. Oh, really interesting. They don't care what they bought it for. They want to be the lowest price on the internet. And it can, it can kill you because you can't convince. Well, I can call up Steve Calabrecy and natural body and yell at him. You'll also raise the price. Amazon doesn't give two shits about you and you can't reach anybody. Right. Interesting. Very, very, very good information from Aaron Singerman. Once again, another, very, I guess you could say, knowledgeable show. We try to, you know, this is a part of the supplement and bodybuilding industry. Aaron, that a lot of people just don't get insight into. So I think these shows are really educational. I think people are going to, you know, take some of this knowledge and hopefully use it. And look, there's going to be future generations of new supplement company owners out there that are going to, I'm going to make us look like a joke, you know, oh, Aaron and Davey, they were old school. And, you know, in ten years or now, you know, maybe we'll, you know, we'll be retired or whatever and they'll be, you know, taking over the next generation of this stuff. So thank you for giving us all that good insight. Thank you for RedCon 1. Sponsoring our all coverage. You're actually getting Davey Lumber to actually make a trip this year. Out of his backyard to Las Vegas. So we'll see you at the, we'll be at Aaron. Aaron's booth all weekend long. Doing interviews. Aaron will be helping us with the wrap-ups at the show. And all the pre-Elimpia, you know, hype and hoopla and coverage will be sponsored by RedCon 1 as well. So thank you, Aaron and we will probably see you next week on a pre-Elimpia, I guess, prediction show. Sounds good. Can't wait to. All right, and that'll take us to the end of another episode of R.A.X. Muscles Iron, Road to the Olympia 2018 brought to you by RedCon 1. I'm Dave Palombo. We'll see you next time.

Welcome back to Bustle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo. Today is Wednesday, August 22, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let's not waste any time and dive right into this week's edition of Recap Wednesday. Where we start with one of the few places in California that is in currently on fire, sunny San Diego. Where the Pacific USA Probecini championships were being held. Bringing home the gold with a bounce back win was a Olympia title contender, Norman Austria, who's getting better by the day. Second place went to local product, Lasha Akabimir, who was good enough in her second pro show to relegate veteran Shina J. Martin to third place. Second year pro Jamie Collins put together the best look of her career to slide into fourth and rounding up the top five with the best performance of her career was fellow sophomore standout, Jasmine Williams. You ever sat around in your bedroom thinking to yourself, you know what? I should use those credit card points I've been rackin' up to buy a fly to Vietnam. Boy, I bet you were excited for the chance to hop on a red eye for last weekend's inaugural muscle contest Vietnam event. Bringing home the gold in the men's physique division we had California import, Mottie Sharifat, who didn't seem to be bothered too much by the jet lag. Second place went to Ironian Powerhouse, Mohammed Coshcanani, and Bronze went to Spanish Heat Naker Juan Farrow, as he managed to hold off a strong effort from local favorite, Tran to and on. And closing out the top five here was the only other American in the lineup, veteran contender Patrick Fullgram. I'll tell you this, out of all the trips I've taken over the last few years, the time I spent down in Brazil still stands out as one of the truly beautiful experiences. And if he's going to keep putting out heat like this, then it's the extent out Philippe Franco might be giving the reason to go back sooner than I expected. Recently we saw the best men's physique east of the Amazon really start to kick up the intensity if you're not just at the unit's team start to head down the home stretch of their Olympia prep. In the past when he's been on, we've seen Franco be a guy who looks like he could be at top 10 talent. And with the margin of error being so thin for these men's physique guys up there at the top, it takes his one slip up for a guy like Franco to move in and seize the day. If you ask any boxer, they'll tell you that it's not the ones you see coming that actually hurt. It's the ones that you never see that you end up feeling the next day. And right now, it feels like the guy in the 2012 division that nobody sees coming might have not been better in powerhouse on the standard set. Last week in Anderson and his team released a new update that got the rumor mill swirling again about a potential return to the stage for the former NPC National champ. Since the last time we saw him compete, Anderson looks like he's slapped a few pounds of quality muscle on. Which will definitely need to try to slug it out with some of these monsters in the division. But as long as he picks his spots right, I think he's got enough in the tank to be a legitimate top five guy in the right lineup. At this point, I think it's cliche to keep saying over and over again that shows a one from the back. But I guess Ahmed Ashkenani doesn't care all that much about cliches. Right, nearly yesterday morning we saw the 2012 title contender released a rare pre-show update where we see the former Arnold Classic champ remind the rest of the division exactly who it is that they're dealing with. Because you only see him once or twice a year, sometimes you can forget just how good this guy can be when he's firing on all cylinders. So if everything starts coming together perfectly over the next three weeks, that first call out in the 2012 division is going to end up being one for the ages. And that does it if yet another edition of Muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Votes, there's 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love this show, this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning, on day polonvo and today is Monday September 28th, 2020 and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. For every athlete pulling out all the stops has a different meaning, but when we're talking about an athlete who's the caliber of Jennifer Dorie, adding anything extra to the mix can be a total game changer, even though she's only competed once this year, the looks she brought into when the Tampa Pro was easily the most complete from top to bottom that she's had to this point in her career. I don't know what it is that she's done differently over these last few months, but I do know that it's working and when she's at her best, Jennifer is one of the most talented athletes in the bikini division, so she finds a way to keep herself trending in the right direction, she's a name that could easily land in the top three conversation. Sometimes I like to tell my clients that we don't need to reinvent the wheel and all we need to do is make sure the tires are balanced to put the pedal to the floor when we need to. So if I'm a homit shabon and I've got Sean Rodin in my corner making sure all the nuts and bolts are tightened up, well I'd be looking ahead to the rest of the schedule for a place where I can finally open things up over the weekend. We saw photos of Sean Rodin helping Shabon find tuning some of the details in his presentation out in gold's vannis where I thought Shabon looked significantly better than where he was a few weeks ago with the Cal Pro. And if those two can figure out a way to keep making the right adjustments, Shabon has a real shot at cracking the top three somewhere before the year is set and done. Usually when you call someone a ticking time bomb, it's a bad thing because they're probably about to become unhinged. So today we're repurposing that phrase from my guy, I came Williams because he's a ticking time bomb. It's just that he set to detonate on the Chicago Pro stage. If you can remember back to March when he was on stage at the Arnold, I came look like he was poised to have another really solid year. And even though things have been crazy during the interim, this show is a great opportunity for him to stay on the course. That being said, if he can manage to sneak in there and steal the win, I think he creates a lot of momentum heading into the Olympia, which is exactly what he needs heading into the biggest event of the year. It's a new week, ladies and gentlemen, which means that now only we're two weeks away from the Europa Championships in Alain County, Spain. That show for a lot of different reasons is shaping up to be one of the most important contests of the year. So far I've heard a few people toss out names of front runners for the 212 tile, so I figured I might as well join in. How about Angel called around? Town for pound angel might be the most underrated athlete in the division. And I've heard from Angel's camp that this is the best he's ever in love heading into a show. This guy is no joke, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he ended up contending for a top two finish. That does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on day polimbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to another episode of Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palembo and today is Thursday July 12, 2018. And let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. You know what it feels like I've probably put together a million diets over the years, but never once in my life that I actually think guys might be in the gym actually eating the weights. Until I saw a Kim Williams in action last weekend. True to form the Brooklyn Beast is looking absolutely gigantic here in the early phases of his off-season program. Especially in one of the more recent back training clips, we saw him release a few days ago. Even though it may not have shown up in the play things, when you sit down and look at the overall improvements he's made in the 2018 season, it's hard not to come away and encouraged if you're into Kim Williams fan. And as long as he can keep avoiding the injury bug and doing what he does best, I don't think we have any reason to think that next year's campaign won't end up being his best yet. I'm someone who wholeheartedly believes that it's up to us to go out and create our opportunities in life. So when I see an athlete like Luis Rogers working her butt off to go out and create her own opportunities right here and now I can't help but want to stop and pay homage. After clinching her Olympia birth with that runaway win she had a few months ago with the San Marino Pro. Rogers has been out there hitting the gym like a one woman wrecking crew. And as you can see the results speak for themselves. Even in the division as talent heavy at the top like we haven't figured, I'd like to think there's still room for someone with first class conditioning to crack the top 10 at the O. Rogers long as she can keep delivering the same extra shock version of Luis Rogers that we've seen all along. I'd say she probably has a great shot at getting in there and mixing it up with the best the figure division as to offer. I had a conversation earlier this week with someone who just earned their PhD and they said something that really stuck with me. Successed anything is way less about being extraordinary than most people think. At the end of the day, it really comes out to how much you're willing to endure. And from where I'm sitting, men's physique all star Brandon Hendrickson looks like he's in this thing for the long haul. Last year's third place Olympia finisher is on the long march to Vegas again. We're all looked to take the rest of the best head on to battle it out for the right to be called Olympia Champion and earn his place in the record books. Truth be told, there are really only a handful of guys on the planet who are better than Brandon Hendrickson when he's that his best. But if he can suck it up and endure the sacrifice just a little more, I'll have a chance to go out there on that stage and rewrite history. Well, I know all my Brazilian World Cup fans are foaming at the mouth right now because it looks like their team is a runaway favorite now that we're getting down to the wire. But hopefully they can take a few minutes to stop popping champagne bottles and doing a couple hair dances in the streets to pay some attention to Raphael Brandeo. The rookie sensation has been an absolute terror so far this year and the string of top 10 finishes that he's already got on his resume don't even come close to doing justice to how it was to me's been when you start looking ahead of guys who might be the face of the pro league over the next decade or so. This guy deserves some serious consideration in spite of his small sample size. If I was going to put money on someone who might come out and really erupted into something special in the 2019 season, here's a guy who's probably right up there at the top of my list. Back in the day people used to tell me that I should always want to make a good first impression. Whether or not that actually turned out to be a good advice is probably up for debate. But if you're a rookie who's about to make your pro debut in the classic physique division like Nick Cavalero, a good first impression sure wouldn't hurt. Recently some new progress photos leaked of the former NPC lightweight standout that showed off some serious improvements in the form of 20 pounds of new stage weight according to my people in his camp. At almost every show now, this classic physique division is loaded with monsters from top to bottom. But if this kid can show up, play his game and try to win the battle in the conditioning department, you never know what could happen once the judges start putting these guys in the pastes. The fact does at the end another edition of Muscle in the morning. On day Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to our ex muscle news update and today's update is about our good friend, North of the border from Canada, my mood elderra, who just won the 212 Pro Division at the Vancouver Pro and you predicted it here on the show and I promised you if you won that show we get you back, that's right. That's right. It's a little bit about how it feels to be going to the Olympian this year. Man, it kind of didn't hit me, you know, like I'm not really, I'm not really mentally there as in like, is this really happening? I'm like going to the Olympia. I just turned pro, like a few months ago. I know. We just interviewed you. So it's a pretty great feeling. I have to be honest, I think I was happier placing fourth in New York because I had no expectations whatsoever on how I'd stack on my first show, but I think going into Vancouver I was a lot more confident. Of course, I'm sure you are because to get that first show under your belt is kind of takes the nerves away and now you're in your hometown, so to speak, you're in Canada. So it's got to feel a little more comfortable for you competing up there. It was kind of weird because they had the Chicago Pro in the same week and that's true. Vancouver, and it kind of split the lineup. Personally, I feel you would have won if you would have combined the lineup for both shows. I think you still would have won. Was that a strategic move on your part to do the Vancouver or instead of the Chicago, or it's just because you live in Canada? You decide if you can. I honestly think so too. I came in four pounds heavier than I did in Toronto, or even more. Five pounds heavier. I waited in Toronto on scale at 194, 195, with clothes. I remember I told you I put stuff in my clothes just in the end. In Vancouver, I was 201. Better look for you. Better look. I was a lot fuller, bigger, same condition. I was pretty confident. It wasn't really much of a strategic thing. I think it was just because Vancouver's closer to me than just flying to the states and the border and everything. Going to the states in general, I'm brown. Airports are not the funnest experiences. I was like, don't you get profile that these airports? I'm always the guy who is randomly selected. You are. You feel they're doing that because you are arrogant. I don't care about it. I know you don't care about it. You don't care but you do. When you're in Rome, do the Romans. This is how they do things. I'm okay with it. I got nothing to hide. Wanna check my bags. Check my bags. It's fine. But yeah, I'm always the guy who is step on the side. Sir, please. Then you think they make you step to the side because you have double, you're like double like a prejudice against you because you got these Arabic thing going. Then you also are bodybuilder which is bad. That'd be worse. It's red X all over. That's right. That's right. I actually thought that I was going to see more Iranian to 12 guys in the Vancouver line. If you're Iranian, you can't go to the US but you can go to Canada. No man, they didn't get the visas. People don't understand. People who see social media thinking Canada is all like, yeah, bring them all in. It's not true. It's not true. It's just as hard to get a visa to Canada as it is in the States. If you get rejected in the States, that's it. You're forgetting to get a visa to Canada. Oh, really? So I didn't even realize that. Interesting. It's a lot harder than people think. It's kind of crazy. I said this before. I said, professional athlete should have exemption from what they're doing to these people. Not letting them into these countries because athletes are like, I remember back when Russia was the Soviet Union and it was a communist country. For them to travel overseas was a big deal. Today we're afraid people were going to defect in everything like that. But the professional athletes will always exempt from the restrictions of travel because it was for competition. I always thought that the athletics were held above all the political tensions in this world. I said, it's not. It's kind of sad, but the sad. Because we have nothing to do with anything. And you know what? Since we're on the topic, did you read some of the comments that were on our last video? I can only imagine. Am I a Muslim, a sympathizer now? A sympathizer? No. Like, see, my son watches the videos too. Like he's seven. And one of the comments, you know, when you talked about my burns, one of the comments was like, is he was making a bomb? Oh, really? You know, people are so stupid. I wish I were, you got to point those things out to me. I would move them on those comments. It's not that. I'm glad I'm saying it so people can understand. Like guys, it's not cool that my son comes and asks me, Dad, are you making a bomb? Yeah. When that fire happened, like, we're athletes. We don't, there is that we have nothing to do with religion, politics, anything. We just love bodybuilding. We're going to wherever country to compete, to have fun, and just to be involved in something that we really love doing. That's why I always liked the, there's a lot of things about bodybuilding that's messed up. But I will say one thing. And maybe some people will disagree with me. I have yet to see any prejudice. It's the only venue where I see all people from all walks of life, whether they be black, white, Asian, Arabic, Jewish, Italian, you know, transgender, gay. No one judges anyone in the bodybuilding world. Everyone is kind of cool with everything that anyone does. All we're interested in is how much frickin' mussel you have and how ripped you are. That's it. That's what we judge you on. Yeah, that's what's beautiful about bodybuilding, man, is that you know, we're a small community relative to all the other bigger sports. So I think that's why you know, and as sense we take care of each other more. You know, we don't judge each other and everyone gets along. Even the, especially the athletes, everyone gets along with each other. Which is pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, the worst argument you have is whether the guy thinks that you know, your waist is not small enough for your abs or your glutes are not ripped enough. That's the only thing that people criticize each other. And if that's the only criticism you have, you know, that's your, you're living in a blessed world. That's for sure. It's so superficial, you know. What's next, you know, I guess you're just going to get ready for the Olympia, right? Um, I need some, I'm taking like a few days off. I still train. But from the diet, I'm taking a few days off. I'm still actually doing my morning cardio because the rebound is just brutal. It's horrible, man. God damn. You look like you gained about 25 pounds already. Yeah, something. I hope you, I wish you didn't say that because now my coach is going to know. I said, I told him, I told him 18. But you know, it's, it's 18 pounds of water. You know, the rest is maybe like a little, you know, you're probably gained two pounds of muscle if I know your physique. Bro, I don't know. I'm taking a few days off. I'm traveling this weekend for four days with my wife. And we had a trip booked. We had a trip booked right after Toronto. But when I had a conversation with Flex Lewis backstage in Toronto and he told me, keep going. He was like, I heard of you in New York and I saw you now in Toronto and, you know, he said, strike when the axe is hot. Right. He's like on disappear and actually that kind of, you know, resonated in me. And I stole my wife in all of on it. You know, so we're at a mouse who close to the qualifying for the Olympia. She had no idea. Oh. So she was like, okay, so we're back on prep. I'm like, no, we got a trip booked. Oh. She actually told me cancel the trip. Oh wow. She said she's not going on that trip. Unless I do Vancouver first. And I canceled it. Did Vancouver and now it's well earned. We're going hopefully. That's nice. Your arms look like they're about 24 inches right now. Yes. So to give us a little arm shot there. See what you look like. That's nice. Flex. That's pretty good. It's pretty impressive for a 12 guy. You look like an open guy with the sizes of your package. I think they're they measure 20. Yeah, that's impressive. How tall are you again? Um, um, um, five six and a half. I thought girls on five seven. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. So let me let's put it this way. We got about eight or nine weeks to the Olympia. You go in on your trip. You come back. You get into prep mode 100%. And what do you you fly in a week before? What do you how do you do the Olympia thing? Because you got to make weight, right? But when you make it way if you're easy. So that doesn't really matter. I don't know. I don't have a problem with weight. Yeah. I'm going to be in Vegas hopefully maybe Wednesday. Okay. Wednesday. I don't like showing up too early. It's for me it's more of an an out kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I like going a couple of days before. Um, just for the tanning. I don't know if I'm going to be on the press conference or not. I think it's usually people who win pro shows that get beyond the press conference. You just want to pressure. Yeah. So I don't know if it's that or the guys who are previously from last year. Oh yeah, who knows? I don't know. But just in case I'm going in a day, uh, a day early. But man, like I'm I'm going to unleash a complete new demon for this prep. I hope. Yeah. I think I think you're going to be dangerous on that Olympia stage. I do. I think that people got to be watch out for you. I, you know, they no one ever predicted I play Swallow and in New York. No one predicted I'd win a pro show. You know, every time I see these pages, they're always hyping. I can't say anything. I'm not, I'm not that kind of guy who would, you know, say anything online at all. Right. But I was, I just, was this close to being like, you guys are are, are hyping the wrong guy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Um, and, you know, I, I gained every show I was better than the one before my body. Loves, dieting. It just reacts so well to lower calories and higher intensity workouts. It responds well to cardio. I've gained two pounds maybe between New York and Toronto and at least another four between, um, between Toronto and Vancouver. And this time I have eight weeks. Well, we're looking forward to seeing you up on that stage and a good luck with the prep enjoy evocation and keep us updated. And I hope to be interviewing you in, uh, in that top five, but winter circle in the Olympia. That's the goal. That's it. Keep that top five to qualify again for next year. Yeah. Enjoy. You know, the fruits of your labor, congratulations on the big win. Thanks a lot, Dave. Appreciate it. God bless. All right. That'll take us to the end of another RX muscle. New is update. I'm Dave Palombo. We'll see you next time.

you trust First, we'll first pre-work out VAPE. Dave Alonbo here with an RX muscle rant. Today's topic is how to deal with social media, how to deal with the mental aspect of the sport. I originally wanted to have IFB pro Ian Valier on the show after his New York pro Victor Marie, and I wanted to talk about this because he's been a victim of an onslaught of people saying he should have won the show and he did look good and other people should have been him and I know it really affects him personally because I've seen him arguing with these people online. I wanted to just say a couple of things about social media. It's a whole new brave new world today that it was when I competed back in the 1990s and 2000s, early 2000s because social media was not an issue. You had to deal with the people responding to the magazines but there was no way to fit them directly to give their input. However, people still talk behind your back if they're Jim and stuff like that. What I noticed about when I was coming up was that I had to learn to put splinters on my eyes and just say, hey, you know what? Walk through life, worry about yourself. And I know it's easier said than done. When I would go to the shopping mall and I would walk through it then I would always wear a tank top and show ourselves. I was always sweating and hot and I was big and whatever. People would whisper stuff and I'm sure saying, sir, sir, sir, and all the notches, jealous things that people say. But I didn't even hear it. I was oblivious to it because I just blocked it out and I didn't care about what people said. I was interviewing Logan Frank and earlier today and we were talking about that because he puts it out there. Hey, look, you know, I know that what I got is good enough to beat anyone in the sport. He's very confident about it. He's not cocky in the sense that he doesn't bad mouth the other people. He just basically puts it out there and says, hey, look, I can stand with anyone. And I'm not going to back down and this is my belief and he just won the New York Pro and Classic physique. And he's got a really very healthy attitude about what he's bringing to the stage. Jay Kuntler had a very strong mindset too. He just didn't care if people said his waist is too wide or this is not good enough or he'll never beat Ronnie Coleman. He didn't let the good opinion of others affect his outcome. What he did, how he lived, how he focused on what he wanted to manifest or bring to reality in his life. And I think it's important as body bull is that we understand there is a mental aspect of this game. And it's a very strong mental aspect. Some people think they, or some people know that they're good enough to win. And some people don't think they deserve to win, even though they have the tool set genetically to do it. Flex Wheeler was very open about saying that he failed like he could never beat Ronnie Coleman. He felt he was always going to be second to him. Right then, and there was no way he could ever beat him with that mindset. Jay Kuntler, when I'm recordin' it, always said that I could beat Ronnie. I'm gonna beat Ronnie and he really believed it and he made it happen. So Flex Wheeler might have been the most genetically blessed, you know, best body builder of all time, had he had the mindset of Jay Kuntler or Dorian Yates or Ronnie Coleman to that matter. People who believed that there was no way they could lose because no one can outwork them. Both physically in the gym and both mentally when it comes to the mind game. Arnold also, a very strong mind game. He went so far as to play mind tricks on the other competitors to psych them out. Now, guys don't do that today on a regular basis because it is a little disrespectful. Now, you get called out for that on social media. Back then, it was a magazine article you did, you saw a guy's at the gym. It was a different reality. Nowadays, if you're too cocky or you're too obviously kind of saying to people, you'll get called out on social media. But a lot of guys do and they don't even care about that. So the answer to or the question is, how do you deal with social media when it really starts affecting you? You don't allow it to bother you. You do your thing. You know, whenever you compete for anything, whether it be body building, I used to look at the magazines and look at the different competitors who I felt were my competition at the national level and I would try to dissect them and figure out, how can I beat them here, how can I beat them there? Every time a new guy came on the block, it was like stressful because I was worried about, oh my god, I'm going to beat this guy and then at some point I said to myself, stop worrying about who's out there. Worried about yourself. Look at yourself in the mirror. Say, what do I need to improve and work on that and bring the best day, polumbot to the stage that you can possibly bring. Bring the best, the invalid year to the stage you can possibly bring. Bring the best, Logan Franklin to the stage you can possibly bring. And then left the judges decide because you know why at the end of the day, he invalid the year left the New York pro as the champion and he should feel like a champion. He doesn't need the fans to validate his victory. The judges did and that's all that matters is what the judges think. He's going to the Olympia. He's the New York pro champ. It doesn't matter in six months, not only remember the show anymore, they'll just know in one of the New York pro. And so don't take everything so seriously. It always seems way more serious right when it happens, but the truth of the matter is that no one's going to remember who play second in the New York pro in another year. They're not going to remember Justin Rodriguez was right there. I know there was a video released about, did Max, Charles gets screwed. You can say the fans could say whatever they want. It doesn't matter. The judges voted. And you know what? I think the judges are doing a very good job. I think in that effect that they did a very good job in picking any value. I think he was the winner. Was he better than Tampa? Absolutely. Absolutely. Does he still have tan issues? Yeah, his tan still wasn't good. Is he not showing confidence on stage? Yes, he was not smiling at pre-judge. He's got to work on that. But was he the best body up there? I say he was. I think a who's son, Massafa, Massafa has a tremendous physique with almost zero flaws. He wasn't hard enough. I think Justin Rodriguez's got probably had the best conditioning on stage. But I think his legs were a little shallow compared to his own body. He flowed well compared to Ian. I think Ian had much better legs than he did. But Ian had no calves. Well, who cares? All right. It's one body part that was not a weakness. It was just not enough to snuff with how big his legs are. But that's hardly a reason for him not winning the show. All the other competitors had their own weaknesses. Was Max, Charles, maybe his best? He was close to it. I think Milis did a great job. It wasn't deserved to the victory. I don't think so. I don't think his legs could hold a match to, or I can handle like this is the right expression to Ian Valiers. I think Ian had all the body parts. Right where he needed to be. I think his posing was better. He was more relaxed. He was fuller. He wasn't flat. His enthusiasm could have been a little better on stage. But he had the best physique. I think the Tyler Manning who was head judge did a fantastic job. I can completely defend his decision whether I, whether Chris the Cito agrees with me, or Milis agrees with me or not. It doesn't matter. I think the right decision was made. The truth of the matter was that no one was perfect at that show. Probably Justin Rodriguez was about as close to his purpose as possible. But sometimes you can be your best and it's not good enough to beat the guy who might be a little bit off. He's been in Valiers as a top 6 Olympian if he puts it together mentally because he's got the physique to do it. He's got to take all the little things that we have control over presentation, coloring on stage. Okay, confidence on stage. These are things he needs to work on. He's very immature in that sense. But that doesn't mean that his physique was not deserving of the victory. And you know what? For him to allow these shocks on social media to negatively influence him, for him to argue with people online to try to justify his winters stupid. He doesn't have to. Phil Pink made that same mistake after the Olympia. And he should have just said, you know what? Scor these people. Cares. And they don't matter to my life. They're not important. It's what's in here that's important. What's in here that's important because that's where you create. That's where you make things happen. You can do that. No one else can do it. You can justify yourself verbally for winning a show, or losing a show. That doesn't mean that you deserve it. Okay? Your physique does the talking. Another way to improve that is to work on it internally. You can't affect anyone else out there except yourself. And that's the bottom line and take on mine. But you can allow these other people to affect you. If you do, you're foolish because you're allowing the public opinions voice to destroy a deconstruct all the great stuff that you're doing to yourself. Ian should be out there saying, you know what? This is what I did. This is what I'm going to improve and talk about the tough, tough battle he's fought with confidence versus dealing with social media. Because that's the real issue here. We're in a brave new world like I mentioned earlier. You've got to learn to deal with social media and handle them properly. Some people are more mature. Some people are less mature. Coming up growing up, I was very immature when I was younger. It took me a long time to hit to be mature and to actually understand who I was and to be confident in that. And everyone with choice at different levels. I think Jay Colt was born mature. Never seen the guy ever get ruffled. But that's everyone's different. So just because Ian Valier acts one way and Logan Franklin acts another way and Jay Colt acts another way doesn't make it one better than the other. But as bodybuilders we have to understand where we're standing up in front of a bunch of people and the entire world on social media and being judged. If you can't handle that, get out of the sport. That's a fact of life. You're going to be judged by everyone. But the only one that matters are the judges. And if you can convince them, you're the best. You did you job. Ian you did you job. You the New York Pro Championship. Stop worrying about what everyone else is thinking. On day polonbo with an RX muscle rant.

I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is a very special one. He's the 2018 Arnold Classic Champion. He might be the next man to win the men's physique Olympia crown. He's our good friend Andre Ferguson. What's up? What's going on? Hey, you're you've been very quietly. I know. I've been very low key bleeding up to the Olympia. No hype, no hoopla. Kind of just lay in low. Is that this is your new style? I just think I've done for that. It's your favorite day, man. I'm just focused on what I'm trying to accomplish. You know, in the past the last couple years you kind of ran the gamut of doing every freaking show leading up to the Olympia and it worked for you. It worked for you. You look you've got better and better where you a little concerned this year because obviously one of the Arnold you shut it down, you know, and you kind of like lay it low You feel that you kind of need to get the edge back and you feel confident that you can bring your best to the Olympia without having to do a million shows leading up to them. I'm already better right now than I've been in any prepped And why is that, Andre? The time off serve my body justice man taking the rest and then prepping for double the time so I could do it slowly without running myself in a Deground like I feel fresh still. I'm fresh. We haven't done anything extreme because we haven't had to Say you look bigger than I've ever seen you this time at this point out. 10 pounds you're getting 10 pounds of muscle from last year Yeah Or from the Arnold was it which one was from the Arnold what you're a genetic freak man You really are what I was 194 I weighed 184 at the Arnold and I don't have much left to lose and I'll probably gain a pound into a muscle Like going down the stretch so would you weigh it last year's Olympia One about 184 185 that's a big big jump. You know will the conditioning be as good as it was at the Arnold I'm already beating all of that now so your leaner and 10 pounds heavier. Oh yeah, oh yeah Now what do you treat me that is that because you stop dieting all year wrong and you actually gave yourself a little bit of an off season That's exactly what it is because usually I'm always like you said I'm always dieting so I never really give myself a my body But chance to really really grow like I can put on like pounds of muscle incrementally, but to make a super jump I had to sit down Wow, do you look impressive I gotta say I want to ask you a controversial question because a couple months ago Jeremy boing deacquad a lot of flack for putting out Like an interview with some media organization where he said that you know Him and men's physique in general saved body building and A lot of people took offense that especially the body was a sick offense to that and they felt that you know The mister Olivia competition was never in jeopardy that the body building you know No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, first thing I'm gonna say is that stay up right How come the bodybuilders get to talk down on the men's physique guys and crack all these jokes and say whatever they want to But a man's physique I said something back and we're so disrespectful your Dave will all men here I'm not less than no lesser of a man than anybody in the open Dave Why because I don't choose to walk around at 270 pounds. I'm lesser of a man. No, I miss me with all of that Dave But to your question now I don't think it was everyone's jeopardy. No, but do I think that men's physique and bikini made it bigger of course I agree I agree even though Jeremy wants to sue me look He I still agree with what he I agreed with he whether he said I agreed all time You know, he did just the thing Bodybuilding was is and will always be king yeah, it will always be king But if you know this certain they like a lot of the endorsement contracts are going to mention these guys now Because it's more men's it's more mainstream fitness isn't Let's say all right Dave let's go back 10 years right 15 years ago It was only a couple of supplement companies and it was the bodybuilders who with the only people Taking supplements or doing bodybuilding now it's so mainstream that everyone does it That someone can send their mom to Walmart to go get protein from them and they're not necessarily going to want to buy the one with filth He thought it because that's not the look necessarily they're going to achieve when they because They don't even realize that Just because you drink that doesn't mean you're going to look like so he but that's the perception of it Right, no, I am a serious thing Do you um feel that Men's physique maybe doesn't get the love it should on the Olympia stage because you guys really kind of compete at the expo But well, so they're going to have competed the expo if they take us from the expo they would be no one at that Well, why can't you do pre judging at the expo in the night show at the on the Olympia stage in the Orleans arena? I agree with that. I agree with that right yeah You know what I'm gonna put that right I agree with that yeah, I mean I think that at this point You know it's been around long enough and established itself now as as a real Competitive sport the physique's have evolved It's from what they started that to what they are now. It's like night and day, you know now It's Rob bodybuilding. Yeah, there's no there's no difference between us and any other division besides eating more food and doing more drugs Dave I can competing any division if I want to any one of them But do I do I have to desire to know But what so I'm taking the easy way out or whatever the hell they want to call it because I don't I I'm not subscribing to that I'm not subscribing to walking around at 260 pounds or not right So you're you're ruling that after you originally tell me you're gonna go to the open division right No, I said if I said I'll sit down and think about it But honestly you're right now it makes no sense well you're almost at the almost one the Olympia so of course It doesn't make sense for you You're right when I look why wouldn't I stay here in Dominique And then right off into the sunset and stop competing right Let me ask you question do you have legs? Yeah, you train you have bodybuilder legs like that legs like I don't got bodybuilder legs So you can do one if I wanted to I got these focus on them for four months Dave when I tell you I can make any muscle grow like me Any muscle grow like these train to twice a week You're you are genetic free. Let me ask you this question if you did classic physique how do you think you do? Oh, I have to put on my my classic cuz he wait is still in like five six pounds All right, but you can you could do that in one three weeks probably? No, but it have to be put on in certain spots Wait, I need it. I'd have to add more to my back. Okay. I'd have to add more to my legs. You got a great back when you talk to them Do I think I could be good? Yeah, I think I could be real good, but it would take time I'm not gonna say oh I'm going to classic next season I'm gonna be the man oh hello that ain't happy. Well, what do you do this? Let's say you win the Olympia Okay, or you or come in second or let's we're not gonna I don't want to jinx you. Let's say you come in top two with the Olympia Why not next year? Do the arle as in in physique when that and then do like another classic physique show during the year just for the shits and giggles I'm not competing at all in the season. You're not Nope, why not Just because you're honestly I'm just gonna go and enjoy my quality of life Then and get the off the stage money Okay, you're not gonna do the Olympia or you'll do the Olympia. No, I'm gonna do the Olympia. I don't know no new your pro none of those shows Yeah, okay Why not what about just doing a classic physique show to see how you do? Not I'm not competing like it doesn't it just doesn't You have been ripping and running for the last four or five years, man. I want to enjoy my quality of life I just want to I just want to relax go on some vacations Just chill out not worry about prepping for shows right now Is that is that financially viable for you now? Oh, hell yeah But look, but look I've never been you'll just check the show checks. I don't care about the show checks That's not what I make my money So where do you make your money? I make my money off my three salaries that I get and my appearance fee So you are so you are getting a parent's fees now. Oh, yeah, oh yeah Where have you been going this year this past year? What what is the highlights You know Texas twice can tuck the floor or does that was everywhere man? That's where it comes everywhere. What was the most fun place you went to? Oh I You I have fun at all because if the home is an ad bro for a morning Georgia that we have Do you go out when you're there and and party or you just kind of chill out? No, we don't we don't party. It's not up thing Yeah, you don't party. It's just just not out thing I figured you were living the rock and roll lifestyle so you're very very low key now, huh? Yeah, let Like I've been then did that David doesn't like it's not something that I need to be doing It does not like prevalent to me like I don't like all shit. I got to go party. I can kill us for it Since you you've attained the level of celebrity in the men's physique world Have you noticed a lot more people like wanting to contact you and be involved with you in a business Or end romantic you have a lot of girls contacting you, you know on Instagram. So many That you crazy What what's her name's calling right now? What what's the girls in? What girl on the other line? I almost got you I almost got you almost got him You're a you All right, what's up? Yeah, but you know I get I get contacted regularly I'm not gonna lie yeah, I got a lot of opportunities come to my door I don't have to go chasing that's great. You're fine. That's me. You're made it when they come to you you made it you know Couple years ago you were on your way to say that because that's what my coach said all right Success is when is when you don't have to pursue things success is when things pursue you that's right That's right. Let me see if I double buy some post Yeah, you can definitely your classic physique. I'm telling you man. You've got it man I got enough muscle though like you're like a giant you were maybe a Johnny Jackson's body, you know You're a look wow when I go to like It's like flex sitting in two twelve and dominating for seven eight years I think they're like dude. I'm a suit right here get comfortable put my feet up and I'm gonna try to beat a best that could be right here in this division I'd like you would like to constantly prove yourself this would be great if you did a classic physique show and you won That would be like another freaking feather in your resume there I Get it don't get it. I get it. I think you do it If I didn't you could do it this immense physique guys did our great men's physique guys, but they never could do bodybuilding or for classic You definitely can do it because you got them you got the bodybuilder like body, you know? I'm not saying I can't do it But I just don't have to desire to do it. All right, look when the Olympia that's the most important Can you be Jeremy? The Olympia her Jeremy's looking really good Yo, he's shaping up nice dude. He's shaping up nice the champs shaping up nice But you're better I'm better than I'm trying to be better than everybody your daddy's not about individuals to me. I don't focus on individuals When you focus on individuals that's how you end up losing I focus on winning people people get Quarter-up in chasing other people's physics oh shit. He's already shredded six weeks out Damn I got start doing more cardio now you're driving from your own plan because you're trying to chase being second best that somebody else's Right now I'm just doing my own thing Dave. I'm going for mine Okay, well you look great and like I said you've got to be have some tremendous momentum from that Arnold classic victory earlier in the year and I think that you got to be the man to beat you know I have to Jeremy obviously so Jeremy's got to be worried I guess about you first I don't know who else is up there. I guess you think right mom yeah Raymont friend Brandon Ryan I mean did everyone's got a shot you know I guess but who do you like you like Raymont? I know you like his physical Well, I don't really think everyone has a shot though Dave Who's got the shot just you? I think Raymont has a great shot too. Why do you think why you think he's why he's got a great shot? Because he's tall you took four you took fourth last year at the Olympia. I'm going by steps took fourth last year at the Olympia Yeah, second at the Arnold one kids verb one New York Right right what about Brandon? I know you guys got peace, but what about Brandon? I think he took himself out of position You do he was third left here though, but then he got third at the Arnold and then he went into those shows and then he took the L to Joel simply True okay and and if he doesn't come back significantly better I think he's gonna end up dropping you know and he tends to be inconsistent You know is that you're pretty consistent he seems to be up and down when he's at up he's his best and he's hard to beat when he's not Well, look at his best. I He get he loses that his best still Yeah, when I'm at my best. I don't do this. That's sure That's sure there's only one Andre now there's only one Andre Ferguson now remember now right like You don't even know you see the Arnold the dude is massive on stage bro Yeah He's a different breed of dude like even me even I have to I a hard time keeping up with the muscular Already that's why they told me to get bigger they would like to go to Raymont is very muscular. You can go put on the couple more counts of muscle Interesting Yeah, the men's physique division has evolved quite a bit since its inception where the guys were weighing in the 170s No, it's not now What's it but people still but the bodybuilders who want to refer to old men's bikini Is that it though a guy cracking jokes thinking it's cute, but if I start cracking jokes about y'all Y'all get what hurting your feelings about and then I'm disrespectful this dad and a third not man Look look you if you want to dish it out you gotta be able to take it and you're right you're right You just get back at it when I do it you'll Dave. I'm no lesser of a man because I choose to be in this division What does me being what does me being? 195 versus me being 240 make me a more or less of a man I think you make it I think you make this division cool. I think you're good for the division because I think that you you legitimize it I think You you look like a bodybuilder to me and I think that that's Really what people want people wanted a figure someone who represents the sport and Jeremy's got a bodybuilder To don't get me wrong you guys both have bodybuilders physics and some people say hey, you know what that guy had a work Real hard to get there he didn't just wake up with abs one morning and get on stage That's how the but that Andre that's how the division started it was beach body Guys it went to clubs on the weekend and they got they took a dioratic and they jumped up on stage now with bodybuilders You know wholeheartedly true and that's what I say like what are they doing that to harder than I'm doing We're also putting the same hours in a gym. We're all still putting the same hours in on the diet Oh, let's talk about check that do more cardio than them guys like I want to see these open bodybuilders little cardio I know yeah, like them got oh, they say oh, it's easy to do what you guys do oh, you guys got to do it cardio you guys only left the lip I could say go it's easy to do what you guys do all I got to do is eat a excessive amount of food I don't even got a cardio that's easy Right, right, you could it can go either way. It's You have to respect every division for what it is Sure, and at the same time it's all bodybuilding If we're eating we're sleeping we're training we're doing all the same things a bodybuilders doing besides we're taking less drugs and not eating all the food There's not there's no difference So what oh, I'm sorry that if I want to live past 60 days. I'm sorry my bad My bad if I don't want to be on kidney dialysis You're the best on drain

Welcome back to live with Broughty by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo. And today's guest is a very special one. He won the Canadian National's Little, the 12th of that Vancouver Pro Am a few weeks ago. In the same day, I say the next day, he entered the Pro Rikes in place fifth of his first pro show in classic physique. The man I'm talking about is Isaac Bear. Welcome to the show. Hey Dave, thanks for having me. Wow, what a crazy night you had or crazy weekend. I should say you had it at the Vancouver Pro Am. You turned pro in classic physique and then you went and competed in the pro division and you placed top five all in the same weekend. Yeah, it was pretty overwhelming. That's for sure man, especially crack in the top five in the pro is being taken pounds under the weight limit. Yeah, did you have any intention of doing that or that was just kind of like a last minute thing they said, hey, you won. You want to do the pro show, want to jump in. Yeah, I mean, if I did win the card, I told myself, I'm already here. I'm already conditioned, you know, I may as well roll into the pro show and see how I do, and if anyone didn't know you were from Canada, you just tip your hat right there with a little bit of that A. Either that or you're from Wisconsin, then I don't think you're from Wisconsin with that accent. Talk to me a little bit about, I mean, you, this is not an overnight sensation type story that you have. You've been doing this for almost 10 years now. You've been banging away at first and body building obviously switching to classic when that came out. Talk to me at how did you get your beginnings? Where did your first get into just the body building in and what made you decide you wanted to do this maybe at a higher elite level? Um, yeah, I got into body building at 18. It was just growing up, I always idolize, like, you know, like a hercules like physique. And a friend of mine, she wanted pro card and at 18, I was like, how did you look like that? You know, when I always grew up reading, you know, the magazines and stuff like, you're, your articles and muscular development, did, um, did one show when I was hooked. Ever since then, I've just done a show a year after a year, trying to just be a better bodybuilder. You know, it wasn't necessarily, I'm going to go pro and be famous. I just did it because I loved it, man. Were you doing well in body building competitions? Or were you not doing so well? And then when classic came out, you started, you know, really, you know, shining. No, I did really well. I wanted a few provincial shows. I wanted some overalls. And then when I got to the national stage, I did my first national heavyweight class at 24 and I placed 15th. So that kind of was like a buzz killer, right? Especially after winning to shows. And then the next year, classic came out and I was kind of on the fence because dropping from 220 pound stage weight to dropping down to 200. That was like, uh, you know, bodybuilders to get bigger. Not get smaller, right? Sure. So I gave it a shot. I placed tight second at the 2017 Nationals ended up getting third. And that kind of lit a new fire onto me. I'm like, hey, maybe I can do well in classic. And then the next year I ended up winning my pro card in classic. So yeah, it was a good switch. How do you lose 15 pounds of muscle? How did you do that? Was a cardio man and no food barely just had to burn it off. It was really hard. Yeah. Now is it easier now that you've gotten down to weight once to make that weight again? Or, and how do you train in the offseason now? Do you have to just do maintenance type training? Yeah. Well, that's exactly it, right? So I basically maintenance training. I couldn't grow at all, you know, because making 200 or the struggle. Fortunately this year they up the amtries at 205. Right. So that's five on difference was it was good. But still trying to make 205 when you walk around at 255 is tough man. It was really tough. You pulled the code in my summary. Now in the pro range, you're going to be able to weigh what? 215? 215. Yeah. So I can have a good night's offseason and you know, try putting on some quality muscle. It's, I right. Yeah, the strip off all this muscle. Now you're going to go put it back because now you're just, what? I'm like, I was, you know, you're having a minute. You're having a minute now, but I can actually train, you know, I can actually lift some heavy weights and eat some food instead of eating like a bird and worrying about putting on an extra count of how hard it's going to be to take it off, right? Don't you think, I mean, I think it should be this way. Don't you think the classic amateur weight should be the same as the pros? I think it should be close. I should say a five pound difference just because I feel like as an amateur with the weight increase, it gives the amateur guys to really now develop a better physique going into the pros, right? So I kind of like the weight difference, but I mean, five pounds would be ideal for sure, not 10. Now, you have an interesting training, I guess methodology for those viewers out there who watch all our programming, I did a couple programs on DNA analysis, where you can actually get your DNA ready. And, in fact, my daypalumber.com website has DNA kits. You can order them and you send them in and the lab up in the Canada where we're going to talk about in a minute. Test your DNA and we'll tell you what you're strong in, what you're weak in, and, you know, what you have mutations in, what you don't have mutations in. And you kind of had that done, you had your DNA tested and you work with Carmen Tuchinek over there who does the DNA diva, you know, who we had on the show and who I work with and who did my DNA. And tell us about how that training went and how that differed from things you had done in the past. Well, at the DNA, we really dialed down the foods that my body could break down, right? You know, we found out I am having a gluten sensitivity lactose sensitivity, so we really avoided any of those food strength prep. We found out my body has high iron production, so we used proper supplements to battle that which helped my chronic fatigue and with not being fatigued, I was able to train harder, train better. And with the DNA testing with all the proper supplements and vitamins, it actually got my metabolism very, very healthy. So I was able to do only 30 minutes of cardio this prep versus, you know, 80, 90 minutes. And I only started 30 minutes of cardio five weeks out from my show versus, you know, 80 minutes for full 16 weeks, right? So the DNA really just catered everything down, you know, and maybe go from a Ford focus to a Ferrari, I guess, and it works, it worked really well. Right. How did you combat that iron issue you had? We would incorporate a higher dose of calcium with every meal and the calcium help combat that iron. So yeah, I worked well. There's actually quite a few more things I need to sit down with Carmen and go over, because we basically did the DNA and went straight into prep, but we didn't use any fat to this prep because my body doesn't utilize the fats properly either, so that was a big change compared to previous prep, so we had a lot of fats, right? So it worked well. Would you, are you going to read, use them again, and you're going to stick with this approach? I mean, was enough to convince you that this is what you need to do? Oh man, 100%. Like, as you know, like I've been competing nine years, I've done everything from, you know, everything you can think of to get ready for a contest, right? But this was by far the easiest, most enjoyable prep I've ever had. You know, 10 days old from my show, I was old golfing, and that's, you know, usually 10 days old from a show, I'm sitting in my room with the lights off, just trying not to eat everything in sight, but yeah, this prep was good man. It was, I recommend it to anyone, and it's good in the health aspect of things, right? It's not necessarily just body building, but up fine, you know, you can find chronic diseases through your genetics and stuff like that. So just on the whole spectrum of health. If I can be healthy and be a better bodybuilder, you know, why not, right? Yeah, no, it's great. When I had my DNA tested, I'm glad I did because I found out that I don't have any real predisposition for like Alzheimer's or dementia, which I'm convinced that I'm getting that because my dad is like going through it and like, yeah, I see him every day, and I'm like, oh, no, I can't remember anything either. But I have my DNA. My DNA is working to my favorite for this one. So hopefully, you know, the DNA test was right. Really, it does, it puts your mind at ease for certain things and it makes you alert to other things that you didn't even know that you should worry about and maybe supplement with and be aware of. So I recommend everyone to do it once again. If you want to get tested, I have these kits on the day below the site. You send away, we send you the kit, you swab your cheek, you put it in the vial, you send it away. They, they will call you up then and they will give you an email, you all your DNA analysis and they'll go over it with you, which is great. Explanacy, what, you know, you're good at what you're not good at and what you have to be aware of. So, and what's going to do you want to work you more in depth with a trainer, like you can call Tom Carman to check yourself and work with her. But I love science. I love when people can employ science and make themselves better at what they do. Isaac and I think that you have done that and maybe gave yourself an advantage. Maybe some of your competitors will say, well, I want to do their DNA now to see what you did to help. You, you, you be. Yeah, I'm an awesome all about promoting healthy body building, right? So I've had a few people reach out already asking about it and I'm all for getting them to do it. Why not? Yeah. Now, when the IFB be amateurly split with the pro league, obviously Canada was split down the middle, which is kind of weird, because most countries need to go with one of the other. And yeah. Now that Canadian assules and the, what was the Canada Cup? Was that the other child that had it there? Um, it's no longer really a part of the IFB be pro league, you know, qualifying series. So they're using what the, the Vancouver pro am and they're using the Toronto pro am I believe, right? In replacement of those two shows, that correct? Yeah, we call it the Canadian physique alliance now. Right. So it should be the exact same as NPC rules and judging and stuff like that. Right. Which is great. But don't you think that they should change the name of the show, to make it sound a little more prestigious? Because I mean, yeah, you won't have been a covert pro am and turn pro, but, you know, we, much better if you could say on Mr. Canada or something like that. Yeah, you know, that would have been a good title to have for sure, but, I mean, that's just the way they're doing it, right? So you just gotta take it as it is. Yeah, I think they should change it to the Mr. Canada. You know, just like I really believe they should bring back the Mr. America title. Because I thought that was like the greatest title, say you Mr. America. You know what I mean? Well, and that's old school body building up until now. And it's like, oh, are you Mr. Universe now? Yeah, you, you, you, you, you, you. But then I'm like, uh, I'm Mr. Vancouver pro am I? Yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I. Hey, you're still an IFVP pro and that's all that really matters. And you actually have a top five finish in some Olympia points for the Olympia's thing. Are you done competing this year? Yeah, I'm done just, um, you know, I really want to add the, the, the feedback I got from the judges was really good, you know, they were happy with everything. It was just add some size to your upper body, you know, which is, you know, 10 pounds is a lot of muscle to put on. So I'm going to do the Toronto pro next year since being Canadian. I feel like next pro show should be in Canada. Right. And, um, I think Toronto pro gives me enough time to add the 10 pounds that I need to be a competitive pro. Yeah, you know, plus the fact that, you know, you, you already had the muscle on your body. So it shouldn't be that, it shouldn't take that long to get back the muscle that you lost, which is actually the advantage for you. Yeah, you know, yeah, 100% comes back pretty quickly. Well, I want to just congratulate you Isaac once again on the big win, uh, and the, the big top five placing in the pros, I think, which is even more impressive and, uh, keep up the great work and, we're looking forward to see you all in stage next year, 10 pounds bigger. Okay, man, thank you so much, here's my pleasure. All right, and that's going to take us to the end of another episode of live with Brought to you by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo, we'll see you next time.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polumbo and today is Monday, October 5th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. If someone asked me to define what I thought faith was, I think my best answer would be believing without knowing. For a lot of people, it's that faith or that belief in themselves or higher power that carries them through all the moments of struggle and doubt. And for someone like the Entry Campbell being anchored in something like this heading into your first Olympia can be a major advantage, even though the Entry is coming into this year's contest as somewhat of a long shot for a top 10, he was also in the same position to start the season. So it's not that he's in unfamiliar territory. And as long as he stays anchored, there's no doubt in my mind that he'll be just fine on December. Here's a fun fact, few. Did you know there's a part of your brain called the Basel Ganglia that stores information about habits and routines that actually is separate from our long-term memory region. And now the Dana Castillo is back in full-time prep mode. I bet your her Basel Ganglia has been working in overtime. This is the first year of Danny's career that she hasn't competed in a regular season show. And I can't help but wonder if her body will end up being better because of it. This will be the first time in a long time that the world has seen a fully rested Danny ready to attack the stage and if she can tap back into those old championship habits, I see her as a legitimate top 3 threat heading into December. 2020's taught me a lot about life, a lot about myself, and a lot about how important it is to be in the moment because tomorrow was never promised. So if I can get the Antoine Valleant one piece of advice heading into his first Olympia, it would be to find some time to sit back and enjoy the moment. Because you never know when the ride is going to end. According to Antoine's team, he's sitting close to 282 pounds right now and slowly getting better by the day. And a statement on Monday Antoine said that he's ready to climb Mount Olympus and do battle with the best athletes in the world. And that when he finally gets there, he'll be ready to unleash all of his energy like a bomb. But hopefully, on his way to the top, he'll take a minute to stop and enjoy the scenery. He's at the end of the day, the memories will be the only thing that lasts. According to Darwin, the survival of any organism is contingent on its biological fitness to adapt to its environment. So do me a favor, go back and look at the transformation that Nicholas Vullier's body has made over the last two years and tell me whether or not you think he understands how to adapt to change, especially the change that's occurring in the 2012 division. And the latest updates from Nick's camp, the former Olympian looks like he's in the process of evolving into a completely new version of what he was with the only caveat being that this version looks like it's even more dangerous than when we last saw him. For me, this is the perfect example of a cultural Darwin at work because either you adapt in the survival, you refuse to adapt and die a slow death. And to Nick's credit, he's all in on the survival. And that does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on the Epilumbo Remining You to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Day of the Lomo here with another RX Muscle rant brought to you by RedCon1. Today's topic Apple cider vinegar. You know guys I hear so many people saying so many things about this terrific product and people have asked me number one. That's really the question I get the most probably. If any of you know me and heard me talk about Apple cider vinegar you know that I really like the product and the product I talk about is not just any apple cider vinegar. It's the apple cider vinegar with the pulp stored it. It's also known as, quote, mother. Mother is the pulp that is it's unfiltered. When they crush the apple because the way apple cider vinegar is made is they crush apples up and then they add yeast and they turn it into basically wine. Then they further ferment that wine and they turn it into vinegar. Then a lot of times when they sell the vinegar in stores they filter the vinegar because the people don't like to see little particles and scrap flow in the vinegar. That's most of the vinegar that you buy in store. This apple cider vinegar with mother is the unfiltered version. That's what we're talking about. That's the one that you can see the brags up there. That's the one that really is the beneficial one and has all the health benefits to it. Now originally a lot of people, the big thing with apple cider vinegar is it alkalineizes your body and I've said this before too. Really what it does is it helps neutralize acidity in the body, specifically in the stomach. Whether it completely alkalineizes the entire body there's really no research to say that's true. There's anecdotal evidence and I believe it to be true but I'm not going to make that same but that's not really what I'm here to tell you. The question is does apple cider get a burn fat? I would have to say if literally no but indirectly yes and more than the benefits of apple cider vinegar is that it actually lowers blood glucose levels and no one really knows how it does this but when people take it they notice that they're fasting blood sugars in the morning are lower specifically people who run high blood sugars. If you guys out there are running some high blood sugars try it. There are two tablespoons in about six eight ounces of water before you go to bed. See what your fasting blood sugars are in the morning. If they're going down then you know what worked. I've noticed that. I actually do by accident sometimes because what I do is I add it to the tablespoon of it usually to my fiber-wise shake at night and my blood sugars are always good in the morning. I hadn't realized it until I actually saw the pattern and I kind of just read an article recently about that and I noticed you know I said you know on the days they take that the apple cider vinegar in my fiber. I am running lower blood sugars in the morning so that's an excellent benefit. Probably the benefit that I see the most used for it is especially since we're as body bowls we eat a lot of food. When you eat a ton of food you get a lot of indigestion. It just comes into the territory. You take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in four to six ounces or eight ounces of water. That acidity goes away instantaneously and I know a lot of people because they eat a lot of food they get hiccups too. I am sure a lot of you body goes out there and have encountered this before you are gorging on a lot of food trying to put weight on and you just have to hiccups all the time. And I have guys contacted me like that this tri apple cider vinegar. It's a great hiccup cure. Sticking with the throat because apple cider vinegar happens to be a great antibacterial accompanied with the kills bacteria on contact. You can put it on your face for if you have bad acne you can dab it on with like a cotton wool or a paper towel. You could gargle with it when you have a sore throat and I've done this before. You got it diluted. Don't do it straight. You usually put it in like put a table spoon and like four ounces of water. Five ounces of water and gargle with it and I'm telling you that the sore throat will go away faster. It really does. I don't know if it's killing. It's not killing the systemic bacteria but it's certainly killing any bacteria that's in your throat. A lot of times these sore throats are just localized at that area so that could definitely help increase or fix that a little better. Another one of the terrific anti-fax them, excuse me, apple cider vinegar, I'm looking at my cheeky because I have so many things I can't remember anymore, is it lowers LDL cholesterol. A lot of people have asked me about the anti-colesterol effects of apple cider vinegar and they have a shown experimentally. You can google these studies if you want that it does lower LDL cholesterol which is another great advantage of this stuff. So how do you really use it? What's the best way to use it? I kind of use it, try to use it once a day at least every day but if you're experiencing side effects like acidity, high acidity, maybe your blood, blood, blood, excuse me, blood cholesterol is high, maybe blood sugar is high. You might want to use it on a regular basis. During my three week detoxification program that I give to people, I have them use it three to five times a day for three weeks straight. It's for pure detoxification purposes. The best way to do it is I usually take a tablespoon and I put it in anywhere from four to eight ounces of water. Donald drink it straight. It's going to, it'll first of all, it can destroy the anamone you teeth because it's so acidic. So you want it to move it down without a doubt. You don't want to speak about a drinking apple cider vinegar. If you have bad breath, it sounds weird because vinegar doesn't really smell like it but if you gargle with the apple cider vinegar in your mouth, your mouth will feel so clean and refreshed after it's unbelievable because you know I kill a little bacteria. That curing your mouth will cause bad breath. And so once again there's a ton of excellent things that the apple cider vinegar could be used for. And once again, can they all be proven? No, but a lot of these things like lowering blood glucose, you can see experimentally and they have been studies to show that they do do these things. Once again, I like it especially for people who have indigestion. This is the best cure all that you could possibly use for indigestion. I don't care you could take tons, you could take out the cell to apple cider vinegar, works the best. And once again, if you get into a routine of using it every day, you know, once again, the best easiest way for me to do is I do a fiber life shake twice today so I just throw it in there. If you guys get into habit of doing that, you'll get two tablespoons in a day and again, your heart's feel better. And again, I guarantee your blood chemistry will come back better. Give it a shot. What do you got to lose? It might just be the best natural cure all that you can use for all the different little weird, you know, problems that you have. And as a bodybuilder, I'm going to tell you one more great thing that you probably didn't know that you can use the apple cider vinegar for. If you ever take a bad shot, a bad injection and you get bruising on your arms, say, or wherever you happen to take it, you take out the side of vinegar and you put it on a paper towel and you dab it on there. Just keep putting it on and on and on and on. Let it dry, put it on and on. It will disperse that bruising about ten times faster than if your body did it on its own. I don't know how it does it. It's kind of acts as an anti-inflammatory from what I understand, but it definitely disperses. I don't know if it brings blood flow to that area, but you'll see that bruise, you know, just kind of disperse. It actually looks worse in first because the blood just kind of just starts spreading out, but by the next day, it's almost gone. So there you go. You got a couple tips to try for this coming weekend. I'm Dave Palombo, but the other red card one, R-Axmuscle ran.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polonbo and today is Monday, August 3rd, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Brady, Michael, LeBron, Geter, some athletes are so great, so far ahead of their time that they're on a first name basis with the general public. And embody building, which has no way less notoriety than football, baseball, basketball, being on a first name basis puts you in a rare fighteratory. But being an exception to the rule is just part of what Ronnie Coleman is at his core. Even at this point, his career over a decade into retirement, that Ronnie is still arguably the most famous bodybuilder on the planet. The man is single-handedly responsible for changing the way we consume the sport. So even if you didn't get to see him compete, you should still appreciate his greatness, because the man is a once in a lifetime talent that we'll never see again. Researchers who study flow in flow states say that we can rarely achieve a state of flow during leisure time. Believe it or not, we only achieve flow during work, because that's when we're doing something we find purposeful. But I don't have to be as psychologist to figure that out. I could see it watching someone like Dominic Cardone do his thing. After some of the long hiatus from training, lately Dominic's been trying to work his way back into the flow by doing what he's been doing for more than half his life. For as long as I've known him, this kid has been someone who eats sleeps and breathed bodybuilding. So just give him some time. It won't be long before he finds his way back into that flow state again. Click-click boom. That's the sound of Missy Truscott letting the rest of the fish to the vision know that she's here and she means business. Over the weekend, Missy released an official update from her road to the Olympia where we see one of the most dangerous women in the game highlighting some of the assets that brought her to the table. As far as the physique is concerned, I think Missy is second only to Oxonic Rashina in her prime. And when you're ready to fly, that close to the top of the mountain, it feels like it's only a matter of time before you reach the summit. Outside of all my normal work stuff, I'm deep into research on motivation and human behavior right now. And one of the things that I found really fascinating is that research seems to show that extrinsic rewards work best for right handed algorithmic tasks that don't require a lot of creativity. But when you're operating at the level of someone like Logan Franklin, right-frame left-frame, whatever, it really doesn't matter what the stimulus is or how it works at the end of the day, the man knows how to get results. Since he made the jump to classic physique, this is the best look that I've seen from Logan. He's thicker off top, he managed to give his physique a little more balance, and he's still keeping his lines together. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Logan Franklin and he's on a mission, and he won't stop until he's managed the conqueror, everyone who stands in his way. And that does it, yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on the Apolomo Reminding You to Always Be True to Your Patients, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is Tuesday, August 21, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. When you come up an inch short of your goals, you have one of two choices. You need to curl up in a ball because you're spent emotionally from bleeding out your heart and so and it's still not enough or you can decide to get your butt up and go back and do it again. And I'll leave it to you to figure out which one of those two camps classic physique all star are Russia bar falls into. With less than a month ago now before you make the long trek out to Vegas for his third straight Olympia, the 2018 Arnold Classic runner up looks to me like a man who's ready to settle the score on a little unfinished business. In my mind, when he's at his best, the level of detail that he puts into his presentation makes this guy one of the supreme talents in the division. So it becomes out ready to battle, plan on seeing some fireworks up there and that first call out. Are any of you guys out there old enough to remember that the H1 show best week ever? Well come this time next month. How much do you want to bet that figure stand out? Bojana Vassaljavik is still riding the wave after the best Olympia week of her career. The word coming from my people near the Vassaljavik camp is that Bojana is well on her way to putting together the best look of her career for this year's contest, which should put her squarely somewhere in the top call out range according to my calculations. All year long we've seen Bojana slowly start to build into this rolling peak that looks like it's finally coming to ahead at the Olympia weekend. Given how strong her track records been up to this point, I wouldn't expect her to start slowing down anytime soon. You know, some out last week and I found myself binge watching like pen episodes of Shark Tank, mostly because I was fascinated by the irrational confidence that some people had with their terrible ideas. When you start looking around the two 12 division, there aren't too many irrational confidence guys out there who can back it up quite like third year powerhouse recorder career. Correras coming into his second consecutive Olympia with some heavy expectations heaped on to his shoulders after last year's breakout top 10 performance something I'm sure the former British national champ doesn't mind one bit. When he's fully dialed in, Correra has one of those super round 3D bodies that almost makes him look like a cartoon character in some of his poses with his high level of talent. It becomes even 2% better that could be all it takes to jump him up with few spots in this year's stack line up. With the level of talent in some of these figure shows these days, sometimes it feels like if you show up being anything less than 100% you're basically out of luck from the start. But luckily for Sandra Gahalis being the total package is something that seems to come naturally despite a little hiccup to start the season. For the majority of 2018, Rihalis has been just about as close to perfect as it gets. Anyone who remembers that clinic she put on back in May to win the Pittsburgh pro understands exactly what I'm talking about. Last year, Rihalis and her ninth place finish at the Figure Olympia really turned out to be one of the pleasant surprises of the weekend. But by now the rest of the division has our circle on their radar. So let's see what she's got up her sleeve for a non-corr. One of the coolest things about bodybuilding is that basically anyone can turn it to a star on any given night if the universe aligns itself in their favor. And with less than a month ago now before he steps onto the Olympia stage for the very first time, I'm sure 212 hopeful Sandy Trudy is keeping his fingers crossed from a little bit of help from somebody out there in Joe Weaters bodybuilding universe. The latest updates from the Trudy camp show the second year pro looking as dangerous as we ever seen him. And if you can remember way back to the start of the season, Trudy really came out smoking with those three straight top three finishes in New Zealand, Fiji and Ethy Arnold. And given the fact that he's had plenty of time now to get his mind and his body back to 100%. He's got a legitimate shot at a top five placing that things can manage to just align themselves. Well, just perfectly. And that does it yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning.

John, Dave Pulando. After hours. Welcome back to After Hour. I'm Dave Pulando. As always, here with John Romano and Greg Valentino starting off the show. Guys, we were just talking before the show started about mortality. And what happens after you die? And John says the light just goes out. That's when I'm afraid. I say the light's just going on. That's what I said. Well, the reason why we're talking about it is because basically, we're all at that age. Dave, you're a little bit young enough. Yeah. But we're all at that age, if you live to be 80 years old, that's a considered a full life. I mean, wow, 80s is not bad. It's a full life. And so now, the last 20 years, I think of like fucking 9-11 and all that shit. You know, it's a while ago, but doesn't feel like 20 years. I mean, it's just went everything went so fast, the millennium. And now it's 20 years later, I'm thinking shit, if the last 20 years went that fast. And this 20 years goes, you know, it seems to go faster, you know, as you get older. I mean, look, we're already 2021 just about, you know, right? I think the context in which your memory functions plays a role in how fast or slow you think the last, you know, couple decades went because my son Max just turned 21. Now, I remember him that being born, the whole, you know, when he, we were in Mexico up under roof of the fireworks going off at the millennium. And you know, when the year changed to 2000, I think wow, that was like yesterday. And then, and then I'll think of, you know, a construction project or something I did, you know, 20 years ago. Wow, that was fucking forever ago, right? You know, so I think dependent on how you look back on it, but, you know, human beings are, are human nature and psychology is such that we don't want to accept the fact that our lives are over when we die. So we, we, we, we, we manufacture all this stuff after lives and heaven and and over here and you go and you get your spirit and all it. And you got TV shows dedicated to this. You got websites dedicated this book dedicated all of this hope that there's something after we die because we just don't want to accept that it's lights out me fall right at the end of the franos. You know, all even ghost like you don't believe that. I would come here's my couch come sit down, what do you mean from up there wherever you are sit down and have a fucking talk with you. You know, I want me to believe see my take is different see I believe that you know, we are living in a movie is actually a movie role we're playing and when the movie is over we go back and then we wake up again. So this is this is really not reality. This is just a figment of reality that we're kind of just super imposing ourselves at these physical beings these bodies when the body's done. We go back and if we want to re go do another movie role we can do another movie role but you don't want to we don't have to. So I think that's you know and it took me a while to get to that point because when I was younger you know and I was a science based guy was in school I was like you know what that's it when you know when we shuffle off this mortal coil that's it's the end of it but I don't believe that I just don't. We live in an intelligent universe you know I think that and I think that the theories of science are compatible with the theories of spirituality I think you have to just figure out how to measure them together. You know, no one two people on earth were closer than you and so and don't tell me that you guys didn't talk about you know afterwards and and all of that when he was passing away. You know what my father was totally not into any he was like you he's like lights out you know and I'm telling you I get so many like I I've convinced that he's sending me messages and and and what what makes you say that what I just hear I just well I told you the story I mentioned the story before the day after he died. In my garage in the middle of the night I go out there and there's a pigeon sitting. I told the story before. You know I couldn't figure out first of all there's no pigeons and came coral or very few and second birds don't fly at night. Where was this pigeon was just sitting up there in my inside my garage not moving not being rattled looking at me and I'm like what what what is this dad and then I realized that the. I'm telling the Italian you know definition of our last name polonbo is pigeon. You think that that's a coincidence that the day my father dies is a pigeon in the garage for 24 hours and until won't leave. All right I got it that Greg you'll appreciate this. I'm not good ones. I'm just I I okay I don't you know I might believe so over here but I did have an experience with my father I think my father I don't know this is what happened. I like this I I had I had I used to test my blood test where I was tested blood tested for Pepsi hepatitis C I would test positive. This is because when I was 18 I had hepatitis and I developed the antibody and it turned the thing or at least that was the explanation one of my the doctor gave me. You were exposed to hepatitis C so you have a you have a reaction to your body so you're forever going to be. I'm going to be. Hep C positive because you have those antibodies right that was the theory okay so I rolled this around and my father was always very concerned about me having hepatitis C even though you know he didn't get tired with because you know he was a doctor. Yeah and he did not with that explanation so. After he passed away you know this was a couple of conversations we had after. Now I have tested positive for hepatitis C probably six times prior to this insurance declined me I had all kinds of issues with this hepatitis C. So and he and he was kind of he was always vocalized his concern about it so he passes away and about a month later coincidentally I'm in Fort Lauderdale having a point with my doctor who is in AIDS slash Hep C specialist because you know I was getting my test prescription for him. So I asked him you know I explained my whole thing with hepatitis C and he orders his whole huge panel of blood work for me. He told me one of my viral low and he wanted this he wanted that and he and he sets this whole thing up so I go in and I get like seven things of blood they take out right and. A week later comes back and he goes you don't have hepatitis C. And I said. Wait a minute. What do you mean I don't have hepatitis C he goes you never did it's not in it is not a trace of it there's no have inside there's no sign indication at all whatsoever that you ever had hepatitis C. So how does that happen you think you father erased it when you. Wait I'll tell you what that's not really a ghost story. I have a real. I actually have to but I don't want to involve somebody else but. I had a a fuck a real go it's a real story and that I can't really explain I'm not sure was a ghost or a shit tell us. Yeah, but wait a minute I think you're hold it it's not a go I'm not looking to ghost stories I'm just thinking of. Anic doodle empirical evidence of of something that happened you can't explain like my Pepsi thing the pigeon in the in the garage okay that these are things that. What's the other explanation for it let me give you two more let me give you two more quick answers before Greg tells me. Why don't we cut Greg off yeah I don't want to cut him off either but I I think. Thanks in between ghost story and an explainable. What about it I go for psychic reading from a guy who doesn't know me from a home the wall he says do you I'm talking to your mother here I think and the name is such as a. She said yeah she'll. He didn't know my mother's name. Do you have a tattoo on your leg. Butterfly or dragonfly exit yeah you know your mother's acknowledging that I had a dragonfly my mother's name on it on my leg how does that happen. We also have in my house there's toys that go off randomly. Specifically one of my my wife is thinking about or talking about her sister who's deceased. And I had a psychic reading the guys like oh you got a lot of spiritual activity masses when you mean he goes yeah lights go off things go off it's a girl. Girl in the house. I mean where's that come from no one knows this stuff. I had one of those two that was very remarkable you know psychic thing but I think I don't know. This stuff falls in a category there's there's supernatural stuff that happens psychics or one of those that's not a ghost story nor is that an inexplicable event that we want to associate with the deceased. Family member or whatever well if it's telling you that you're getting a message from a deceased relative that that's accurate and that there's no way this person could have known what had it what is that. Yeah, I mean that's pretty that's pretty I mean a butterfly on a leg and with somebody's name and with s h that's pretty that's pretty like random and I mean you know what I'm saying it's it's pretty accurate you know she goes story right. I'm not 100% it was it goes but back after after my girlfriend passed away the girl who you know I was with she's tattooed all the way to Lisa. Right yes after she passed away I was in Washington, I was doing a drug deal okay and it was up on the heart I was actually on off Amsterdam Avenue. You know right where Martha King Boulevard kind of intersect they go at that and about a hundred twenty nine street and I'm sitting there and it's like two in the morning it's dark.

So what where did the arm come Was it attached to anything or one thing that she just said I just saw an art girl a girl's and like this Hold in your arm back it was a hand it was just like it just it looked it's a Meaning that that she kept you from getting out of the car. I would save your life Yes, yes, because back then I was on it, okay and back then You know, I told you I was 278 at five six.

You know in the hood and I was like you know, I'm not staying for this shit fuck you you know I mean and The fact that he came at me with that gun.

I didn't hear my girlfriend's voice in my head But she told me it look like a woman's hand holding my arm Back my hand like this and That stopped me from going out of the car and I'm telling you that guy told me I would you if you would have stepped out of the car to make your fidget foot hit that floor you were dead You know, so I don't know. I mean was it a ghost? I don't know if it was a ghost I believe it I believe there was definitely a divine intervention You've been my mother or my girlfriend Do you think it's my but girlfriend is because the girl that was with me was one of her best friends You know what I mean? Absolutely and they were you know and they were you know We were just sitting bullshit in the car and we were talking about Joel and we all the other shit and Joel said just died only I mean maybe two months before you know, so I was with upset still over that and I Touch my fucking you know just think had me I got to definitely definitely was that you know I mean and he is a prime lesson you know No, you know never know bro you never know I was You're dealing with pure evil No George that's what I was saying I was telling that guy was he was you could see it Yeah, that Caesar heckerian look at his face yet We sat on night and he had a jacket on. Everything He was defied of all You What's on that hot dog? What do you got on a hot dog? Where'd you get on a hot dog? I'm gonna be here in the 30s. I'm gonna be here in the 30s. Truck? Yeah, good question man. What's in the hot dog? What did you put on it? Down we're crowned mustard. I just do a little mustard. I don't really do the soud dragon gas. You know, it's not the hot dog that's bad. You don't think it's the hot dog that's making you fart. It's pretty bad when you get out of your head. You can't take the smell of your mouth. It's pretty fucking bad. It's not the hot dog, John. It's the sour part that's making you fart. It's exactly you. It's the night train. It's the night train, they say. That's future fine in your dreams. Yeah, I think it's just huge fine exactly. So to cabbage, the sourcrout develops the sour. The sour part has the back to good things. I'm gonna put some food for menta. You're gonna pull full sugar Pepsi too. It's a nice chicken. It's gonna be. This is the fucking health. It's just sicker right. It's just sicker right. It's just sicker right. It's just sicker right. It's just sicker right. It's just sicker right. I gotta join the way the light up. While he's driving the truck, he's gotta join it. Before we get to VBA to here, I just want to add to the ghost story thing. Because there's a restaurant on Long Island and Greg, I think there would black. We've been there with black meat right up. That is supposed to be the most haunted place on earth, I think. So, I mean, are these things, why is it, why is it this one place? Is where the haunted and it doesn't happen. You can't get one of these guys out of come sit on my couch and talk to me. But that's a hundred-year-old place in a lady that you still lived there. What do they think is the one that wants to? I'm not going to fire. Didn't a girl hang herself from the rafters. I don't know, she might have hung herself down stairs in the fuck basement. But I know, I was there with, I've been there before we're black men. And by the fucking fireplace is where the, I think she appears. But they said, no, they said that repairmen would be there during the day. It wouldn't shit. They'd run out of there, scared of out of their minds. They'd leave in their tools behind. They'd say, oh, that's true. That's true. John and I both, but John, you know, black men swear said he's had, you know, a ghost experience is when he was there. You know what I mean? He also said that he had encounters with aliens that did all kinds of things to us. Oh, yeah. It's a terrible thing. A total of eight. A total of eight. Oh, those eight must be great. Oh, I don't know. Oh, we all should be doing this. So John, how do you explain all this with your lights out, theory of life? I cannot explain it. I don't, I, I want to know if these things are supposedly propagated by, Ah, relative's. Why did Jimmy take it to dump? Why did Jimmy take it to dump? Why did Jimmy take it to dump from the back of the truck? Yeah, I think he went back in the truck. He's pulling his lunchbox. He's pulling his lunchbox. He's not. You know what they say? He's made it to your consciousness go when you go into anesthesia. You know what I'm saying? If you can't believe it, it's a different thing. Let's do it. God. You have a disc. Let's say that it's, you know, it's consciousness. It's consciousness. You know, where does your consciousness go? I've had it. Why did they make it such a riddle? You got to figure this shit out. It's got to be the pigeon. It's, you got to know what to say. Why? Just come, you know, my couch and talk to me. Maybe it's not that easy. Maybe it's not what I'm saying. It's a bad internet. It's like a bad internet signal. You know, I think that they have to like communicate. And I think our vibrational levels are so low because we're such, we're so unenlightens that it's hard to connect. I hope you guys are right. The same radio waves. Yeah. I mean, it's a different speed realistic. Yeah. Yeah. You know, some people would say, why did Dave's father appear as a pigeon and not just appears him? That's, I'm just saying that's what skeptics was saying. But how would I, you know, because I think that when you have to, when, if I'm over on the other side and, and on that of substance anymore, and I'm just an anti pure energy, I have to figure a way to, to convince me the rational thinking scientist that I'm actually having a legitimate message from the other side. So it has to be something that in my experience is I would interpret. Like, you might show that same thing to my sister. She may not pick it up, but she might not even know the word, Pellumbo means pigeon and Italian. My father obviously knows that I knew that so that that was his message to me. All right. I believe. I'll give you a better idea. I think that that's why every single human on his planet has a different personality and a different, like you and you have a sister. So you and your sister have the same DNA to same blood. We all have heart brains and everything like that. What makes you have your personality? What makes me and my person? And we're makes Jimmy the bull. Where does Jimmy's first high-buddoll? I got a third brain. Yeah, Zanger issues. That's good. I got a third brain. I was told I have a third brain. Jimmy, let me ask you questions. Have you ever had any experiences? I know that your mom passed, you know, because that's somebody you love very much. Have you ever had any experiences? Like, oh my God, I walked in a room and it was my mom or, you know, because my mom's been dead many years. After my mom passed, before. What were any kind of ghosts though? So I met after your mom passed. Did you ever have any experiences? Like, oh shit, I think my mom, you know. I'll tell you a story. One time, maybe my mother or I had a friend. She was thinking about buying one of those over 55 year old, you know, condos over there. Right. How do you, like, probably about an hour from my house and honey and I really didn't want to move out there because it was talking to me through it. So anyway, we went out there and, you know, I said, my, let me go with you. I don't want to go, you know, I don't want to go by yourself. I want to look at the place though. I said, I really don't want to, I really opposed you going out here. It's too far. You know, no one's ever going to come and see you. You're an hour out, you know. So anyway, we went out there. Scott, get met the realtor. We're looking at the house. I've told my mother on the side, you know, I've said, I know where. I mean, I don't like it, you know what I mean? And my grandmother just passed away. Because Jimmy was too self-restilled. I was mom to actually kill a liverway for me. He needs my money around. Oh, you got to stay here. Yeah. Jimmy was the biggest mother's family. I'm going to finish the fucking story. You were, let me finish the fucking story. So we're going in. You know, it's done to get our way. I was trying to stay calm. And you know what I mean? You guys, you always do to me. So we're in the kitchen. You know what I mean? I was like the kitchen. I told my mother, do you look at me now? I got to calm down. I'm not going to do that. I told the realtor. I told the realtor. I said, excuse me, Mary, could I talk to my mother, Minna police? She said, sure, she went inside. So I made my mother win the kitchen. And it had like, uh, what are those long claws? What are they called, John? The cupboard? Like the, yeah, boom claws. You're right. Yeah, we're walking the kitchen. The boom claws are the kitchen. There's all set up into what else. And I say, my, I don't really want you to move out here, I don't like it. I don't like this fucking place. I like the fucking realtor. I don't want you to come out here. So with that, all of a sudden that fucking room closet, the door started rattling. Like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that. I mean, like, you don't feel like you're off the second. It wasn't like something hit it. It kept, it kept rattling. Like that, me and my mother helped my arm. We're looking at the door going, like that, like that, like that, like that. And then it stopped, right? And me and my mother looked at that shell. Like, what the fuck was that? So my mother held it my arm and we creeped over the fucking closet. I opened it up and a broom fell out. And I said, there's no fucking way to broom was doing that. I said, somebody was telling us they're in agreement with us. We're getting a fuck out here. So we made my mother turn around. We told her realtor, no thank you, we love you. Did you see that was your father? Huh? You think that was your father? I didn't like my grandmother just had pissed away. So I was thinking it was my grandmother, you know, telling us, no way, you know, and then she ended up buying over there in the nose of medical, which was just 15 minutes from my house. So it was much better for everybody, you know, so. We gave you somebody to die in the house and didn't want to sell the house. They'll get the fuck out of here. I don't want you to buy my house. No, I wasn't like that because we, you know, we would just, you know, it was just telling her, you know, right at that moment, you know, it wasn't like, I was telling a mom, let's get out of here. So if it was somebody who didn't want us to have the house, I don't think there would be around the door. So if it was somebody who didn't want us to have the house, but what I was asking is, since your mom's past, if you had anything like, oh, that maybe like, oh, just she caught you. My brother, how about my brother? And I went, you know, his daughter saw a man in the Navy out. My old man was in the Korean War in the Navy. So they're, they're not too long ago. My, my niece saw a figure in the hallway. You know, it was like a man in the Navy out there, right? So with that, she heard like, this is a crazy story. She heard a bang, you know? And she went in the kitchen and my, my assistant little had a cake on a counter. And you know, the place that covers that go over a regular, like the Navy. Yeah, the fucking cake cover was off the cake and on the floor flat. So she picked it up. She put it back when I'm on the care home later. She says, my, the cake cover flew off the cake. So she says, oh, come on, you hear what you're seeing in things up above her. So later, later, later on, the day, the money heard a bang. And she went in the kitchen and the fucking cake cover was off the cake on the fucking ground. So now my brother got off the work. Five, six, seven o'clock. You'll have dinner and they would tell him my brother's story about the cake cover. Right? So now he all go to bed. They're all sleeping. Whatever, two or more than my brother. Here's a bang, right? Get up. He creeps down the hallway. He looks around the corner. And the fucking cake cover was on the ground again. Wow. No icing on the, you know, you would think of it fell sideways. It was a, you know, brand new cake was an eaten. Yeah. You think the icing would hit the sight of the cover like if it kept over. Right. It's like a, it's like a, it's like a, it's straight up off the cake. Clean as a whistle around that lid. And then over and trapped in the fucking middle of the kitchen. Two or three times. Now is that happened. How do you explain that? I don't know. Did you eat that good? That exact. Exactly illustrates my point. How do you explain that? You got to, because you can't explain it. But you would match it to some supernatural phenomena. But wait, John, you're going to, it says, You know, let me give you an example. Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example. Okay. There, there tends to be, there can always be an explanation for something. But if you manufacture the explanation, that's one thing. But for example, I used to go, I used to go, I got to watch TV at night to go to sleep. I can't fall asleep without the TV. Right? So John. So I, so I, and, and I know the channel I watched. I keep it on because I'm watching whatever discovery, whatever. I was watching or the cook for the food channel, whatever. And I fall asleep and wake up and the TV's on, but it's on a different channel. I'm like, the remote, the remote is still in the bed with me. I didn't change nothing. I mean, why is the TV on a different channel? Or, and it's, and I can't even go to bed the next night in the next day. It's on a different channel. I go, I don't understand how this is happened. It's happened six, seven times in a row. It's weird. You're all going to run the remote. No, the remote's all going over here. I'm going to run the remote. But by myself and the bed. Okay. Turns out, Max is sneaking into my room with five o'clock in the morning, and turning the fucking cartoons on, sitting at the foot of my bed. He's watching the button. Okay. So, and then he gets done with Bob the builder. And he goes back in the was room and he goes back to sleep. So, I could easily say, well, you know, my aunt, my aunt is coming out from the clouds and she's turning my channel. So you're saying, somebody's taking fucking with Jimmy's brother, taking that thing and putting it on the floor. Ah, no way, but, I know Jimmy, I think he has the product. He's trying to say it's an explanation where I go. He has the product. No, no, no, no, no, no, a few days after that. My brother heard another noise in the kitchen. He thought it was the fucking, but he didn't know what it was. And he went in the calendar. One of the pages slipped off the cookbookboard thing. You know, one page slipped off and fell out to the fucking kitchen floor. Guess what fuck a murder was, Greg? Well, man, I'm a bummer. My fucking birthday, right? So he put it back. He said there's no way he could have felt it was on a spiral. You know, I had to live a little holes on it. No, the page is in this, there's no way the page could have came out. It happened two times, three times November came out. So I told my brother, I'm dead, bro. I'm fucking dead because somebody's giving you a message. Now your brother's fucking finished. I knew the day was coming. His probably is fucking the bummer. I'm a fucking, he's like the one who's not the boy. I said it never told you. I said you shouldn't have had a tummy bummer. The fucking long we go. I mean, you're gonna do this shit three for. You're gonna do this at the base of your parents' reminding them about your father. I think I texted you before. My list, I gave my list a shit. Because I can't remember everything. And I had a typical fucking plague going on in my basement. In my washroom. I one day I went down there, there was flies all over the fucking place. I had to handle fucking strips all over the fucking watch of his shoes. It's just everywhere. I'm feeling I really don't want to fucking write. I've had a sudden cricket show up. I got a thousand crickets in my washroom. Oh, I'm in a fucking place. I'm like, what the fuck had to put traps out of your relatives by the fucking right? Now I get spiders. Spiders are everywhere. This is the one room, John. The washroom, okay? Then I'll take him to the spider and scorn off the leeks. I'm gonna flood. I'm gonna flood my fucking basement. In the washroom. I'm gonna get rid of the fucking base on a baseball. I'm gonna flood and get rid of that. Fucking everything was so good. Now with the fuck is that? You're ruining the techno system in your house. You killed off the the one bugs that were eating the other bugs. The spiders ate those bugs. You messed up the whole ecosystem. You should have brought a change. You should have brought a change from what they ate the bugs. Good ones scumps and it eat the bugs. Yeah. But it was the next. The frogs are next. It's a message to you. It's telling you to delete the start of the new life. You can scare that that start in the life. And you know what George? That's the message that the thing all of the cake is telling you to leave the poop and the other thing is saying leave what are you doing? I think it was November. It was just for the Florida and state it. It was just for us. It was just for us. We're trying to remind this brother by him and take on fucking November because it's just fucking birthday. And then that's the way I got a question. Jimmy. Jimmy. When the page fell out, it was a little spirited and then spiral, you know, when the page fell out, where the spiral holes intact or they all ripped like jungle paper. That's the fuck the fuck. There was a cat. No. No holes were in my face. Was it unrolled? Yeah. I don't know what was there up on the fucking door at the fucking board. It was up there for the longest time and the fucking page November flew out and he showed me the page and all the holes were, you know, unwipped. I said, how to hold a Disney 4-eye of a spiral notebook fucking thing and the holes are still intact. Tell me Anthony. Tell me. He was a good tell you. I don't know. I said exactly. That's some kind of fucking phenomenon. Jimmy. Let me ask you a question, Jimmy. I'm going to do something a psycho now, I'll see you right now. Was this after your mom passed away? Yes. Okay. That's why I told my brother on this. Listen. Listen, I'm next. Listen now. Now, that's dummy. You're obsessed with your mother. You love your mother. Your mother was your whole life. You lost your mother. You were depressed for five years afterwards. Four years after, whatever, whatever. You were a basketball. You were basketball. Right? You're looking for validation that your mom is still there. She's showing you her fucking birthday on a calendar and you're not even reading the science properly. That's about to cake, too. Of course. You're not stuck fucking around. Great course it is. That your mother dummy telling you I'm here. Fucking live you life. Oh, so she's telling me what she's showing me my birthday. She's showing you your birthday, of course. She's showing you the cake. Don't read birth. It's a rebirth. She's telling you, use your birthday to be born again. Go visit John Ramano in South Carolina. This is what you said. You're making the cake. Come live down here in the south where people are conservative and nice. You don't have to beat people up into DMV line. And calm down because she's a more afraid. You're going to fucking blow an o-ring and because you can't contain yourself because New York is driving your fucking crazy. So come down here come see me come see Dave. That's why it's your birthday. It's a rebirth. I'm sorry. John I'm glad you said that because I always look at I don't know why I always tend to look at the glance. Have full not you know not have.

My boss calls him on the road and goes, can you go to stop and do all this get the checks everybody. So I don't know. I'm not going to do that. So I said all right fucking you know, so I made a detour. I went to the office over there. I was in good mood. I was Friday. I spirit was up. I was happy. I whistle and triddy. I go in the office. I'm joking with Dale you know my my little boss and the billy the other boy because I got a lot of boss and I'm joking with that.

I said, you know, yeah, I'm gonna come back as a millionaire because you know, I think I'd like that. She says, now you'll be bored. I says I'll be bored. I said, okay, let me think this.

So thank you very much. Thank you. And then I got the checks and I was talking a little bit. And then I was leaving and I said, the bird is leaving babe. I thought you were not the dog. You know, it took me two days to get over that bro. Two days. I said the video to judge that the Dave, I was in my friends gym. It was screaming yelling about that brain brain shit. Two days, man.

What if he comes down there and all of a sudden on your calendar, fucking the data November falls to the floor and one of your fucking cake things really end on the ground too.

If you're going to show him saying it's just no such thing. So I'm telling you that your mother is a parent you're sending new messages to get the hell out of New York.

Tile. was fired because he had an excessive tattoos. Now, evidently he was a popular teacher, but the guy you think that like tattooed Timmy has a lot of tattoos on his face, this guy had the whites of his eyes tattooed black. Can you imagine, oh yeah, he had a tattoo. I guess he had a tattoo. How do you not go blind doing that shit? I don't understand that. Because you don't see through the white eyes or see through the pupils, but he actually made the white to his eyes black. So he's black on that tattoo. Like he's like, they're like, yeah, they're like, they're like, yeah, they're like, what ain't gonna do that? Are you a John? I've seen that. I know guys that have that shit. It's so scary. It's a very popular tattoo. What the fuck is that? What goes into your brain that says, I gotta get some guy to squeeze my eye open and jab needles into the fucking white some my eyes until they turn black. What where does that come from? People, people took over this. Did you watch it? The guy was a popular teacher too. You stay in The Punk, and that's the pope. Yes. He was the pope. You're as benefits as the achter. Yeah, he looks like the pope. Yeah. You're right. You Just Look If the Pope Stre升 to The Seckers. Oh, he's shit. I gotta go, I've got in my lunchies over there. So I'm gonna get the fuck out, he guy. All right, baby spin. You're gonna get a gun. Yeah, I'm gonna get a gun. Now let me ask you a question guys. What what possesses people that look otherwise normal and probably are very He's probably a very nice guy. He was a teacher. He's very popular. What possesses people to want to disfigure themselves like that? I don't I don't I don't I don't I I don't list that's a temporary thing because Look at even late. Praise he's getting a tattoo. Yeah, you got it off here. A lot of people feel that way now, but then later on they're going to say, Oh, shit. You know what that's going to look like? They're an old man with black tattooed eyeballs like these chicks that got big fake Tits where you're 80 years old. Yeah. If fucking those earrings would have fucking like that, you know what I mean? And it irres down here. Great. You hung out with that subculture of weird people for a while. What what possesses people do that? Do they feel like inadequate or what why do they do stuff that disfigures themselves like that? Feeling adequate about about themselves. Don't never say that though. Don't never say I feel inadequate, but it they have to keep changing their outside To compensate for the inside. Once you come comfortable with that. Joy, you're very low. Volume. Can you speak all of that? What did it be? Dead it. Two is they all wanted to prove away from the Vatican. You got to give them away. That's true. They all do all regret that shit. You know, even that guy's who she is. Doesn't that guy's 6, 6, 9, 6, 9, F. Fucking guy. Any get some of the status removed on a space. Yes. My girlfriend's like that. Then you don't realize it. That's a temporary. Like, you know, like, Lee, why would you ask Lee? Why would you put a tribal tattoo on your face? And now you're going to get it off. And you know, I love Lee Priest. He's my boy. You know, I miss that. No disrespect. I love Lee. And we would together what we do is laugh. But he, the guy's a dude. I think it's for the moment. Sometimes you think it's cool. What the next day you go, what the fuck that I just do. You know what I mean? That's good thing. Great. What? I'm loaded with touches. My arms. So you fight. Johnny, I got him. Fuck it back in the 90s. Nobody on the fucking view, right? Every one of them has this. It's my girlfriend. There's no skull across. That's my girlfriend. It died. Those are my children. I'm not a mother. I'm not a mother. I'm not a mother. I got my children. Right. See, I don't just get like, you know, the skulls or shit or the get no fucking Chainlink fan. What about people to get tribal that aren't in a tribe? Yeah. Wait, what about the best. John, what about people get fucking Asian letters? Like, Chinese letters. It says chicken and broccoli or something on there. And you take it easy. I have to take it in broccoli and mine. These research. I have, I went to the fucking sushi bar and did it. I got some chicken and broccoli on me. So thank you. These guys. Well, I made sure they were correct before I went in there. But let me ask you another question. I have a friend who's got tattoos all over him, but you can never see it because he wears clothes. And I'm like, well, we're good as a tattoo. Nobody sees it. Like, why would you do that to yourself? Nobody sees it. It doesn't make sense. It's like, well, I see it. And I'm like, give it. You know, he's one of these guys. Doesn't like to take a shirt off. He feels like he's not built enough. Or, you know, he doesn't have a girlfriend. It's a little wacky. You know what I mean? I'm like, so, you know, when you're naked, you see it. But I mean, nobody else sees it. You don't even have a girlfriend. And it goes, wow, it looks hot. I like where you like your old dog. It's, it's, I don't know. I think some people scarred themselves. There's people cut themselves and do shit like that. You know? I did, I did. I did. I should be forcing you over yourself. Who did that? Tell you. Who? Tell you. Who's Joey? Telly. Shelley Beatty. My ex. Oh, I'm a member of Shelley. Yeah, she was, she ended up killing herself. But before she did, she was doing a scarification. I have friends that don't act. I mean, it's, it's not good. But, you know, what was, what was, what was the cheat, was she, the press because she wasn't, at the top of the game no more? She was, she was bipolar and, um, very manic, extremely manic. And, um, she just, she just could not get comfortable in her skin no, no matter what. This is what, and she's, This is what I mean, it has nothing to do with that, uh, uh, George, because my, my ex wife, her best friend, was 18 years old when she killed herself. And this girl was the hottest girl in school, went and got implants, had her fucking, you know, abs and everything like that. Every guy wanted to date this girl. She was hot, but she hated herself. And she's, it's tough for me, she was a little girl. I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself. So these people that do that shit have it inside them. It's just that one day, one day, they get the balls to say, you know what? Fuck this, I'm gonna do this shit today. And, and, but you know what, she, she tried it when we were together like twice. And, and it was, you know, you're, you're with someone six years and then they try to start trying to kill themselves. It's like, what, what the fuck did I do, you know? I mean, we're, how, how, how, I had no idea was that bad. Did you got to feel like you got to do that? And, you know, we're therapy together. And her explanation is, it's the pain, the pain that she feels. She wants it to go away so bad that the only way that she can, father the pain going away is to kill herself. And that will make me stop. That's funny because I knew Shelby Bady. I knew her. She's the state of a barbana house and everything. She was doing it, you know, she's the, I was doing it when we were driving one of those things. Yeah, she did. And I knew as she was fucking great man, we would have talks and everything like that. And she was actually a very nice caring girl. One of the nicest girls in the industry to be honest with you. And I'm not saying it because she, she was your ex. I'm saying that fact that she was one of the nicest girls. So sometimes people are demons behind that you don't see that the average person. You think she was, oh, she's such a happy girl. And really, that's a great girl. And really, that's a front. Yeah. And she was an unbelievable athlete. She was an American gladiator. She did stuff and set records that, you know, the guy's couldn't break. John, and you would figure, here's the girl who went from a bodybuilding career. Now she's on television. It's rare. You know, I mean, there's only a few that they took, you know, she's one, well, like three, four girls at the most. And she was one of them. And she was, to popular. She was a girl that could go on known to be very friendly. Anybody that knew she had a new show. He knew that she was very friendly. And you would figure, man, this girl's got to go on on. Who knows, maybe just gladiator shit can go to movies and other shit. You got on America's, America, Cuba was the first all women's team to sell for the America's cup. We moved to San Diego for that. And that was an incredible, I mean, she was so, you would look at her and talk to her and whatever. And if you knew her, she, everything in the world to live for it. She was the guy who I'm saying. You know, she was deaf, too, remember? And she, that's why I wanted to ask you John, did the deafness have anything to do with it? You think you think she felt like she was like, there was something wrong with her or something like that? Or some kind of deafness. The way her father treated her over it. Yeah, it was definitely some kind of connection there. But but she was, she was a tremendous figure, figure head for the deaf community. They all looked up to her. I mean, she had, I mean, for her to accomplish what she did be in deaf was such a motivating thing. We've all over the country, get over her. Is in sign language to, you know, deaf people and, you know, motivating them. I have a, I have a friend who was actually very introverted and everything, I'm really quiet. And we want to this party with Shelley. And, you know, she, you know, she was trying really hard to talk. She actually pulled them out on a dance floor. And they danced, you know, and she did it to like show him, you know, and he was like, he became her biggest fan after that. His name was Anthony. And he's always say, I love Shelley. That's my favorite of all of the, because she showed him, you know, it's, you understand what I'm saying? He, he had issues. And she saw that. And she, you know, because he was part of our crew. She pulled them on the dance floor and danced with him. And it made his, it made his, is fucking month man. I'll tell you that. Why would you say, hey, Brian's to hear that. I thought that. At that. What's that? It changes life from that. Can you hear me? Yeah, you're, you're low. Like Dave was trying to, your volumes. So that's where we can hear you sometimes. It does. I think you said it changes life. It does. It does. He became her biggest fucking fan. You know, we heard about that for fucking he would talk about that. One, he got one little dance that she did with him. And she held his hands. She pulled him by the hand. You know, not, you know, he wasn't anything like, you know, it was nothing, you know, he was, it was like he has, he has issues. And it's then like he's. That's the one. I mean, she, she actually worked. She was in his counter in a group home. Work with, you know, severely mentally handicapped people. She took me back there. Once that she wanted to visit, you know, in the group home where, you know, we're, we're, we're shoes to work. Man, no, like I'm talking, there were, the ones that were helmets and drool and you know, they, they, fuck it. They lit off when she came back there, man. And like, you know, we're, you know, all over her. Or, you know, the way they do their thing. And, you know, she was like, she was, you know, it was remarkable. Everything about that girl was remarkable. You would never, in a million years think that's the girl that would kill herself. Yep. Well, you know what, John? Mr. I don't believe it lights out. Probably you'll have some kind of a, a spiritual, I guess you could say, encounter with her maybe later today now that we've been talking about her so much. She's definitely going to give you some kind of message. Look out for that message. And next week, you're going to tell us that message. All right. All right. I find something that you got from her. Maybe a little ring, a little piece of something. So I'm, she brought me to spending a whatever. He's going to get a message. I'm telling you. I draw. I'm going to tell her, so it's going to be on your fucking night table. So I'm going to text me in like an hour. He's going to be like, oh, shit. You're right. I can't find one. You'll see a pigeon flying by your house. That's right. That's right. Well, guys, good show today. I enjoyed the topic. And hopefully we can get Jimmy to come down a little bit.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning on Dave. Well, I'm going today as a Monday, August 6th, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Sometimes I look at some of these bikini shows and wonder how the judges can place these girls when it feels like they're all basically separated by your razor thin margins. But then again, maybe that's why Norman Austria has been pushing so hard this prep to try to separate herself from the pack. The A-Time Olympian is blazing her way back to the stage again after having what she's called one of the best preps of her career. So far this year, we've seen a little bit of a resurgence from Austria, who seems like she's got back that championship swagger she had a few years ago. So if she comes in and hits it on the mark, she's certainly good enough to enter Olympia weekend placing somewhere, sadly in the top six. They say it's the ones who you never see coming with a most dangerous. And when I look around the men's physique division right now, I don't know if I see anyone looking in the direction of Abdullah Al-Said. The oxygen-gim product basically came from out of nowhere last year to win the Kuwait pro. And now that he's got his sights set on becoming the first member of the camel crew to crack the men's physique top 10 at the Olympia weekend, it'll be interesting to see what he brings. When we saw Al-Said last year, he really stood out as being a guy who was in a leap athlete from a conditionings standpoint. But whether or not he'll have enough muscle to hang with some of the bigger guys in this year show is something we'll all find out first hand a little under six weeks from today. I think when we look back historically, at last year's classic physique Olympia, we'll probably end up talking about how it was one of the best top 10s that we've ever had in any division from front to back. And if there's one guy who thinks he might be able to shake things up this year, it might be second year standout, Rylon McDool. Over the last few weeks, we finally started to see some signs of life from McDool in his team after essentially going MIA throughout the whole first half of the season. You can remember back to last year, it really wasn't until this time before he came out and made that big splash by winning his rookie debut at the Vancouver Pro. So if his weight and sea strategy ends up panning at, here's a guy who could possibly move up a spotter too, at this year's Olympia. If you ask my wife, she'll probably tell you that I'm guilty of being a work of hollig. But that's probably why I can appreciate the grind of an athlete like the Thalia Soltero, less than 48 hours after rocking the stage at the Tampa Pro, the figure standout didn't waste any time getting right back onto the horse once again. Very quietly, Soltero has been riding one of the hottest freaks of her career throughout this whole season. And that little tune up she just had in Tampa was really only a small sample of what's coming down the pike a few weeks from now when she really hits her peak. A 100% Natalia Soltero is probably one of the eight to ten best athletes in the division right now and assuming that everything breaks her way, I don't think it would be totally crazy to see her end this season with the top six finish on the Olympia stage. Somewhere in the legacy of every guy champion is the story about the time they were pushed to their absolute limit by a bitter rival. And this year on the 212 stage, you're not going to find a bigger rivalry than the one we're going to see between current champ Flex Lewis and his number one challenger on the Ashkenani. And typical Ashkenani fashion, the former Arnold Classic champ has been all going to go up to this point in his prep, which only adds another layer of intrigue. The closer we get to this year's contest with this being Flex's official farewell tour, you know that just about everyone on the planet is assuming that this will be the year he puts the final stamp on his legacy. But when you've got a guy with the talent and pedigree of an Amma Ashkenani as a fan, you still have to think that he has a puncher's chance to go out there and do his part to rewrite bodybuilding history. And that does a yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. On day, Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We're going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car hot tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary food muscle in the morning. On day polumbo and today is Tuesday, June 22nd, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Welcome back and happy Tuesday. I need to check the calendar, but I think we're about 10 days away from the Puerto Rico Pro now. And the reason I mentioned that is because yesterday I heard a room at that Puerto Rico is looking like the place where we'll see a team Williams making a season debut. Since I get for my sources, is that a team has every intention of winning this show and using it like a testing round to fine tune some of the work he put in during the off season. I think last year really solidified a team's place as one of the top tier athletes in bodybuilding. And getting a win in Puerto Rico would only cement that further. So if he shows up in full beast mode, it might be game set and match for everyone else in the building. Generally speaking, I'm not big on the Raw Raw Motivation stuff that people love to post on social media. I think most of that stuff is just people trying to do whatever it takes to get likes and clicks. But I will say this, when you see two high level athletes like Alex Cabernero and Kai Green and the Jim together, well, that does get you pretty amped up to go to the gym. Now that we know for sure that Alex will be coming back to defend his oral classic title, you almost want to see him being monitored and mentored by someone like Kai who understands what it takes to win at that level. I think there's a lot more on the line than just being the Arnold Classic Champion there. That show almost feels like a tone setter for the Olympia. So if Kai can help Alex set the right tone, that can end up translating into something a whole lot bigger down the road. There are a few people in body building right now who we could legitimately say have Ronnie Coleman like Strenth. I just mentioned the team Williams a few minutes ago, his name definitely belongs in the conversation. But one of the other names that I want to lift up right now is Joe Mackie, because I don't think people realize how crazy strong this guy is. A few days ago, I saw a video of Joe doing incline dumbbell presses with the 190s for a set of eight, which is one of those lifts that falls into the Ronnie Coleman superhuman strength category. A few days ago, Jen is James, one on the record to say that he believes Joe will be a real threat at the Chicago Pro. When you see him moving weight like this, it isn't hard to see why. This guy trains like he's from another planet. And five weeks from now, we'll get a first hand look to see what that looks like when he lands the ship right there in the middle of that Chicago Pro stage. Normally, my brain doesn't connect the word thin to 300 pound body builders. But for whatever reason, when I saw these photos of James Hollings head the other day, the first thing that popped into my head was, damn, his waist looks thin. According to James, when these pictures were taken last week, he weighed 301 right out of bed in the morning, which would be impressive enough on its own. But when you take into account the fact that he's thisly at 301, 17 weeks out from the Olympia, it's even more impressive. Because it means he's already way ahead of the pace. He set last year when he was at his all-time best. And assuming that his plans don't change between now and then, it's final product will end up being something very special. And that does it for yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. On Day4 I'm about reminding you to always be true to your passions. Make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I'm gonna be launching a tasty pastry for the low carb hot tart. It's got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Oh, nice! Welcome back to Legendary Foods, muscle in the morning. Today is Friday, July 9th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Welcome back and happy Friday ladies and gentlemen. Once again, we have another great show lined up for you today. Starting with this brand new update on your raining and defending, Bikini Limpia Champ Janet Leog. Right now, 14 weeks out from her first title defense, Janet's about to enter the next phase of her contest prep where we can expect to see her really start to kick things into high gear. For Janet, this is uncharted territory in two ways. First and foremost, this will be the first time in her career that she's going into the Limpia weekend as the defending champion, which comes with its own set of pressures. But the other important thing to keep in mind here is that she will also be the first time she's ever gone into in the Limpia without competing at least once during the regular season. And we haven't seen her have to answer the proverbial belly yet at all this year. We'll have to wait until October to see if she can answer the call. We talked a lot this year about all the various injuries that have already had a major impact on the season. Including a segment we did a few weeks ago on Antoine Vallions after he suffered a torn bicep during training for the second time in his career. But today after a few ups and downs, I'm happy to report that Antoine is back to training again on the road to recovery and getting closer to gaining back his pre-injury form. On top of recovery from the biceps tear, Antoine also revealed on his Instagram that he had to spend some time in a rehab facility as well to help him combat a recent relapse. Anyone who's followed him throughout his entire career already knows how difficult these issues with substance abuse have been for him. With that said, it does seem like he's in a better place both physically and mentally now. So let's hope that it'll only continue to get better from here on out. And that we'll see him back on stage at some point next season ready to pick right back up where he left off. To weeks ago, we did a segment on Kion Pearson after he made a comment about retiring early to one of his fans. And at the time, even though he was pretty clear and direct with his statement, I think there were still a lot of people who believed that he would backtrack on that at some point. But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case. Just this week, another fan asked Kion if he really planned that retiring in his prime of his career. And Kion responded with an infatic, yes, saying that there was more to life in bodybuilding. This feels like something that he's put a lot of thought into, and I don't think he would be saying it over and over again if it wasn't true. But like I said before, he still has four years between now and then and four years is a long time. So while he's still here and in this prime, people should not worry so much about when the ride is going to end. And just enjoy it while it lasts because if you spend too much time worrying about what isn't or what won't be, you're going to end up missing what it is. And today we're closing out the week with a quick preview of this weekend's Omaha Pro. And if you're a fan of our female athletes, this will be right up your alley. The show is going to feature women's bodybuilding, women's physique and bikini. And when the official line-ups for each division were released on Wednesday morning, there were a few names that immediately jumped off the page. Women's physique, I wouldn't sleep on Christina Bryant. She finished third at Chicago Pro. And her pro debut last year, and I can see her catching some people by surprise and potentially pulling off a win. In bikini, on your nickelsins, bed having a strong season so far. So when you come as a huge surprise if she managed to lock up for first win, and to women's bodybuilding, Makala A-Kop will be making her big return to the stage after taking almost two full years off. And I know there are a lot of people interested to see what you can do in this division for the first time. And that does it. Another edition of Lusselin the Morning on Daypalm, or reminding you to always be true to your passions, and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car mock tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning on day polombo and today is Wednesday September 16th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Welcome back and thank you for joining us on another very special edition of Recap Wednesday. It was only one event of the pro-dock at this past weekend, and it was the Cal Pro that took place in Vegas. And it did not disappoint. The big story came from the winner Antoine Vallions, who finally put it all together and clinched his first Olympia qualification. Second place went to the Red Hot Mac Shaws, who looks like he's getting better by the week. The place went to California native on win, who delivered the best performance of his career. Sliding into fourth was the powerful one, Patrick Moore, and round the other top five was veteran Antoine Vallions. Here's another interesting storyline from the Cal Pro that we're going to cover that almost caused Hassan Mustafa to withdraw right before the start of the show. During Hassan's flight from Egypt to Vegas, he started to get sick on the plane and was rushed to the hospital immediately after landing, according to Hassan, an abscess from hemorrhoids became infected, which required him to have emergency surgery. After spending a day or so on the hospital, Hassan did end up being released and was giving clearance by the doctors to compete on Saturday. Somehow in the midst of all that, he still managed to carve out an eighth place finish year. So Kudos to Hassan for all the mental and physical toughness he put on display last weekend. The guy is a warrior through and through. At some point in the middle of watching the NFL action last weekend, I realized some athletes need the competition to bring the best out in them. They thrive under pressure, and no matter how hard they train, or how diligent they are, they still need that person on the other side of the field to bring the best out in them. And in a roundabout way, I think that might also be true for Sydney Gillin. Now, if an Olympic prep is under way, you can see a noticeable shift in her level of intensity. And I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the fact that she'll have an entire line of off-killer's up there on stage who will all die to take away her Olympic title. This is exactly what Sydney's in. This is what gives her that extra push, because when she steps on that Olympia stage, it's a game on. So everyone else, better be ready. One of the years I've started to recognize a few parallels in bodybuilding and in business. For me, one of the most important aha moments was when I realized that being successful in either venture hinges on your ability to be honest with yourself about what your weaknesses are, and then developing a strategic approach for turning those weaknesses into strengths. And from what I hear, Volziana Vustravic is taking a very similar approach when it comes to her Olympia prep this year. Volziana and her team have decided to really concentrate their efforts on making sure she's lights out from the back this year. And the hope is that with the new improvements, it'll bump her up into the top five territory. And with so many things still in flux heading into this year's contest, the new and improved Boyana could be in a great position to take on the opportunity to her advantage. And that does it for yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X Pro 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car pot tart. It's got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polumbo and today is Monday September 7th, 2020 and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. In the words of the great Muhammad Ali, ladies and gentlemen of the champ is here and in case you missed it late last week, Brandon Curry set the internet on fire again when he released two news clips from his Olympia training camp from what we understand Brandon's back and full-scale championship mode with the camel crew out of oxygen and at least so far all systems are a go. Even though he's the defending champ, Brandon is in a pretty unique situation in the sense that he might actually be the underdog heading into his first title defense. From this end, the plus side of that situation is that it puts his back up against the wall again, which might actually be the best thing for him. And with so much on the line, figuring how to use this situation to his advantage to gain a competitive edge could make all the difference in the world. Here's a fun fact for you. Did you know that scattered across different parts of the UK, there were what we essentially call ghost towns that are left over remnants from World War II? It's true. Look it up. They're like the land that time for God. And while you're busy Googling, you might want to look up what Ryan Terry's doing as well because it seems like he's been the forgotten man in men's physique this year. Even though he's been way off the radar, Ryan's still been in the gym. He's still training and he still works the part of a guy who could be 16 weeks away from being a title contender. There was a point a few years ago when Ryan was in the conversation, is one of the top two or three athletes in the division. And when you have his level of talent, you never more than one win away from being back in that mix. In the season's restarted, and it feels like we've gotten back to some level of normal see again, has there been an athlete who's done more to help their stop in any division than Hunter Labrata? A few days ago someone sent me a video from Hunter's latest guest posing at the Savannah Pro. Where the odds on rookie of the year favored gave everyone attendance a sneak peek at what stage does a limpia prep looks like. In fact, during a conversation yesterday, I actually learned that Hunter officially started his prep last Monday, which is a few days after that guest posing spot, and that he and his team feel great about where they are right now. All things considered as a rookie heading into his first Olympia, Hunter's in a great spot right now. If he exceeds expectations, everyone will be tripping all over themselves to annoy him as the second coming. And if things don't turn out so great, he gets the rookie pass, which makes the whole thing a win win. So if I were him, I just do my thing and enjoy the ride, because that's what this whole thing is all about. Whenever I talk to young athletes about training, I always give them the same advice, stick to the basics. The reason they've been around forever is that they work, and the reason I say that is because I saw a video over the weekend of Arnold cranking out a set of T-bar rows that made something click in my head about the beauty of simplicity. At this point Arnold is in his 70s and he's probably been doing T-bar rows for over 50 years. Yet here he is, still strong, still vibrant, and still sticking to the basics. There's something to be said for that, especially for someone who's been a successful as he has at so many different mediums. Consisted adherence to a simple, but highly principled approach can take you a long way. And I think that's something a lot of people would benefit from having more than their lives. And that does it yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions, and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Old School Body Building Clothing Company. If leg day was yesterday and now you're wondering why toilets are so damn low, you are definitely old school. If you're the only athlete in your gym that knows there's a contest today and it's to see who trains the hardest. You are old school. OSBBC.com for the hardest training athletes. Welcome back to live with brought you by Stacey's Nutrition. I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is an old friend of mine. She's been in 10 Olympias. She has 10 IFV Pro wins to her resume and you might be wondering where she's been because she's been missing and we haven't seen her missing for quite some time. So I got her here today. We're going to talk a little bit about what she's been going through. Of course, the woman I'm talking about is Jen Strobo. How's the own? Hey, how are you? Thank you for having me. It's been a couple of years since I've been in here. I think starting like, oh, hey, I must interview you. You like at least 25, 30 times, you know, over the years. I was trying to like look them all up last night and watch them and then I started getting sag because I was like, oh, I look so young. Believe me, I look a lot young and soon they're in those interviews and a lot bigger. But we all get older. It's funny because one of the stories that really, you know, kind of attracting me to an initially interview, you was the fact that you were a type one diabetic, your whole life essentially and you were so successful competing, you know, in figure and you know, just moving up the ranks, so to speak over the, you know, course of 10 years where you were, you know, dominating and winning, you know, pro shows left and right, always doing well at the Olympia. How tough was that? First of all, when you were diagnosed, how old were you? I was young, like seven, maybe. I battled with it for a long time and then it was almost like it was, I didn't really need to battle with it. And it was like my body was kind of, there were some of these little beta cells in my pancreas that were kind of producing a little bit of their own insulin. So I was able to not even have to be insulin dependent for quite some time. And then so now what they actually call it is adult onset type one because it's like a key back. And I wear, you know, a little pot of my arms. So I can see my glucose and, you know, but I rarely use insulin. I use movement nutrition, everything like that. You're not, you don't have the autoimmune form of it. I didn't know that. What's that? Oh, you know. Yeah, but that, which is weird because when you get it usually when you're a kid, you're, is that most of the time that's always type one, isn't it? Yeah. And so it was type one. And then they call this adult, adult onset type one because my pancreas doesn't work at all. So the people that are type two, their pancreas actually does function a little bit. Usually not everyone, but the majority of most that are type two, it's because they kind of brought that on themselves with poor physical activity for nutrition, diet, or bad genetics, or bad genetics. Right. But, so that's what I was saying. Yeah. So do you do take insulin then? I do take insulin. Well, okay. I didn't take it along. And then I also have short acting, but I, I very rarely use my short acting. I tried to use what I'm eating. I mean, I use very little bits of it, but I try to use what I'm eating. I use glycolog by blackstone labs. And then like that's, I just kind of, if it's a little bit more. Yeah, I didn't share with a long acting insulin. You must not eat a lot of carbs in your diet then. I do eat carbs. It's just timing of them. So I wait until my glucose is a little lower. And then I'll have my carbs. So if I normally, I pretty much eat the same thing all the time except on my Sunday but, you know, it's, I like the food that I eat. Right. Um, but so at night, my glucose is a lot lower, usually. But by the time my body's a little exhausted and fatigued and moved around and everything all day. So I have like this giant biglet night. You know, I have rice and things few hours before that. So I'll have most of my carbs later in the day. And you don't have to take any, any short acting insulin because of that. I'll take a little bit. Yeah, just a couple units, usually very, very two to three units at the most. Wow. And it depends because if it's a really low, I won't take it because I'm getting ready to go to bed. And I don't want to have a load here in the night. Do you think your body may be still producing a little bit insulin? Must, I would think, right? The doctor says no, but sometimes I wonder because you get like a little bit of a high, but you can have those beta tumor cells in your pancreas that can produce a little small, very small amount. Well, that's pretty cool. So you've been managing that since your kid. You know, my son's five years old. He can't even tie his shoes yet. I can't even imagine him having to take insulin, you know. It's crazy. Was that traumatizing to you to find that out as a young kid? It's more traumatizing to prick your fingers and toes all the time. Yeah. Yeah, I know. If come up, they've come along way in 40 years. So I'm saying, that had to be, how did that, how did that influence who you became, you know, from having to micromanage your blood sugars from such a young age? I feel like it may give you structure. And you become very rigid and structured. I don't believe that's always a great thing. My rigidity is very strong in my old age. You know, it's like it's my way or no way because of this, you know. But I can eat out. I can do all these things that everybody does and everybody's like, I don't know how you do it. It's like competitors. You know, they're like, I can't go to the movies. I can't go out with my friends. I'm like, why not? You know, but I still do all those things. It's just like you either eat before you eat after you don't eat. You know, what to eat, you know, what to do. But it did make me very structured a little rigid and but very independent. Right. Right. You got to do it. I have a little bit of a small. Well, you got to be very, you know, you have to be very dependent upon yourself, the constantly mon of your blood sugar 24 seven, which is, which is no small task. Although it seems to fit very well to the body of the lifestyle because we do everything so neurotically around the clock as bodybuilders that I'm sure you were really, I'm assuming that's how you got attracted to it, right? The whole regimentation of bodybuilders. It sort of like it didn't even everybody's like, how do you do it? How do you do it? It was my very first show when I did it in the end of 2008. And it was, it was like, I don't know, like I always ate well anyway. I was actually very, very tiny and skinny and sickly looking when I started competing. And it just was, it was easy. And I guess you're right, it's the rigidity of the bodybuilding competition process as well. Yeah. Yeah. Now, when you did start, I remember saying to interview you, you were on the smaller side. And I didn't even know how you would actually do and figure, but you really put a lot of, how much muscle did you add from, oh, eight to when you, I guess, did you last the limpier in 18? I went on stage in my very first show at 118 pounds at 57. Yeah, you're called. Yeah. So stick girl with shoulders and glutes. And I believe my last show I was 142 on stage. Wow, that's a lot of muscle for a girl. You know, to put on your own natural movement through it because of my health. Perfect. But it's a lot of people feel like type ones that I talk to say that the insulin, the least, oxygen essential in you, so over the years, definitely has an animal. Perfect. Did you notice that? I believe it does. I've actually done more research on it now in the last few years. But I believe it can have a little bit of an animal effect. Yeah. It just like you'll see some people. And I think it depends on how much you're using as well. Right. Because you'll see some people that just kind of have a, like, kind of use a different sliding scale than they probably should be and using a little bit more as type one. You'll see that they're just eating crap and still able to pretty much manage their weight 150%. So it's obviously we all know it's got a little bit of an anabolic effect, especially considering some of the history going on over the last few years with it. It's funny because the people who use it and who have to take a lot, but who don't exercise get fat from it, right? And then the people who seem to exercise with it, who are type ones, I notice they put muscle on from it. You know, so it definitely has to do with activity level two. It's not just, you know, muscle from insulin, you know. Right. It definitely has to do with that because you're right. You know, when I go to my endocrinologist, I'm, people are looking at me like, what is that girl doing here? Are they calling her name? You know, she must do it. Somebody kind of thing because everyone's sitting there or at least the majority of them are very overweight. Yeah. And you know, it's just because of lack of physical activity. What was your, the most memorable show that you did, that you can like, when you look back in your career now, it's a, hey, that was the best one. It's so hard because you, you kind of look back and you got memories of everything. I got into a point where that my last few years, I was doing back to back shows one week apart and I, for three years in a row that I did it, I won both of them. Right. So that was so exciting. But I think to me to place third in the Arnold International, I had a, a head of a girl that won the Olympia come up in September, you know, it was like, wait, I did that. You know, when they called my name, when they started calling, you know, six, fifth and fourth and I was like, wait, did I just not even break the top six? I was dead in there. I don't know. Yeah. You know, and they called my name. I just, I was floored. And so to look at my Arnold trophies and to see all of those and all my Olympia models, like, both of those shows are just so nostalgic for me and they're just prestigious. So to just to even stood there is so memorable. Well, it also validates all the hard work you put into it and everything. Now, nice. You did your last Olympian 18 and then in 2019, you were diagnosed with leukemia, which a lot of, I didn't even know that until a mutual friend of us told us, had that come about. What were your symptoms that you were experiencing? Well, it was towards the end of 18 that I noticed that everyone kept saying, like, what are you doing? Are you not eating? You've got an eating disorder. You're losing all this weight. You look so frail. Right. You know, all of these things and I was like, I'm literally eating the same thing I have been eating for years. I'm not changing anything. I'm not doing tons of cardio. Right. I don't have time to do that. You know, I love to do cardio in the morning to kind of set my intention for the day, but it's usually a walk or 20 minutes on the stairs and that's it. You know, it's not like you're going to get frail from that. And usually post show, obviously you kind of start to gain some weight a little bit, not really a lot. I never, I never veered too far off of it because of my diabetes. Right. But I just kept losing weight and losing weight and losing weight and getting lighter than stage weight and that everyone just kept saying something to me and I noticed my face was looking drawn. And then come April, I moved and moved from a condo to a house and I started to get these little red bumps on my body. And I thought that it was weird I thought it was something from the house. So I call these Terminator. I call these people, you know, there's bad bugs in this house. God, I mean, someone else's fault. Right. Yeah, there's something going on because it was a little old on 1940s home that I moved into. And so I started calling these things and I mean, I have some pictures of my body when I find the I went and saw my siblings at our family cabin about three weeks later. And they're both nurses. And I just kind of like pulled my pants down. And I was like, look at my lymph nodes. And they were like the size of just like giant rocks. And my brother's face was just he was hoard, he was mortified. Like he was just he said, you have got to go to the doctor. And I was showing him all these bumps and he's like a literally looks like you've been eaten alive by mosquitoes. Right. So I got back. Went and saw a dermatologist. They were like, you need to call an oncologist right now. Well, today, they knew they knew. But then I called my oncologist. I saw him that day. I got there at three o'clock in the afternoon. Right. I didn't get home to almost midnight. He walked in the room. And I had seen him before because I had cancer when I was 25. I had some uterine cancer. Oh, OK. And that was that was super easy and quick for me. It was, you know, an easy sort of thing. So I don't think about that often. But what did they have to do? Did they have to remove uterus? I had a full history. I'm OK. And so I see him every year to 18 months just as like a checkup. Right. And we're good friends. And he walked in and he just went, whoa. And he turned around and he walked out of the room. That's that. You never want to see a doctor run out of the room. That's that. And I like, we're bloody. We're buddies. I don't know what's going on. And I had a hat on because I didn't want anyone to see me because I had these bumps on my face. They were all of them. And they were everywhere. And he came back in after talking to a bunch of colleagues from Shands, which is like a very well-reknown hospital there in Gainesville. It's nearby Orlando. And he started running tests, CT scans, MRIs. I was having all sorts of things, all sorts of led work done. Right. Because he thought I had a form of leukemia, which is literally the final you've got two to three weeks and you're gone. Oh, really? What is it again? Like, hot skin system? No, I forget what it's called, but it's like... It's like a final. It's like a multiple, my long one. Yeah. It's just, I seriously can't remember because I think I might have blocked it. So what did it turn out? It was just like a chronic, a lipocytic look. It turned out it was just like, yeah, like my body was just like, it was God's way of saying, get your butt to the doctor. Yeah. You know, and he's like, you're just, I'm just thankful that you did come in. I went through like some horrible bouts of some antibiotics. And got that to go away. But then started seeing him twice a week and figuring out what we needed to do and what was really actually going on. And that's when we found out that my red and white blood cells were so low that my bone mirror was just not functioning. Wow, that's weird. What do you think was, would cause, I mean, that was it. Is it a genetic thing? Is it, I mean, is it? Why? I mean, what would cause you something to get something like that? Well, I have, um, somewhat leukemia. You have no, I had no idea, but after kind of going through everything and talking to my mom about he's saying it's a blood disorder that's like leukemia, she's like, you know, what, I think your mom all had leukemia when she died. Oh, great. You know, you know, they were dead. They just, after the fact, yeah. Yeah, so, and none of us knew that. And it was, it was just one of those random things we don't really have any history of that sort of thing in our family. So, you know, and then he also found out that I have some really bad lymphoma issues going on as well. So it's just kind of like a two prongs, you know, hit me and over the head kind of situated. Yeah, you did something kind of unconventional. You started some chemo, but then you stopped and you decided to go the natural pathograph. What, how did you make that decision? I just decided I was not going to do it. That wasn't after sitting in that room for three hours, looking around and hearing everyone's stories and stuff. I just said, I sort of, I'm a research stalk on everything that goes into my body anyway. And I do. I mean, I hadn't taken antibiotics in a decade until I had those big found, but I had to do something. I don't take talent all, you know, I don't do any of that stuff. And I just started doing tons of research on the natural healing. I ran into someone, I met someone who said, oh my gosh, I went to the Gershwin Center in Spain, which that's where they do all natural cancer healing. Right. And it's like a 95% success rate. So I started researching their institute and getting information on what they do on a daily basis, which it involves natural vitamin D three to four hours a week, you know, getting outside in the sunshine, which usually you don't want to do that because of cancer. Right. But being forced upon you, it involves juicing heavily for quite some time. You go on to a plant-based diet at first, which I had to do, which was totally fine with me. It doesn't bother me. And then you also do coffee enema, which a lot of people are funny about talking about that, but they are very beneficial in detoxing your liver and helping your body just really learn to process good gut biome and create a good atmosphere for healing. Sure. So it's just so many of these things, but also they add in extracts and powders, like some Chinese herbs, which I can't even pronounce all the ones I take. I just want to be good to stand for a guess. It's like a whole orchestra going on and when I'm getting ready for bed and when I get up in the morning. Is it like, like, are they a immune stimulating herbs? Is that what this was today? They are. Some of them simulate your immune system to go up. Some of them are just ones you can get offline on Amazon, like the extracts, some of them, like bladder rack, bird awkward, stuff like that. They're great for cleansing. They have great anti-cancer properties. They're almost like natural antibiotics. Got you. Got you. Interesting. It's a great question. I've talked to people before, I've told me about coffee enema's. I was always wondering, do you get a caffeine buzz from the animal when you go up when you come? You can. It depends. So when I've used different brands, I've gotten like, because I don't really drink a lot of cap. I don't drink coffee. That's my coffee buzz for the day every morning. You can get a little bit because it does, especially if you're holding it long enough, it does go so far into your liver that it ends up in your bloodstream, which is kind of what you want. A little bit to detox and pull things out. You're using organic green coffee. But when I've traveled and been like, oh, I definitely am not skipping a day. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing that. So I would have to use just regular plain black coffee and you get more of a buzz from that. And then I'll do it every day. I'm always thinking of like, you've taken a stimulant, I guess, like a pre-workout, which I don't take those. But I think you're that's kind of the feeling that you've done. So you do a coffee anime every single day? I do right now. I had dropped down to where I was only doing it two to three days a week. Right. With my health and the way it's been, I've been doing it daily. So every morning, it's like a whole hour process for me to take all these extrax and vitamins and things. You got to get off the lower early, in other words, yeah. Yeah, but then my body doesn't want to do that either. So. Now, on top of that, compounding everything that you just told us, you got COVID. When did that happen? I got COVID April 27th. All right, I started feeling kind of bad the day before. Yeah. And I just thought, you know what, I'm going to go get tested. So I did the drive through at the, you know, CBS and the, yeah. While being where you're, where you're swapping your own nose and dropping the thing, you know? Yeah. And I would have rather had someone else do it because you're trying to do like all these things two days later, which I was, I was so sick by the time two days later came I thought I haven't had a head cold in so many years. I don't even know what's wrong with me. I couldn't stop coughing and it came back as positive. So I did like the two weeks of, you know, standing in your house, which totally find me. I live by myself. I'm always alone. I'd find with me. You know, I was just working online when I was awake, but I was barely able to stay awake. It was like 20 hours leaping every day. Wow. But I still, and then I was able to kind of leave the house, but just still had no energy. I see my doctor now and I still have side effects of it. So it's been six weeks now, eight weeks. Right. I don't like that. And he said I will probably have some of the effects of it for three to six months. Brain fog, confusion, exhaustion. My heart is inflamed and my lungs are inflamed. So where do you think you picked it up? Well, I, I work for Blackstone Labs down here. I still have online clients as well, with nutrition and lifestyle and competition, but I also came in and an executive assistant at Blackstone. I'm managing a lot of different tasks there and a guy there just said he wasn't feeling that great and he had gone to the hospital that week. Everyone else seemed to have like the stomach bug which never got to me. But that's what made me, I was like, I just kind of like did it feel good. I kind of was coughing a little bit and that's what made me, I was like, you know what? I'm just going to go get checked. I've managed to make it this whole year without getting COVID and I'm just going to go get checked because something just doesn't seem right. So are you sure that's where I got it, but you can get it from a gas pump. You can get it from a car. Oh, of course I know, but you're doing a cereal box at the grocery store. Are you? I don't think you can, but they say you get, well, you get that vaccine now. It's to make sure you don't get it again. I can't right now. You have to wait a full 90 day. Oh, okay. So probably the, who knows, who knows if it would even help, you know. They say if you have it once, if you get COVID and you take your only one dose of vaccine, really, the keep is. Yeah, I had a really plan on getting the vaccine. I was, I was funny about that stuff, but my doctor is kind of like, you know what? I would really rather you do that because you got sicker from your, the value of blood cells and all your blood work just went tanked during COVID and it's kind of really pushing me to do it. Now, what's the process now that you're, you know, you have the, the, the, the, the, the blood, the blood disorder. You know, you, you, you're, you're levels kind of dipped down, but it could have been obviously to do the COVID. How did they actually classify you as, quote, in remission or cured? I mean, is, is there actually a time when they'll actually say that or yeah, they will. I'm actually when my red blood cells get back to a normal level. Okay. So I just have to wait for that. The white blood cells can be a little lower. Obviously, you still want them to be higher and you want them to really increase when you get sick, which they did not when I had COVID, which you would think, you know, most people have an infection. That's how they can tell when your white blood cells are off the chart because they're trying to, you know, kill that off. But I just, I have to wait until my red blood cells come back up. So I just have blood work done actually this morning. Right. And I had blood work done seven days ago. And so we'll just wait and see when everything comes back. And I, I, I thought with leukemia, usually you have high red, high white blood cell count, usually you know, they're immature white blood cells that don't really function well. But I, I thought you have a higher amount of it. I actually have like nothing. It's weird. Yeah. You have like a weird amount. Yeah, they're, they're like, it's ridiculous. It's like non-existent almost. Mm-hmm. Now, knowing the kind of person that you are and how structured you are and how goal oriented you are, I gotta ask you this, even though if it might not be in the near future, do you see yourself competing again at some point? I don't think so. A lot of people go, you know, you can repeat right now. And I'm like, well, now that I'm on this cancer diet. I mean, I still, I still pick out on Sunday, Sunday, and stuff like that. But, you know, I, I just keep very structured to keep my insulin levels, correct. You know, my glucose levels, right? Right. But, um, I don't think so. I think I'd rather go out, you know, you just kind of go out while you're on top. I agree, but yeah. And there's no, there's nothing to prove on the stage. I won 10 pro shows, which I'm just thankful that I had that opportunity to compete even on the I have baby stage. Right. And I got to grace the stage of the Olympia and the Arnold and Australia and India and all these places, you know, and Canada, like everywhere. And I just don't think that there's any reason for me to get back on stage and put the heels back on. Right. So what, so what do you see is like your future, everyone has their like, what am I going to do next type of thing, my future goal? Like things I want to do in the future. What, like, where do you see South going? You want to stay in the sport and just kind of be like you do the coaching and I know you worked for Blackstone now. Is that what you want to see? What do you see yourself doing something else? I love doing the coaching with through nutrition, teaching people how to heal their bodies through nutrition and vitamins and just live a healthy sustainable life. I call like life long to sustainable, where you don't feel like you're on a deep leash and a bulking in a this and in that kind of nutrition. Like that's not good for your mentality long term, especially. As you get older, especially for women, men are a little bit better. But I see myself, you know, right now short term, my goal for myself would be to kind of get my body back to just feeling good because a lot of people go, well, you still look great outside. And I'm like, very appreciative of them saying that that makes me feel good. But at the end of the day, I could come home and I feel miserable and everybody, you know, my muscles is just aching and just I've got a Dima and a headache and nausea, it's just these random things and I don't think that they fully understand that. Or in the gym, I may be lifting some weight and they think I look great lifting that weight and I'm thinking, well, I used to feel to lift twice this much. Whoever think I need to do that much again, no. But I would love to see my physique be at a place where I'm personally happy because I think those of us that are successful on the stage, we've always challenged ourselves to be personally happy with something, you know. Sure. So I want to do that. But really just focusing on nutrition, focus on every day, just being a better person, somewhere and helping others. That's just always been my goal and that's what my goal through Blackstone Labs and through my online coaching. Yeah, I know a lot of people that were in the world. Help others and let them see their true potential. Sure. Sure. What do you think of this new wellness division that they got out there? I think it's great. I mean, I never had legs where always my problem. So I would never be a wellness competitor. I wish I could because I think that that's a beautiful look. I love that they're still not like so overpowering to where, you know, you see someone who have no over, no upper body at all and it's just legs. I love that the wellness division is still kind of balanced. I like to call it kind of like a 60 40. Yeah. Kind of balance. I think it's great though because so many women that wanted to compete would just have to run and run and run and run and die and do all these things and it was going against their natural body genetics. Yeah. And I believe they didn't have good experiences on the stage. And I think the whole point of the NPC and the IFPV, I've always wanted someone to walk away from that stage and find something that they could use that was. Fun and enjoyable to them that they can use in the rest of their life. And if you're just miserable every moment of it, then it's not. So I think that the wellness division has opened up the world of competing for a lot of women. Sure. Well, I got to just say you're a very brave woman and you've been through an awful hot in your life and it's amazing. And it just goes to show you that if you're focused enough and you're organized and you do your research and you have a positive attitude that you can kind of get through anything and you've proved that through your career. You've achieved probably more in the physique world than I think anyone ever would have predicted. And that's a testament to work ethic and I always tell people that. I mean, yeah, we all have a genetic predisposition but a lot of people never really realize they're true potential because they're not willing to do the work. And you've done the work not just on the stage but outside, you know, when through all the different illnesses you've had, your diabetes and you've overcome all these obstacles. And that's what a real role model is. I believe, you know, someone who can have these, I always ask myself something, why do I have these weird things that happen to me? And then I say, you know what, it's to show people that you can get through these things. If you're determined enough, if you do your research and educate yourself enough and you just don't give up, you know, and that's the key. Just said what you just took the word right out of my mouth. I think for me, what motivates me and drives me is at the end of the day. I want someone to be able to say, I didn't give up because of you. Right. And see, I just got like little tingles. I think it's too. Because you're right. You know, I'm not going to give up. Every day there's a reason why I'm on God's wake up list and is it to inspire someone motivate someone, just drive someone, push them a little harder or for them to see like, oh, wait, I could do something like that or I could try that. You know, because most days I wake up and I don't feel great, but I set my intention today is going to be a good day in some way and I'm going to get my butt out of this bed and I'm going to try no matter what. If I've got to come home at three o'clock and like I'm accounting, take a two hour nap, then I'm going to have to do that. But I'm going to do whatever I can physically, emotionally, mentally, all of that in the meantime. Yeah, amen to that. Okay. Keep us updated, Jen, you know, your story is ongoing and I love to hear that you know, you're doing well. Always interesting. Every time I hear you, you always have a fun. So I remember the first time I interviewed her, she's like, I'm eating. I have to eat pancakes three, night days in a row because I can't keep my weight up for stage. I'm like, oh, you got real big probs. Believe me, I said, don't tell me. Oh, I know. I don't want to be like, oh, I hate you. I hate that. I hate this. I hate this. And I'm like, no, no, wait, I'm not going to do that. I'm really fine. He's the only one. And then what they didn't know is that not only you pick it, you've got to now manage your blood sugar because of the pancakes, you know. That's what they didn't know. And we never knew like our pancakes going to backfire. Right. Because we need to drop really low and it also means I have chronic GI issues or any of that are going to work. Because that's the crap shoot you have with diabetes. Is it going to work this time or not? Because it could be different every single time you take a step on that stage. Absolutely. Good luck. Keep us updated. We're all praying for you. It's so good to speak to you. And I love talking to you. It was an inspiration doing this interview. I appreciate you doing joining us today. Well, I appreciate you having me. All right. The great trend. Strobo. We'll say a prayer for her. For now, though, we are at a time on day polumbo. We'll see you next time.

Let's get to what we were discussing yesterday. We posted it on Instagram. We wanted to get a feel for modern day posing, modern day body gold opposing and Lee, you brother, good point as far as the posing versus the entertainment aspect of it. Reflect back on your memories of Melvin and one made him such a great poster in your mind. Hello Melvin. It was just a great pose. It just just looking at Melvin, you know, some people. And then some people's like painting, I guess. That's why people, we suck at painting. So we don't have rhythm. And I think the same comes to opposing. You can just see people who are naturally gifted when it comes to posing. They can hear music. They can flow their body moves to it. They said not even the muscles like Melvin said, even facial expressions or even opening of a hand or a hand closing your fingers. Everything comes into play when someone's a great classical pose or so. Just seeing Melvin move on stage or just like what's in fluid. It's just like this fluid movement. The music, just gracefully went together. Where is he get out of the guys that come out and just moved up. Most muscular walk to the stage. Most muscular walk over there. They'll have some music where every second beat is boom, boom. So they can't miss the pose. But you can watch Melvin pose and sometimes I know people will be like, oh, they're not clapping. That's the, to me, that's great. If you can mesmerize an audience here, we'd like to hear you applaud, awesome that. But if you can walk out and pose and there is silence because the crowd is just in awe because Melvin, you know, it's time to start off slow and the crowd will be quiet. People think well, no one's making a noise because it's so captivated by his moving and he's posing and then he'd go into some road-bought and dense moves and then the crowd would really arc up and stuff. But if you can just catch someone with music and posing like that, you've got to mean the palm of your hand and Melvin always did that when he was posing. There's very, you know, there's a lot of good poses, but to be an exceptional pose like Melvin, there's probably only a handful to this day in bodybuilding. That can do it. Yes, there are entertainers too, like Kai and how do you can stand on his head and do the splits and spin around and stuff. But yes, that's sort of good pose, but to me, that's more on the entertaining side where his Melvin had best of both worlds, but when Melvin posed he really posed. Well, Skate King Kamali and here King, we're going to talk about individual bodybuilders today as far as who are considered to be some of the better poses, a better poseer's. In your opinion though, again, we talk about Melvin Anthony, we talk about a generation of own stage entertainers. Do you feel as if we still have that same level of quality today in terms of posing in terms of routine as we do today? And if you want to throw it in, your memories will meet Melvin such a great on stage entertainer. Yeah, absolutely not. It's horrible nowadays. It sucks. Bodybuilding is not bodybuilding anymore. I've said it a thousand times. People seem to think that when we say things like this, we are disgruntled and all they're retired and no, it's not. Bodybuilding is not the same. The energy is gone. The excitement is gone. The guest posing is gone. When you had a guest poseer coming to town, it was like a rock star coming into town. You go there. People will go nuts. You feel the energy even before you walk out on stage. The lights come on. You hear the ooze and eyes. Now you got crickets. Rami walks out at 320 pounds and you hear crickets. What's wrong with that? What is wrong with that? You know what's all with that is the internet. Internet fucked everything up. Social media fucked everything up. Right now when you have social media stars that are bigger than the actual stars, something's wrong with this picture. Something's really wrong with this picture. As far as Melvin goes, listen, meet personally. I always, I loved going up against Melvin because Melvin was, he was fun. Craig took it personal. Melvin didn't take it personal. Melvin took it like exactly what he just did right now. You say something to him and he comes right back at you and it was fun. Melvin was the type of person that you can have a fight with and later on that day the expo he'll buy you lunch. That was Melvin. Now as far as his posing goes, Melvin is a pop locker from the West Coast. One of the funniest things I've ever seen is when he had a break that when he had a pop lock competition in Italy against a bunch of fucking douche bags, every time I'm in a bad mood, I want to be a hero and I laugh myself because Melvin doesn't care. He'll do it any place anytime anywhere. Characters, personalities, that shit is gone. Dexter retired the last of the Mohicans retired. It's done. It's a whole different ballgame now. I'm sorry, Melos. I know you got a lot of people your coaching. I know that you, you have a lot of people under you and all these people, but it's not the same and I know deep down in your heart. You know that's true. Well I do want to get me a little shimpy. I don't mean, you have to run in a short period of time and I appreciate your time as always and I have to go train. I wanted to get your opinion if you want to respond to King but then also in today's naughty building landscape, who you like, who reminds you sort of that, you know Melvin's era as posing as for as an on stage entertainment value. I got to make one thing straight. I don't have to go three o'clock through train because it's three o'clock. That's good in time. Not the eastern time. Oh, three o'clock. And by the way, when I said this west east, I want to revisit that east west competition also because I have a couple of westerns here and couple of easterns and then Australia and Guy that can say, who is better east coast of West coast. But I hear about the posing. Madden brought it really to the next level. He got everything from John as Lee Priest said, opening the finger, facial expression and alls, bending the choices of the poses. You can hit the 10 great poses. But this 10 great poses have to be hit in the right transitions in order. If you do from one and then the other one doesn't make sense, you know, you're ruining the posing. So madden that 2003 post-reviewed in for Madden and I posted, I think that's some masterpiece. That was a masterpiece. And I'm going to, you know, can you hear? I do remember one's commentating Mr. Olympia and I actually was kind of bashing you for your great entertaining posing. And I was saying, like, look, he didn't hit the three poses. You know, these dance. You know, so I'm going to take that back because yeah, you did a scene many of your routines. You did so entertaining and you did excellent routine. But if I'm a judge going by the 80s and the 90s rules, when we had a signature round of square round and the posing round, presentation round was counted for you can actually get the points on that. Madden, you bit Flex, three or 2003 and I don't man after the posing round. He was the head of the in the prejudging right? So if you think this is the element, hey, we don't have a much of the supporting event in the bodybuilding, you know, because they say since sport is entertainment, well, it was a sport back in a day. You do the signature round and you have it for any comparisons. Three guys back to back to back, you can dissect them. Now that is the six guys, Hanahalib and I look at the guy from the left, guy to the right and then in the middle, there is no way. So when he came to the posing, there was the posing of John Brown, Mohamed McCabe, Lilabrada, at Korma, being staleer. I mean, there was art and this is what Madden brought into it with his statue of entertainment, which you come out of, yeah, you did the hell of a job there. You know, as much as I made those comments back then for the midst of the MPI was actually compensating and I said like, well, this is entertainment, but not the posing team. I've seen some of your posing routines and you did manage to keep your stomach tight and make interesting poses. I've seen several of those dancers that they tried to emulate, that in Charles were a nothing and they completely lose. The stomach goes out, you know, they do some poses that don't do nothing for their physique. It's just the opposite. I remember back in the day when I was in 90s, posing in Germany, this German promoter goes to Miller's. Why you have to do bad double-bicycle posing, you're free posing routine, I say what you mean. You know, it's a Madden 3 pose, years, but not in a free posing. Free posing is supposed to be a time that you emphasize your physique, your streaks, not your weaknesses. So you have no arms, you have no back. Why are you how they're doing a bad double-bicycle? It's like, yeah, you're right. So yet also come at the act of posing. Some guys don't have all the mandatory spurtryplic, but then when they bring this twisting back shots, launching, kneeling, whatever and you go, whoa, look at that. Well, I mean, the whole Madden 3 routine 2003, I started that I saw a thousand kinds, and as if this is absolute perfection, okay? So you know, just to mention this, Sean Ray was a great poseer. So nobody can take away this from him, right? Madden, you don't mean in a conversation yesterday, you don't take away from Sean as a barbell, you even think that he should win Mr. Olympia. So let's, I mean, I know that a lot of guys jump on Sean, Sean is Sean, okay? Let it, you say he is kind of selfish things just so you can self. I know, as a told you, right? Everybody should be, what? Very selfish man, come on, be a little bit. Yeah, yeah, but here, he question for all of you guys. Should we all be selfish and think of a self first or follow mad by my, my way? I was pretty much set last, always an end up with a short end of the stick. So I understand that Sean wants to, you know, do things for Sean, okay? But to be fair, I mean, that gives some advice, Madden, he was not your opposing coach by no means absolutely, and you will not hear, I don't know if you'll listen, I said that day 299 for the U.S. that you won and then going to 2000, another champions which I prepared for, you know, I was observing your opposing, of course, with the due respect of John giving instructions, I would just be second pair of the eyes. And in that moment, Sean was there and he just said his basic bangled biceps open, he did back again. I mean, something that you already did 2000 times. So on that matter, he didn't teach anything, but to conclude, and I'm sure that all of you guys are great. I haven't seen one great opposing routine unless he is Olympic, let me think, not one. I mean, because it's a scale down, you don't need to do, you're not being judged on it, you know, it's just a little impression. If you had a three-round symmetry round, so you have to emphasize the status, shape, it really need to go to the classic physique, because if you want to be more classic, you would do it, so you can win a symmetry round. Then you want to freak them out and you win the Ferrari round, okay? You scared me to pose. You can do the most muscular and from the advices, you know, stick your tongue out and go left and right. Meals, can I say something here? Okay, everything you're saying, 100%, 1000% agree. The problem is that you have to look at the root of the problem, okay? One person was awarded a pro-card at the USA's. One! That's it! One! Now you got a 118 pro-cards handed out. That's what fucked up the sport. When you're coming and you're going into the nationals of the USA, you had to be the best in the country. Number one in the United States. Now you have to be number one to 200. You understand? That's why, when you say water down, that's what the water down. They don't care anymore. That's the problem. When I'm getting ready for the show, when I was getting ready and I knew Melvin was going to be, and I was like, I will go to a body rock, I'm like, Dom man, we got out to him, we got out to him, whatever he's doing Steve, I don't care what he's doing, I wanted to put more sound effects, for more bombs here, I want more drops here, this and that. Now they don't care, it doesn't matter. You know why? Because the girl with her has the fucking Dominican ass and the fucking bombshell boobs is getting with 1 million followers on Instagram, she's getting paid. Not the guy who's killing him, soft on stage. That's the problem man. One champion, now there's 118 pro cars mean hand it out. Okay, can I ask you guys, okay, King, how do you explain that right now they have a probably 300, 400 professionals back in the day, I'm going to mention Melvin's pro debut, 2000, another chance, right? 44 competitors, 40 fucking four competitors, I competed also 50 competitors on the fucking stage, another chance. Now you have a show, like what was here in California, like eighth competitors and nine and ten, I don't get it, I was the pro, I have a pro card, I can enter any pro contest, make money, promote myself, you know, get some jobs, where does pros, we have a, like you said, 300 pros, where are they, why they're not competing? They don't care. That's the topic that we've been talking about now over the course of the last two weeks and that is and that was sort of an sort of, you know, with this almost classic lineup, Sergio Leva Jr came on heavy, most radio and essentially cold out the bodybuilding world, he wanted more competitors to compete, especially the high level ones and that's what we're going to get at the Arnold Classic, but they've only bring you because again, you made, you know, a real career out of guest posing and again, you have an appreciation for the art of guest posing, you and I were talking about the silver the point yesterday, again, who bought up the point, I really wish I could remember it, but they pointed out on Instagram how guest posing in a sense today has become two and a half minutes of just most muscular shots telling the crowd to get all been and then that's about it. In your opinion, again, when we talk to today's bodybuilders, again, you have many who have an appreciation for the art of bodybuilding, for the art of posing, but in a sense that has been translated, where do you think the disconnect is? People are lazy. I mean, when I would go to guest pose, like I didn't have the talent of Melvin, so I had to be entertaining. I had the size and freakingess and that's what the, I knew the crowd loves that and guest poses and I always was in shape. So I made sure I was always in shape and I would put together these routines, I would choreograph with music and props and everything like that to get people laughing to get them like holy Mac, well, this is cool. I got my money's worth coming through the show because I got entertained by someone who actually took the time to be creative because when I went to bodybuilding shows, that's what I was just, you know, speaking of, I remember seeing Melissa Coates' guest pose at the muscle beach, one of the muscle beach shows back in the 90s, may she rest in peace, we lost her recently, and she put on such a great routine. It was so entertaining, I said, you know what? When I get to the level, if I ever get to the level where people want to pay me or see me to guest pose, I am going to put time and effort into my routines. I'm not going to just go up there and wing it because these people are paying money to see these shows and they deserve to be entertained. And you know what, I might not be a pro, I might have been an Olympian, but I'm going to give them the money's worth, and they're going to remember they pull them, but when they leave, that or what a torn-up, and that's what I did every single time. And I did a couple of years, I guess, post 35 times a year, I mean, so I was, you know, I was in demand, I didn't overcharge these promoters, I did seminars with it, I gave them the money's worth, and you know what? The people who went there and bought it, taken to see their friends felt like they got something a little extra. And I don't know why we don't have that today. The shows are too long, there's too many divisions, people just want to get out of there, they're not interested in watching anything. And I think that that's the problem, you know? So, you know, it's a different year, I understand that. You mentioned Sergio Leaver Jr., I think he's a great pose, I love watching him on stage. He's entertaining. He does his own thing, but then he also throws in a little bit of his dad's pose at the end. I mean, the audience goes crazy for that. I mean, that's entertainment. You know, we put out this post yesterday on our Instagram and some of the names are mentioned. Yeah, Sergio Leaver Jr. was one of the more prominent, he mentioned the most prominent one was Terrence Ruffin. And you had a lot of a handful coming from the classic physique division, and to one of Ayanna, Hunter Lebrada mentioned prominently from the open class as well. Melvin was bringing back on this, when you lengthen, you surveyed the landscape to today's bodybuilding. Who do you like? Who do you find entertaining on stage? entertaining? I think that, you know, the names you mentioned, they are very good poses. But there's a level, there's a level that the bodybuilding community or the fitness community as a whole, they don't try to grasp the wow factor. Terrence Ruffin's like, I like it, I like the way he poses. Sergio Leaver, I've been knowing the guys the team is a kid. There's a level, there's a, there's a level that goes beyond what he's done. And that's why I started to try to teach it. I started, you know, giving guys information, guys have been retaining my services to help them get there. That's the same information that I got from John Brown. I could deliver it. You know what I mean? Paul DeLette was one of the guys I really, really wanted to like get a hold of when I was coming up through the ranks. You know what I mean? He's to stay at Lee pre-south, you know? And I used to go over there, like a little kid and I, you know, I talked to him and he said, you know, there's a mind muscle connection that you're not trying to learn. But he thought, since I'm in shape, I'm pre-hunting a prince. I don't care. So if you don't care, that's how he talked to you. He has to rub that as much. You know, maybe when I don't care. So you know, I was 300 pounds in, I don't care. So you know, I just laugh at him or I, but don't care. And so you get what you get. So the same emphasis that these guys have now. Oh shit. I'm out. Can't come on. He says it best. You know, they laugh at me because I'm always a jokester. I'm a tailor like it is. And I can emulate Paul DeLette, like you would not believe. He'd be like, how do you be the chin? And I do cut you. So I don't care. Just two, three hours. And I would get up there and I would just do abshunt. And it'd be over with. Nah man, because I didn't do even to this day. If I competed now, let's just say you put me on stage right now. And remember, best shake. I don't do it for the money. I do it for the people who pay to get here. The people who paid money to see me, I'm going to want to be the one that stands out. So I put the emphasis in the time and the effort it and the work to be able to have a wild factor. So yes, Terras Reffen will be the stand out guy. Sergio Leaver Jr.'s another stand out guy with four classical posing. But there's another level. The entertainment value. There's another level. You have to connect with the music. You have to bring them music. You have to make it come alive. And there's a system for that. A day one thing here, I think I mentioned this before that I when I talked to you before. When I went to the nationals, Lee Haney was backstage. And when he told me change my life, it really did. And what Lee said to me was, when the crowd, he goes, just be entertaining. When the crowd and you're going to have a great career. Forget about the crowd. He's just wind the crowd. He said to me, and it just stuck to my head. I'm like, okay, that's it. That's what I'm going to do. And you don't know Dave, how many times I'm not going to mention names, because then I'm going to get shit for it. How many times some officials will tell me, stop doing that. Your routines are too long. Why are you dancing? And I'm going to look at them over like, but I got the best response. People are talking about women to stop when I'm when the crowd is having a good time. So I would be like, okay, sure, no problem. The next time I do it even longer. So you got to eat Melvin's right entertainment. You gotta make them have don't do. And I love the fact that people use songs that they like. No, no, no, no. No, right, right, you would everyone like. So I don't know why I don't that song. No, you have to send a message. And I will tell you, when we were coming through like he said, you were saying the California, the Orange County, there was one guy. I had to beat everybody. You know what I'm talking about? And you didn't have to beat a biggest. You just had to beat the best. And we took it serious. Believe me, Melos is Jim, Melos, what's telling you? We didn't play on the West side. We was street boy. So when Keke Kamali came out in the magazine and he got the top of that shit about we was pussy. And he was told, so he was guys on train hard. We wanted to kill Keke Kamali. When he Kamali came in 93, he didn't know everybody had to all of his head done. They's like, hey, yeah, so when we came up backstage, remember we came up at the backstage after the show and Keke Kamali was like, hey, man, you know, I just want to say, man, that was all for show. That's safe, but he was about to jump on Keke. He liked to get his ass. The 2000 one, the 2001 Iron Man won. I was up there battling. There were people in the audience throwing a game sign. Don't want to get. Yeah, so Keke Kamali come up the side at you. 2000 one. He comes up the side on the stage. Go the guys. You know, I got my little friends in front of the neighborhood and like, yeah, that's that food. They throw them guys on. They weren't getting kids. Look. Some kids come out of the side of the stage after the show. You know, we all, you know, it was all over with. It's all became out and Keen, you know, put his hand out to say, hey, man, man, that was a battle man for the ages, man. You know, it was all for show. And it hit me that this guy was just crying. But we didn't know that. He was a kid talking about, he was back to the boat here. We're going to beat up a postage. We're getting out. 2001 Iron Man Chris winning Melvin second and Kamali crazy looking. Territ. Yeah. It was a show. It was something spectacular. But hey, now you're talking East Coast, West Coast. I just thought you're subject. Let me ask you guys, because I'm not, you know, Americans. So I coonvented USA's and nationals. What are you guys? Okay. Dave, you did almost 20 national levels from North American USA's nationals. You did everything. Maven, you only did the USA's. They did both every year. USA national national, USA national, he gave them all the way up to the second. King, you only did the nationals. Why is that? Oh, I'm going to tell you. Okay. I'll let King Kemori answer that first and then I'll come in. I was hoping. Yeah. It was obvious to me. It was as a kid coming up. It was so fucking obvious that the USA's was the West Coast show, West Coast judges, West Coast everything. Why would I go there and get my ass handed to me when I can just stay on the East Coast and just stay with my people, stay with it. No, no, to me it was completely obvious. Number one. Number two, again, it was to me it was embedded on the West on the East side that the nationals was the show to do for us. West Coast was the USA. That was embedded in my brain from day one. So that's my answer. All right. My answers I agree. I would have went to the nationals because I mean, me personally, I was trained that you know, like a people, you know, John Brown was say sick and I go in and bite and just go kill everything. But as my personal, I did the USA because I wanted to be in my backyard. I wanted to be the best because at that show, the national back that had you get every class to get a profile. You know, John Brown won. Every guy at the USA, you had to win yo class and the overall, which means you had to be the best of the best of the internet day when all the smoke cleared. I had to be the band of weight, the middle weight, the wealth weight, heavy weight and then that time, the super heavy weights. And I did that. That was, it was a personal decision for me. And I knew that shoot. I was going to have some of them judges and you know, I'm like me too. I watched me since I was kids. So I'm just staying over here. So yeah, I agree with King on that. My, I'll give you my answer. My answer that I was a dumb dumb naive kid. I was in school way too long. I knew nothing about politics about trends about East Coast West Coast. I just figured if you showed up at the best, you got you placed with your supposed to. So I did both. I figured you know what? I'm always in shape. I could do two shows. It didn't take a lot out of me to peak twice a year. And so I did both. And I was naive to that fact. But they were right. Back in the early 90s, you know, I think there was definitely a trend for West Coast USA, East Coast wins nationals. I think it changed once we got into the 2000s. I think it kind of evened out. But there was definitely a, there was definitely a tendency to go that direction. I think I'll have one extractor to that too, Chad Nichol. You know, he guided me in the right. He put me on the right track when I didn't have, when I had questions and I should say Chad and Kim, I will put them both together because I used to talk to both of them. So it was him and he guided me in the right direction. He would tell me and he'd point blank told me state, state of the nationals, let Melvin do his thing. He's got it because we both because both Melvin and I just suppose that the Ronnie Coleman show and Melvin was in shape and I was a fat ass off season. And I remember we had a little thing on stage and I said Melvin, go get your fucking pro card to the USA. He'd be alone. And he's doing a 90s game. He's black. And Melvin was like, anyway, it was fun time. But good Chad definitely Chad put me on the right. And then even Chad after I got my pro cards, he'd point blank told me he goes, yeah man, you ain't ready. I'll put the conclusion because he's not ready for the approach. That's why I took two years to give back on stage from 99 to 2001. He was straight at me because you're not ready for the pro. Just do what you got to do put on another 10 12 pounds and then we'll get you ready. Chad Nichols, God bless him. We lost Lee for a second. I wanted to bring up something in the surge of mention and King of the Year on this one. He mentioned specifically, he made a really good point on this one. Let me see if I get this correctly. There is a fine line between posing when you're under 275, 270 pounds and over 270 pounds talking about Dennis Wolff, when in the best posing award at the Arnolds. And again, we're talking about Sergio Lee with Junior Vegas. You know, if we're going to go into Classic Physicians, that's totally different topic altogether. Again, you're talking about a lighter demographic for the most part. But when you're talking about somebody who's going to be posing over the weight of 270 pounds, talk about some of the challenge that's going to present it. Because he's talking specifically about how much more difficult it is for him to pull off some of these poses and routines. Yeah, first of all, I don't think he's 200 and fucking 70 pounds on stage. That, that I severely doubt that. A lot of people nowadays they're saying they're 270. I think Flex Wheeler at his all-time best. I don't know Melvin can clarify this. I mean, was a 232, 235 somewhere around there. Right. And in a cutler at his best was what? 255 to 60? No, no more than 262. So when someone says I'm 270 pounds, let's take Ronnie and put him on a different category and put him aside. You know, let's not talk about he's just a freak mutation mutant. And we're never going to see that again for hundreds of years. But don't look at that. Now, yes, if you're a bigger guy, of course it's going to be harder to move and all that stuff. But it's not impossible. How about practicing once in a while? How about, you know, getting in front of a mirror and putting the microphones on and practicing your posing, nobody does that anymore. Nobody does that anymore. It's just sad. And again, I know Melus is he's got so many clients and so many people still doing this is he's the person to ask this question. And we will also be the person that. Yeah, you got to pose definitely. Well, let me tell you this, King, I talked to, this is very interesting. I talked to Ronnie Coleman, ask him what is your all-time best Ronnie says 98 Olympia. I asked Kevin, what was his best? He said the, uh, how does he have to ship? I forgot now what was Kevin? I think 93 or champions. I asked Flex Villar, he says 99, vintage ramp tree and he said he was 258 and that show. And I remember that was because I was 255. That was my my heaviest. I said, is this possible? Yeah, he looks bigger than me. So yeah, Flex would be competing normally, you know, he was 217 18 and 93, but I don't plastic, but then he went to the, uh, to 30s and then the third year of career, he would tip the scale over to 50, possibly. But you have to go back to the opposing. He's a Tata and my issue, he was supposed one hour a day as a mandatory. And what I was saying, if you really analyze the opposing, and I don't know if can you do it in a date and leave or a mountain, uh, mountain, I'm sure he does. Every pose have to be succeeding the other one. He has everything makes sense. I would take a picture of every single pose and then put it on and say, okay, here is 28 poses. Okay, this makes sense. This sequence, but here, you turn around for no reason, you went down for no reason, you went down and up in a, you know, two consecutive, uh, presses. So, they're advised that I would give, you know, for the people, uh, you have to impress the judges. When you step on the stage, you have to do your best poses. Whatever, you know, your 10 15 best poses, it has to be right there because judges will lose the patience. If you do like so so pose and it's not eventful, you drop the shoulders, you know, relax your abs, nothing is happening. So, you have to have a 10 15 best poses and transition has to be perfect. You have to be, wow, wow, well, you have to capture the audience, capture the judges. Not too many people do that. Right now even, you know, when somebody is sending a post in video, in a ceiling, about 10 poses that have no place being there. It's the way I held it. Oh, you know, he just thought of, it doesn't look good for you. It take it out, change it. It's like a movie, you know, it's like a movie and they say that a good director of movies says there's not one scene in a movie that's not relevant to progress the plot forward. If there is, the movie drags you lose the audience. Yeah. That was that. That was what I was good at. That was what I've mastered. That takes time. That takes somebody showing you first how to do your mandatories. That most of the guys I see on stage right now, they don't even know how to do their mandatories. I said it to show just recently. Man, Chris Cormeer was sitting out there and the guy got up there and he was hitting his shots and big his hell had a great physique, but he didn't know how to present it. That's like cooking a meal and then throw it on a floor. Don't give your forms to eat it. You can't do that. You have to know what you have. You have to know your greatest attributes. What are my best poses? And then you have to practice it over and over and over in front of a mirror. And the problem is that guys don't want to take that time to do that because it's boring. Yes, it takes time. It doesn't feel good. It's like walking naturally left, right, left, right left right, but see poses not like that. Posing is like walking front and side and front into the left and front into the right. It doesn't you have to make what's uncomfortable natural. Right. How do you do that? It takes practice. So for you for the question of a hundred, two hundred, seventy five pound guy or two hundred, fifty five pound guy hitting his shots. You first have to learn my muscle control. After you learn the my muscle control, you have to know how to move from one post to the next and do it perfectly or almost perfectly. Doesn't happen overnight? No, it doesn't. It took me years to do that. Once I got it though, once you have it, it becomes second nature. Again, what Milo showed me by my stomach. I don't know why he messed me up with that because I don't even compete. I still do it when I'm driving the car. I'm almost on the game. I think if you know what I still do it, but it works. And when I'm on stage, I always keep the attention of the judge. Every time I move something happens, even when I'm standing to the sidelines, I don't relax and get water and you know, it was funny because it happened in one of my last shows that I won the Phoenix Pro show. Everybody was on stage and I will say something about he, he, he, he, he day. I try to kill that guy to jump. That dude has no give whatsoever. He is a robot. That guy doesn't get tired. So we were all on stage and they kept having us battle. Having us battles one of those times in John, two minute, got a therapist, but he wanted to keep us on stage for 20 minutes. So Tony Freeman got pissed and started cousin because he goes, you guys want water? I say, hey, no, man, I die up here, man. This is this is where it said, man, I'm here. Let's go. He said, you need to only move for a group. You custed the judges. He was so mad. He custed the judges. You know, I'm talking about it. So that's what it takes. You got to be up there right or die. Guys don't have it, man. Tell you no more. You want the kill to give me up this stage. Meals should tell you, he ain't going to go in nowhere to get no water. Why, what you bring the town to me. I'm not going off this stage to the fire. Go up a loose, my money. And I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Rit to play. You know, I want to make this one comment about the weight of the body balls. You know, when I first saw a guy compete, when he stood to the team, my son as a kid, because we used to compete in New York together. But when he was doing team universe, and he was in that, he was natural. And he was winning. I think he weighed probably 220 pounds, 218 pounds. His movement on stage was incredible. He was emotional. Okay. He really wasn't a good guy with the man of the toys. But he was like, he was like, I was like, I'm about to, a Broadway dancer on saying it was so entertaining to watch. I didn't want to do the routine to end. When he got bigger and he got over 250, he couldn't move like that anymore. His routines were still very entertaining. Because you, we see what he does. I mean, but he moved the same way. So I think when you do get larger and you weigh more, you do have to modify a little bit to the extent of what you do. Absolutely. You have to pick your best poses and you got to prevent, you know, present them on stage. That's, that's the key, you know, the connection to the audience and the judges because judges are friends too. Don't let them tell it. Yes, they're supposed to be, you know, unbiased and all that. But they got their favorites. Don't think for one second that they are looking for a person to do a certain thing. And that's just the way it is. So, you know, posing is very important. Even if it's not, you know, you don't get the points for it. Even if you don't, you know, get the extra money because we had posing awards in all that when I was coming through me and King, we were trying to get that extra money. That extra King ran. We're trying to 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what? You know, I gotta say one thing to, I remember watching Lee priest routine. Lee took Superman theme, which was probably over, overused by a million people over the years. And he made it exciting. When I would see him at the Olympia doing those poses to Superman with the victory poses, I mean, I got chills in me. I mean, no one pulled off Superman better than Lee priest. Nobody. Nobody did that. I don't know. That's the song. Look, Lee did that at the Arnold. And can you hear me? Yeah, we got it. Yeah, we got it. Yeah, I want your video. But Lee, Lee priest did that at the Arnold. And this was another 10 grand, right? And they said, we were talking to each other and Lee, with me and Lee talked briefly. And he, he, he goes, hey, man, what you gonna do? I'm like, I tell you, he's like, well, what are you gonna do, man? I'm not telling you what you're gonna do. You are not telling you. So I knew it was funny because Lee went out before I did, right? So, you know, it was a big thing they had the TV's back there, you know? And this is again, this has been lost in body, but we all talk, we all, we all are homies, you know, but on that stage, we battle. So I ran to the TV, you know, dexter's always to get stuff started, right? You know, these back there. So I ran to the TV. Man, when Lee came out, did that Superman? I looked at that, I was, I was so old shit. I've been do something because if Rob, don't they went crazy? Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, I heard people yell, I'm like, maybe, wait a minute, that's what, that's what, that's what, that's what, that's what, that's what you can't steal my funk. I watched that video. And I got chills, my damn stuff. So I knew, I had to get it. And I think what a year that did I do Darth Vader that year? And they got dead Darth Vader, because they say that was the year we were able to get it. They let us use proof, man, but they had everybody scared with that. I thought for sure that 10 grams is going to him. Yeah. It's funny, why don't you give that tank ran out anymore? I mean, that really would inspire people to suppose more. When did you think, I was just going to ask that because, you know, last year with the Arnold Classic, we were talking to Sergio before the Arnold, and he talked about the best closer word. He joked, lapsed that it's going to be the easiest 10,000 dollars I ever win. So, Lee, you feel like that's something that needs to be incentivized more. Oh, you know, I think it worked. And we could give 25. I think if I did the 25, why not? They showed him saying, oh, I thought you said it was 20. No, not the money. Melvin will come back, they can come back for that money. Shoot for 25 grand, you are. But that's what I should maybe, maybe you're giving me any people, give people incentives, actual practice of posing again and stuff like that. Because see the like Melvin said, it's not even the posing. Sometimes the posing's great, but even the Braddock would have a video not long ago where he was shown the poses, but he's also shown the transitions between the transitions, the transitions are just as important as the posing because the Braddock goes, he's a boy set, he's a lat's spread. That's how you move between the two. And even just moving between the two is an art in itself. Sometimes I get sick of big guy saying we can't pose cause we're big, we can't pose cause we're big. You can't even practice. Practice makes perfect. No matter how big you are. What's your memory memory memory memory memory memory memory memory memory? I still remember watching Phil, Phil, Phil, do fan of the opera at the early early when he went down into the splits. He had that crowd captivated. He's a guy, thick muskier, huge, lace-like plaques and stuff. And he moved like a balleriner on stage. With practice, you can make anything happen if you put the time and if it into it. First you have to have a trademark. You got to have a trademark. There's something that we all used to do. You know, when Melvin came out, you knew he was going to start slow and he's going to end up with the West Coast pop locking. You knew Melvin was going to do that. You knew Kamali is going to come out and I'm going to do a robot routine with the Terminator thing. You knew Lee is going to come out and do some mellows. You knew somehow he'll put gladiator in there. Someone else. He's all the way in the music. In the routine, you would have fucking gladiator in the fucking song. That's Melosarce. And you know, that's it. You got to have a piece of Victor with his one side, the vice-appose. He does. You got to have your own specific thing that you do. I'm sorry guys, you just don't have that anymore. It sucks. Yeah. Signature poses. Signature poses. I always love when I see something new. I don't know why people are not discovering and you're seeing what your poses character is. Just for them. But let me ask you now because you guys maybe know supposedly, showray competition somewhere in Texas that Kai Green had to take a train. You didn't have a money for hotel room. He stayed at a train station and then just went for a hope that he can get the best sponsor award. And he was hopefully he's going to be top 15 because if he didn't make it up 15, he wouldn't even close. And I guess he was the 15 and then he made a 10 ran. Do you know that story? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. I'm sure they remember New York. Kai was six, but he looked unbelievable. If he would have won that show, there would be no problem. Branch Warren won. Then he's James second then he's small third and I train both then he's for that show. But on one backstage I said, Kai, you know, you sure won. I mean he looked that good. Two weeks later, three weeks later, in Colorado, I was talking about hotel and then you know, it's okay. You want to see what I look like. I said, of course, some of the love to see when I look like. So he came into the room and he'd deposit. Of course, the characteristic Kai poses, you know, like the twisted ass to like, wow shit. And he would be like, but he had a notebook with him. And it is not booked like Leonardo da Vinci, happy realistic, truck and graphic. Every scene of post you can see every fiber correct thing. Everything, 30 poses back to back to back to back. I mean, I asked him, can I please take a picture? I mean, Kai. The last one was no next level. You know, everyone's little no puns. You want pictures and everyone's no puns. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think something else and speaking of this, let me use this. I predicted back in March that he's going to come back to the Olympia. Now, it looks like it's pretty much obvious thing that that's what's going to happen.

Iron debate makes it for turn. I'm not going to tell you exactly who we're going to have on the panel because whenever we do that, we guess. They fit and what we do have a very, very star-studded panel promised for you in some interesting, interesting topics. So excited for that iron debate makes it for turn this week. But Dave, this upcoming weekend, you have your virtual secret to become a diet group class. Yes, I am an interrible and promoting it. However, some of you mentioned on here, it will be this Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. we take an hour for lunch break. It's online. So anyone anywhere in the world can take it. Obviously it's going to be Eastern Standard Time 9 a.m. You can go to mydapelombo.com website. There's a link to sign up there at the Dave Polamo University, the Pumble University website.

Okay, because I I I I build up everything very gradually so that everyone can understand what's going on. And it reinforces a lot of science and people's heads had a diet, had a gain weight. Drogs and that's a very popular part of the course. Obviously, you've performed some enhancing drugs and something about steroids and insulin and G.E.H. and all that usage. Do you talk to the case and we do contest prep last week had a peak people, dioretics. You know, it goes over anything you could possibly imagine and people come away from this course feeling like they took four year college education on this stuff. And this the the sad part is there's nothing else out there like this and that's why I do it really I do it because I feel like I'm giving back and I'm educating the next generation of coaches. So guys sign up and I'll see you on Saturday. Let's go to our question. Again, the first two questions on the day of the lungo experience. The first question day by the started recently cycling after 15 years and now calling some supplements I used into question, especially caffeine. Do you think people at one medium dose cycles will better off any lung cavity than if they were to use the various high caffeine pre-workouts, etc.? You know, I was just having this discussion with my wife yesterday and I told her, I don't think she believed me. And I used to be and when I was in medical school and I was in college, I never used a single stimulant. I never drank a couple of coffee and she said, well, how did you study and had you when I would do is I would take an abs. Okay, and I'm serious about this. When I was bodybuilding I did this. The only time I ever had coffee was when I was dieting. I would drink coffee just to curb my appetite a little bit. But when I needed energy, okay, I went and took an abs. Now if you have a full-time job obviously, you can't sleep at work. It's a different story. But if you're working, when you have the ability to have some breaks, try taking a mid-afternoon nap. I'm telling you, sleep doesn't an amazing thing. I used to come home from medical school. I would go to the gym right after med school. I would come home. I would eat dinner. I would do a bunch of guys. We would cook dinner. And then they would start studying. I was exhausted at that point. I went into my bedroom. I was slept for about 45 minutes. I got up. I washed my face, took a shower, and you know what? I was so awake. I would study four hours. It was like they would have to study 18 hours to be equipped with that four hours of studying because I was so focused. So good nap goes a long way. Can't do that. You know, a good cup of coffee can certainly help. Now, if you're using a pre-workout, there's nothing wrong with that. However, if you're using a pre-workout and drinking two energy drinks with it, that's excessive. And when you excessively over-stimulate your body, it stresses out the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are always pumping out more and more and more at the naphenethrane. When they pump out at the naphenethrane, they pump out cortisol, which is a stress hormone. We know the cortisol can definitely catabolize muscle tissue. Because cortisol's job is to convert amino acids into glucose to raise blood glucose. So you don't want a lot of cortisol. I was also talking to George Tulliotis this morning about how cortisol can ravage your body. You can get fat from it and lose muscle. Nothing, okay? Which is weird. Because people think, oh, well, all the calorie guys will tell you, oh, it's all about calories and calories that know it's not. Because hormones will influence how your body utilizes calories. And cortisol, in high amounts, wreaks havoc on the body. We don't want to suppress the immune system. It breaks down a muscle tissue. It causes fat deposition in the abdominal area in the visceral organs. Not good. So you don't want to over-stimulate your body. But you could do a little bit, okay? It's a all-bout moderation. So if you like that pre-workout, you know, that you take and it helps get you three work out, then fine. But you shouldn't be drinking four or five energy drinks throughout the day. Also, in addition to that, because that's too much, okay? So, and also, what I do is, I drink cup of coffee like on the days we film here because we do a lot of filming in a row and I need to be awake. And sometimes I don't sleep that much because I got key on kids. So if that is the case, on the days I don't record, I don't drink coffee. So I let my body recover so that my central nervous system is very sensitive to caffeine. If I were to drink coffee every single day, large amounts eventually, it doesn't even do anything. I remember when I used to diet, I would drink Starbucks, you know, iced americanoes, and after, you know, three weeks of drinking every day, I could drink them and I could go right to sleep afterwards. It didn't even keep me awake. So, if you want to keep yourself sensitive to caffeine, don't do it. If you can get away with doing it every day or do very small amounts on the days that you really don't need it, you're going to get much better results for it. Second question again from the deep plumbo experience, I would get it cry, I don't want to drink high days. When Smith-Machine Squats be effective as barbell squats, I have it and I'm going to be very careful when I say this. Bulging disc, I love it. And to many times, I struggle after squatting. Yeah. Every N.A.S. didn't squat. The latter part of his career, because he had to hit an issue or something like that. His legs look great, okay? So, some people can do Smith-Machine Squats. I find that when you do Smith-Machine Squats, the Smith-Machine balance is the bar for you basically. So you're taking out a component of the squat that helps with full development. Just like Smith-Machine bench press is not quite as good as good a development as a freeway bar or free bar bench press. However, having said that, if you have an injury that makes it to that you can't squat the way you need to with a free bar, because you're injuring your back more and more, then you can't do it. You've got to work around the injury. Now, you should also check out, if you should try to get a pair of custom orthotics made for your shoes. That's going to certainly help the bile mechanics of your back and how your body is aligned. That could be causing the problem with irritating that disc as well. If the orthotics don't help and the only thing you can use is a Smith-Machine and that's going to help and you do the Smith-Machine, that's the best you can do. It's better than being laid up injured, right? I mean, at least you're training. So, sometimes we have injuries, we've got to walk around, we'll see we work around. And sometimes we're just making excuses. If you're just making an excuse, it doesn't seem like you are, then that's a problem. But if you have a legitimate reason why you're not doing it and you've tried all the suggestions of other people like I'm asking you telling you right now, get a pair of custom orthotics, then you go and you do your Smith-Machine.

And as always, we thank you for your support. It's going to ask Susie Blaylock, a friend of the show. People are telling you, Bonnie Blaylockers are using a metformin to cut, but doesn't it impair muscle growth or is that not an issue for short-term use? You know, the study show, I'm a big life extension magazine guy, I like it because they do a lot of research there and they always support everything they say with research. And one of the reasons why metformin, which is that helps with blood sugar control, reduces glucose output from the liver and it does a couple of other things. The reason why they've shown that it actually helps with longevity or they think it helps with longevity is because it reduces IGF1 output. IGF1, obviously, is an anabolic hormone that will help build and repair muscle. And by reducing it, it reduces the rates of cancer and people's body. And by doing that, obviously, that won't increase longevity. So we know that high IGF1 levels are not good for living a long time. And for, you know, possibly if you do have cancer in your body, for cancer's recovery, because it stimulates their growth, obviously, you know, how cancer in your body, IGF1 is not an anabolic hormone. So it goes back to the old, what's good for body billing is sometimes not good for your health and what's good for your health is sometimes not good for body billing. So if I was a competitive body builder, I would not be taking metformin right now. Maybe after I retired, if I felt like it was something I wanted to take, I would do it. I don't use it now because I don't think I need it. I don't think, I don't like the gastric or the GIFX of metformin. I'm not against people who use it. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. But if you have a blood sugar issue and you're taking metformin for that, I think you'd better off taking a long act of insulin to manage it and then taking metformin. But if I'm a body builder who's looking to maximize muscle, I would not take metformin. No. I'll go to heartache, bro, Chancho, can you give more of a thorough explanation on why bridging is not ideal to gain size. I've seen really big physiques that were achieved with cruising glass cycles and don't even want. I hate the word cruising and blasting and I don't know. Maybe I'm just a shell on my age here. It's almost annoying. It's like people make up cool sounding, you know, I guess you could say, colloquialism to make it cool to do what you shouldn't be doing. Look, if you're doing a cycle for six months, okay, to grow. And it worked and you put on 20 pounds, whatever, whether it may be 12 of that as muscle, the rest is water, whatever the case may be, and it worked. And you did a had a nice cycle and you're not going to compete this year, okay. If you go off to clean your body out, why would you stay on anivar or bridge it with anivar or even like a little bit of testosterone? Why? Why not just go off everything? Clean your body out. Number one, you're going to detox perfectly. Now the anabolic receptors, the energy and receptors that are weak, we know are not, they're found on the nucleus of the cell itself. So inside the cell is a little brain. The DNA is in there. And these receptors are on the nuclear membrane. Come on, these energy and bind to this, it tells the body, obviously, build more muscle, okay. But these receptor numbers, the more they're over-stimulated or over-saturated with testosterone, another anabolic state, they downgrade themselves. Just like anything would, okay. It doesn't want to be overwhelmed. That's why they steroids don't work as well as when you first take them the first four and six weeks. They still work, but they downgrade, okay. In women, women don't produce very much testosterone, with talking small small amounts. So their energy and receptor density is very high. Meaning they have a lot of receptors so that those receptors can recognize the small amount of testosterone that's floating around their blood. When you take a large amount of steroids, over what your body naturally produces, what we call a pharmacological amount, okay. The receptors will downgrade. Now when you go off a cycle, okay, if you stay on some steroid, those receptor numbers are not going to come back to the degree that they should or that you would want them to. However, if you take away everything and you know what's going to happen, after four weeks of off all of these steroids, you're going to go down to almost zero, okay. Because your body's not going to even with HCG in clom, but it's not going to turn itself back on initially, very high amounts. You'll get a little bit production. So the body now, these receptors, okay, on this, these energy receptors are being exposed in very low levels of energy now. For whether it be six to eight weeks however long you're going to go off. That's usually I recommend eight weeks off. And what they're going to do is these receptors now, we're going to think that there's not enough receptor. It's not going to understand that your testosterone level is super low. So it's going to start producing more and more and more and more energy receptors. After six to eight weeks, you're going to have maximum amount of the energy receptors back. Now you're going to go back on cycle. Oh, cookie monster. He agrees with me. Oh, oh. You're going to have maximum energy receptors now at the six to eight weeks. When you go back on cycle, you're going to get a very, very big antibody boost. I think the mistake people make is they don't go off. They stay on some testosterone. Their engine receptor is really don't regenerate much. Although they do detox their body because they're off of most of the stuff that they were on. And then they go back on and they grow a little bit, but they don't really get the maximum results. And over, you do this year, a year, a year, after three to five years, your body shot, you're not growing anymore. Trust me, you're not going to lose anything in six to eight weeks. Every year of my career, I went off for eight to ten weeks. Except one year, and that was the year I had terrible results from 97 to 98. I was doing a lot of gasposing, and I just kind of stayed on a little testosterone. I bridged and it didn't work well. And I didn't, I had an entire look to my physique. Trust me, go off for six to eight weeks. I promise you, you would not lose any muscle. And when you come back on, you're going to see amazing results. But abroad, Rogers, Dave, have you ever mixed? Trends, T-T and Trend, and they together, just to get the trend into your system faster? I have not. Not tried that myself. Back in my day, there was, there was parable, which was long acting trend alone. And, you know, the second half of my career, there was trendable and acetate, that people were making for you. And I used usually one or the other. I didn't usually use both at the same time, because it was really the same compound. I preferred trend acetate over the, um, the parable, because I found like, I felt like it worked better during contests prep. Offseason, sometimes when I used parable, that became not available anymore. I was using trend alone, acetate, both offseason and pre-contest, you know, I would obviously cycle a lot in off. I personally think that the trend acetate works better. However, people get more side effects with that, because it seems to over-stimulate the nervous system more so than the trend, the long acting trends do. And then when you over-stimulate the nervous system, you, some people have, you know, digestive problems, some people get chronic hiccups from it, some people have trouble sleeping and that's usually the sub one of the main side effects you can't fall asleep in it. Once you fall asleep, you go be as very hard to fall asleep. Anger aggression, obviously all those other things. And of course, high blood pressure. Try and acetate really can spike your blood pressure pretty high and you got to be careful of that, because that could damage your kidneys. So these are things you want to side one and often these are things you want to take into account. Probably retrospectively, if I was looking back, I probably would do the long acting trend on the offseason, save the trend acetate for the, you know, the last six to eight weeks before our show. Those good at piney, the destroyer day we've heard you mentioned how any see and milk this look in altar, your blood work. Can you go into a little detail on what it changes and how much of a change it can make? Yeah, I've talked about this before. I feel like I'm being repetitive, but maybe it won't repeating. Milk vessel or silamaring, which is the chemical, it's in milk vessel, that does something, is a dilator to the bile ducts inside the liver. Okay, so the liver produces bile, it dumps the bile into the, it globular, the globular, and then squirts it into the small intestine when you're eating a fatty food meal. Okay, these bile ducts that drain the liver however, also the ducts that deliver uses to detoxify itself. So, when the liver is detoxifying chemicals in the body, whether they be animal oxsteroids or alcohol, whatever, it dumps all the gunk through the bile ducts into the globular, and then that's how you body gets rid of this stuff. However, when the liver is overstressed, it can get inflamed. When the liver gets inflamed, these little bile ducts get pinched off, and now that the gunk can't get out of the liver, it backs up, and you get inflammation, and then over time, you can get fibrodic tissue or scar tissue being laid down essentially, and that will scar the liver over, and that's permanently damaging the liver. So, milk vessel, okay, opens up or dilates these bile ducts and enables the gunk to go through at a much higher rate. It's like, if you have a kinking your hose, it opens up the kinking the hose that the hose can lift the water flow. And so, it's a good thing to use, especially when you're on a cycle, or even when you're trying to detox after a cycle, because you're constantly allowing the liver to push stuff out at maximum amounts without that backup occurring. Anacidal system is a precursor to glutify on which is the main antioxidant of the liver uses for also helping to detoxify these chemicals coming into the liver, while the antioxidant, I mean, all the free radicals that are there that are being produced. So, it's a nice one-two tandem to have together. The milk vessel is the most important component, however, and I really recommend highly. I can make my own, but I recommend Bill Lewellin's Molecular Labs, Liver Stable. I actually sell it at datelumbo.com. I think it's a really good product, and so I've just always backed it rather than try to make my own, which I could. But, you know, when I see good other products out there, I don't mind selling those other products if I think that they're the best out there, and I think he did a good job of it. So, it's something if, you know, when I'm competing or if I was on a cycle, I would be taking it all the time, through an just 65 days year. In the very least, you should certainly take it when you go off-cycle to clean yourself out. Time for two, three more questions, Lavonne, Eugene, Kelhoun, should I stop taking creatine before a show? I tell people to stop it two weeks out, because I think it does cost some fluid retention that sometimes it's hard to get rid of. Plus, when you're dehydrating the last week or so that last couple days before a show, you definitely don't want to be on creatine because the kidneys need fluid, you know, proper hydration to flush the creatine out of the body. So, two weeks before stop it. Bill, you want to be 20. How many calories do you recommend to add weight or size to maintain and to be deficient? I heard John Meadows talking about a 16, 12, 10 approach, 16 to gain, 12 to maintain, and 10 to lose these are calories per body weight. You know what? I do not believe in calories. Obviously, calories are important. You know, you got eating a food, enough energy you need, but I don't believe in calculating things by calories. We're not machines. We know that these calculations do not work, okay? Because depending on whether you're eating protein fat or carbs, your body is going to respond completely different. So, you can't just say increase calories because people will just eat junk food, okay? Or the leek carbs. I would. If you just said, hey, increase your calories, 100, I'm going to eat carbs. That's what I'm going to do. It's not going to, that's like I'm doing it for me. You know, the rate, the rate, the rate, proof on the fact that what you eat doesn't always dictate how you look is by and we just mentioned this before. If you have a high high cortisol level in your body, okay, or you're taking a drug like prednisone, it's going to make you store fat without eating any extra calories whatsoever. Any extra food, your body will just get fat or why? Because this drug has a nutrient partitioning effect that changes, okay, how your body processes food. Likewise, certain people are very carbs sensitive and if you increase their carbon take, they're going to get fat or they're not going to get more muscular. Other people, you add carbs to their diet and guess what? They grow muscle, not because the carbs are building muskers, we know carbs don't build muscle, but because they need more fuel available so that their bodies don't use the protein and fat as a fuel source so they can build muscle. So in every situation it's different. So I don't, there's no formula that works. Mathematically, because we're not machines and everyone is a different type of organism and responds differently. I can eat a lot of different, I can eat McDonald's and I'm going to get lean and I'm going to grow muscle. The next guy eats McDonald's, he's going to turn to a fat slob. So you got to figure out what your body needs and I, you know, as a coach, I ascertained that by how I see your body responding. So if I think that you look really flat and I'm trying to put weight on you, you're probably not eating enough carbs that are producing glycogen in the muscles, so I'm going to increase your carbon take. If you're full and as a house and you're still not getting weight, I'm going to assume you're probably not eating enough protein to add new muscle and I'm going to add proteins to your diet. If that doesn't work, okay, you might not be getting enough essential or enough even just fats in general and then I'll try to increase fats. So it's a trial and error type of thing and each person is a little different. You can't calculate calories because calories tell you nothing quite qualitatively about what you're consuming. Last question from Taylor Vation David, your opinion the best legs in bodybuilding history. Tom Platt's. No, no questions asked. I like to believe that mine were but they were not even close to Tom Platt's. Tom Platt's had the sickest look in legs, the shape of them, the striations. I mean, they were just, I mean, if you, from a purity standpoint, those were perfection. Unfortunately, his upper body didn't match his legs. I don't know if anyone's upper body can match those legs, but I thought that that's the perfect set of legs. That's going to do for this episode of As Dave reminder, new all new iron debate coming up tomorrow and Friday. We're going to have two episodes for you of iron debate. So the show after a hiatus is back again, we can't, we can't tell you who's going to be on the show because that's kind of beaten us in the past before, but we promise you's going to be worth your time. It's going to be worth your watch and it's going to be really, really compelling and compelling to beat compelling compelling topics. For Tyler Schoen-Dapetal and Bolt, I'm so the for review, we'll see you next time.

gains on work conservative TRT dosesDo you think they could have reached that level of muscularity if they'd only ever taken the TRT doses or is there an advantage to blasting and maintaining that muscularger with the TRT? Yeah, you can grow that big just on like 200 million euros as his social media is not going to happen but once you have that, when I decided I wasn't going to compete anymore and I went on to TRT I just went away from my site and I went on to 200 million euros testosterone weight I didn't lose anything I was saying about 260 270 I had to cut back my food intake I had to stop training as heavy It took a long time for me to lose that weight and it wasn't until I went off the TRT completely that I was able to actually bring my weight down to where I wanted to which was under 200 pounds so it's not so easy to lose muscle once you had it it's hard to get the muscle but once you have it if you lift heavy and you eat right you can maintain it really easily Let's go to end my co-init It's a question about toxicity What is the solution for NMR or a superdolchanticity on the body? He said he tried apples out of vinegar is just not helpful anymore What was the toxicity in the toenailment? for NMR or a superdolchanticity? NMR and comparing NMR and a superdolchanticity comparing Sianai and Tiktak There's no comparison NMR has very little toxicity superdolchanticity superdolchanticity can deliver to big difference you could take NMR or probably you're around even though it's 17th of South-19th it's not a toxic compound where a superdolchanticity can take it for six weeks and you can be joined and some people who are prone to it My advice and I've said it a million times you don't have to agree with me there's no reason to be taking these toxic superdolchanticity or all this compounds like anodrol if you're a bodybuilder the strength guys like it because it gives them and they don't take it for a long period the time they like the strength that it gives them but for bodybuilders it kills your head these harsh orals kill your appetite like superdrol like anodrol like methyl testosterone there's no reason to take them the hardest oral I ever took early in my career was dianibal because for some reason dianibal it must not be as strong because it doesn't kill your appetite anything that blunts your appetite you don't want to eat you have to believe that it's doing something to deliver that the liver does not enjoy it's overstressing the liver to the point where the liver doesn't want to send out the right signals when I would take anodrol I felt terrible on it and I didn't want to eat I was strong but I didn't want to eat and if you can't eat enough protein and fat and carbs you're not going to grow obviously so this is ridiculous and then I realized you know what this so many great injectable antibiotics why am I even worried about these orals we become from a pill pop culture people like the pop pills they think it works better so that's why guys take the orals but in reality you don't need them it's good to get strong and they do believe there is a limit of how much the body can absorb from injectables I've seen some research that 125 mg is the limit or compound while injecting and anything more and that's just because waste and bile in the liver of his liver that's like saying that you know you can only absorb 30 grams of protein per meal obviously that's not the case because the more muscle you have and you're better than the more protein you can absorb because your body is only going to absorb protein wise what it means to use so if you're 2,300 pounds and you're breaking down a lot of muscle you're better than you need to a lot more protein it's going to absorb more if you're 120 pounds and you're eating 350 grams of protein the body just needs to know that protein it's probably going to get rid of a lot of it or won't absorb it so it's the same thing with drugs you know not everyone needs the same amount of a box you know to say that you only can absorb 125 mg in a shot who made up that rule you know you could anything you inject into your body you know storightly speaking you're going to absorb what your body does with it is another story is it going to convert to estrogen or DHT is it going to just break it down and eliminate it like I said earlier there's only so many engine receptors so if you're taking too much drug that's getting into your bloodstream your body's going to inactivate the drug because there's nothing for the drug to bind to anymore and that's how you know you're wasting your time and usually when you start taking and more than your body needs you start to get like symptoms like almost like a flu-like symptom because your immune system is starting to hyper respond to all this drug this foreign body that's there it's too much so when you start feeling like that you know you're taking too much you got to back it down first I'm certainly though we've had I guess this type of question on this show mushroom any of your clients have been quiet about this but it is irrelevant one especially when the times are living in now is from muscle machine now his question is if you test positive to COVID can you start your cycle or is it better to wait so I'll take it to set further in your Indian or I guess what you discussed research what would be the correlation between COVID taking anything short-term long-term is there relationship positive-negative aware you know if anything I think that anabolic star is probably helping if you had COVID with recovery but the truth is that if you feel like I have a client who said who tested positive for two he feels absolutely fine he has no symptoms he I don't know what he was the doctor they said I will just test you he's like sure no symptoms hey should I work out that day if you don't find it go work out we don't even know if a positive test result means anything we don't even know if it means you have an active case or not or you had it already no one really knows or from what I'm reading everyone carries little strands of this DNA that you can find that in this virus so we might actually have the virus particles in us or segments of DNA that they're testing so they're really not testing for a virus testing when they do this polymerase test the testing for segments of DNA and a lot of people just had those in their body anyway so you could test positive and not have an active case of the virus that's been established already so if you feel good and you feel strong even if you test it positive and you want to train especially your gym I don't know if I would go and expose anyone else just in case you are at you know contagious do it not can self-att if you feel terrible don't push yourself obviously because you could make yourself worse so if you feel sick lay in bed do it you got to do the recover take your multi-vitaminate you know immune system and get over the thing and then you can go back to the gym but if you feel great and just because you got a positive test not can self-attach go train if you want that's going to do for this episode of ass-day reminder right now on speciesentrition.com the link is below

After hours from last night, Dave doing his reaction video on the big news, Dave and that's what we'll start with the Arnold Classic. We also touched on Flex Loomis who made his announcement of a leave late last week about why he was not going to be competing at this upcoming Olympia, but speaking of the Olympia and the upcoming Arnold Classic, who was reported, I don't know if an official announcement has been made yet, but it's been reported that this 2021 Arnold Classic will in fact be a qualifier for the 2021 Mr. Olympia previously. It was a qualifier for the 2022 Mr. Olympia. Yeah, what I found that was a little weird was that I reached out to Bob Lormo, who usually always texted me back pretty quickly and he didn't confirm anything. I haven't seen anything announced on the Arnold page, who were going on secondhand information that other people have been reporting on other sites. It doesn't matter. I really don't even think it matters. I think it should be a qualifier for this here. It just makes sense. I don't know why. If there was a show a weekend before the Olympia, it was a qualifier for the Olympia. If it happened a weekend after the Olympia, then it was a qualifier for the next year. I don't know why they started doing this one month out type of cutoff. I thought maybe they did because they wanted to book flights more easily and have everything set up. How many extra people really qualified that last week or two? Not netty. I don't know why they do that. But if they look, if they do do or they do make the Arnold this year or qualifier for the Olympia, I think that's a great idea. Probably most of the people will be qualified. I think the only person in that list would be probably a really winkler. I know Sergio is competing before that. I'm sure it's not depending on the Arnold or qualifier, especially with that line up there. It would be a really winkler qualifier really is what it would amount to. We might see him before the Arnold anyway. Maybe now he's going to ask it. If you think he's going to be competing before the Olympia class? Maybe now he won't. I would still be nervous because what if he doesn't qualify to the Arnold? What if he has an offer show or something like that? There's no other opportunity. He couldn't compete last year. It would be really rolling the dice to the bank on that one show. The second biggest show that you're going to be mistaken is part of. Well, it is going to up the stage a little bit. It's going to up the entertainment aspect of the event. Of course, we're talking about September 25th. It is July 14th now. So before you know, we're going to be starting our coverage of the Arnold classic hour road to the 2021 Arnold classic. A lot of exciting things on that front. Then it's going to be the 2021 Olympia. So it's going to be a lot of breaking a gaction between August, September and October. Let's go to the questions. The first two questions from the Dave Lumbo experience. I have the first question. Dave, I'm on your pre-contest diet with little cards before training 30 grams. But I'm losing weight so fast and the competition still for months. What can I do? Increase carbs in another meal or take one day full on carbs with all meals with carbs. You know, when I see a guy losing too fast or a woman losing too fast. But I usually said to do a throw a couple of cheat meals in there. Rather than start messing with the diet right away. Because sometimes people lose really quick in the beginning because they're getting their bodies get rid of junk weight very fast. So what I'll do is like rather than just do a once a week cheat meal, I might say in the words if someone sends me an update today, I lost three pounds from yesterday. I'm going to be like tonight. I want you to have a double quarter pound or with fries, you know, an update in the morning. If they're weight stabilizes, then I know they're good for a couple of days. If it doesn't stabilize, then I might do it again. If it still doesn't stabilize that, then I know all you have to cut back their cardio or it needs to increase their food intake at every meal. Because they're just not eating enough. Most of the time the cheat meal will stall a little bit and fill them up and get their body right. At some point, usually that massive weight drop stops. What I find is usually the first two to three weeks, you'll see big jumps in weight loss because they're losing, because remember when you'd deplete glycogen out of your muscle, water goes too. That's a lot of weight. You can lose when I was 315 pounds, I think I went down to 285 and like two weeks. So that's, I mean that's thinking about a 30 pounds I lost. Because the bigger you are, the more water you hold, that's just the way it goes. And I did, and to 315, I didn't look like I was holding a lot of fat. I was a little bloated though in the face and my tissues were a little full. Once the glycogen came out of the muscles with the water, then obviously I dropped some weight. So I wouldn't panic right away, but I would definitely, you know, if you need to throw those cheat meals in there to kind of, you know, balance off your metabolism a little bit, there's nothing wrong with that. Second question again from the D.F. Lumbo Experience app. How large of a role do you think hormones play in fat storage? I think they have a huge role. I mean, the perfect example and Dr. Scott Conley loves to give this example. You know, you know, you have a person on a diet that's like icicle or, you know, isomate and insuffusion on a call. And there was whatever they're eating is being used to repair muscle and fuel their body, but they're not gaining or losing weight. And you throw give them prednisome because maybe they had some kind of neuromune issue, chronic inflammatory type disease like Crohn disease, and all of a sudden they start getting fat. And they might even lose some muscle. And think about it, they're doing nothing different. They're training the same, they're eating the same. They're just adding this hormone because certain hormones are what we call positive partition, nutrient partitioning agents, and some hormones are negative partitioning agents. And the negative partitioning agents make you gain fat. The positive partitioning agents will make you build muscle and use stored body fat as a fuel source. And a ball of steroids will do that. At a ball of steroids like prednisone are negative partitioning agents. They actually just make your body store fat because they raise blood sugar. So yes, hormones dictate a lot of about what's going on. Obviously, if you thyroid hormone is often, that's a huge problem that a lot of people have because they're running their little hypo thyroid. They're metabolic processes are not moving into the right rate. It's almost like having a factory that doesn't have enough power for the factory. And because the factory can generate a tremendous amount of output, but if you don't have enough energy to run the factory, then it doesn't work. And the thyroid hormone is kind of like the thermostat there that will keep the factory running its ideal temperatures. So yes, hormones absolutely without a doubt will influence how you look.

Once some open-class bodybuilders who retire use, sometimes your quote, I got too big and ruined my waistline. Couldn't those guys just have died and cut some of the drugs out of their waistline or to get their waistline back? What am I missing? So if you want to talk about, I guess, you know, blowing out those lines and I guess what they could have done to avoid that. You know, I thought a lot about this, too. I used to, I ate a lot of food back in the day, but you know what? I'm almost of the belief that I don't necessarily know if the drugs and the food ruin their waistline as much as Father Time did and genetics, because, you know, in order to get that big, okay, let's, I might use myself as an example, because I wasn't a pro. Let's use Ronnie Coleman as an example. Ronnie was eating an enormous amount of food and training with enormously heavy weights and his waistline was great, his body looked great, okay? And people don't realize that he won his first Olympi, he was in his early 30s, you know, he wasn't young. So by the time he got to the end of his reign, he was already in the 40s, you know, and when you get to that late 30s, 40s, things start to, you know, you lose the elasticity of the, of the fashion around your abdominal area, whether you eat a lot of food or whether you train really heavy or not, okay? Looking flex wheeler, he saw his really tiny waist, he always ate a lot of food and trained heavy, he was big, you know, he was, his frame, he was huge, he was like 260 on stage. So, to the end of his career, he, any term pro at 218. So, and his waistline didn't look work bad for him to me. So, I think what happens is your genetic structure is your genetic structure and as you get older, it deteriorates and breaks down a little bit and you lose the elasticity of your skin and the fashion sheets that surround the muscles stretch out and I don't necessarily think it's a drug issue because I see when guys go off drugs, it kind of reverses. Like, you know, I had a lot of problems with distension, I'm like, I had a very short torso in my midsection and my waist is small now and it's my stomach flat, you know, so I reversed it somehow and I don't have loose skin on my abdominal area. So, I don't, I don't buy into it. I think it's just genetics at at a certain level, you know, your body can only handle, you know, I wouldn't say, you know, my body, I don't have the tightness of the skin that I had when I was younger and I don't have the kind of like that fresh looking muscle that you see on like a Nick Walker, but age is what ravages us really and some guys, age better than others, Dexter did a pretty good job aging, you know, although his midsection also wasn't what it was. Phil heat wasn't and I don't think Phil doesn't look at the kind of guy that was abusing a lot of performance enhancing drugs. He wasn't a he, I'm super heavy trainer. He didn't, he wasn't an over eater. So, you know, why would happen to his waist? He just got older, you know, and that's what happens, I think. And so, you know, I think people just, you know, they get carried away with the fact they want to blame something. Oh, yeah, he was a good champion, but he ruined himself. No, I think, you know, the guy won fucking seven Olympias, Ronnie won eight Olympias, you know, they obviously had a lot of time during that rain that they looked amazing. That's why people don't last forever, you know, body building is a very short live sport. You can only have that peak look to your body with a good quality muscle before you start tearing things and things start, you lose elasticity in your skin and things just go wrong. I mean, that's just what happens, especially when you walk around in 300 pounds, you know, all the time. It's a big strain on your body. So, I think the question, the answer to the question is that, you know, I don't think that it's the drugs necessarily in the overeating and the food that did it as much as it is the person's genetics and old age. Let's go to G, more of Gano, your opinion on taking a test E while on ketosis, your recommendation. Yeah, you know, I always say that, you know, drugs, excuse me, the diet, supplementation, and training is very standard. Okay, whether you're a natural body, builder or you're an enhanced athlete, it's very important. I think sometimes the natural athlete have their diets down and their supplementation better because they don't really can't depend on drugs. So, they're really like almost like OCD at researching what they need to eat and how they have to train properly. That's why a lot of those guys when they do switch on to using PEDs, they make amazing, amazing games because they have well trained muscle, they had a supplement, they had a train and that's something that a lot of people just take for granted that that's really important. So, when you add tests, whatever, an athlete in or any kind of drugs into a regimen, whether you're on a ketogenic diet or you're in a non-ketogenic diet, all drugs do as make things work better. So, to answer your question, adding, you know, test an athlete or whatever he wants to add into his ketogenic diet, it's just going to make it work better. That's all. Magnificent, marvelous Maria, if you were happy to go against Lonnie Coleman in the challenge round for anyone, O's, which pose it to be. Side try, sir. Gustavo Badell showed that right off the bat and that was Ronnie's worst pose. That was Gustavo's best pose. I don't think it was my best pose, but it was a good pose. But I wouldn't want to go against Ronnie in any pose, that's how good running ones. But yeah, that was Ronnie's worst pose, everyone knew it. You know, the funny thing was another really bad pose for Ronnie was the front last bread and it wasn't because it was a bad pose because he had a huge lat and huge legs. He just didn't have to hit the pose. He hit it like a most musco, like he was like flexing into it. But his side try said, I don't know why he had problems and I think he just Ronnie wasn't the greatest poseer and I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that he was so big or the fact that maybe he just, you know, he just didn't have the mind muscle connection because I'm sure he practiced because Ronnie was a consummate professional. He just wasn't that good at hitting the mandatory. And I think it's hard to tell someone who's an eight-time Mr. Olympia, you don't know how to hit the mandatory poses. I don't think anyone ever really worked with him to the degree that a deconstructing what he was doing and then building him up again because I think a lot of his poses could have been better. But he was pretty, but he knew at it. What the poses he was good at, he was so dominant and didn't even matter, you know. Taktu by Tony and I'm sure you're going to be talking about this over the course of the next six months or so. If really comes in at his all-time best condition, do you think he could beat Ronnie if he comes in with the same shape as last year? I think if Kevin LeRoni could get back to his best that he ever could beat big revenue. I mean it's a hypothetical situation you're asking. I don't know. I mean I've been seeing pictures on Instagram of really recently. He looks like when the Olympia right now. I don't know. I don't know if he's a recent. He's crazy looking. I think the exciting thing about bodybuilding is that in any given day, anyone can beat anyone because you never know who's going to show up in shape. Rulia has had a couple of bat, a run of a couple of bat shows and I think because of that people are kind of this countenium, but that's dangerous because Rulia's got a lot of firepower in his arsenal. He's got more muscle than all these guys. Higher better density muscle, you know, grainy, you know, mature muscle that he's developed over 20 years. Randy doesn't have that. So can he beat Randy? He absolutely can beat Randy but Randy has pretty good structure for a big massive guy and you know Randy's more impressive standing in a lineup and Rulia seems to have trouble peaking from behind. So a problem Randy had too. So if Rulia can pull it all together he absolutely can win the Olympia. But you know what? To beat Mr. Olympia you've got to knock them off and Randy's a pretty big looking guy. You know, you see Phil Heath up there he's not that big but Randy's huge. You're going to knock Randy off. Randy's going to have to be off a little bit because they're not going to take the Olympia away from Randy if he comes in better than he was last year. Also going to Alex Williamson lamb versus beef as a red meat source for body builders. You know, it's interesting because I don't really have too much access to lamb but I I actually like it, you know, if it's prepared properly. I was a big beef eater in the sense that I used to do for a while I went through a period where I was eating a lot of flares, flaming on, stakes out of guy with my butcher with chopping up into like half pound pieces for me and I would have like one a day or something like that back in the day just for the red meat component. Of course I ate a lot of McDonald's too which was red or just red meat. But I actually had it I don't know if I guess lamb would be I guess you'd get I guess the most the place where I usually would get lamb would be one of those Brazilian meat places where they cut the stuff in front of you there and they come around to the tables and they slice it. That's the the only place I really liked lamb the way they cooked it because it was kind of like that free but lamb could be a little gainy too and it could be a little fatty. So I don't I know a lot of people like that taste I don't really like that gristly taste in my mouth. So for me I would stick to beef if if I was competing today and they didn't have this when I was younger I would go with grass fed beef. I you know I would just buy from them like massive amounts and load my freezer up with it because grass fed beef is actually good for you. It's got it's got more omega-3 fats than a salmon does believe it or not and I would go with grass fed buffalo but we're bisoned they call today and I would go with grass fed beef and I would probably have them chop it up into like you know hamburger me that's that's the easiest to make. I mean you could make that you could make pounds and pounds of that put it in some top of where our containers or break it up into like half pound things and just leave it in top where and you're refrigerated. When the day comes you know in the morning you get those top where out you warm them up or I like whole food I would just mash those things up. I throw fresh you know cooked minute rice in there some soy sauce on there maybe a handful of like nuts in there or you know some macadamia nut oil and that I'd have like five meals made in 10 minutes and that's how I used to do with stuff like that's how I would prepare my food but I would definitely go with the grass fed nowadays even if I had to spend a little bit more money. It's good to cook Robinson odd if you want to answer this as far as when you were competing post competition career across the time you're like the most water you drink in a day or a week so I don't know if you want to break it up as far as yeah yeah I was never a water loader like I know these people like that would do three gallons you know water day and it's for like two days and they go down to two gallons and one gallon I never what I never measured what first of all I believe that you drink too much water number one you can water down your electrolytes and you can cause cramping for you mature because when you drink down a quarter and your kidneys have to flush it out which is by the way a big strain of your kidneys so if you have if you have high creatinine you don't want to be drinking excessive amounts of water but if you drink that much water your body has to release some sodium with the water to get it out of the body and so you can water down your electrolytes to the point where you're cramping so I never really I knew that was not the right thing to do so I never really overdrive I hate to admit it because it's it's but it's the truth when I would diet I would drink mass of amounts of fluid because I was so hungry but a lot of it was in the form of coffee diet you know so it is and stuff like that because I just I I I didn't want to cheat and so I would drink a lot of that I mean I was literally in the bathroom every ten minutes ping personally also from what I've read recently that I didn't really know this back in the day you know if you drink too much out of meal theoretically you can water down your your digestive enzymes in your stomach too which might make it harder especially if you're eating a very high protein meal so when I when I now when I am if I eat a meal I'll sip whatever I'm drinking whether it be coffee or water or you know I mean I'll evolve you know I'll I'll sip that while I'm eating just to keep my mouth wet but I don't really drink a lot of fluid I'll drink it before the meal I drink it after the meal and between meals but I don't drink massive amounts of fluid during the meals when you train that's probably when you want to drink most of your water especially if you're dieting but I wouldn't like I said there's no reason to over drink let's go to ballal hummide is there any difference between an injectable clan as opposed to the pill form will be the advantage I think they're absorbed pretty much the same I don't think I don't do any problems with absorbing oral clumbia role so it's not like like some drugs are hard to absorb orally I think clumbia role is pretty easy so I don't think there's any need to do injectable clumbia role I personally never used injectable clumbia role I've seen it and you would think it would be you know pretty very precise because you're putting exactly what you want into into your body but like I said it's not that much of available out there you know the the water you know the the clumbia role that comes in bottles that people make on these and selling these peptide sites that's not injectable that's to be squirted in your mouth it's just it's just clumbia role suspended in water so you actually measure it and then you just kind of squirt in your mouth and you swallow it very few people that I've known have have injectable clumbia role I know it's in Canada they have a life they use it on the horses or some kind of animals up there because it seems to be more readily available in Canada and they also have that there's like a liquid suspension to have clumbia role which a real one that's made but you by you know a real veterinary in place that they get to the animals up there the feed which we don't have here in the United States so like I said I mean it all works the same if you as only you know how to measure 20 micrograms that's the dose you should be taking now how many times they're taking it just depends on you know what you're up to and who's coaching you and how you administer but Columbia all shows be taken in 20 micrograms so just let's go to low-tay um sumo deadlift versus regular deadlift I have a long torso and regular deadlift don't feel right but sumo feels better how different are the two from one another you know the sumo deadlift you know where you kind of stand and you know you like you're pointing your toes that you can't really see my feet and you really wide and you're pulling I like wide stance but I think sumo is almost too much and so like I like to keep toes pointing forward and I like to go a little wider than shoulder width so it's still wide and then I can grab the bar inside rather than going outside and I think you're stronger like this and I and when I come down I pull this way and I'm driving for my hips my glutes my adductors which is what you want to hit with um with deadlift I think when you're too close you're almost like you're leaning over so much that you're using your lower back too much and I think it could it could it could actually cause injuries it really puts that lower back those spinal rectus and very compromised position and I don't think it's giving the deadlift you're not really building quads and deadlifts okay you're building you glutes and outer sweep the legs a little bit of a doctor and you're also obviously working those traps and those lumbars which run down the middle you're back you're thickening all that up so it's a compound movement you're not just working your back when you're doing deadlifts and you're not just working your leg you work you work your whole body that's why it's such a good mass builder because like squats which you have to kind of balance the bar and the weight you're building mass on your entire body it's one of those that's why when you're trying to grow and develop density and thickness from side to side those movements are our imperative you cannot replace those with machines people show me these squat machines there's no way you get in the same thing out of that they have like a deadlift machine too you can kind of it looks like almost like a shrug machine but it's you pick the you grab the weight on the ground and it's good if you have injuries when you come and back to them but I wouldn't be doing that on a regular basis we'll take this question and then we have a couple of fairly deep philosophical ones uh just a silly in 83 why if you want to kind of go through the mechanics of science but why is the body so prime after a show to grow? Well because you're essentially starving and even though you're eating six times a day you're essentially starving it because you're under eating with the body needs so the body is in this conservation mode of trying to hoard everything because you're you're starving and pushing it and and getting rid of every little bit so when the body wants to store and I'm not just told I'm not telling that story fat I'm told I'm telling that story like it's in storing muscle you know protein in the muscle as muscle it's actually in a complete hoarding mode now after the show is over you put back a tremendous amount of nutrients okay and that's this is the key you want to put that good quality nutrients that your body can use to build and repair muscle if you just eat sugar after a show you're just going to get bloated okay but if you give your body a lot of big meals with high protein good essential fatty acids in there high quality carbs to low glycogen you're going to grow because all that's going to go into the muscle and the muscles is going to say we better store this all and build extra muscle because we don't know when we're going to be fat again you know because the bodies in this like starvation mode everything the energy and receptors is super recessed everything's ready to go and and you'll see you'll put on muscle right after showing and the heart of you dieted and the leaner you got the more you'll the better your rebound will be and you don't have to even be this is one this is another question I get should I stay on like a cycle for another eight weeks after a show and my answer always is I've tried it both ways no because I'll tell you why first of all if you do it if you do it a big show and you're on a good amount of gear that gear isn't leaving your system so quickly you're going to have that in your body for three to four weeks probably close to the four weeks post the show so you got plenty of drugs in the system when you stop taking all those antibiotics and you go to like a PCT while your body still is depleting all those antibiotics anybody your appetite is going to go through the roof and you're going to feel good and your body's systems are going to work efficiently because now you're not pumping a lot of drugs into you which is creating toxicity remember when your body is working to detoxify and break down antibiotics steroids and everything else you're taking that takes away a priority to building muscle because your body doesn't warm the building muscles the last priority if you body however if everything else is being taken care of and there's no toxicity in the body no toxic load your appetite's going to be great and you're going to grow great and that's what I noticed I'd go off the drugs I feel so good my body is so clean but meanwhile I still have all this drug in my system I'm just not adding you know more on top of it and I get a good four week rebound of growth and in that four weeks you could put almost 10 pounds of muscle on maybe so I've seen guys put more on and then by the time you hit week four you're still on PCT now you're going to clean out you know now you're going to let your body do nothing for four weeks okay so those receptors now see no testosterone and there's no drug left in the system and those receptors are going to like boost themselves through the roof those angers and receptors because they like this drug is no testosterone there's nothing maybe we don't have enough receptors more make more receptors make more receptors make more receptors make more receptors make more receptors and of course after a while you body after a couple weeks your body catches on by by that time though now your eight weeks off after a show you've been on no drugs you've gained you know 15 20 pounds of weight of scale weight maybe you've gained you know seven eight pounds of muscle and now you're going back on okay and now boom you get another rebound as you go back on and all those drugs hit those receptors that are all renewed and now you're going to grow so you're creating a rebound in a very precise manner and I like I said I've experimented with all the different ways of doing it staying on cycle not and I'm telling you you go off do your PCT a week after the last shot the that first four weeks you're off you get that beautiful animal boost and and waking and muscle gain you clean out for four weeks during that time it's not that bad it's only four weeks your receptors completely regenerate themselves your body cleans all the toxins out of your body and then you go back on you get a second rebound when you go back on and those drugs start working with all those receptors now that you have that you didn't have before and boom you grow again you could put 20 pounds on you know in the first two months or first three months after a show's over and just by the first rebound and in the second boost when you go back on cycle so that that's what I recommend you do. You don't have to listen to me I'm just telling you I've done it every way possible that this is the best way and it's the best way for health too because you're cleaning yourself out too. So these two I'm going to sort of pack it into one because um you know this is going to be something that you need you're going to want to just as far as it's essentially going to be the same message that you're going to deliver. So the first one is from a booby bobby track lord who I didn't know obviously we're just reading this now but uh his mother recently passed away two months ago you very close with her um says that everything is felt really lackluster since that point any life advice on how not to feel like total crop and I mean before going to the next one just you know our warmest warmest wishes to you and your family obviously you've been a big contributor to our ex muscle and this show in particular uh but that aside and you know breaks our heart to see that how close he was with his mother and uh for that to happen so we send our deepest prayers during your family the second most from uh Ivan banyanats uh during your competitive career you have any days where you just felt like you lost a passion for this sport when you felt like you were wasting your time and if so how did you deal with that? You know I've said this before and um you know I don't know people listen maybe some people do maybe some people don't but first of all I want to send my condolences because I there's nothing I'm gonna say that it's gonna make you feel better about losing your mother obviously but I will tell you this the time does heal all wounds and eventually that the pain will go all subside sometimes it's good I don't know if it's good I deal I dealt with a lot of emotional pain in my life whenever I had a emotional by diety I know it sounds ridiculous but when you're on a contest I don't care about anything I want you care about his food and it almost numbs you and I don't know if that's good not to experience the emotions that you're feeling but that's how I got through it unfortunately and uh I don't you know sometimes if the grief is so severe I recommend that people go talk to a Councillor because that's Sometimes they can walk you through that and you can kind of release your grief while you're with them rather than take it out on the people that your friends with and love ones in a negative fashion. That's another one. But what I recommend people to always do is have not just one thing that you love to do, but more than one thing. Two or three things. I always have three things going at the same time. I have bodybuilding. I have my love of breeding animals and reptiles and snakes and all that stuff I'm doing now. And of course I have my kids, that's my third thing. No matter how what's going on, if I'm having a bad day with bodybuilding or something going wrong, I'll go downstairs and I'll start cleaning snake tubs. Sometimes I have a bad, you know, the snake seasons I go and go and I'm not getting the reproduction I want. Maybe there's a, I have a couple of six snakes and it's, you know, I'm just like, I don't even want to go down there. I'm kind of sick of the whole big, I'll go and I'll play with my kids, you know, and they'll pull me out of it because they're always in a good mood. You know, I'll come in here and I'll pull some markers out. I'll start drawing or do some art or something like that and do it all like, you gotta find something that kind of gives you pleasure. And sometimes it's, you have to walk away from the thing that you love most. Now all of us here, the thing we have in common is that we love bodybuilding, right? I mean, we love training, we love competing, getting bigger and getting lean. And sometimes it's just, it's just, you look in the mirror and you're like, I look like fucking shit. You know, what am I doing in the sport, wasted all my money, I'm, I'm, I'm drugs and supplements and food and wasting all my time. You know, I look terrible. You know, I guarantee you wake up tomorrow morning and you're going to look at you completely different. Don't, if you haven't one of those days, don't look in the mirror, put a sweatshirt on and go do something else. That's the best thing I can recommend. If you're having a tough time because you've lost a family member or a girlfriend, a boyfriend broke up with you, then do something different. It gives you pleasure. Okay. Take yourself out of that thought process. Because if you dwell on the negative, you get more of the negative. And we get what we think about whether we wanted or not. Unfortunately, that's the, the law of attraction, that's how our universe works. So think about what you do want, okay? Think about that. Even if you don't have it, even if you think about what you want, fantasize, close your eyes, you know, land the couch, imagine yourself winning the lottery and what would you do with the money? It doesn't even matter if it ever manifests or happens or not. It doesn't matter. Think about it. Think about the feelings of what you feel when you're doing it. Think about what it would be like to be on the Mr. Olympia stage, posing down against, you know, all the top body bills, big ranny and winning bone-ac and, and, and really, make book. Even if, even if, if they're making a beautiful, any reality, think about that because that will make you attract anything and everything that will help you be the best body bill that you can be. Even if you never get to that level. Okay? My goal in life was always, in life. My goal in body bill is when I got involved was to be able to make a living for myself doing this where I wouldn't have to go work a job at a law office or, you know, as a medical, whatever, doctor or whatever, you know, I was a medical school for a while. I didn't want to have to work or I wanted to be my own, my own boss. So to speak, I, or I, or I, I didn't, my working for someone else was going to pay me to work out or do something related to that. And that's all I thought about. I was consumed with it. And I thought that it had, I thought that in order to achieve that, I had to become a provotty builder. And I realized at some point that it didn't even matter if I got a pro-card, did not. Because I was already making a living. I was doing exactly what, what, what I wanted, you know, I never had these fantasies of being, you know, walking on stage as Mr. Olympia. I just thought that it was necessary to get to that level to make a good living, doing what I like to do every day. But that's not the case. So think about what you want, even when you're in a bad situation emotionally or mentally, psychologically. And I promise you, you will pull out of it. I promise you, when you wake up the next morning. Sometimes I just go to bed early and say, you know, I can't think about this anymore. I turn my phone off. I put it aside. I said, not looking at another social media page, going to sleep. And I wake up in the morning completely refreshed and I feel much better. So give it a shot. On that note, that is going to do for this episode of As Dave Reminder right now on the channel.

If watching someone sit on a hammer machine for five minutes between sets playing with their phone, pisses you off, you are definitely old school. OSBBC.com for the hardest training athletes. I'll have it three and a half. Stay with me, I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! I'll have it! Welcome back to After Hours. I am Dave Palabo joined as always by the entire WAC pack. John Romano, Greg Valentino, and guys that I can say you didn't know, a Mr. G supposedly is poised to health his press conference with Big Lenny. Very shortly. I think we should support it 100%. We have a cameraman out there? No, of course not. Yeah. I wouldn't even send Tyler out, I'll tell you why, because I don't trust them. They're very unreliable, those guys. That includes Mr. G and Big Lenny and crew. It's not in rely on loads of they won't do it. Who knows if they got a shot while up on time? There's always so many problems. Someone gets arrested. They got too much going on. Well, Mr. G should have somebody just do it on their phone. They got their phones there. I told Rob Zilla, we do in this press conference. Mr. G, I think he wants to do it from his phone. I'd rather you do it from your phone, Rob. I said, because probably the lens is a lot cleaner on your phone. It's probably gonna save you from the love that. Because he's got a new phone and it still looks like this. Who's with George? Who's with George? Is Mike, what am I going to make? I think it's his, the right is quiet. The rich client who has the house down there in Boka. Oh, that makes everything nice. When you get a serious rich client. I'm the one that introduced him to Mike. I met him in C-side heights. He was right at actually talking to him. Mike is not the client as not as quiet. He's like a fan in the show. He came up to me, rose promptly, gas. And then I told George was around him, Mr. G. Because no way. So I told George, George went over there. And now he's got a best friend. So in the meantime, we got to talk about Jimmy to ball. Yes, so where is going on with him? You said he's having problems? Yeah, well, you know, my wife's going out of town for a week. And so I thought, you know, what a good time to invite him down and hang out. You know, we can take the motorcycles out, ride around. He'd love that, you know? Right. The big lake and summertime. I, there's a, there's a drift jam coming up. You know, where you tie to all the boats up and they get high. So I haven't seen a regular music on the lake. It's freaking awesome. So he's, he's, yeah, yeah, I'll do that. I'll just a good idea. I'm going to do that. That's a good idea. I'm going to, I'll make that happen. And this is this is three four five conversations over text. I tell you, you know, he likes to talk, you know, he's all school. So I'm around the phone. You know, yeah, I'm going to do that. That's a good idea. I hated it up there, fucking hated it. You haven't done this. I had to do that. You should have what happened today. And he's on it and on it. So just come on down relax for a good time, right? So yeah, he's gonna come. And he likes to drive too. That's the funny thing. It's not like he doesn't like to drive, you know? It's not that bad to drive. I mean, he did it before, but I'm saying he likes it. It's not like he's one of these guys like my father who doesn't want to go anywhere. Right, and this time he'd come in his, I keep and told him rent the car. It's the best way to go. You'd be driving a brand new car, you know? Down, right? And if you had a good idea to put the wear and tear on a cheap, you know? So he's like, you know, he's all about that. And then this is like almost a done deal. Of course, I did say it in the Valerie yet because I know Jimmy last minute who's gonna say I'm not gonna say it in the Valerie. And which he did. So, you know, but under the guys of, yeah, I'm out of time here, John, you know, here I'll tell you really a text, you know? He says, he gets to, you know, his John gets depressed and then he, he's gonna be a fool. So he'll snap out of, you know, go to a bar and he'll meet some girl and then he snaps out of it, you know, for a couple days. John, sorry, I didn't call. I'm going through some times. I'm going through some times here. I'll buzz you this afternoon if that's okay. I respond, sure, absolutely brother, call me whenever. You know, I'm free all afternoon actually. I was gonna, I was, my mom was in Florida. So, yeah, he doesn't call, nothing. There's today still so far, nothing. He had come in. And that's how. What, I don't understand the, the, the, the instant tense bitching and mourning and hatred he has for where he is. And then here you, me and of Greg could do, he would also, we are offering him an option. You know, you know, oh, I see. So scared, we do scared. When is it going to old school, a tiny thing, no, they bitch about everything? You know what I mean? I think a lot of brothers were all brothers. Don't you think it, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? Of course I do. I just finished saying you guys are family. Yeah, of course. But that's the way he is. You know, he is fucking, you know, he's crazy. He's always on the edge of the slightest little thing. You know, it breaks my heart because he's miserable. When, when Jimmy is on, when Jimmy's on, what? You know, it is entertaining person on the planet. Greg is the same way, except Greg doesn't complain. Like so. Greg would do great and Florida, but he's not complaining about where he is. He's just, he's just comfortable there. So he doesn't need to say anything. Jimmy doesn't really want to be where he is. That's the funny thing. Anyone do anything. He's dead. He's dead. He has everybody, all his friends. I know Jimmy, if he went to Florida, he'd be there for probably a month. And then he'd be like, I gotta go back. I gotta go back. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He would be the main room to town in two months. I don't know, he's got his daughters up here and he's got a lot of oil. He doesn't even see his daughter. He's in with that crow, you know? They'd rather come down here and see him. That's when they told him. I like the mix. Since. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I think he needs an intervention. Yeah. Well, hey, what? Lee Priest was freaking out there today. My girlfriend, you know, Texas him a lot. They go back and forth. He's funny though. He was taking the show. My girlfriend is bats that they have over the area. He's trying to film him at night. This is giant bats. They look at their side. They're like, uh, we call it foxes. He's like, we're wings and shitting out. He's him and my girlfriend are going back and forth about this. And then he starts, you know, he was just about Jimmy Bull. And he wants to know, what's beyond the polarized caps? I don't understand that. Lee, why don't you just add it? And he goes, what's beyond the, when you get, I want to know what happens when you get to that ice wall that Jimmy claims. He goes, what's beyond that fucking ice. I asked him that. I was on the phone, Greg. And I said, can't answer it. No, listen, no, he's what he told me. He goes, oh yeah. He goes, you go look it up. Bird, we bird, check it out on Google. He got to the white spot. He couldn't climb the wall. They couldn't get up, and it was so massive. I said, Jimmy, how can they take a helicopter up the way? Go over the wall. He's not, you guys, the weather's too bad. They can't get a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little fly. No, you know what they think. They think it's an ice wall and it's like a dome. So if they go up and come around, it won't be back. So just like a flat bird and then a dome. I said, we're in a hurry. Oh, wait, what did you just say? A flat earth with a dome? Yeah, yeah. Right. Which is no longer flat. No, which means that this is me. I don't know if you really get it. Yeah. Dude, I agree with you, but this is a lot of conspiracy people. They believe that you. And fucking leap, preschools, I want to know what the fuck is behind that stupid ice wall. And then, you know, my girlfriend, you can get her going on that check. Because, you know, she's fucking easy, like, like shot. What I wanted to know is when I look out my, when I'm outside of my house and we watch the, the all these, you know, because I, you could see the, the shuttle, we'll be with there's no shuttles now. But you could see the rockets go up the SpaceX rockets from Cape Kennedy. I want to know where they go in. Jimmy, I think it's go for it. Do I ride like we're the fucking, you know what I'm saying? Do you know real days? Do you like as to put it? That's what you're playing. But if the earth is flat, okay? And the rockets go in up, right? It's, it's like a skyrocket. It's going to eventually. Where's the, it's floating. There, where's the go? We know bounces off the bounces off the kick it through there. He'll tell you, it can't, he'll tell you that it, like, that you're not really seen around, it's like, they're fucking with your governments, fucking with you, that that's not real right. Right, right, right. Never land the moon. Right, right, right. All that video's fake. He says, it's all bullshit. It's all fake. He tells me, he said, there's no such thing as a, me and him at an argument that there's a long time ago. He was telling me that there's no such thing as a picture of the earth. You know, you know, when you say, yeah, you said that. He says that's a painting. That's a, computer generated. Yes, all of the videos, the spaceships, the Hubble telescope is bullshit. There's, there's no rockets. We didn't land on the moon. The moon isn't even there. You know, it's a projection from Gotham City. And instead of just break the bat. And Alice, and it's all bullshit. So everything we've seen on the ex-combs哪裡 screens is fake. Except for what he says. Yeah. Now I get to tell you, Lee Priest has a little bit, a little bit of conspiracy in him himself because, and my girlfriend's into all that shit. So he had my girlfriend gone back and forth on this fucking text message. About like the key was taking pictures of the sky above his house. And he's like, look, they got camp trails. So you know that. And three of both sends me that too. Yeah, but you want to know something. How stupid? Because whoever's up there flying a plane and dropping this so-called poison that's killing all of us, they're poisoning their own family, still, right? Like, you know, they live down here. They live on this earth and everything. You know? So you're looking at, right? Am I right or wrong? They're drones. Well, I'll tell you something. They definitely spray for, from insects over here. They drop shit all the time. Yeah, but they're not dropping you. These topics, then you got, you got the, you got the UFOs now. We got the UFO footage coming out. Well, that Jimmy would say that's all manufactured, right? Because there are no UFOs because you can't leave the planet. Oh, yeah, dude. Let me think of it. That doesn't make it. It could possibly be. And it probably is. But it certainly is working as a distraction from all this other shit. Go, no. If you guys in the comments here on this station here, if they were saying, like, God, that's birds. That's fucking, you know, shit like that. You know what I mean? That's birds. I actually would, I would tend to believe that there are other aliens coming here visiting us. Well, of course. I hate. You know, that's how you're doing. I was playing a fucking 4,000 years ago. You know, a pyramid's will built in each of it. It was pyramids here in, in, in, in, in, fucking South America's pyramid. There's like, yeah, pyramids here in the United States. How did these people, like, know to communicate with each other like that? Like, you know what I mean? Don't you think, don't you think it's incredibly arrogant as a society to believe that what do you only want? That what we believe the laws of physics are, are the laws of physics period. And that it would be impossible to conceive that another civilization, somewhere else that's been around hundreds of thousands of millions, tens of millions of years longer than our civilization has been developing here on earth. Literally, light years ahead of us in technology and intelligence and all that stuff. That what our laws think we think they are, physics not theirs, they figured you should out hundreds of millions of years ago, right? You know, and so. Well, John, let me ask you a question. How come, you know, even back before Jesus's days, people always looked up to the sky for God, right? Right. But how you're telling me to, like, you know, I believe in God, and everything, but I don't believe he sits up on a cloud somewhere. That's why with people look up, oh God, you know, he's not, you know, I believe that's all like another dimension, so to speak. But that's the reason why they say that people came down for this, this cave, there's drawings on the caves. Well, there's, but there's physical proof. I've been to Egypt. The proof is there. That pyramid, the giant pyramid, was not built by us, not this us. It was not, and it wasn't built 4,000 years ago. It's not over. Did you could have built that today with the schematic and everything? You're telling me 4,000 years ago, but what an advocate. Right, no, they didn't even have the wheel. They didn't even have the wheel back then. There were one foot out of the freaking stone age. How did it fuck the day figure out, how to move? If you had a build, that pyramid is built by two millions, what I 100, two a million, over two million blocks that had half tons each. Right, great, John had it. And they said it was built in 25 years. So it's built in 25 years, all of those blocks, they would have the mine transport, carry up in place, one block every 21 seconds. John, how do you cut perfect squares? Each block is perfect. Out of granted. What does it mean? Get it? Number nine in the hardness scale, and the hardest tool you had was copper, which is you can't even scratch anything with it. Give a height unit fucker, take a five pound ton, fucking block and drag it, and then get it all the way up there, and the fucking, you know, the most regret. The most insane thing is this plate is this, what's that place called? Peach you or what? No, it's in, you know, no, in Egypt, by the, by the pyramids, where these giant sarcophagus are, they either ground, and they're way like, they went like a hundred tons. The bases, the base, solid granite, the bases carved out of, solid granite, perfectly square, 70 tons, and the top, the cap, is also perfectly carved with an indent around the inside, and that's 30 tons. And it's laying on top of itself, you know, like this, and they're carried down these corridors, and put in these rooms, and there's only like two feet around where, you know, where this giant sarcophagus is, it's way bigger than for a person, these things are giant. They're like, you know, eight, seven feet tall and 12 feet long, you know, eight feet wide, giant bucks that solid granite, perfectly square, they put a square straight edge up against the right, absolutely perfect, right? You've seen that, right? And they're like, and there's, and there's, so this is catacomone to ground, and these like branches that go off and there's giant boxes, they need to get these branches, right? And, and, and there's one, actually, they left in the middle of the hallway, and they just stopped moving it. But this underground, no light, no suit on the ceiling, so there was no torches, and they got all this dug out, and it's all perfect, and they're moving these giant, giant blocks of, of, of, a perfectly carved granite underground and stick them in a room that they got like two feet around the stand. So somebody please explain how they do that, right? I agree with you, man. I don't know, I just think, you cut perfect fucking blocks that are 10 feet fucking high, and, you know, 20 feet, I mean, it's, it's impossible to cut that. You couldn't do that today with electric fucking, gas power tools, you know, I don't see how you can stand it with a chisel and fucking do that. But they got rocks with the cut marks in it. They got cuts that were at the blade broke. They were saying, and they were saying, even if they knew how to manufacture their own rock, they say, we don't even have that technology perfected today, you know, right? So there's no way they could submit. Yeah. It's just even like the sphinx and shit like that. How do you carve something that's so humongous? I don't know, I just think, you know, there's definitely got to be something, well, we'll think about this. How much technology change from like the 1920s 2020. Think about where we went with the cell phones and the ability to fly. It's a bit of a shit. So in 1970s, we were catching up with the. Why the Holy E. But that's 100 years. Imagine a thousand years from now. And so we don't kill each other off. Think about how much tech with it. And you'll calculate her. A calculated in 1970s and fucking think of like, what, fucking 100 bucks with normal life. But think about what we can do. I mean, don't you think that they're going to figure out how to make anti-gravity like type of vehicles that are just going to just lift off that, you know, repel gravity and then you'll just, you'll just fly basically. I mean, well, they're saying that right now, what's his name? Elon Musk is teaming up with fucking that moment from Amazon Jeff Bezos. And that is what I want to both go to space and what you get those guys involved. They have enough money to create whatever you don't want to mean. Look, I mean, we are less space shuttle was, you know, funded by a private thing and it was Elon Musk, you know? So you don't know what that is going to happen. Now, I mean, that's saying eventually, you know, we're going to go in a Mars and 100 years from now. People would be watching it, going, little cell phones those guys are using. You know, I mean, it's, it's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's important. People left for me. I got a fucking flip phone. You'll still, you'll still have a flip phone. 100 years from now. Yeah. I would have fun. I'll be like, Greg, you'll be so seen out. I'll be like, you know, that phone doesn't work right now, right? There's no network. Yeah. But to think of trying to say, they're fucking technology, just from like the early 2000s. You know, no cell phones are like, people left for me. They got older than that. I'm like, it really isn't that old. What do you know? Jeff, my point is that in a thousand years from now, think about what kind of you will be around. 100 years. That's why John's saying, you know, people, people. I got a whole bit of a challenge. We got a challenge on us. Good. Dave, we got a mystery. Oh, we got the, we got the, uh, but I can't see it. We got it. We got it. Yeah, Dave. Send a link to my phone. Are you having a second? I said it to your phone. Hold on. Okay. Thanks. Take it. Talk to me. I feel like I'm watching the Logan. I never have any. I never have any. Maybe I'll have their fight. I see. I saw that. Yeah. Hey. Look at this. We're in a private location, a suitcase in my clients on a big giant golf course. Big built-in pool. Oh, nice. Is this way going to have the fight? Laney's. Laney's about 30 feet from me. You know, what do you guys just have the fight right now? Get it over with? Have Rob hold the phone. Nah, it's the, it's called the press conference, Dave. You know what they are? You guys, you guys may never get together again. This might be the end of a rob. Just make them fight and hold the phone so we can watch. We're not with it. We're still in training if I do. I mean, so when you, when you can do the fight, you go in there, I like it. Hmm. Hold on. We lost you. I said. I said. No, on. I don't. I ain't doing it. Good. All right. They're all holding this. They're Lenny. I see. So Rob, maybe you should be like the guy who asked the questions at the press conference. Unless you want us to. No, when you guys get you guys, you guys can ask and it can't hear the, then I'll repeat them. But okay, but you got to turn the phone because yeah, you got to put an orientation lock as got to come off. I see. I see. He ups and downs. I'm just not getting help. Greg, I'm placing Egypt. It's called the Serapium. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I mean, look that up. No, you're a peer. I'm going to look at the R.A. I'm going to look at my screen. I'm trying to find the crazy to figure out how he fucked they did that. No one that we know today. They couldn't do it. I got it. Let's focus on press conference. You get the, to get the aliens. All right, Rob. You're a little bit of this set that we got. Hold on, Rob. What you got to do is you got to turn your phone sideways. So it's the long way. I mean, they're the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, but then you got to take your orientation. He had it. He had it right. He had it right. You got to take the lock off. Take your attention lock off. And turn it side. Do you have an iPhone, Rob? Yeah. All right. Swipe down from the top. You sound there. There you go. Lenny. This is your job. You should be here doing this. I told you're full. Yeah, well, I didn't, we didn't trust that you guys would show off. So you got to stand still. Yeah, can you sit. There you go. Stop. Don't take any more free work out right now. All right. All right, snowmbody hit some body. Do we still? Yeah. Well, what, like questions up on the fans, John. Did you make all those postage, uh, Mr. G? Yeah. All right, they made up here and you know how we work on the go, right? So so I went, I went, I, I, to my back up, I didn't have the special board. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't be in that line. How can we only have a small beat for big one? C. B. Big ladies. Yeah, why do you? Why do you do the lines to be in big one? A small letter. Where's the scale? Is this a weigh in? Where's the, No, the weigh in. The weigh in isn't too long. Is that a boy? Jack, why is the hot chick? Where's the hot chick? Where's the hot chick? Where's the hot chick? I feel it. I feel it. So what do we, what do we, what do we, so what do we intend to accomplish here today, gentlemen? Fans, ask questions. Okay, ask a question. I just did. Well, it's a question. What are you, guys? What are you guys want to accomplish here today? That's the question. Oh, that's not how long how long are you doing? Well, what's the, what, oh, what's the tail of the tape? Did you guys did Rob, did you measure these guys like the neck by our ability to reach? Reach. What am I a tailor? No, I didn't measure these guys. Here's the tail. All right. Up. What are you waiting today? I'm six foot. Two, two, 22 right now. All right. Maybe I'm, I'm, I'm six, three, three, seven, ten. Let me look way bigger than Mr. G. I'll get in that my huge. Yeah. Let's get it. Let's get a stand right next to each other. So we can get a stand right next to each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we can get a stand right next to each other. You know, I can the poster. Like, no, you're ready to go up like, make a spritz out of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, face off. We can't get any spritz here. There you go. That's it. Let me say. Pop. It's not popping up. Ladies, got George, can't you see? I'm not even playing. I'm just playing. I'm just playing. And he's laughing over there. George, George, you're being psyched out right now. Hey, Lenny looks menacing. Yeah, you can feel your right on his foot. And whip your head off and shit down your neck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, let's compare. Oh, George, it's turning away. That's the best. I might have to retract my bat now. Look who's supposed to be this big. Lenny. Wait, Lenny's a monster. I got the list. Lenny's list is thicker, man. I got to tell you, Lenny's no difference between Lenny's hand and his wrist. It's one solid piece. You guys look at Henry's hell too, by the way. Let's go nose to nose again. But I need you someone to talk Rob, talk over the acid. It pops up in the screen. Yeah, working me. Can he put it on? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, now we got it. OK. OK, good. Let's see who breaks first. Mr. G's like laughing. He's like, don't you have a meat? I like Lenny's. Lenny's got a very menacing. He's not aggressive. You know, look, you could tell he's been in a fight before. I'm scared of Lenny. You'll be thinking about the way Rob, your kind of thing is getting to work. OK. This is some questions. What the wizard wizard wizard wizard wizard. Yeah, you can, all right, you can, you guys can sit down now. But that's the screen. You got to go get the screen. Wait, wait, wait. Has anyone asked for it anyway? Wait, the question is, has anyone asked the question? But, yes. Well, you have, I want the fans. Don't we want it down? No, we want it. No, we want it. You have my brain to hand show. I got a question for you, Mr. J. If after the fight to plan on releasing a big Lenny cookie, that's big in my inbox. Yeah, a lot of people been asking that to. I think he should. If Lenny is ready. If Lenny uses his platform for good, then I will. If he continues his ways, then I will. I got a question to you, Lenny. And a lot of fans want to know, is it mandatory that you won't fight unless there's training, or training ring girls present? No, not necessarily, but that would add to it. I mean, it's national pride months. Which I'm not a political thing, but if a man can make himself sexually appealing to another man, I think that's a society. And I find that an art. So that's the law for you. And I got a question for you, Lenny. Don't take those shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Follow the question. Follow a question. Follow a question. Art. Please explain the artistic element of this because you know, I'm an artist. So this is interesting to me. Yeah, we can tell by the photos behind your head. John, if you look at some of them online, where you can't tell if it's a woman or a man, that is, hats off to them. I mean, they can get them in a wretched amount of any man. It's turned on any man. And I think if you want to be gay, why don't you be a trans sexual and look good at it? They don't want to stop. Why is it that? I don't think it's not that. But I can totally understand that. I can totally understand that. As a man, if you can make yourself so gorgeous, it's just going to show how lazy a lot of the women are. And that's what family and status is thinking that they can walk around not having to be pleasing. Don't worry. So, Lenny, if you're going to take it in the ass, it's going to go, my name is Will Be Would You Know? No, no. I'm not one. I've never done that. I've had a couple of tried to take good and do it. And I'm not for that at all. That's the thing. I'm a natural part. But I mean sit down, talk, and maybe hug and kiss, and maybe a little oil or some and jogs. That's not funny. Anybody in the crowd is here. I mean, it's an ass isn't hurting anybody. It's not John. No, that's not my thing. I heard that's what you're trying to, I'm just trying to establish the parameters to be able to find acceptable within this room. So, John, I know I have a question for Mr. G. John, I know. Okay. You're no, I got a question. Mr. G. I'm going to turn on as we all do. We're a man. Let's face it. Every one of us, have either seen one, on the nuns to them, or been with one and say, wow, this is great. So, I think I want to speak to him. I don't want you to speak to him. That's not funny. I want to ask Mr. G something. Mr. G and we're hearing Lenny say these things. You are a little nervous that he, you know, when he's wrestling you and the ring that, you know, something might pop in there or something like that, you know? Yeah, that's a great question Dave. What's the question? Oh no, no, no, that's our fair. Because, late, on Lenny's defense, he's saying, the trend, gay guys don't like trends. Because that's been in any gay guys like men. What if he's not gay? He likes girl. If he's not going to try to stick his dick to people. Where his mind seems to be open. No, I don't think I'm going to think. I don't think it's going to be a stretch. No, I get it. I'm going to be like a wrestling. Basically, what if he wears his wig? You know, I'm going to let Lenny, I'm on your side. I understand that. Click on this. Yeah, it's a stretch. I'm going to shade. I'm just saying, if his mind is open up enough to that, if he's rolling around on the floor of Mr. G and he's just trying to just get the hard on. Oh, no. I'm going to slap you to that. And then Mr. G's got to deal with that. Not being mischievous. That is what you don't work. That's not good. How do you? It's a big test. The big test. The soft skin is to the estrogen therapy and the smooth voice. I mean, I can't describe it. But it's still there. It's not as much as it has been. And I can credit the eye of the game treatment for that. But it's still a part of it is there. And it's an all-man. It's a serious right. I was on the phone. I remember the training said we got a fight. We got a fight. I was on the phone with my eyes. He gave me one. I'll take that. Oh, my. What are you going to say about it? One second. Hold on. Logan Paul just went for it. No, first vlog. Hi. I believe, really like, second. Second vlog. Anyone? And the end of the day wants to be the nice, nice girl at some point. Not a training, not a test. I don't care about those people as far as what they do. Sex with, you know, I'm just not going to promote them, you know, and be part of it. That's a very simple. Whatever the sexual lifestyle is, it's up to them. Who cares? So, Lenny, what do you want to show the world with this fight? Good question. Show them it's with hard failure. It's not a death sentence. You can get better shade. I want you to go out and go man to man. Actually, it's kind of, I'm having a difficulty right now. Right now, I mean, Mr. Jean wrote out the red carpet, gave me some Mr. Jean's cookies, different flavors. I got my alcohol on water and make sure I had it. And we had a nice discussion, but we have to prove who's the better man, at least for this day. And already, I'm starting to get really, really fired up. Over the fact that I didn't really get much of a chance, you know, with all the pre-fight whoop-law. I'm going to prove from people wrong, which I like doing, and as the best way to do it. And I will be in shape for this fight, and it's going to be entertaining. And hopefully we can get Cassidy Campbell or Nagarishin on Genie Mereira with me priests. And that'll definitely add to it. Can I ask Cassidy Campbell to fight Lee? Yes. I'm really, I just just thought they're working on it. They're working. I know, because I was watching him tell him, I need to ask a serious question to Lenin. OK, so let's say you guys fight and you. Does that victory justify what you did to him? We'll work on him. Say it again, John. I'll do it here. I'll do it here. I got a question. I didn't have my think as forgiven. I'm actually glad he called me out on it because it shows you that old school mentality that he's knocking on a letter code for anything. Yeah, we have to admire that. But if you stand at it just internet beats and a certain someone who remain nameless that won't get in the ring for anybody, he's causing a lot of problems. And it's been offered $5,000 to get in the ring. Let's see if he does it. Because I gave him a question. That's a tag. J Masters. Yeah. J. J. J. That truck driver who's going to fight? That won't let me. That won't let you. That won't go. Whatever he is. Okay. It's just some six stuff. Yeah. We know who you are, J. M. This is. Don't worry about it. You hide behind will these different names. You're cow. Well, I'm lost. So wait, he wants to fight Rob? Huh? Yes, yes, Greg. All right. Okay. That guy Benny his help offered J $5,000 to get in the ring with me and go one round. Wow. But he won't do a training thing. Because he's currently like I said in the last year, trying to get people to harass my family and stuff. Let's get back to this fight. He wants to keep it. He wants to accomplish with this fight. Okay, so wait one more question and then I'll shut up. George, you look like you have built a carattery with when you know, it's a no, it's a press conference. No, I know that, but I mean, you can show me the real good. You've been treating them really good. You gave him cookies. You know, you built a poster's form. Yeah, maybe the other one. Are you mad? I mean, are you still mad? John, let's, let me explain what you're doing on, John. I showed George get him from laughing. I can't say what you're doing. It's been he's got serious. It's not working. This is what's going on, John. I already figured it out. Mr. G has trained his ass off the display, right? He's petrified that this thing's not going to go off. He's got to sweeten the pot a little bit to make sure that everyone is, is cooperating and that everyone's going to show up on the day of the fight. You understand? Right. I'm from all the way. Put away, you would look a little better if they were like, didn't like each other. Right. They should have, you should have, you should have, you should have pretending you didn't like each other. I think we could not. This is George trying to say, if they were standing there and Rob had a holding back both between him. Right. That's what they should have. It looks like F finished. They're going to go out and ever fight to eat. Maybe hang out to the show. That's fine. They come a few tradies together. Yeah. That's what it looks like to me. So I don't let me better than that. And I know what's really going to happen is after this. The second we leave, he's going to start running his mouth once again. Probably. Let me, let me ask you guys a question. What's going on? I thought you guys must have been trained by Vinny up there. And you were going to go up there for three weeks. And now you're back down. I heard. Well, back in that way, but thanks to take care of our some legal issues. What's going on with your earlier, Lenny? What's going on with your earlier, Lenny? What's going on with your legal and the things? I can't leave the county. Oh, okay. So you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, you have a, do you have a, you have a, you have a mine of touring device to attach to you? No, no. No, because he has a going to court you. Hey, we have any lawyers that are watching this that maybe can help you. Yeah, I don't have any side. I have a whole room full. Wait, you're going to make sure that we got a gel, Mr. J, you're not going to have a fight. Yeah, they're all, they're all in signing it. Adler to hope the whole crew. Well, let's help Lenny out. He's not a little bit of a trouble. George is my boy, but I like Lenny. Lenny, I, I hope he does good. And I want to see. Yeah, he's, you know, I want to, I don't like this legal shit, whatever it is, I want to see him get through this and have, you know, have fun. That guy, that guy, that guy, that guy, that guy looks like a bowl of bowls. You know, that, with a little tiny head, like, like the beat of juice head on it. Yeah, I said that he said, I saw this, he said some sick things. Yeah, and then trying to get everybody in trouble. Yo, none of this is about that. It's about two guys getting in a ring, working it out, yo, competition at the end of the day. And then I kept fitting to this. I don't understand. I thought it wasn't until these guys all friends down there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Two, two, frascaids. That's the same thing. Made a video. He made a video and told people that they, if they have a, I'll keep it down syndrome or a kid that has special needs, that it's you main to drown them. What? What? Yeah, yeah, they, who did? That guy, they messes. Who did? That guy, the real, the real, the real. I don't know who this guy, I'm not sure. I'm telling you, I saw the video. He said to me, he said me, he said me one of the wild back, yo, he's in the dog, yo. I think he's going to want to be talking about, you come down and beat me. Is it on YouTube? It was on his Instagram. It should be somewhere, yeah. I would, I don't know, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it's in the right place. Yeah, it's in the right place. Yeah, it's actually, that's how the kids get a half special needs or something, right? Yeah, yeah. And he's going to, he's going to, he's going to, he's going to, he's going to, he's going to, he's going to, you guys, you, you guys don't hear. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, he used to be, but he got, you know, we all kind of banished him once he started saying out, Lannish things like that. I mean, who wants to be around somebody like that? No, I don't like that. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That could get me in a ring and that would be good for him. But you know, you want to fight him like that? I don't even know who he is. He won't accept a challenge from anybody. He wouldn't accept a challenge from the same hand that you could have, girl, like, talking about she'd with the Zass. Oh, wow. I looked, the challenge and he's going to have one day is that he's not going to see the challenge. What, this guy, if he keeps still a stop, he can, I'm not told. What are you doing, stuff like that? You have to fight. You'll have someone, you'll have someone one day and you, no, it's come. How about, wait, you got to do it. He can be at the fight because George, if he was at the fight, my bed is George would call him into the ring. You, get out, Pyrr, let's go on. You want to go on, right? He wants to go on. So it's face anywhere where he be reckless. She's going to work in a game sending messages on my Instagram and I just, I, I, I, I, I, I, listen, why did you spend your time trying to help people to, to destroy the story lives like they told about Lenny and Tom's leaving you whatever, who cares? That's his problems. That's not to do me trying to throw up the fire on it. That's not to do that. But you know what you should be doing instead. You would end it. You would end it. You would end it. You would end it. You would end it. You would end it. You know, like a, like a mercenary soldiers are fortunate and, you know, just going out after this guy. And just instead of fighting each other and him, that's what you should do. Well, fighting each other first and to go do it. Then go on a mission together. Yeah. You know what? They'll be best friends after the next show. I think the best friends now. It's like, you know, that's the, like the expendable. That's the point, John. John, the whole point of this and everybody is, is to show people how to send all differences. Not by destroying people's lives. Not by trying to destroy someone's reputation. Not by going to someone's house and dragging them out or doing something bad, by taking it and competing and running together and working it out. And the end of the day, if the whole workshop's shit can't and realize that we got to use our, our, what we do for good and not bad. And then other people like, let's see that. I like it. We got to do a rise in the right. And we can't make up. And it's called price fights. But what if we die in the ring? Not going to happen. How do you know? Not going to happen. When he's got a hard issue. God. John, that would be the place an honorable place for me to die in a red. Not on some streets, some ghetto, let's listen by the other day, doing something stupid or worse. If I got wanted to be in a ring, well, you know, I couldn't have the 100%. I respect that. Yeah. Yeah. There's an honor in the battlefield. He'd probably have his father's approval on that one. Yep. That's the Olympics. I don't think that's nice. Is that what the Olympics are about? The Olympics are athletes from every country. Even though they have differences. You know, when they're a woman, when you're, is the, to the athletes, you put your best up there, the fighters, the javlong dies, you know, the swimmers. And then they compete against us all the time. They get the 12th and they realize that they're similar. And they can work it out in competitive sports, the angry animosity and become friends and not go to war. And that's how it started. I tell it started. Right. Right. Let's get the answer to the nitty grids. Yeah. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. How many rounds is it going to go? First of all, how many rounds is it going to go? Three, five minutes and then they, you have to see. How much rounds? This will wait. You guys can fight for five minutes. Are you doing with that, Leonard? Three, five minutes rounds. No, no, good enough. But I'm not. I would, I would say five minutes. Five, like two minute rounds. I would say, I would say, I would say, five, thirty second rounds. Yeah. Three, three, thirty second rounds. No, two minute rounds. Do five minutes. That's what it's going to spend. We spent doing nothing. You guys can do it. They're going to just go around the ring, like, you know, to sign up. Remember when Ollie fought the, the jab. Yeah. Got wrestler, remember that? Yeah. He was not easy. No, right. Exactly. Right. The bell rang. Blank sweep. Undergone the ground. He spent the rest of the time on it. He was taken a nap. So I mean, two minutes. Come on. Just be realistic. I've seen big, lengthy doing any cardiovascular conditioning. Mr. G has been, has been trained incredibly hard and is incredibly fit shape, great shape and condition. He could easily go two minutes. He's been training in two minutes. So I'm a trained, done, between five minutes. Five minutes. Two more. John. I've been training. I've been training. I've been actually five minutes. I can get it right. Fave is right. Five minutes is too long. I couldn't fight for five minutes. It's no way Lenny's fighting for five minutes. Lenny's honor on the battlefield will be fulfilled if you try to go five minutes. All right. So so to said, so shall be done. But I don't, we don't want Lenny to die. He's not. Do you fight around? You don't. You don't. He came from God. This, this has been pre-old day. This is a property. He's done. This is like the fucking pyramid. You don't get it. It's like a sack of what you're showing. It's like a sack of what you're showing. Yeah, we're talking. It's like a blues brother. It's on a mission to put the band back together. It's a momentum. God. You guys can fight. But George, you guys are older. You need to have a little bit more rest in between. You can't fight five minutes straight. No one fights five minutes straight. George, can. What are you talking about? They said you have seen. You guys are not in UFC. Like months of fucking demonstrations. Two more. Ten rounds. Five minutes like those guys doing the 30 sets of body fuck. The Arnold training. We want the Mike Metser and Thor and the hard one. The Metser and Thor and the A. It's ours and Jones. Have a beauty fight. Two minutes. Yeah. I think it's fair. George, to go two minutes. It's very hard to have enough endurance. I know you're in that case for endurance. But you got to give a lady the opportunity to at least be on a rest in between. Yeah. You got to do that. What? What? You take a, you take a one minute rest in between. Right. But you go two minute rounds. You do five minute five two minute rounds. That's fair. Right. But I'm not, I'm trying to decide. Yeah. But he's, you know, I'm so why? What's the big deal? You'll be in better shape. All right. All right. So, ladies. You want. Yeah. Three, two minute rounds. Do five two minute rounds. Five two minute rounds. Five two. How about five two minutes? Five is too many. It's not going to go five. Yeah. At least. Leave the audience. Yeah. Three to three. Five three to three, five. I mean, if it goes beyond three three, we'll have a. Siden we've got overtime of it to tie. That's all five two minutes. Yes. George, you got to give him the two minutes. Come on. All right. Five two minutes. You got to think George. You got to think entertainment value. You want, you want this to be a show. No. You want to, you want to, you want to, you want to, you want to. No. on the state in bulk of Florida. Whoa! Give us your tool. No, we said that you would be the only who would go to Florida. No, I want to do it again. Cause I will tell me, cause everything you say, I'm going to do the opposite. That would tell you everything. I'll be surprised. All right, hold on. I should go to a fucking giant. Giant, I'm not going to do it. Greg, if you guys were betting men, what would you bet? I mean, who are you going to pick? What round are they going to go out and how's the win going to happen? Oh, fuck. I don't know. That's tough one. John. I mean, he want to go first. Greg, I want to pick. I think it's first. I think it's going to be some sort of drama, but I don't want to see anybody get hurt and just predict. I predict if I was done now. I'd say to Lenny, let's go to a club shit. Fuck, that's not fun. Greg, I'll sneak him out the back door before the fight starts. I probably want to happen. This is what's going to happen. I'm going to go to distance and it's going to be a draw. You think so? Yep. Now draw. Now draw. I'm scared for his a draw. Draw. This is going to be up. Look, this isn't everybody gets a trophy deal. Well, that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. What? OK. OK. So what if both of you end up unconscious? Who won? The guy who wakes up first. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. I think George is going to have a hard time hurting Lenny because I don't think Lenny will go down. I think Lenny is, you could take a lot of punishment. So he's going to wind up arm barring him in a very boring end to the fight. It will probably be over by the second round. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I think this is not going to be exciting. John, I think they should go to a training club. See you guys, the hottest, training. That's right. You can judge the contest. John and I want no part of it. Yeah. I'm not in the control at all with the training element of this. So you guys seem to have an affinity. You find the club for them to go to. And then I'm going to go to the world. I'm going to go. I don't know. I don't Greg's open to it. Greg Greg. I would fucking. Greg, you're going to get a hot of training. Yeah, you probably will. You've got a better rap than those guys. You're a great. No, I'm only kidding. No, listen. I. I. An idea. He doesn't. I don't want to see anybody get hurt. I like. Greg, listen. You're running in a voice. What if you went down there? All right. What if you went down there? And you got two trainees to fight each other by for them by proxy. But what if I was Lenny's coach? You know what's that? Well, this is bad. No, listen, like, you know, like wrestling. You come out with a big head on a shit of bow around. You got two two hot trainees, which you're like, Lenny, Lenny, get a good girls. Well, George, you used to do that for the radio show, but out the trend. Yes. Maybe Greg, maybe you can find Lenny, Lenny, some bad, hot trainees to go out with them. I think you get too, Greg, if you find two willing trainees that you think fit the, you know, the bill. And get them to fight each other. Now, we want them to be the ring girls, John. Yeah, you want to ring girls. This is why you got to be in a fight. Right. Really. I got to be honest with you. I got to be honest with you. You have watched the three studios, you remember a curly, then. Yeah. And if we're, we get to ring, you get to ring a store playing on music. You get two hot trainees there. They call like this, Lenny and a blow, my kiss. He'd be in the front. He was like, he was like, he was going to have to score it. Come on, like, just join him. He's going to score your round up. Yeah, that's a swing in the middle of the world. Let you with that. I have a real girl. He really wants to get it out. Oh, hold on. I believe Lenny takes it. He does that because he can't get a hot girl. That's not right. It's that quick. Listen, if that's what he likes, that's what it does. That's what it does. Yeah. Let me have George. What's your on garage? Get a consistent. Do you have it planned yet? At the fight. The walkout. Yeah. Do you have a song? Hey, who the fucking, who the fucking, who the fucking. Who the fucking, who the fucking. Who the fucking, who the fucking. Who the fucking. Hi, Gordon, guys. With the band pipes from the police department. Yeah. You can have a garage. You can have a garage. You can have a garage. A garage. I was dancing. And my music, I music. What's your music? What's your theme? Rocky. Irish. I was. You can have Irish music. My team is. You know Irish working. Fighting guy with a whole life. Working on. We're talking about a whole life to build the business and the build something. And to to show people how this new evolution of. People who talk people try to room reputation. There if you're going to call bullies. You know, we all, you know, then so be it online. And they need to be stopped. They can't just drive people way and make up stuff. Not going to happen. Yeah, but back in the last garage. Back in the last. But I want to show the youth. What you do. What stand up. You can't let it just go by the way, sir. You know, the name is question about the entourage. Are you going to do like, you know, like, have like, you know, like just in beaver walk out with you kind of down the aisle from the walk. Maybe. Maybe. You're good. You need someone. You just got to walk with. Yeah. Maybe. But let me in the garage. We're going to get one. No, we're trying to think ahead of what we can do. Hmm. He's got a little bit of a strange line. It's right in the front, but then he also has to have like, you know like, a rapper or something like that. What kind of music you like, you, like, you, like, you know, a bridge by the music that you love. What was that? Well, I was a lot on listening to music. It's a kid. So any kind of deal. You're probably like club music, right? House. No. No, what is he like? He likes the year the cat, that's so. That's the year. What is that so you're a bit sad? Yeah, yeah. Country rock. Country rock. Yeah, 70's probably. I don't listen to the radio when I'm talking. I think I can get one of the BGNs. John, maybe he could sing like night fever or something like that, you know, when I mean, like, for you know, like disco from the 70's. That was that was really looking forward to it. Go ahead, Mr. G. again, the opportunity as well as Dave, you and your after hours crew. Yeah. And as a great chance for me to get in shape and just be a purpose in life. You need a purpose when you wake up in the morning. Letting people, can you agree with you? Can you give us like some like, you know, like, jam, jam, jam, you know, give us some like, you know, punching, you know, yeah, give us a, let's do a little demonstration for them and really wrap it up.

So we've ever wanted. This is called this this is a little training. Give me. Don't call Perry at the end of the speed. You know, and in the dirt. You know, we're. We're. Just do it. You don't need to explain anything. Just. Why would you want to see a lot? That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that. You. You. You. You. I. When he's getting guests. Not me. He's going to be a massive. Good job. No. Come on. George is locked. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. I'm not just joining us today and I'm looking forward to the fight. It's going to happen the weekend of October. Why. I'll. Yeah, the Olivia October night between. Twelve and six when nothing's happening at the Olympia. Like I said. We're going to have. Everything. Nothing but. Judging John. That's all. That's all. We got the whole because they have to. Well, I. All right. We're going to. So in the middle of the day in Vegas. And in the or. We're going to have vodka and watch the fight. All right. All right. All right. All right. Take it guys. Love your ball man. Rob. Thank you. You're. Great. Wait. What the fuck is you? What is that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. First of all, first of all, Laney Caballi left his arms up. I love. But it will be a massacre. It will be a massacre. And it's not going to accomplish anything. It's already fake. I mean, they don't they like each other. Yeah, the ball. You're going to do the best fucking God damn most like prefight show ever. No, I don't. But the best idea or maybe Greg did. The misdegetion, move his business down here. We should hire, Lanyan Rob Zillet to bacon, the good. And they should hire. Good. His client should hire a film crew to film the whole thing. It would be the greatest reality show of all time. I. I'm the one who introduced it to that guy Mike. Another guy Mike. We could call it the cookie. Well, Mike's been replaced by big Lanyan seems like so. So it'll be, it'll be, it'll be the cookie factory with big Lanyan misdegetion. No, the cookie cutter. That's the great idea. The cookie cutter. That's what you'll call it. Your cookie cutter versus the cookie man. That's what I said. Instead of giving Lanyan cookies, you should give him a big thing. A cookie. No, from 12 at the reality show, we'll be called the cookie cutters. All right. Right. And, uh, or big. Great. Mr. G will make a fortune because everyone will want to buy the cookies because of the show. Right. And the show will be on the head. I can do a lot more people. This is the greatest thing that's happened. I think George for the cookie company because now we've got Lee Freeze to Volk to once and find a we a cookie. A lot of people want Lee's. Correct. Well, those guys, I guess on the show, but imagine a big Lanyan works for Mr. G. Can you imagine that the insanity that we're going at that point? I told you, I'm a digesting guy Mike. He's a nice kid. He's now down there with a I did. Now he's down there with George and Florida. Yeah, but he's went out to the store. But big Mike, that that my guy seems like a normal pretty normal guy. I, I, I, Lanyan Robzilla with Mr. G. It's good. It'll be like an insane asylum. Lany, Lany Robzilla and Mr. G. Making cookies of all the things that happens today. And I'm telling you, you want to put the thing is Dave, we can't if we leave this in the house. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Because this is a great business model. Right. The fact that there, we make a reality show of the making cookies that we sell. Yes. Yes. Right. This is brilliant. Yeah. It's brilliant. Okay. So, but they'll never figure that out. Yeah. So we got, we got to do this for that. Yeah. You know what? Be funny. I need to be a little dumb. I need to be a little dumb. I need to be a little dumb. So, I mean, I got, I got, this is a great idea, Dave. You're a genius. What did you give me to pull came down and knocked them both out? Just, well, you know, you know, you got another element. Yeah. Well, you know, pull him in because, you know, he's, he's the law. I saw that needs an intervention because he's he might be seeing two. That might be seen two, John. Yeah, but he could get. Yeah, he would fight the ball. Right. He would not fight. So we're talking about the reality show now. Yeah, no, no more fighting zone. They're fighting zone. They're fighting zone. We're talking about the freedom of being a free-to-giving and for season two to add more, you know, more flat in the show, you know, to bring Jimmy to bowling. And he's trying to drive and down to, to Florida to make a good. And then Greg, you could come in for the season three. Maybe, you know, you know, lead priest for season four. You know, we got, we got a plan ahead because this is going to be at least the seven to ten year run this show. And the, and the cook, and the imagine all the different cookies that we're in. Well, we're in this. When they get like she's three, they could have me and Lee preach coming like the open loopholes. Oh, I'll loom. I won't make it. Oh, boom. And the good thing is Mr. G's got his client who could hook a bill though all this. That's awesome. I couldn't find things in the show, you know. Yeah. But we got, we got to step in and organize this for them because they don't don't fucking all over. Yeah, of course they will. Yeah. The key is film. You got to film everything. You know what? We got to create. We got to make sure that this, we got to, we got to, we got to justify the actual truth and reality of what this arrangement is done. Oh, I can I ask you a question. I want to know, is Tyler a little upset that he wasn't there with this big press conference. Yeah. Believe me, he was a, was even, even. Tyler's. Tyler's. He can't believe. Yeah. They're literally Tyler was supposed to go down here and film. Yeah. But get him back to the environment. And this is really true that that house is theirs and it's like the training camp, you know, and cookie factory all in one, you know. We got to, we got to see if that's. This is a monumental. You know, it would be John, you're crazy. Got that house to get about the fucking cookies. They should be bringing home girls also. So, and then he brings home a training. She goes in George's room. And next thing you got to the house. That's what we had that in. We had that in. That's it. The show plot is they're making cookies and trend and all the things that happened today. Well, let's get it. Well, it's, let these life interweave the Mr. G's life interweave with the business, you know, right. And so, so Mr. So Lenny's. Proclivities come to the surface and they go completely against what Mr. G believes in his value, but they're being informed that they're. They're being informed that they're. Mr. G's now conforming. So, no, Mr. G's getting all week down. What you know, Lenny's got his hands in the cookie. He's been aiming at the training out in the hallway and Mr. G's. What the fuck? This guy's making cookies with the hands. He's got all over the training. And the funny. And then people. You know, it's funny. You know, it's funny. He's pitching about it. But then also in the show the morning breakfast and out of his door comes his training run out into the bathroom. If you get a robot. And a George's door. And then George comes out. And they're like, yeah, what happened? It's what you thought. I didn't know. She's just flipping a room. And we got. And God knows what Lenny will put into the. Into the. Into the cookie. You know. He's going to God. Did George get to all of sets. He went. Badger's mushroom. It's not. Right. He made me go against God. We're writing this thing as as it goes. It's right to set. You know, these guys. I didn't watch you. They don't know what we're talking because they don't understand how George the God. The show will explain it all. All right. So, all right. We got to do his get his brother down there for a couple episodes to John. Oh, Bobby small. No, he did something. Forget about Bobby would rule that show. Oh, you know that. You know what Bobby's going to listen to this. And he's going to his Bobby's the business man. Yeah. And he's a George. Wait a minute. I got to put the smart business on the side. So he's. Because you got to go. Mine over here with this fucking cookie. All right. The reality show with the cookie. The reality show promotes the cookie. Right. So this is fucking brilliant. Yeah. So it's going to wouldn't even have to be like a TV reality show. It could be a YouTube reality show because that's a signal. Yes, not what they're selling to cookie. Right. Of course. You get to watch to make your cookies. They're making cookies your body. But you know, you show. But by making you never want to eat the cookies again. But you never know, you know, they'll crawl around from the ground outside for the birds. They just want to freaking be part of the heel. They don't care about the fucking. Dude, I still think it's funny. If anyone started knocking everybody out, you remember like the three Stoods you know what seriously though, Lenny and Robney job. So I mean, this would be perfect. Really. I mean, this is like I said, this writes itself. That when you got to put you out of somebody comp. We got to send. We got to send Bobby Smalls down there to manage. So Bobby Smalls would be knocking. Dude, you. You fit your fucking given Lenny like the smell or the fucking maybe a Trandom Duce. Like this and isn't it like fucking curly? Yeah, get out there and it'd be knocking dudes out. Everybody coming and ring bang. Rob's little comes in and ring your stop of banging on cement. He's fucking, you remember like fucking nut of three Stoods you like that? That would be fucking great. That would be funny. That would be funny. Oh, watch it. I'm glad I would love it to people like to watch our fantasies and listen to all crazy, you know, I will just have fun with you. Somebody's guys think this shit serious. Like the guys watching us and fucking my feeling. It really is a good idea. You know, like I said, talking about trans sexes and Lenny's dysfunction and get the fuck out of your wits. It's a very, very creative idea. I hope that they listen to what we're telling them. You know what? The fight. Out of the way dreams to be on. You saw the press conference. We're one step closer. If anyone wants to, you know, get involved and donate some equipment to these guys or any kind of supplements. I'm sure we can get them over to them and they would appreciate it. Dude, and that was an amazing quality press conference. That's the very high point. We're making your own zoos. Rages this cells. That's outrageous. That's outrageous. That's what he's like. Black men's going to try to like take over. I'll give you an exclusive contract on any, like, so that he won't be able to fight, you know, because I don't know how to let the guy go in. I can see that. Big one. I should talk to Joe Pitaro. Maybe we'll put the winners on the coverage. I'll put it on the whole. Have a whole issue of muscle sport back going just on the fight. And the cookie recipe. There you go. You know how much they would sell that would fucking the people want that man. I have anxiety from this whole show, but I'm glad you guys tuned in. We'll be back next week as we always are. If you guys want to reach out to Jimmy to bowl, hit him up on Facebook. I think it's a little bit. Richard's having a hard time. Yeah, hopefully we'll have that one. We need you guys. Alright. Reach out to Jimmy. Especially if you're a dentist. He needs a dentist. Yeah, he needs a dental and what's all right. Guys, I love you guys. I love you guys. See you next week on the Plumbo with the entire Wackback for another edition of After Hours. Love you guys. I love you guys, man.

Day Palombo here with an RX muscle news update. The story of today is Big Rami. We saw a beta bedide posted a picture of Big Rami getting a most muscular shot on his Instagram and the guy looks absolutely enormous. Now, obviously, crab most muscular shots. Everyone looks pretty impressive. Rami's looking to be well over 320 pounds. I mean, if I had a guess, I'd say I'm a 330. Now people are probably saying, and I've already had people tell me, Rami's never going to be ready for the Olympia. This is a big mistake from the guy's 11 weeks out. He doesn't look like he's got a tremendous amount of body fat. He doesn't look like he's in trouble to me. Now, should he be on the Internet at this point? I don't know. It depends on everyone's different metabolism. I had a metabolism where I didn't want to be too too lean in 11 weeks out. I don't know how difficult it is to get Rami in shape. I never worked with them. So I don't know the answer to that question. When you have that much muscle however, you could hold a lot of work. Rami can die for two weeks and lose 20, 30 pounds, maybe more of muscle. What people don't realize is, as you get bigger, and I noticed this when I started going, when I first started diving for my first show, I guess, in 1994, the first like National Show, the Junior USA, I was 260. I came down to 224. Then the following year, I was 305 or 305 or 301 or something like that. I came down to 258. Then the following year, I was 315 and I came down to 268 or something like that. But that tells you is that as you get bigger, offseason, you hold way, way, way more fluid. People think, oh, it's stupid to go that high and you'll lose so much fat. What on me, it wasn't fat. I can tell you for sure, on Rami, he's not holding you in excess of the amount of fat. He's got abs. If you look at the next picture, the beta, but I just said to Sid, our social media guy, and the co-host of a lot of our TV shows here, that's pretty good at thigh shot. Now the advantage is that the rest of the body is a pretty sharp. But you don't walk around with sharp abs and have a lot of body fat. He does have a lot of fluid on his body, however, which can indicate his eating a tremendous amount of food or other supplements and being involved. So I think Rami size wise looks to be tremendous. His body looks well balanced. Now it's a matter of can Rami get in shape for the Olympia. That's the question we've been asking ourselves for what five years now. When is Rami going to show up at his best? Firstly, I'm not saying that he's just because I'm friends with Chris and Seater when Chris worked with him, I thought he looked the sharpest he's ever been. I'll give it. Let's leave it at the sharpest. For the night show at the Olympia, he was the sharpest of falling weak when he won the Arnold Europe. That was the best I thought we've ever seen Rami last year. He was bigger. However, he was not as hard in my mind. And I think a lot of other people's minds, especially from behind. So we know Rami can get lean, but there's a matter of getting him lean enough and full enough at the same time. Obviously, you don't want to flatten someone out. Yes, you can be flat at 285 pounds. Rami comes into flat, even though he might be the biggest competitor up there by 20 pounds. That's still not good. That's not a good look for him. I think hopefully the camera crew over there and Kuwait will find the right formula from this year. I don't think he's in trouble. I think it's a great look to be in 11 weeks out from the Mr. Levy competition. I think he's going to be considered the biggest threat to fill Heath on that stage and fill obviously going for number eight this year. Weather Rami comes in their shape or not. We don't know. Obviously, these photos that get leaked from oxygen and data of a diet himself are selected for a reason. They probably took 4 million pictures. And these are the pictures they want coming out. This is what they want to project. They want to project that Rami's biggest and ever, obviously. And they certainly accomplished that. I hope you guys are enjoying these updates. Make sure you subscribe below and turn on your notifications. I'm Dave Alamba with another RX muscle news update.

from the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida day one of the 2021 Olympia weekend glad you can join us on rxmuscle.com alongside the legend Chris Cormier. I'm sitting for Rookie the 2021 Olympia press conference just letting out in Chris. It was a radically different format this time around no longer having 30 athletes just sitting on the stage for a half hour this time they brought everyone out in many groups more like USC boxing a lot more entertaining fans got their money's worth this afternoon. Yeah, I thought it was definitely refreshing being in a 10 of those myself being up there with all the athletes and everyone trying to get their turn at sand something. I thought it was better like you know like a pace off style each one having a microphone type of thing and I thought it was great or you know all the fans loved it I loved it and I think that least loved it themselves and they get to go eat and start their preparation quickly. I know you have to jettle for just a couple of minutes to go to the gym with Breon and Zlee the press conference started with the classic physique guys first they brought out a Breon as well as Terrence Ruffin and eventually they had like a double-edged drop in with Chris Bum said made some entertainment and of course Breon decided to take off his shirt and give the fans a preview. Yeah that was awesome I thought Breon was looking right on the money and I was happy to see that everything we worked on the lower back was tight the as or tight everything's jumping and popping and I'm sure he's and some pancakes in there as we speak right now before we go to the gym. Give us a little insight on Breon obviously she looking to win his title back a title that he is won two times Izzy on track do you see him what is one of the adjustments rather that you and him worked on together to get that title back up back over the top. Well we was just working on just like his glutes are definitely more developed more strided more shape there the lower back we felt was a little bit not as tight as we wanted to be when we came out you know to the show so we worked extra hard there and the poses some just poses the way to Brazilian himself it wasn't even the opening this back I was screaming oh we not open up open up you back last year so you can probably hear me on the on the video saying screaming that but we worked a lot on that and because you know he haven't been competing all that long it's he's been only in a hands-for-the-shows he won probably at 9 or 10 or shows something like that but they were consecutive and there wasn't that many years he started the game later on in life but you know trying to pick up the speed but you know what the pose and like you know when the lights are on with your hunger you tie it you've been dying on his time you know that's when he is on the when you're gonna hit that pose right is everything gonna connect from head to toe that's where it's hard for us to wear a lot of people you had division by division many group after many group and Bob Chickeroa low coming out of trying to do what he does best and that is get some you know ribbing conversation get somebody to explain why they're going to win why they're going to knock off the champion well another one of the highlights of from today was big rami big rami they had a scale on stage they didn't use them much but they did use it for big rami big rami tipping in a 305 of course coming in to the game of thrones winters here the whole music the whole theme keeps on for 2021 yeah I thought that was awesome I thought it was a nice touch they used to have a scale back it was a 1988 with the lihanie you know uh little abrata uh Sean Ray all those guys were in the show I was in attendance I was in the last row the very last row but I bought my own ticket and I made it to my first Olympia and uh I thought it was a great touch I people want to see that they want to I think that you can do you know have it live just like to do the the in the may the you'll see I think you do that and uh it'd be very I think everybody would love that and at the end they had um champions and I guess some of the top competitors come out and essentially explain why they're the best for the heq why they're the best body but uh you know we do close on a touching note and that was when they brought out the two 12's the obvious absence there uh George Petersen they and let's give them credit uh dance Solomon Bob Chicorilla came out in the beginning and addressed the crowd you know uh dance almond also talking about the loss of Peter McGuff earlier in the year yeah I was in my guy right there I call him the silver fox you guys come Peter McGuff but I mean I used to call this guy on a daily basis uh sometimes uh during that four or five o'clock in the morning he still picked up the phone every time uh I love the guy to death when I I said bring my son to to his office and go through all his magazines and tuck shop and he just been really a big part of my life uh the whole time and and uh George Peterson we had a close connection because him and Brigham was going at it pretty good for a lot of uh I did at careers uh three years or so so I got to know him and Justin and I'm yeah my heart goes out to his family to his fans and uh yeah that's tough for the story it was a classy touch by dance almond by Bob Chicorilla by the Olympia committee to recognize Peter McGuff to recognize George Peterson also to recognize John Meadows who just about a year ago we're here at this very spot he helped us with the two 12 wrap up videos so you know again we say from our entire community the our expulsal team the body building community we continue to send our warmest wishes to all of their families but Chris this is going to be an exciting show this upcoming weekend a lot of story lines heading police you're about to go train with Brigham big rommies looking to defend his title what excites you the most about this upcoming weekend oh the competitors the you know seeing him all leading up to this show um they all want to bat the all been training hard uh Nick Walker coming in with his excitement I like I like his attitude like the way he goes forward and uh I mean he's put together the good physique I mean I don't I know a lot of people gave him some slack about how he's put together I like what he's doing I think he's working probably harder than anybody in the sport right now in my opinion he works just as hard as you know Brigham I think is number one but I think he works just as hard and I think he's on a gear around you see him on his Instagram giving the fans of looking to what he's doing all the time uh I think you have the right attitude for uh saying whatever I want to prove you wrong I did the same thing in my career so I like his attitude I'm gonna see him push him straight a title here from the legend himself it all begins tomorrow pre-judging and then the night shows we will have wrap up videos after each session less out tonight meet the Olympians so all the interviews that we're gonna be doing walking around we try to grab as many as we possibly can keep it a lot continuing coverage of Olympia weekend on rxmuscle.com

We launched the tasty pastry for the Ocar Pocktart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polonvo and today is Wednesday, June 30th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Once again, it's recap Wednesday where it means that we are kicking off today's show with the recap of last weekend's Puerto Rico Pro. We're starting off with the men's open with a Brooklyn beast that came Williams came out and dominated in his season debut, punching the win and another well-deserved trip back to the Olympia stage, this October. In the 2012 polonvo Peter Burrecki locked up the win and his first Olympia qualification of his career all in the same night after delivering an outstanding performance in his own right. In the classic physique Brazil's Gabriel Macado looked impressive as he crews to an easy win and we can say the same thing for your men's physique winner, Diego Montenegro, who might have been the best we've seen him here. On the women's side of things, Italy's Anadia Copotosto was as good as advertised in women's bodybuilding where she crews to an easy win and fitness to come back kid Darina Wilson delivered one of the best performances of her career which landed her the win, which has to make you feel good if you know her story and everything she's been through over the last year or so. In figure Puerto Rico's own Jessica Rays, a pediow is lights out from the minute she stepped on stage, which made it easy for the judges to leave her which straight ones across the board. Brazil, Maria Lemos, finished at the head of the class in bikini, while Tanya Schartran secured career win number three with another strong performance in women's physique. And we're wrapping up our coverage here with wellness where Casey Dolong brought home a well deserved victory. 4M of big proponent of embracing change because I feel like change is essential for growth, but in certain cases no change can actually be a good thing like what we're seeing this week from Huntal Abraata. According to reports, Hunter Wade in at 259 right out of bed earlier this week, which is actually where his weight was two weeks ago, even though he says that he's in better shape now than he was then. Since there are still four weeks to go before he makes his season debut in Chicago, I think we can expect to see those numbers move a little bit between now and then, but at the end of the day, the final number won't matter as much as the final result, which is whatever one will be tuning in for. Yeah, I know that I just said that the final numbers don't matter for Hunter Labrata, which they don't. With this morning, I heard Dennis James say that Big Ramey weighs somewhere in the Neha Vohod of £340 right now. And got to number that feels like it's too high, not to matter. There are a bit of few pictures and videos floating around in Ramey from different sources, but at this point I don't think we can say for sure if any of them are recent. But given DJ and Ramey's relationship, I think that £340 estimate is probably right on the money, which means that the champ is doing everything in his power to bring winter back to the Olympia stage in a few months. We all saw what that looked like last year, so this year ends up being a bigger and better version of that. They might as well start writing his name on the check now, because no one else in that line can even come close to bridging that gap. That does it's yet another addition of muscle in the morning. On day full of boar reminding you to always be sure to your passions, and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

We're going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car cocktail. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary food muscle in the morning. Today, Pellumbo, and today is Monday, August 2, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, is there any better way to start off you week than with exclusive content from Kai Green. In case you missed it last week, I shared a video on Instagram that Kai sent me asking my opinion on how we looked and whether or not I thought he should do the Olympia. And I gave my honest opinion, I said, when the Olympia no regrets. That said, I do believe Kai is going to compete this year, and if this is where he's starting from, the final product will be something special. Love, and more hate him, he's one of the most gifted athletes that we've ever seen in bodybuilding. And for him to come back and when the Olympia now would be icing on the cake of what's already been a whole thing worthy career. So get ready folks. I think Kai fever is about to take over. We can't talk about Kai Green and winning the Olympia without acknowledging the elephant in the room, which is the fact that he needs to go through our current Olympia champ big ramming in order to do it. Randy hasn't come right out and responded directly to any of the news related to Kai, in order to see half two. There's no reason for him to respond to people throwing rocks at the throne. But from what I understand, and Randy is teeming up with Dennis James again for his Olympia prep this year, and obviously we all know what the outcome of these two teeming up was last year. And there's no reason to think that they wouldn't be able to run it back again, especially if Randy isn't dealing with any injuries or issues related to travel restrictions like he hasn't the past. So what I 100% big rammy look like last year, and for all intensive purposes, that look was unbeatable. So if you do get a 100% rammy and a 100% Kai, I think it sets up one of the most intriguing matchups that we've seen in four or five years, and for me, well, that alone is worth the price of admission. Since there's no clean way to segue between the potential showdown between Randy and Kai, I'm just going to jump right into this new clip from Charles Griffin, because he looks like he's about to do a little bit of showcasing of his own next weekend at the Tampa Pro. This will be Charles's first time back on stage in over a year, and to his credit, it seems like he's bringing in a completely revamp, looked in comparison to what we saw him do when he plays seventh at Tampa back in 19. This version of Charles is bigger, has a smaller waist and has a lot more detail than he had a few years ago. And even though this lineup at Tampa is going to be loaded with top tier talent, if he's as good as advertised, he'll be right there in the running for a top two or three placing. One of our other storylines that I think is worth mentioning heading into the Tampa Pro surrounds really way cooler, and whether or not it's important for him to show up and show out here since he didn't manage to crack the top four in Chicago. Obviously, we know that really is planning to compete at the Arnold in September, which means he could basically be using Chicago and Tampa as test runs to work out some of the kings, which is fine if that's the case, but it also might not be too. We see this a lot in baseball, pictures hit a certain point in their career, and all of a sudden they don't have as much heat on their fastball anymore. It's just one of those things, father time remains undefeated, and eventually athletes just can't reach a certain level anymore. Now, just so I'm clear, I'm not saying that's the case, but really, I don't think we can say that, he's there yet. But I do think what happens in Tampa goes a long way towards confirming or crushing that narrative, which does make his placing their hold as certain in that of weight. So, guess for now, I'll just have to wait and see. Those are really still having enough in the tank to hit 100 miles per hour off the gun, or is he losing some steam on his fastball? Let me know what you think in the comments below. And that does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. I'm the Aprilumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

What's up, body million fans? Dave Palombo here with another RX muscle news update. Beta Badae leaked a couple more pictures of the Big Ronnie a little more than nine weeks out from the 2018 Mr. Olympia competition. He sent them over to Sid Sid Center, over to me, and I was so impressed by them that I had to just do a little bit of a little update on Ronnie. He potentially is the most exciting guy going into the weekend. Obviously, Phil, he's going for number eight trying to tie the record of Lee Haney, Ronnie Coleman, and then obviously the following year, I'll try to go for the record. But this is a big year at the Olympia Limpia stage, because it seems like this is a number eight is a tough number for people to get past. Guys like Big Ronnie who are lurking out there are just basically waiting to eat you for lunch, okay, if they come in and shape, it's something that's kind of a scary thought, because Phil is not like former Mr. Olympia, is where they were the biggest guys up there and they just dominated. Phil has got other editors that are way bigger than him. So he has to beat these guys on quality and conditioning. Ronnie so far has never showed up in the best that he could be. Even last year when he was second, he still was not his best. When I look at these pictures now from Beta, I'm actually getting excited because I think that Ronnie, assuming there's not 400 filters on this picture, you know, in Tau and Tau, it looks pretty legit. You know, I don't know, maybe the airbrushed is abs. I don't know, I'm just doing. I'm sure there's probably some filters. They got the magic mirror there, but Ronnie's got enormous amount of size. He's got good structure, good shape, his conditioning looks really good. The question is, how is he going to look from behind? One of those glutes in the ham is going to look like, are they going to pop on stage? Are they going to show definition? Is he going to be dry? These pictures would indicate one thing. We don't know, you know, however, if these are accurate pictures or if there's anything being done to them, Tau, you're my creative genius over there. Do these look like they have any kind of filters on them? They look pretty legit. All right, Tau says they look legit. Pretty wrong. They look pretty raw. I'll take it. That means Ronnie's on track to do some serious damage at this year's Olympia. And with only a little over two months to go before the show, now the excitement is picking up. All the stories we're going to hear from different competitors, what they got going on, what they're bringing to the stage, are all going to kind of culminate in that Olympia weekend. And look, I think it's going to be a show down between big Romney and Phil Heath. And there's such different physics, filming smaller, shorter, more proportioned, Romney just being huge muscle mass with good structure, canny bring the finishing. That's the question. We won't know. But you know what? We're going to keep an eye on the big Romney pictures and the big Romney story for the next eight or nine weeks. And if you guys have any updates, you can always send them over to us. Or if you have any little tips on Big Romney sending them over, he certainly under the microscope now. Now can he perform in the liver on game day? We won't know till September for now and day polo and bow. With another RX muscle, news update.

What's up, body building fans, Dave Pullembo with an RX muscle, news update, big rami update that is because Bader Badae has sent us some new posing footage of Big Rami less than eight weeks out now from this to Olympic competition I got to say. He's looking pretty damn impressive. Big, full and definitely the hardest we've seen. He might be hard to hear what's the deal in the last year. I'd be honest with you. I'd like the grainyness of his body and just thinking showing some good detail. He doesn't look overly big, meaning that you know they're not trying to keep him too big and too full, which is always a problem when you talk about weight loss. We get that side leg. He's got glute striations. He's got good grainyness there. Yes, some makes a little full at this point. But he probably might have eaten five meals already today for all we know. But I'd never seen rami with glutes this grainy looking at this, this many weeks out. Now obviously all this gunner's shit in the hand basket if they start feeding him too much. But I think he's definitely on track to be his best at this point. Like I said, this condition level is super impressive right now. You know, if you think about it, big rami may have the biggest glutes in body, but you know, think about it. I think besides them, I don't think I thought I had big glutes. This guy's got enormous glute muscles because his legs are just huge. And he has time to to peek his body. I think this is a great update from big rami. I think that Beta was proud to show this. Obviously no filters on this or anything like that. I think rami's on track to do some series damage to this Olympia. Great looked for rami and we'll keep you updated in the coming weeks as we get more and more updates from Beta himself. Day polimbo with an RX muscle quick news update.

Day below here for an R-AX muscle news update. This just in big rammy confirming that he will indeed be doing the IFBB Europa Pro in Aliconti Spain coming in the next couple of weeks. This is exciting news because a lot of people have been speculating when we would see big rammy again. It's not qualified for this year's Olympia so the absolute needs to compete. Most people have speculated that we probably would see them in Spain, seeing that that's going to be the closest show to where he lives. It's also a top 3 qualification. However, I don't think big rammy is going there with a place top 3 in qualify for the Olympia. Our good friend, John Enrico Picca is promoting this show in Aliconti Spain. This is a really important show because for European bodybuilders and people who don't live in the United States, this is really the only qualifier or one of the few qualifiers prior to the Olympia. This is a big one. The IFBB extended the top 3 qualification spots for this show in the men's open to 12 classic physique men's physique bikini and figure. Top 2 will qualify in fitness, women's physique and women's bodybuilding. This is the biggest qualifier in the year. I'm going to be the biggest show in the year but it's certainly going to give us the most qualification spots for the Olympia that will be coming up by December and Las Vegas. Big rammy, making the jump into the show will see him compete against the likes of Reagan Grimes. James Hollingshead and I don't know who else is going to be there and we're going to see some good quality bodybuilders there. Big rammy probably going to be the biggest name in the lineup. We're not aware of who are having an outskid if they made a jump. I mean, let's say William Bowenek shows up at the last minute. Putting aside anything like that happening, we have to assume the big rammy is going to be the biggest and highest ranking name in this lineup which is going to make him the clear cut favorites. So, Rammy goes in and doesn't win this show. It'll be a huge disappointment for fans and for the judges and for everyone who wants to see Rammy hit the pinnacle of bodybuilding which is winning the Mr. Libby contest. To me, this is an exercise basically just a walk through for Rammy. He comes in even at 95% I think Rammy walks away with this title and will qualify for the Olympia and we're going to see him in Vegas obviously and hopefully competing for the Olympia title. We've been saying to the last 10 years when his runny waiting for Rammy to show up at his best so that he can be the heir of parent to the Olympia title. If he hasn't happened yet, well it never happened. I don't know. I believe that Rammy is still going to be working with Chad, Nicholas who we work with for the oral plastic where he plays third. So I'm assuming that him and Chad are going to make some tweaks between then and now and we should see a much better and much drier and harder rammy coming to Alicante Spain. If he shows up at his best and really shocks a lot of people that will give him tremendous momentum going into the Mr. Olympia contest and I think that's what he needs at this point because no one's really talking about Rammy as a potential to win the show. You hear in Flex Lewis, you hear in Brandon Curry, you hear in Phil Heath. We haven't heard Big Rammy's name. The Rammy goes into Alicante Spain and dominates there, bringing the best look of his career. He's going to be anic that list of guys who could absolutely win that Olympia and that's what's exciting for the press for the fans and for I'm sure a big Rammy. So what's going to happen? We will know but it's an exciting prospect to see Randy on a stage again. It's certainly going to add a lot of intensity and a lot of whoop-lock to the Alicante show. I'm sure John and Rico pick his very happy that Big Rammy is going to be showing up there. Good luck to everyone involved and we will keep you obviously updated as we hear any more updates on the Rammy appearance in Alicante Spain and if any drama has ensued right without appearance. Alright, I'm Dave Polando for an RX muscle news update.

All right, television on rxmuscle.com. This is s-dave, better known as hashtag as Dave brought to you my species nutrition visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm your host of the Farooque. This is your 30th question and answer show with Dave Palombo. All your questions on diet, training, supplementation, IFBB pros, competition, whatever on your mind, it is all on the table, speaking of competitions. That's where we'll throw it today. Hey Palombo, Dave, this past weekend out in Las Vegas, the NPC, USA Championships, an exciting show, a show that you and Chris Hasito talked about on heavy muscle radio tomorrow, you have an entire lineup of interviews, a lineup of course, including Shane Stewart, the overall winner. Yeah, you know, Chris and I didn't get to go this year, which is the first year that one of us was in there, at least. You used to always both go. You know, you got kids now and the show takes 40 days to get through because it's a thousand competitors. No, I missed going to these shows, but obviously, you know, my IX-Hinteries a little different nowadays, especially with the new babies and everything like that. But the great thing is that all the guys that won really want to be interviewed and they kind of contacted me through their coaches and something like that and I contacted a couple of them. So we're going to have all the top winners on. We have the super heavy weight first and second. We have the overall winner, Shane Stewart obviously, the light heavy. We have the heavy weight winner. And a lot of these guys are going to be doing pro shows like in Tampa next week. So it's going to be great to get them not only off their wins and their pro card victories, but then also what they got to look forward to this coming weekend in Tampa. So I'm excited. I always love the USA. I love the nationals, you know, like I said, I might have some disputes with sometimes how things are run, but the bottom line is that the camaraderie in that show and what comes out of that show, the new talent that we then get into the IFB and which will change the scope and the landscape of the IFB is unparalleled. So I'm super excited and I think you guys are going to enjoy these interviews because a lot of these guys are new guys and we don't really know much about them. So it's good when you get new blood in the air so to speak and see where these guys came from how they got to where they are and what they think about where they're going. Shane Stewart of course, the overall winner, Dave, a lofty comparison to you, believe you said he reminds you of a younger branch war in them, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. He liked that comparison. So the funny thing is that, you know, when branch term pro and O2 I believe it was one of the heavyweight class at the nationals, he was impressive. He was impressive. He had big legs and he had like a good structure and he was ripped to the bone. But never my wildest dreams that I think he would be turned into morph into the mass monster that he became, you know, in the IFB. So I see like a similar look when branch was younger and just term pro to Shane. I don't know, Shane will turn into a branch war and but you know, if he does it will be an interesting parallel for sure. Let's get to the questions. The first two questions from the Dave Palombo experience app. The first question at the pros and cons to using pro penate over a sippunate or an Athenate, any difference in results at all. When I first started and I was reading, you know, I used to read the animal reference guy by Bill Phillips and they would say, you know, testosterone pro penate, short acting testosterone produces aromatizes last season. It's in the body for short period of time. The long acting esters stay there a long period of time but they tend to aromatize more theoretically. It's supposedly causing more fluid retention and stuff like that. But what I experienced, you know, from using this stuff for 13 years that I was on it, was that there was no difference. testosterone testosterone, the side effects are the same. If you take and propinate every other day, you're getting the same effects as if you take and you know, one shot or two shots of sest and an Athenate are sippunate a week. So the effects are cumulative. And also what I realized was that water retention is meaningless because when you're on a low carb diet, you don't hold any water. When you're on a high carb diet, you hold water no matter what drugs you take. And if you want to get rid of water before a show, you don't have to go off the drugs. You take, you know, you restrict fluid the last 24 hours. You take sodium out and you take a dioranic and that's a year rid of water. So once again, it becomes irrelevant what we talk about water. So many people are preoccupied with fluid retention. They think it's the same thing as body fat. It's not. The difference is body fat, you have to burn off fluid. You can get rid of in hours. It can be gotten rid of with the right dioranic. So it really doesn't matter which testosterone to use. And what I found was that I struggled with using an propinate for many years, sore, achy, very allergic to that propinate ac Sor oh He has a lot of people. And I found that when it took sipinate an an anfa, you never had any pain anywhere. So I said you know, what's screw this at some point. I saw not using propinate anymore. Probably the last five years of my career I'm going to have used propinate. And I looked probably better. Those five years that I ever did. So I just don't think that there's any reason to have to use one ac sor over another. And that's just the way it is, I'm just telling you the truth. question, Dave, that pick one for the best gains and explain it to us why test at 500 week with a 50mg n of r per day, b 50mg windstall eod, c 100mg master on eod or d 100mg primoeod. Well, master on is a stronger drug of all the ones that they listed. So, test and master on you to get the best results from this and and master on is really hard on your learning age because it's kind of an aromatase inhibitor, it kind of inhibits you know, prolactin to certain degree. So, I would have to go with test oscum and master on. Let's go to the Instagram questions. Again, you can follow us on official underscore our ex muscle. Let's go to holes, what 127. We get a lot of hair questions. My hair always gets dry went on cycle. We always talk about hair loss, but he's talking about dryness in his hair. Can you explain that? You know, that's that's an interesting, you know, observation and I don't know if dryness has anything to do with you know with hair falling out or not. Sometimes, you know, I believe that when you take out a box steroids that they kind of direct all the protein that you're eating into muscle. If that makes sense, this sounds like a like a ronic hormone explanation, but it doesn't sound very scientific, but I always felt that you know, steroids direct protein into the muscles from protein synthesis, build muscle, and sometimes maybe you're shorting your hair, and maybe you're shorting your nails. So, in other words, the nails and hair beds and not getting as much protein as they should be getting because the muscles are sucking up all the needed resources so to speak to build and repair muscle tissue, directed by the animal ox steroids. So, the steroids basically are protein, you know, are partitioning agents that direct, you know, all the nutrients in the body to go to muscle building and repair. So, I don't know if that's a truth or not, it's always anecdotally what I thought in my mind, but it is possible, same thing with essential fatty acids, rather than going to the hair, and you know, it's going and skin, it's going to the muscles, because remember all the muscle cells in the native of essential fatty acids as well, the cell membranes that is. So, is that the right answer? I don't know, but it sounds like a plausible explanation. Ripped grizzly, you've explained the clen protocol incredibly many times, but I can't remember every hearing about how we should taper off. Yeah, you know, I usually, the metahom, what you're taking, let's say you're taking the max, which I always recommend being a 120 microamps per day. Immediately after the show, I usually have guys drop down to 20 microamps twice today for a week, and then I have them drop down to 20 microamps per day, once a day, for a week, and then I have them go off. So, it's a two week taper off period, and that seems to work pretty well. Let's go to swallverham, O'Neal Day. We've heard you talk a lot about dioretics in the past, but not much about herbal dioretics. I personally use dandelion, and it works wonders for me as far as dropping overall water is concerned. Could you talk about how herbal dioretics were compared to prescription dioretics? I have used to produce a product called aquilize. It was, to me, you've a earthy is the herb that's the most potent in terms of fluid loss, you know, water loss. I combine it with a little dandelion in some B6, and these are just, you know, it's natural dioretics. Aquilize worked terrifically. We had to add it to tremendous fun. The problem is that you have to pretty have minimums to produce. I would produce it, but I wouldn't sell enough in them to make it, I would always, at the last minute, when the expiration dates were coming up, I would still have a thousand bottles of 500 bottles left, and it was a pay-in-the-neck. So, I kind of discontent it. I might restart it again if I can get small minimums. All right, but, you know, a lot of these companies, you can't get the price and you want to let you do the minimums. I love the herbals. I think they work great. The problem is, they work differently in everyone's body. So, as a prep coach, I want something that delivers precise absolutely known fluid loss. So, I know that if I give a half a diaside to someone, I know how much fluid they're going to lose from that, okay? If they have a lot of fluid to lose, I know if I give them a whole diaside how much they're going to lose. If I give them, you know, two aqualize with every meal, you know, five or six times a day depending on how many meals are eating, I know generally how much fluid they're going to lose, but it's kind of like I'm experimenting, you know, and it depends on people's bodies, how they absorb it, you know, how much fluid they're drinking with it, so herbals are a little less predictable. But I use them a lot with different competitors. They're competitors to compete naturally, or competitors that don't want to use or, you know, a diaside or it can't get it. And so, I use herbals all the time. I just find that the prescription ones are, you use less of them, and they're more predictable. Cody Plum, a competing in the Washington State, opened this weekend as a super heavyweight, 237.5 pounds, last three weeks. I've been carb cycling three load 220g, one high 500g, one hour 15 minutes cardio per day. I use diaside if my diaretic. This has gotten me a very good condition body fat very low. My question is, what is the best way to introduce carbs and water after competing in a house soon? Do you go back and training and cardio? Is my only show of the years that I don't need to worry about preparing for another show? You know, after a show, I usually just kind of eat what I want, you know, for the first, like, couple days. What I found in the past is that the worst thing you can do is just stop taking diaretics. Because the first 24 hours after you compete, you're going to still be flushing. You know, those diasides keep working, you know, so to speak. Even herbal ski working. So, if you compete on Saturday, you can eat whatever you want, Saturday night and Sunday, you're still going to be flushing. By a Monday, you're starting to gain a little weight Tuesday, you're starting to, by the end of, you think you think you're out of the, you're, you know, out of the danger zone at the end of the week, the following week. But that's when you just really started to retain a lot of water. Because what happens is when you don't drink and you take diaretics, you're out of the hospital levels, go through the roof, which is your body's poor amount of the tells your body absorbs sodium water. Think about it. You're flushing water out, you're flushing sodium out. Your body doesn't know what's going on. It wants to retain this stuff. So what does it do? It releases more aldosterone. Now the show is over. You start drinking and eating again, and this aldosterone is through the roof. So your body's retaining all the sodium and water. Every bit that you drink and eat. And there's no way around it. So what you can eat to do is you need to stay on a little diaryside. So let's say Monday comes around and you take a half a diaryside maybe on Monday on another half on Tuesday. What you're doing is you're just pushing the extra water out of your body. You don't want to restrict fluid and you don't want to restrict sodium. That's a mistake. If you do that, you're going to create the same rebound effect. If you continue to each sodium and drink plenty and you're just flushing out the extra water with the diaryside, okay, you're going to eventually equilibrate. I'm telling you. But if you restrict, if you go back to that diet and don't eat sodium and restrict your water, you're going to rebound again when you stop it. So just go eat what you want. Obviously, don't become a glutton. Don't eat like a thousand grams of carbs a day right after that every single day, or you're going to retain a ton of fluid also. But if you go back to eating, and having a maybe one sheet meal a day is supposed to eat in the whole entire day, junk food, you know, and you stand a little bit of dyeside. You're eventually going to eat it. That after a week, it should be good. Usually about three or four days, undoing a half a dyeside a day is usually enough to get you back to that baseline level. See, it fits the fit recently switched to keto, main sources of fat, our grass fed beef avocado, species macademia, nut oil, and almonds and cashews. At this point is omitaly is a totally necessary. Yes, I'll tell you why because macadamina oil does have a little bit of omega-36 fat. It's a matter of fact, they're perfectly balanced one to one. But it's not a lot. They're macadamina oil all of a while, even nuts. They're basically, they're just stick with macadamina oil and avocado oil, and all of those are predominantly source of monon saturated fat. They're healthy fats, they're omega-9, healthy fats, but they're not essential fats. So you need your omega-36 to get those omega-36 that your body can't really, doesn't really get in the diet very easily. It's an insurance policy because if you don't take it enough essential fats, your body will sense it's an effect the private state that will hoard fat. A lot of the bodily processes, including muscle repair, won't take place at optimal levels. So you definitely want to take omega-ly's, okay? Then the other source is a fat, you know, or kind of like, you know, just for health purposes and for, you know, metabolism boosting effects. I use macadamina oil when I cook, I put it on my foods, for taste, but I'm doing that for the health benefits of it and because I feel that it simulates my metabolism. It's really not being consumed because it's an essential fat. The essential fats come once again from the fish oil and the evening perimros oil, which is in the omega-ly's formula. Let's, what we actually have a couple of different questions, both as in the same thing, but for their particular areas, we have one in Korea as far as when it's facing nutrition, we'll go to South Africa and another for Latin America, the second part of the South Africa question is about extra vitamins and minerals, one needs to supplement with besides a good multivitamin and what dosages, also benefits of each that you might mention. What was that last thing you said, the benefits of what? No, the last one is also what are the health and physical benefits of each that you might mention, so I guess the additional vitamins and minerals, right? Here's the problem. I'd love to be in all every country in the world. You know, if you guys know distributors that want to carry the product, feel free to contact me and put me in touch so I'd love to work with them. A lot of time the issue is price because shipping internationally is expensive and sometimes these manufacturers or these distributors want to make a huge margin and my product line is a high end product line. It has to be sold that way. It's not the cheapest products out there. It's not the most expensive, but it's not the cheapest either. I'm not going to cheap in the products so that people oversees you have a buy. I'm not going to sell, I know a lot of these companies will sell a cheap rate version of their products in the other in the Middle Eastern countries in Africa because it's trying it up because it's cheaper to to give to the customer there. But it's not the same product. So I won't do that. I'd rather not sell there. Having said that, you know, the line that I self species products is so complete that there's really not that much you need to add to it. The mineralizes all the vitamins, essential vitamins, minerals, trace metals, and polyphenolics coming from, you know, vegetable extracts. It's all in one product. And then all the essential fats, which will left out of the multivitum, which you can't really mix them in there, are in omega-lices. So those two cover that. Then you got your fiber-liced, you cover it as your fiber. The only thing you really need to add, and I've said this before, is I would add an extra 5,000 units of vitamin D3. I have, I already have 2,000 in my product, but I think 7,000 IU's of vitamin D3 per day is perfect. That's just my experience. That usually brings your levels up to the normal level on blood and, you know, unless you're outside with no shirt on every day for 20, 30 minutes, you know, then you might not need as much vitamin D, because you're biting my field of synthesizer. But I always say, better safe than sorry. The only other supplements I really recommend is I use a product called juice plus that I really like. It's a fruit and vegetable extract product. It's not a vitamin product, but it's a fruit and vegetable extract. I just think it's good for good health. Not necessary for luxury item, I call it, but it's something that I use. I also take extra vitamin and it's actually in the co-cute 10, because it's good for the heart and the efficiency of the heart, right? So I do add that, and there's a couple others I add, and I don't think they're necessary. That's sorry, but if you're over 35, over 40, probably Coke, taking 100 to 200 milligrams of Coke, ketene day is probably not a bad idea, just to keep your heart functioning well. Obviously, then, every couple of months I'll alternate this in and out. I'll use kidney stuff for my daypalombo.com website, for my kidney, you know, function, for creatinein and B-U-N, to keep that down in normal range. And I use Bill LaWelonz, which I also sell at Daypalombo.com. I use his liver stable product, I mentioned earlier also, and why do I do that? Because just to keep my liver healthy, keep the kidney tube goes open, keep everything flushing out of your body. And that's really it. Those are really all I use. Then, every, like, maybe a couple of months, I'll work in another supplement. Just to see how I feel on it, right now I'm using these ostrich peptides for immune system. And I want to just see how they work. I always send the bottle of them, and I want to see if they work well. If they do, then I will recommend them. And that's usually what I do. Usually every other month or so, I'm testing a new product to see if it's something that I want to incorporate into my regimen or not, or maybe even to advise you guys to. I just started a Titan Medical Center.com, sent me their TV4, Fimus and Beta4, which is a healing peptide. And I just started taking that. So I'm going to see how I feel on that. And I'll report, we'll do a video probably next week on that, or maybe this week, and this week about how I've been feeling on it. It's been, I've been actually feeling pretty good and recovering from my workouts well. So there's always something I'm testing out. But once again, the items that I mentioned are the absolute you must use, everything else is a luxury item. Olympia six weeks away. So of course, it's going to be expecting a lot of Olympia related questions. Easy, why won't I say, and Dave, what do you think? Dave Romney has to do to win the Olympia? Is it conditioning in of itself or is it something else or something else needed beyond conditioning? Now, I think it's just a conditioning issue. And I'm going to say, I think that there's a good chance I'm going to be at the Olympia this year. A lot of people have been asking me, and I first said, no, and I might be going pretty sure. We have a sponsor. We'll probably announce that in the next week or so. And we're going to be covering the show. But I think that if Romney can bring conditioning, and we've looked better, sent you a couple of videos that I've done some analysis on said, and I think that Romney looks really good. Even Chris Cito said, he looks really good for five weeks or six weeks out, whatever it is from the Olympia. If he can continue to improve from this point on and no one tries to pull any crazy things with insane carb ups and something that he can beat Phil. He's got the tool set to beat him. You know, if he can bring the same conditioning as Phil with the mass that he's got, no way, Phil, take him. Good one here from, big pup-eye John. Again, a lot of our fans like to ask you about your bodybuilding career and stuff that you did during your career. What were some of your daily routines you would do every day, and you believe benefited your bodybuilding career? You want to know what my routine was. It was wake up like late because I would go to bed early late and I always wanted to sleep like eight or nine hours. Sometimes I wake up at one in the afternoon to be honest with you. I get my ass in the shower. I would get out of the house. I'd go right to McDonald's. I'd have my six cheese burgers there. I usually on two buns. Large fry, two apple pies, and then I would usually go to the gym. Well, I usually just are shopping if I had to get some stuff to groceries, whatever, and eventually I wind up at the gym somewhere. I train usually I have a postwork out shake. Then I would usually go tanning. I would go, if I had to go buy clothing or something, I don't know. I really didn't have a lot to do. I was living the dream. I was living the bodybuilding dream style. I would go home at night. I would usually buy some dinner. I would go for sushi or buy like three Chinese food meals to have in the house. I was eating every two hours around the clock. I was drinking a lot of shakes, obviously. I did a lot of computer work at night. I obviously back in the 1980s and early 2000s. The computer wasn't quite what it is now. There was no social media, but I had an answer to emails. I answered, I would post on some forums. I would search the net for information. I would read up. I was always trying to educate myself. And that was my life. It was very simple. It was no responsibilities. I would spend a couple of hours at night, cleaning them up and checking if they had kittens or whatever the case may be. That was my kind of like diversion at that point. I tried to keep it simple. I tried to take naps in the middle of the day after I trained and possible just to help recover. For a while, I was training people out of valleys. When I was doing personal training in the morning, then I was doing it. I was getting up a lot earlier. I was getting up at eight o'clock. Going to train people from nine to 12. I'd go train my friend Doug Wentz. We'd come back. Then I'd come home and I would take a nap usually. That's probably when I had my biggest growing years. Later in my career, I started becoming a light riser and I wasn't doing the naps as much. I was just sleeping later in the afternoon. But I was at the end of my career at that point. I wasn't really, I didn't have to put much muscle on. But when I was in my growth stage, sleep was super important. I really believe think about what a baby does. A baby sleeps like almost around the clock when it's an that's when it's doing its most grow. As long as you're putting the food in, you're not missing meals from sleeping, which I never would get up at an eating. I would go back to sleep. You're going to grow way better. If you're getting a lot of sleep. A lot of guys I work with, they work really tough jobs. They only get like four or five hours of sleep and they have trouble putting weight on and they have trouble losing body fat because their body is not recovering properly. So sleep, sleep, Kyle and Mara Nucci is marinating chicken breasts in a white vinegar precontas bad for the breasts protein does it value the chicken breast. Yeah, that's fine. You can use marinades until like that as long as there's no sugar in them or carbs. A lot of people, you know, you could start adding extra stuff. But if you're only using vinegar, that's fine. Soy sauce is great too. Just make sure you buy like keycum in soy sauce that doesn't have the added sugar to it. That's a big mistake that people do make. You can't add a lot of calories to your food if you're using condiments that have carbs in them and you're not aware of it or you're just being ignorant. Read your labels. The labels don't lie. Taley Alley, milk fissile does it affect Andrew Jin resenters. Now, all milk fissile does is open up the, open up the, the bile docks in the liver and they bite them wider instead of them getting pinched off. They're open when they're open. The liver can dump the waste out this detoxifying and get rid of it. And once it dumps it into the intestinal tract, it just gets eliminated from your body when you poop. So that's the easiest way to do things. I mean, the problem is that when the liver is being overworked to get it in flames, and you know, any kind of overwork syndrome will cause chronic inflammation. An inflammation in the liver is going to pinch these bile docks off and it's not going to allow the waste to pass through these small small ducks. And when that happens, that's when you get problems because then the fluid backs up in the liver and you get fibrieticiuming laid down. Sometimes you can get cyst formation where all of this, these toxins have nowhere to go. And so the body just encapsulates them and assists it sits on top of the liver. And I see that in a lot of people at this. You have to be very careful. Jimmy Massiam Dave, I have an abdominal hernia surgery coming up in two weeks. What do you recommend? I do over the recovery period to maintain my mass and maybe even look better at the end, which sounds like a range where I can start with light cardio and work my way back to full activity in six to eight weeks. The key is to make sure you keep eating. Don't miss meals. Don't think because you're not in the gym that you don't have to eat that you only have to eat twice a day. You know, it's insane. You should continue eating as if you've never stopped working out. Because if you've been working out, you know, religiously for long, long periods of time, it's going to take your body a really long time before it's completely healed up maybe two weeks. And by then you're going to already suck feeling good again. So don't miss meals. Big Rocky Sosa peak week essentials in terms of how to manipulate carbs, water, sodium. Yeah, I mean, I have a protocol that I use with with pretty much everyone in different different for men and women, but the protocol is pretty much the same. It just gets tweaked according to the person. I did not do anything as is foolish. You got to have a game plan that last week. The atomic beast have you heard this statement that vitamin D should be regarded more as a hormone rather than a vitamin. Why do some people claim this? Well, you look at the structure of vitamin D3. It looks like a steroid hormone, which it really is. It's a steroid hormone. It's or at least a precursor So, which is interesting when you think about, you know, being deficient in it might actually inhibit some anableness in it's going on in the body. So that's even another reason why you should supplement with vitamin D. Philip Role, what do you think about feeder workouts? Brent sees few cents every day of a hundred reps for arm shoulders to get blood in in the muscle and get more growth. Rich Pianna talked about them as one of the advice that he gave on YouTube. Does it work for natural bodybuilders? I've tried this. Never been able to stick with it for a long isn't worth it. I put feeder workouts up there with bridging between steroids because which is basically never going off a steroid. When you over-trank in other words, if you have a weak muscle, the reason it's weak is assuming your training properly is that it's probably not able to recover as quickly as some of the good body parts you have. So what do people do? They train it more. And what does that do? It makes it break down more and it doesn't even repair itself even in a repetitive or even less. At the long term, you want a bluesy muscle rather than a gaining muscle. So I think it's a terrible idea. I think once in a blue moon, if you want some month maybe you're throwing extra work out and they'll say have weak shoulders or let's say have weak pegs. And you usually do chest once a week and you train it really hard. Maybe you want some a while. You just throwing extra chest work out in there. Just to really stimulate that muscle and give it a little extra. But if you did it every week, you would over-trane that muscle. So you don't want to do it every single day. But once in a blue moon you throw an extra work out in there. I think it's terrific. Excellent. 187. I want my daughter to be healthy and strong growing it. Going as she grows up. Should I follow the same sort of approach, nutrition-wise, as I would in terms of the macros or just let her be and eat whatever other kids would generally be. Your approach with your kids. My son still too young but I would like to them to eat well. I don't think he should just let him eat with him. I want to think if you have knowledge about nutrition, it's good to impart some of them. But not be a Nazi about it. Not to be like, you know, like where they're whipping the kid at the kid. The kid has an M&M or something like that once in a while. You know, you can't do that. But I try to make my son at least be exposed to healthy foods on a regular basis. But I allow him to have a treat. I actually enjoy watching him. You have a treat once in a while. We go to McDonald's, you know, every once in a while. I'll let him have a piece of pizza. You know, if we go to like a buffet, my wife will have, you know, she'll share it. We'll just share a dessert with her. You might have some ice cream or some carrot cake. But most of his meals are very healthy. And I think that's what you have to do. That's to be balanced in their lives. Because otherwise they'll become dysfunctional eaters and they'll have eating disorders. You know, especially when they're but if you expose them to 90% of their food being healthy, that's enough. They can handle a little junk food. It's when the kids eat all junk food. That's the problem. Jim Madness, Dave, I know this question has been asked a lot of times that I would appreciate a short answer. What are my alternatives for a clomeet in PCT? Almost killed myself in my last PCT because of clomeet side effects. Yeah, you can use no that X. No that X is, uh, or Tomox if it is, does the same thing as clomeet essentially in block estrogen receptors, whether it be on the breast tissue or in the brain, it doesn't really matter. It does the same thing. Clomeet blocks the estrogen receptors on the hypothalamus in the brain and allows it to not be turned off by estrogen. Okay, and so therefore the hypothalamus keeps working. It sends signal to the pituitary, pituitary sends signal to the testicles and everything keeps going. Okay, if you don't have that okay, and there's note and the estrogen combined to those hypothalamus on the cassette, there's just going to shut off testosterone production completely. Time for a couple of more Howard nine is H.H. we're taking in the all-season bulk when it's main use at low doses, fat burning, skin, et cetera. It's really not even at low doses, it's main function is not fat burning. It's muscle building and repair via IGF1 release from the liver. So you take a shot at G.H. the G.H. goes to liver liver degrades it and releases IGF1. So that's the benefit of it. So and I think it works great because you don't have to take a lot of it, a small amount works well. It's just consistently using it. Last question from a bassier C. Dave the best work out for chronic knee pain. All account, all compound movements. Father me, I've tried all of various foot and leg placements. So we get a lot of questions for those suffering from chronic knee pain. So we want some other best work out you would recommend for those suffering from chronic knee pain. You know I had an E issue when I first started before I ever took an animal ox steroid for some reason it was driving me crazy. I couldn't do legs and I met a physical therapist at a bar and this girl told me that what you should do is tape your knee. She was an athletic trainer to tape your knee inward. So if here's my legs, I'm taping my knee towards the middle of my body, pushing the knee cap into the proper place because I was getting pain under the knee cap and she said you have a tracking problem. Okay and she's like it's not going to be fun having that tape holding your knee over but it's going to functionally work and I started doing that and it was helping a little bit. Okay and then I wanted to do my first animal ox cycle and I kept saying I want to wait for them. I'm healthy so I get trained and then I said you know what maybe I'll feel better if I take the egg so frustrated. I just started taking the animal ox cycle and I'll tell you within three weeks my knee pain went away. But I think also that it was the fixing of the tracking of it that really helps. So my suggestion is go see an ART guy like you know and have them work on the knee and the tissues are around there try to get massage on a real basis to keep the quads nice and soft and pliable and if that doesn't work you know obviously you want to take joint you know supplements I would recommend taking ART through the lives five pills twice a day you're going to certainly feel relieved you'll feel some extra lubrication in the joint and that might be your ticket to you know to salvage and so to speak. But ultimately if you go and get an x-ray done and you find that you have very little carnitally in there you might want to get a sin mask shot which is basically injecting liquids to no real fluid into the or gel like to no real fluid into the joint and then it kind of just lubricates everything and that a lot of times helps people too. One more quick hitter in this one from Camille B body building not sure if you address this in the past but if you have to say someone was your mentor in the sport whether now or in your body will agree or how to be. I say probably type two. Dr Scott Collin who invented Matt Drex was definitely a mentor of mine in terms of not drugs but supplements protein metabolism you know the science and what's going on you know and that's why a lot of my rants are based on stuff that he's rancid he's given me and luckily I always agree with everything he said pretty much. Another mentor of mine probably from a friendship and I guess you could say drug standpoint would be Dr Mike Kloffman who was a dermatologist after my sister and he was a big big time body builder he invented a lot of exercise equipment machines something like that and he was he was just brilliant this guy and he really was a mentor and we used to stay up to like four in the morning he he's like the train and just Jimmy had a key to I'd be there for four in the morning just ask him like question if the question if the question he loved he loved to have these discussions we had really really crazy you know like theoretical discussions about what we can do and how we can alter muscle you know size and recovery and different supplements and different drug cocktails and I learned a lot from those discussions you know even if some of the stuff was gibberish it didn't matter it was an exercise and using our minds to develop better protocols and a lot of my protocols I've developed because of him and because of those discussions so I want to thank him he's up with a big guy up there so may rest in peace that's going to do for this episode of past day of again we be remiss day we did mention throughout the course of the week especially on today's episode with a lot of the questions that we've been getting a lot of people sending their prayers to you to your father your family obviously you're going through a very difficult time so I wanted you to know that that RX muscle nation has been sending their best really throughout the course of the week and they've all been supportive of you and in your corner during your difficult time yeah I want to thank people I've gotten a lot of the great response from people and I didn't even I didn't even think about when I first started putting it up but you know the community does rally behind people when things are you know the chips are down so to speak and you know it's always tough to lose a parent my dad's a little older you know which makes it a little easier obviously I lost my mom when she was 42 and I was 14 that was tough my dad's a little easier but you know it's still you know he's been there so long now I just expect him to always be there and once again he's going to be moving on to a better place and he'll be with up with the other Jedi's up there and have it you know we're looking me and hoping to make sure I make the right decisions and protecting when I don't and you know I just I appreciate it obviously you know eventually my dad does let go it'll probably be a sad time for me I think right now I'm a little numb to the situation just trying to keep everything but you know it's tough tough losing a parent you know and a lot of people that can relate to that I think that's why we've got a lot of great I've got a lot of great responses from people giving me the wrong personal you know encounters with memory loss and old age and dementia and stuff like that and had a deal with it and Chris Hasido and I talk about it on the radio a lot because his dad's kind of going through the same thing so you know it is what it is it's part of life it's the cycle of life I appreciate all the loving and loving words and prayers and I know that's going to do for this episode of As David and brought to you by species nutrition for Dave Blumbo and our producer Tyler Shore obviously for repeat we'll see you next time

Welcome back to live with Brought You By Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is Becchi Superstar, I have to be pro Natasha Coleman. Welcome. You don't know what it is. Hello, guys. We've got a little bit of a delay, but we'll make it work. Now Natasha, you've had a quite a run this season. You've had first places, second places, third places. You've really been doing your work. A lot of competitors don't want to compete a lot these days. You've done over four shows already this year. You won in the year. You were second just two weeks ago. You're like the new flavor of the month in the Becchi division. You've been really establishing yourself as someone that's going to be very dangerous come a limpia time. Talk to us a little bit about the process, getting to this point in time where you are now. It's been an interesting ride because I build muscle very fast and in Becchiene they don't want that kind of muscle. First say, so I've had to find where my balance is on my particular body. It's been a while to actually kind of get my package together and I don't think I've actually fine tuned it quite yet, but come time for the Olympia. I think I'm going to kind of reveal something special and I'm really excited about it. Now, you have a very athletic look to you. You look like you can get out there and run hurdles and you can play volleyball, field hot, you can do anything. It looks like that. That team is a good look for the bikini division. Someone who looks like they're actually a functional athlete, not just a pretty body. Right, yeah. I re-entract in high school to shop put in high school. I didn't feel in high school. I was very, very active in sports. I think that they're going, they're starting to move more towards this athletic look, which I think is better. I think when bikini first started, it was little girls who just were cute and kind of had a little bit of abs going on, but not too much. Now it seems they're definitely welcoming more muscle. They're obviously they don't want the level of muscle. You would see the figure division, but they're definitely accepting of more muscle. If it looks athletic. Yeah, it does definitely seem that way for sure. And that obviously works to your advantage, because that just comes naturally to you. I mean, that's not something you have to work at. You go to the gym, you just project athleticism. Obviously, you're watching you here and you're in your species nutrition, which I do want to say that you're one of our athletes and I'm very proud of you and what you've accomplished this year. So I want to put that out there right off the bat. Thank you. What would you say, Brad? Oh, yeah. No, you're an excellent representative. Let me just ask you this though. What do you think that how can bikini, the bikini division get a more definitive criteria for what the judge is looking for? It seems like from show to show you see different judging of different betas. And it's not really consistent across the board. Would you like to see a more consistent judging of the division? Oh, sure. I think everyone would appreciate a more consistent look. And I think it's difficult because there are so many different shades when it comes to women. And how their weight is distributed per height. Women who have very small weights and whites at hips, you have very short women who are very compact, short torso versus long torso, long legs versus shorter legs. I just, everybody has a different look. And I think when it comes to consistency in bikini, I think a lot of us want more consistency. But it's just, I feel like it's difficult because someone look with abs and someone with like figure with abs if that makes any sense. Yeah, no, no. We'll watch some video here from the Greater Gulf States where the top three, all of you girls looked, you look like sisters all of you. I mean, you were very well matched up, which I thought was unusual. Usually you don't see a top three that is that close. Personally, I thought you should have won, but it was very close so you can't really complain about how did you feel that competition went and did you think that you deserve the win there? You know, that show was really stacked. I think we all come to win. Obviously, you know, we don't die at and train and do cardio for a second. And anyone who does shouldn't be in the sport. I think we all have a certain level of confidence and I think that all kind of it's on stage. I definitely feel out of the three. I feel like I was from most balance. But I was also the most soft. It makes any sense. Marcia was a little harder. She has a very tight waist. She's a very good competitor. She's been consistent for this year for sure. I mean, she's won three consecutive shows backed back. Back. So, you know, obviously I came to win. I wanted to win for sure. Definitely. No. It's didn't work out that way. Yeah. You know, it's interesting. The way the bikini division works is your lot of people don't realize it's just winning a show is not enough to qualify you for the Olympia because there's so many bikini events they made a new point system that obviously you get a win. You get a lot more points than if you get a second, third, fourth or fifth. But you still have winning one show might not qualify you for the Olympia. And that's why a lot of people might want to be wondering why you're doing a lot of these shows. Yeah. Obviously, now with all the seconds and third you have you probably have more than enough points to make it to the Olympia stage. Do you like the new system? They are pros and cons to it. The pro is you don't get a winner out of a week's show that goes to the Olympia and that's a place. The cause of this system I feel like the points should be a little bit more steep. I also feel like you run the risk of these competitors tiring themselves out before the Olympia and then looking like crap on stage or you run the risk of creating these eating disorders that something is being held straight. It's kind of scary to think that someone's willing to put their health at risk and be keen for sure to get to the O stage. Why do you think that you're seeing a eating disorder behavior? Have you talked to girls that actually told you that? I'm bingeing and throwing up or anything like that. I don't know anyone who's necessarily throwing up, I shouldn't say that. But it creates this body to some more fear. It's the most in the community because you go from this extreme because you have to be lean and tight. You have to be small on stage because the camera adds to the 15 pounds to you or you're standing next to someone who looks better at the winner. But your body is being criteria for the community. That makes any sense. We're constantly pushing ourselves to the max and finally get to the Olympia stage. It's the big stage to be on and your body is tired and everyone can see it. I think trying to figure out a strategy for each person individually is something that's very important for people. I don't think that doing 12 shows is smart to try and get into the Olympia. If you do 12 shows, you don't need to go to the Olympia. You're not going to get to the Olympia. You're not responding anymore. People can say all they want about bikini doesn't need to be as hard as bodybuild but it doesn't matter. If you do too much of anything, too much dieting all your around, your body just is sharp at you into the year. I do relate to that. But at the same time, I think it's important that we don't have 600 people in the Olympia line up because it should be the elite of the elite. How do you break it down? How do you say to yourself, okay, these are the best. That's gross, but the other girls can't come, you know? Yeah, I think that in that sense, the point system is great. It narrows it down for sure. I think taking away more shows and I hate to see this. I hate to see it. Taking away more shows and making it more difficult and looking at, you know, making it more fun is what I'm going to fight. I mean, we fight, but if you take away half of the shows even from this year, you only have the top people winning. I'm all of for it. I think there's only 10 girls at the Olympia personally. That's always my, you know, I say with the guy, it should be 10 people. I'd say 10, top 10 in the world go to the Olympia. And that's it. And it would be so much more interesting if you're only judging 10 people, you know? But maybe they should have a qualifier. I always said, maybe halfway through the year, they should actually hold some kind of a qualifier that, you know, qualifies you for the Olympia. I don't know. There's got to be a better way to do it. There's gotta be a way, there's gotta be a way, because even this year, there's still going to be less. 32, 36 girls. I know. I know. It's crazy. It's crazy. I don't know. Did the bikini competitors, I can see the body goes, we, you know, we go back and forth. And I especially on Instagram, they used to break each other's balls and, you know, they, you know, argue with each other and they make fun of each other. Did the bikini girls do that with each other? Oh, thanks so. No. Not, not because I know of, you know, you have your people who are, who want to be who they want to be or whatever, but I don't think we, at least the mature bikini competitors, I don't think that we go out of our way to, you know, make a big, blue blot. It's just like, oh, that's just who she is. Okay. And then we keep going. You know, it's not, I don't think it's necessary. It, um, it wouldn't make it interesting. Yeah. But I feel like women have a heart and up, you know, so why add to it? Now, obviously, having the physique that you have in the, in the great, genetic athletics, would you have a consider moving up to figure the figure division and trying your hat there or, or is the key, something that you can, you really love to do? Bigger is very competitive, too. Like, I would have to take several years off to, to be competitive and figure. I think figures good. I think I think the top women in figure are, uh, I think they are so loves it, a love of choice. So they are, um, they, I think the great representatives of this, of that division for sure. What, what are you way on stage and what's your height? Um, this last show I was 115. Um, and I'm, I'm 53 and 3 quarters. Okay. And what was the say, a comparable figure competitive of that height would weigh at this point in time? Going into the Olympia or just on stage. Yeah, in the Olympia, like what? In general. What are those girls' land? How much more? 10 pounds more? 15? I would think, I would think 15 to 20 pounds at least, yeah. So that's the thing that they get an out of muscle. Just because, you know, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a thicker amount of muscle, you know, um, and then depending on the age and the muscle maturity. I mean, there are a lot of factors that go into it. Of course, the posing, like, huge, you know, part and head. But um, yeah, I would think that they would weigh, my office is in late on stage. Yeah, sure. You work for a law firm now. You have a real job. Congratulations on that. None of these people do. Uh, thanks. Where do you see yourself, what do you see the future for yourself being in the cany? I mean, what would you like to do in the cany? And do you see yourself changing professions or, or do you like what you do in this, is, is bikini kind of like a hobby with you? Um, I mean, obviously, I would like something to come up with for sure. Um, I like reaching out to people, like helping people, um, especially reach their goals, their body composition goals. Um, I like inspiring people to do better, um, or at least to me help your decisions. Not like that saving lives or anything. Um, but I would, I would love to be able to jump the world and represent a company and, you know, just be interactive with with people who kind of want to do the same thing that I do that makes an instance. Did you have you struggled with eating, uh, disorder behavior from the past? Not eating disorder, for say, um, I didn't have a healthy relationship with food. Um, before I even gotten to bodybuilding, you know, they, they, you know, what was the, the big thing ten years ago, the high hydroxy cut, was it? Yeah. Um, so yeah, I was young. I was dumb. You know, I would pop those pills or whatever and not eat the night would drink on the weekends. You know, so it was just a very unhealthy relationship with food. Um, I never had a disorder per se, but it was always, you know, eat less, eat less, and do a cardio. And now it's sort of just flipped, um, with this whole, the key, the key, the competition and, you know, competing and then it's like that. And I have such a healthier relationship with food. Um, and, you know, it's, it's, it's been great for me, but for some people, it, it, it is a great for them. You know, I know you're saying this. Mental has to be there. Sure. I guess I, I know when I was a long distance runner, I had a terrible relationship with food that would start myself. So I wanted to lose weight because, you know, your, your lighter, your run faster. And when I actually got the body building, it actually cured it because you're right. Body building is the opposite. It's like you have to eat five, six times a day, and you can't miss meals. And all of a sudden, I wasn't starving anymore. And so it took the edge off, and I actually, and I actually booked better, obviously when I was eating right foods, and I was eating more frequently. So the, the whole competition, you know, bikini, figure whatever you want to call the division of your interests. And it really does help eating disorder and behavior because it's so structured and you're not really limiting the food you're eating, then I think it, it, it actually makes it healthy. And obviously the contest diet, you can get a little crazy. But the rest of the year, you have to admit it is a much more healthy way of thinking about food. Oh, sure. Oh, 100%. I, I feel that thing. 100%. Yeah. Now, you were obviously, you were also used a lot of supplements. You know, use our whole species nutrition line of products. You represent us. How important is it to you incorporate nutritional supplements and some, and protein powder stuff like that into your regimen? How does that work? Is it, is it, is it an important add-on for you? Or do you like to stick to main foods? What's your, what's your philosophy on that? Um, I obviously, I'm going to want more food. But I do, I do take a multi, I do, especially when I'm transitioning from off season into my prep. I take, um, liqueurize for sure, just because it helps kind of curves the hunger a little bit. Sure. And it, and it gives me, it gives me just kind of that, that head start that makes any sense. Yeah. Um, I take my summer life as it knocks me out. Oh, my gosh. Like that between that, the, you fertilize, um, what else is it? Fiberize those are my three go to, oh, my God. I cannot say enough. It seems like the fertilize saves my prep. We sell, we sell a lot of the pudding. The fertilizer is putting to women. I would say probably 70% of the people by the pudding from us are women because it's like a little treat you can have. And it takes the edge off that sweet tooth you get when you're diving. Mm-hmm. Yep. And of course we know in the touch of whether you want to admit it or not, all women have trouble pooping, right, when they're diving. So, so fiberlizes is a God send in that sense, right? I love fertilizer. I think I ruined one of my friends image of me because I was in his life. And so when had asked him like, hey, I do you take fiberlize. And God, this is terrible. So, of course I tried to end. And he hadn't taken it before. I was like, yeah, you know, you get these really silky pousse. But it's like, it is true though, you know, your women cannot go to the bathroom. I know I work in the lot of women. A lot of them get concentrated. The guys do too, but I'm saying women more so, probably because women's colonns are not as strong. And it really does help, especially when I'm content this time. The worst thing you want to do is get on stage and you can't go to the bathroom, you know. What, yeah, not so we're spilling other. It just feels like blow, it's just gross, yeah. Well, we're very proud of you. Obviously it's easy to nutrition. I'm also want to just congratulate you on the winner earlier in the year. And obviously the trip to the Olympia will be rooting for you over there. And, you know, the great thing about the bikini division is that it's wide open. And every year they seem to be, they seem to judge you pretty fairly. If you're the best, you seem to do better. It's not like some of these other divisions where it seems like it's impossible to unseat the champ. Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see because there's so many different women. There's so many gorgeous women in the Olympia this year. That qualified last year and that have enough points this year. So it's going to be interesting to see. Good luck. I'm on that stage. I want you to get back to work. I know you're doing this on your lunch hour. So we appreciate you taking time at your schedule. Of course. Thank you for having me today. Absolutely. All right. And that's going to take us to the end of another episode of Live with Brought to You by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesutrition.com And they pull on both. We'll see you next time.

realidad of another island that condiments Opción. Daypalumbo here with another RX muscle, news update. Guys, I want to talk to you a little bit about blood work because this is the time of the year. A lot of guys have been sending me blood work to interpret, read, give me my opinions upon it. And the truth of the matter is that a lot of us don't get enough blood work done. Sometimes I'm a little lazy with getting it done as well. I try to get it done at least once a year, but I really should do it every six months. You know, you want to check your, especially if you're body building, you're taking performance enhancing drugs or any kind of hormones for that matter. You definitely want to check, you know, you liver functions and there's a whole host of enzymes that cover that. You want to check your kidney function, which is creatinine and BUN levels pretty much. Those are high. You want to address that situation. Obviously, you want to check your blood cells, white blood cells that's your complete blood count. The CFF. Too many red blood cells in your body because you're taking out of all of it. Because you're, are your white blood cells too high because maybe you have some kind of a sickness or some kind of an infection going on in your body. You want to check C-reactive protein levels to see what your total body inflammation is. You want to check hemoglobin A1C to see what your average blood sugars are running over three months. Fastly glucose levels are always nice to get. It's a quick, quick reading that they do all the time. And then of course you want to do hormone panels. You want to see what your testosterone is. You want to see what your estrogen levels are, what your pro-lactin levels are. So that you can optimize these things. Your DHG or dihydrogen testosterone levels. These are all hormones that you need to have this data at your back in the disposal, especially if you're going to go and get them replaced. Now, titan medical centers is a clinic that I've been talking about for many, many years now. They produce top quality supplements. They have injectable vitamins. Really, you know, I started out with them because of the hormone replacement. And if you want to go in hormone replacement, okay, you got to get your blood work done. Now blood work can be very expensive. And a lot of you guys out there don't have health insurance. So I talked to titan medical, and I said, look, I have a lot of guys and a lot of women out there who want to use you guys and get hormone replacement prescribed. They want to get you want to get injectable vitamins like glutathione and some of the healing peptides that are now at BPC, 157, TB 500. But you know what, we need blood work. We need to see what your baseline levels are. And you know, I said a lot of these guys don't have insurance. I said, what do they do? I said, it's kind of expensive. I know that they will prescribe blood work, anti-medical, but sometimes it's a little cost prohibitive for some of you guys. So I talked to them and doing a special sale. And I know this is a time of year or about halfway through the year where everyone wants to see what they're going on. They want to get on them replacement for summer's year. They want to feel good and diggerous for till July 4th. Okay, till July 4th only we have a special going on. Full men's blood profile from 135,000 to $70. It's a lot of my, well, tighten gives you guys a very good deal to begin with at 200 dollars. But to get that for 130, that's a huge savings. So if you're thinking about doing it, this might be the impetus to make you want to do it. Now the women's panels are a little more expensive because they have to test estrogen for gesturing all the womenly hormones. Very normally at $300 those panels, they're doing it for 225 now. So if you don't have insurance and you would like to go through tighten to get this blood work done, even if you don't want to get any hormone replacement, I think for sure I'd be trying to get your blood work done. This is a super cheap deal for the blood work you're going to get. So if you're feeling like, oh man, you know what I should have gotten blood work done, I just didn't have the money, it's so expensive. Here's your opportunity. Don't delay because you know what, what you find out in this blood work could be integral into helping your progress in the future. Hey, you know what I didn't even realize I was high in this or I was low in that. Now I can correct that and make better progress, put on muscle easier, lose body fat easily. And then if you like you said, if you decided to take the next step and go on hormone replacement or go on some of these injectable vitamins, you've got your blood work ready to funny, it's all done, you're ready. You do your Skype session with the doctor over tighten, which is something I have to do now because it's been a year. And guess what? You're back in business right away with high quality prescription drugs that are made in a compounding pharmacy center, directly to your house monthly. It doesn't get much easier than that.

I know he watches the show. He hadn't gone to the doctor in 20 years, isn't like that. He was so nervous, he was like, Dave, I don't know what to do. I haven't gone to the doctor. I said, just go. At least you'll have peace to mind, and you take perfect care of yourself. There's probably nothing wrong with you. He goes, of course, nothing was wrong with them.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Motor 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low carb clock tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polumbo and today is Thursday, August 20th, 2020. And let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. There's one of his fans been on this earth. There have been epic tales passed down from generation to generation about how one extraordinary man was able to overcome the obstacles to slay a great feast. And a few days ago, blessing Wabba do found out firsthand what it might be like to be the hero in his own epic. In case you missed it, blessing stepped inside the zoo and decided to go one on one with a full grown male lion in a game of tug of war. Now, considering the fact that the male lion can grow up to 550 pounds, I have to pat blessing on the back for holding his own against one of the most powerful creatures on the planet. But if these were throwback gladiator times and there wasn't a full scaling closure separating them, you would need a whole lot more than a rope to conquer that bad boy. They say one of the hardest things to do in sports is to win back to back championships. Because this second time around, you come in with a target on your back, which means that you're getting everyone's best shot on a nightly basis. And a few weeks from now, second year men's physique pro, Andre Doe will find out firsthand when he tries to defend his title at the Romania pro. According to reports, Andre plans to make his season debut a few weeks from now in Romania, where he set the world on fire last season when he crews to a huge win in his rookie debut. Based on what I've heard, this version of Andre would easily beat what he brought to the stage last year. So what I'm hearing is true, Andre could be in a position to make this whole back-to-back thing look a whole lot easier than people might think. One of the most important things I've learned about being in business is that more isn't always better. And learning how to get better and more efficient at what you do is the real key to being successful in the long run. And just looking at what Brittany Campbell's been doing lately, it seems like she's trying to take a similar approach. Rumor has it that Brittany's in the early stages of prep for the Texas pro in November. Where I'm shortly looking to grab one of the last few remaining spots for the Olympia qualification. When Brittany's at top of her game, she has the potential to be one of the top 10 athletes in the figure division. So if she keeps learning and finding new ways to get better, Texas could be the perfect venue for her to showcase all her talents. If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the best way to get the point A to point B is to put one foot in front of the other and not stop until you get there. Simple as that, you just have to keep moving, take fun, Prima Guy for instance. For her the last two years had been a steady climb up the ladder in the women's physique division because she treats every day in every workout like an opportunity to take another step forward. And she's done it so consistently that now she's in their position to be a legitimate top five contender in this year's contest. She's walking the straight and narrow path and as long as she keeps putting one foot in front of the other, eventually she might end up walking herself right into being a title contender. And that does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on the Palaambo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

So there's a lot of people like to hate on the guys who are at the top, just the way it is in all sports. Do you see a scenario where a film where to win or a film where to come in just amazing? Show that last year was an evaluation that comes back all the time best. Do you see the crowd turning around and falling in love with him and respecting the physique that he brings? Because that'd be cool too. A film shows up and he's so on the money. So amazing. The best way to ever see him that all those booze suddenly turned to chips. I don't see it happening because I think people always love to hate the champion. Now it's so lost one year and he came out of comeback. Everyone be rooting for him. But people like, they don't want to see the same champion every year. It just gets boring to them. I think the guy who deserves to win, I don't care. Like Ronnie deserved all those victories because he deserved it. And it's tough shit on everyone else that Ronnie was the best body but for eight years and a row. Or seven years and a row. But I still like Janna one. Yeah, I did like Janna. But it was but Ronnie wasn't terrible. No, not at all. So the bottom line is everyone wants to see Phil Beans. I can't imagine a scenario even if he looks amazing that they wouldn't vote for him. But although the people in the arena tend to be better body going fan than the haters who are at home. It's involving everyone in home I say there's no way to feel it can win. If it's involving people in the theater, I can see maybe. There is a big gap between what goes on in that venue and what goes on in people's living room. It's actually amazing isn't it? You come home and we all do this. You spend the weekend with busy hostings stuff doing all the stuff that we do. And then you get home and you log on to the computer and you can. So what do people think of the weekend? Because you don't have time to look at it while you're there, right? So you come home and the feedback makes you realize that you saw completely different kinds of. Well, what happens if like Dex Jackson wins like the people's choice? You know, he could. Yeah, because he's very well-wired. Dex to take that. He'd add the eights from his the OA, the one we had at 18. He'd choose to his title. He'd do his Instagram. It's going to be a lot of abuse of privileges. But that, you know, just the same way you see guys who win these other divisions and they get introduced as Mr. Oralian. Yeah, they'll probably. You can see that happening. Although I think that a lot of the top guys would not want to have the daily owners of not having one. But are the people's choice? It's almost like like the the people of the shade Mr. Oralian's might get. That's right. You know, but there's a lot of people's chance, right? That's the thing. You know, the scenarios that would make everything interesting, I think, on a week and I think that that's why they do this stuff to hype it up. Yeah. I think they figure, well, who cares? The ultimate Mr. Oralian is going to be the ultimate Mr. Oralian. Nothing's going to change that. That people argue. And debate, it makes the Oralian be that much. It's a surprise. Are you surprised that they don't bring out the 212 winner and put him with the Mr. Olympic champion? Look back in the day that you should do it, right? I know. I've been saying they should do it. What are you doing? I mean, at the very least, the fans deserve to see what it looks like. Since the beginning, I would like to say, I'd love to see. So I should just be in flex Lewis's last year as a 212 winner. Just we haven't even talked about it. Yeah. Flex Lewis, you know, 20, I had heard a room and that he was at this year's last year. And I texted him and he kind of like blew me off a little bit. He's like, don't really hear anything here. Because we were talking about, I didn't know this, but I don't know if you know this. Let's Lewis use the breathing. Birds, fingers, parrots, parrots, parrots, he's racing pigeons. Okay. Because we have that net. He knows I'd bring reptiles. Yeah. So we were talking. Is this true? This little year last year. He didn't say anything. He kind of blew me off. And then obviously announced when coming. I think he's going to come back into the open. I think that's going to be tremendous. Yeah. He's got it. I know that Neil Hill is trainer. And people who are close to flex. We train with him. Everybody wants to see what that body could look like without the limitations. Sure. A being under 200 and 12 pounds. To the point where his body is trying to explode through that division. I actually feel sometimes that flex may have almost overstayed his welcome in that division. Now, there's no bigger fan of flex. Lewis, I mean, I love the guy. He's a great, great champion. He works hard. It's hard not to like flex. But I'm a little worried about him this year because a lot of that division was created for that sort of younger muscle as cleaner lines. You know, kind of that David Henry type of look back when he started. And now flex is a more mature body. Yeah. It's a little grainier. The lines flow a little differently. Yeah. It's still a great physique. And it will still probably win next month. But I'll tell you. It ain't a foregone conclusion. He doesn't like the criticism he's getting. And I understand where he's coming from. He knows he's not as best. He can't be his best at that way. Right. He's his best probably a 220 to 18. He can't get down to 212 and be his best. So when people criticizing, he knows the criticism is real. Yeah. And there's nothing he can do about it. You can't fill up in a day or two and regain what you had to do to make that way. It's just impossible. Yeah. You can look good, but you can't look great. So I think he wants to come on to a body bone stage and look his best. Look at Lee Priestley, priest competed with all the old guys here. He was shorter than Flex. Yeah. And he did great. He won shows. You know, big shows. And so I think Flex, I don't think Flex will win the Olympia. But I think Flex will be a very, very dangerous competitor. Right now is Flex a top 7 body builder in the big division. Now the way it's this minute now, but I think in the year we will. Yeah. I think he could possibly, definitely break the top 10 if you can. And I think that he might be even higher. Right. Look, bone acts up there. How much bigger is bone acting? I think we'll go back when. Bona is good. This is scenario where you could win. I thought he should have be Romney last year and if film had been off, you know, a little more than he was, you know, bone equity. I kind of feel like Bona not that there are physics compared, but I feel like Bona represents what Dekster used to represent. Being that guy, where if the guy's, if the guy's miss it, that he's that guy, who you kind of know what you're going to get now. And he's good. The problem with Bona is that he's not as consistent as Dekster. And that's why Dekster is the one. No, no. No one is. And that's, but you know, it's filled with kind of consistent too. And that's where his, you know, Mr. consistency, I show him. And that's why he's been able to win so many times. You know, he's, if Dekster was his biggest cell, okay, Dekster would be winning the Olympic at 20 times. You know, the last couple years, but the film came up. He was younger. He had a little bit fresh from us. He was a little bigger, a little round and more cartoonish. And he's a better version of Dekster. But he is, you know, but when he's off, Dekster exploits that. And that's why Dekster's so dangerous waiting in the wings. You know, it's like George Foreman, when George Foreman made that crazy comeback. And I was like, what is this all the fact I'm doing? But you knew he had that knockout punch in and Michael Moore stepped in front of him and boom, Foreman knocked him out. He's a world champion. So Dekster's there also. Don't, don't count him out. You know, you can't forget him. I think he's more dangerous than Sean Rodinus. I mean, just the story of Dekster finishing the top five again this year. It's been every year. I didn't believe it. Every single year, guys come and they go in the mirror. Dekster, he's got to spot the top five every single year. And it's remarkable. And to me, it's one of the greatest achievements in sports. To be able to do what he's doing, Deket in Deket. It's like, you know, Deket. He's like, you know, he's just, he's got that longevity aspect going on. He knows how to not abuse his body so that he can continue to get more viable jettin. Right. That's the best way to say. I know where he'll defend on the Fed that I would say he's going with. Galer Fitty. I'm sorry. But I feel like the Lugar and Lugar are going to be like, you know, the point is that, you know, this Olympia is really open. I think if a high green stepson, it's a real wild part of it. But even without him, Dekronmy is surging, we're just waiting for this guy to deliver the goods. Still knows he's there. Still knows that, you know, if Wormmy, Wormmy, if it comes in at 100% which he hasn't yet. He's in trouble. What you're taking on me commercial implications in terms of the business of bodybuilding, if a bodybuilder from that region, from that part of the world, or part of the world that we know is very fanatical about bodybuilding. Right. A bodybuilder with her. There's a whole infrastructure over there. If they had the champion, it probably wouldn't be bad for the sport in terms of the business of bodybuilding, right? Oh, look at it. Doring one. It didn't show anything. Right. I think I don't think that this ever a bad champion. And I don't think this ever a bad change. I think change is always good because it refreshes the sport a little bit. I don't think that we ever thought that we'd be a Lonnie that would come on the woodwork like that. So he's waiting there and you know, probably the bystander who's looking at pictures is like, this guy's not, he didn't win. Well, we know nuances of why he didn't win and why he's not his best yet. And he's why he has, you know, what the reasoning is, why the judges haven't picked him. But once he does win, because he will win eventually, I think. I agree. I think they don't be undeniable. Everyone will say, of course he's Mr. I might be looking at the size of this guy. He's out unbelievable. I told him because he just mentioned we didn't know he existed. We used to say that when Phil started winning the Olympics, the first couple we used to say that people would ask. So who's going to be the next Mr. Olympia? Who's the guy who's going to be Phil? And we would all look around at the current crop of champion. He doesn't exist. We don't know who he is yet. And then suddenly, Rami appeared. And Rami is legit. And I know you weren't, I guess you weren't that high in what you saw from Rami last year. No, I thought his conditioning was not that good. I was impressed. We had different states. It was a different angle. But I was pretty impressed by him. And I felt that what he showed, and I thought this was important. The conditioning in years past had been really off. He hadn't found his rhythm. What I saw last year was a guy who looks like he was figuring out. It was obvious to me that he was starting to find the formula. And if that's the case, there's no stop. I thought when he worked with Chris to see over the year before. I thought for the pre-chaging and lumping he was too fly. He didn't look good. But for the night show, he looked great. And then he won the Arnold year that we could have to keep. I thought that was the best I've ever seen. I thought that look could have possibly been in the middle of the last year. But he didn't bring that look. He brought a bigger look. They like big in the Middle East. Sure, they're a big, big, big, big, big, big. Well, they're guys. And it works for a lot of these guys. Branded. But I don't think Rami's so big that he doesn't need to be bigger. Yeah. And I think at this point they have to just play the conditioning game. And I think when he comes in with conditioning, it's a one-bedroom. You're not your ruling. This guy is when you look at Rami Wanker, what comes to mind? What do you think of when you scan? It's funny because we've all been around this long enough for nothing free to say. He's the biggest guy. He's the biggest man. He's the biggest man. He's bigger than Rami. He's the biggest human to ever exist. When they show these images of this guy, it's like a living walking breathing photoshop. Things are happening that just don't happen. I think the problem with Roli is that he's too big. And he's lost a little bit of proportion. Which as a bodybuilding, I don't care almost because I'm just like, look at this muscle. Look at that muscle. But I think the aesthetics are a little, are not quite as good. Rami's got very good aesthetics for a big guy. He's very balanced up or lower. Yeah. There's nothing out of proportion. So I think that Rami has a better chance of winning the one-bedroom. The issue of people's champion. Yeah. Roli Wanker. I think he's the most talking about people. I was talking about Chik the other day. I think I have like a weekly one hour of time. Yeah. I think that's what we spent about 10 minutes of the call talking about this people's champion. And Bob said you can write it down. That really wins it. If he's really so popular. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Marcus Roli would have been the people's champion back in the day. That's right. Because he never would have won the only one being. But people's loved the size. Yeah. Roli is the guy that would have done the a four-minute, the four-minute note, night of champions. Everybody went every single year back in the reward. Right. Because that's what he has like. And after all, if the bare root scratch roots, that's what bodybuilding is. It's about building muscle and coming in darling, free to heart. Yes. And the fans don't necessarily care about aesthetics as much as you think. Even though there is this like social media movement for the classic looks. Right. Most people don't give a question about that. Most of the fans want hard core muscle. And that's what we grow up. Especially now that there's all these other divisions where those other physiques. If they have a point. Can you showcase, right? So now it's like if we're going to get to the big stage. Let's showcase the big bodies. I am one of those people who does like the physiques the flow. I do like the degree of aesthetics. I marvel especially in the early years of fill-heat. I used to marvel over that three-dimensional muscle. I thought when he lost the Arnold Classic to the Kai was in 2010. That sounds very good. He was unbelievable. If you want to go back and look guys if you're watching, go back and watch on the YouTube videos. He was unbelievable. His waist was teeny tiny. His proportion. His size was perfect. I don't know. I definitely didn't need to get any bigger. Of course, as a bodybuilding we all want to be bigger bigger. Better. Sure. But I thought that that should have been Mr. Olympia. Yeah. And that was the ideal physique. So I think to fill genetically was meant to be Mr. Olympia. But every Mr. Olympia we've ever had as they've gotten later into their years. To the end of their reign. Their aesthetics have gotten awful. Because you know what happened? Everything rose including the waist. It's a tiny. Never have that. Rani is 99.98 waist was teeny. His 2004 or five waist was a lot thicker. Yeah. And that's just the way you know. You still look forward to going to the Olympia over here? Yeah, you do. You know, I missed the Arnold classes the first time. I did do 25 years. How you got this? Yeah. And I, you know, it's a taste. I don't even know if you're going to be able to be. I haven't decided. It's very hard with the on kids to. I think that sacrifice to the athlete. My wife alone for that many days without me being there. I don't know. We'll see if I have a sponsor. I might be able to justify going. If I don't, I might like Chris and the crew do their thing on the baron. It's funny. Like we all bitch and complain about stuff right here whenever I get to Vegas for the Olympia. It's that one moment where I have this real great new depreciation. I fall in love with body going to get ready. Every year in September, I go to the Olympia. Of course, you got the Wayne Johnson, the rock. They're all there. It's a great energy. Anybody who starts talking about the demise of body building. You walk inside that. Or lanes arena. You see Robin Shane stage production. You see the energy in the building. You appreciate the historic importance of what you're at. It's the singular greatest event in body going. And it makes me love body building again. And that's why I keep going back. Because throughout the year it's easy to get cynical and get caught up in the minutia of the negative stuff. But the Olympia, it's the hallmark. It's the Super Bowl. It's nice. You know, who doesn't want to go to the Super Bowl. That's the Super Bowl of our sport. That's what it's worth. That's worth. And I understand what you talk about. You do get in. You almost get excited about body building. Yeah. You become proud to be a part of this community when you go out to the end. And for some reason, whatever I go to these big events, tell me controversial always goes down between me and so and else. And I, it's, it becomes more than just anything. I want to be a week and all the world weekend. Me and Sean Ray or me and this person. And I, by your always the comment, did I? Yeah. I don't know what it is. It's like I'm a cold, very polarizing. You're honest, I very strong opinions. And I'm not afraid to give my opinions. And I think people, the fans appreciate that. Some don't. Most of them do. And what happens is that on those weekends, you're so charged up trying to do content. This and that and opinions that someone, invariably, you know, people block heads in a lot of times people back down. But I don't back down from strong opinions. And I feel that it's my duty as a, as a, as a press person to respond to that. Because the fans expect that. You, people asked me about all sorts of members of the body building meeting. I get asked about you and I always say that Dave Palombo is willing to go there. He's willing to go where I'm not willing to go. He's willing to go where most guys aren't willing to go. There's a lot of times where you'll do something and I will vehemently disagree with the fact that you just did that or you just did that interview. But it's served you well. Every industry has somebody who serves the role that you serve. So, and you work hard and I respect what you do. But yeah, you are willing to go places that most people aren't willing to go. Because you know what the only way change can happen is if someone speaks up right about it. And I'm not saying that I'm responsible for all the change that occurs. But I like to believe that a lot of the things that have been created in our sport may be changed. Maybe it has a little something to do with it. Right. Just by opening my big mouth and you know, and somehow it trickles back down and five years later they decided to make a change because of that. So, someone has to at least put the thought out there because if no one does, then then the sports stagnates and we don't see it. Well, the portion that can happen is for people to stop talking about bodybuilding. And that does concern me. Here we are. What do we tend to unrikes out from the biggest event of the year? We have a guy who's about to try to catch the biggest record in bodybuilding. These are big stories. We have the Kigreens story. We have Flex Lewis competing in the 212 for the final time. We have so many other dynamics in the other divisions that are playing out. I'd like to see more chatter. So, it's important for all of us to do our part to some people say, we're talking about manufacturing, we're talking about manufacturing. Well, I say, you know, manufacturing. If you got to do whatever you got to do, let's get people talking about bodybuilding. You know, Dan, I always do this every year for the Arnale. I always do pre-interviews with all these guys. I get the people and people talking about it. Do it for the Olympics too. And you know what I get? I get stonewall with the top guys because there's still with the stupid exclusivity. Why is Phil Heath exclusive? When Arnale would go, okay, and do the Olympics or promote movies. He'd go on every talk show in the entire world. Okay, because publicity is good for the gory. Same for the Olympic. Ported Mr. Olympia, Sheraton, where Flex magazine will all his sponsors on it and send them out and let them do media for everyone to promote the Olympic. You know what? The guy actually might be a like guy after that. If I got him in the studio here or if I got him on Skype and interviewed him, I guarantee you more people would like this guy because I talk to him alone. And he has a good heart. He's a good guy. I think he's a misunderstood champion because he's very passionate about what he does. He gets mad when people critique him. I guarantee if I sat down in an interview to I say, I guarantee if you sat down in a interview to people would have a different presentation. There's no question about, I actually watched Phil doing interview with somebody who I'm not familiar with. He talked about his life and his approach to business and I came away really appreciating Phil's brain. He's talking to me. He's talking to me. Very well done. I don't know why they won't let this guy do interviews with. And it's really only exclusivity. It's really him now that there's not a lot of guys who have those deals. It's only exclusionary for like, for probably you me and the other body. Yeah, I don't know why he can do TV. Let the guy do as many interviews as he wants. It's good for the freaking Mr. Olympic contest. I don't understand it. Same thing with Dexter and he got a couple of the guys under it. There should be no more exclusive contracts. It's the social media age. And we want you to be able to interview anywhere they want it to be. Because it's going to only help the sport. The good news is we are trending that right. One of the reasons I started digital muscle.com is because there were there weren't very many exclusives anymore. I have great content providers all over the room who have the freedom to provide content. Yes, Phil he does the number one body member on the planet. He still has his deal with the waiter and my people. And that's fine. But there's fewer and the fact that we can sit here by the way. Yeah. And do this now shows how much things have changed because there was a time where my contract for limitations would prevent this event. But I understand that there was magazines that there was a reason to have a season. But you don't have to truth this feels exclusive. They know what even uses him over there. They're not even using him. Maybe they'll have one interview with this guy. Why not let their champion let the Mr. Olympia represents the sport. But he's at the president of the United States for body level. That's right. Let him go out there and give his speeches and give his interviews and represent. He's a guy who's very well spoken. I wanted the reasons why they got him in there. I began much because he's a good representative. What the guy represent? That's the one thing that I really have a problem. And you should. But I think the good news is we're getting close to it. And we're getting close to it. I think simply because we're print media is headed. It's headed. It's headed. The resources are there to limit those guys the way it used to. Blacks Lewis is dying. He's dying. He's dying. He's right down here. No. No. Something contract. I can't say the freedom to do that. No. He does not. Because not be any good love to. Maybe. Imagine when you they take the title of the. There we go. But what are they using him for? What was the last interview? Some of the flex Lewis. Well, I saw the one that they just did. I'm also finished and flex magazine where he announced his decision. Right. But that was just like kind of an up news update. Right. Let's get this guy. He's the best rep. He's the best. The best of you have all tied. Right. This guy is the kind of regretter of. That's another body building. He just wants to talk talk talk talk. He's not afraid to call people out. He's very controversial. Come on. Let's. You want excitement in the sport. Let these guys talk. Open up. Take the gag orders off everyone and let these people talk because you know what? That's what the fans want. You don't need to people's champion. Let the champions themselves go out there and be the people's champion and speak. I guarantee you if you didn't lock these guys behind prison doors and not let them speak to anyone. They would actually be more like by the public. The public would get to know what they are. Personality was. No question about it. And it is one of the things that has really helped body building back. But those seeds were planted along the way. I know. It's an old guard system. It's like an antiquated system. It doesn't serve any of the stuff. The system sort of raises even in 2005 when I started probating on the weekly top radio. I would actually sign Jay color to my radio show. I didn't know. Think of the absurdity. Yeah. I look back on that now and it seems crazy. The one we mean Bob was sat down. We did a deal. He wasn't allowed to appear on any other. I remember that. Radio shows. It's now I love the concept. But at the time it was a big story, right? Jay couldn't go on your show already. Right. Well, in the time I was working for Muscle Development, I used it. And it's blackly was going crazy with you. But dance. I had dance on them. Because you were doing, trying to scoff up the interview before he did and you would put the gobash on it. And it was fun that day because he had you were valuable. And I can't see how Muscle Development. And it was flexed that didn't really have a radio show, but they wouldn't provide any content for you guys. So it was its whole like war. Which was fun. There's no warning more. The war's over. No one won. The only people who wanted the people survived. That's true and me. And I can't even say it in these survivors. And they're like on the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean. But the bottom line is that it doesn't expose the video as in serving more. The most important thing that we need to have happened is we need to everybody to thrive. Because that competition is what put money in all of our pockets. We had a compete with side B and had a spend money to be better than side B. We all won the athletes won. All of us in the media won. But now that's not the case. They're just struggling to get by. So we don't have that competitive spirit anymore. It's forces people to spend money. So as a result, the athletes aren't getting their contracts anymore. The whole model has changed for guys like us. So you gotta let these guys promote themselves? Because otherwise they can't make money. If you went into good flex loads and I end up in flex loads of the B2s, completely different interviews. And they wouldn't clash and people would watch both and they would think they would both break. Because I would ask them to completely different questions in you. Yeah, they wouldn't ask them about it. The first on life you wouldn't ask them about it. You know, what is, you know, hobbies are you wouldn't ask them about, you know, how close the competition was. You would ask them very concerned. So what would I ask you? You would ask, you just take your money. You just take your money. You're a Larry King. You ask all the questions people want to know about everything. The people like all the background that will be very organized, you'll, your flex will come out as like, Marlon Brand out in the right of you. And people will love it. And then I'll get them and I'll ask them every little dirty secret that he's got. And all the things that people think, oh, I can't believe you asked me that question. What do you say? Yeah. And so it'll be two separate interviews. And that's what you need. You see, it'll basically diversify him and show that he has different dimensions to his character. That's right. And you can get a third person who can interview and you get a completely different story about him. They could talk about something else. It's a broad reading business. So that's, and then all of the sudden people say, wow, flexosis is a pretty, fucking interesting person. That's true. But now they don't know what he is because he can't talk to anyone. That's right. The limitations are very, I'm glad we were there. Dan and I actually remarked this down. What's the, what's the day? July, what? We need to, um, I think the interview that would be really good is I've never really interviewed you the way you need to be interviewed. Um, and your story, and you hide up here in this treehouse up here, right? And you do your thing. Yeah. Um, but your story is pretty good. And I, to be honest, my favorite part about doing what we all do is, I love the stories. You know, Joey de Roe, he used to say to us, you know, he used to say it's about, we talked about the stories, not about the physics, the things that are, the physics are, what we see, but what makes this industry run are the stories. And I love the stories. I love stories about guys who went from here to here and back here and, and the things that they went through and even the athletes and what inspired them, what motivated them to do what they do and, um, on the business side, there's some remarkable stories of success and unbelievable failure. Um, things that we can all learn from, and motivated by that to me is, um, one of the, I was actually at one point when people still write books, I was going on people so red built, right? I was going to write a book, something like, like, a business of time. I haven't written a book because no one reads it, maybe. Right, there you go. But I was going to write, I was going to take, like, the 15 most compelling people that I've had the privilege of sitting down and telling their stories. Um, and it would always be like a college course type book, because these stories are remarkable. And they teach lessons. And they teach lessons, they teach business, they teach failure, um, they teach success. And I've always thought that that's sort of the thing that has kept me doing this for as long as I've been doing this. Yeah, that's, that's, that's the people. So this is the stories that they have to tell them. That's what, when I interview people, I try to find that story, the line, what's going on, you know, because there's a story behind every single person. These are the most boring person, and as an interview, if you could find that story, I think you did your job. That's right. And sometimes I can't do it. Sometimes I, I fail. I'm like, you know what, that was a terrible interview. And people might like it anyway, but I, I feel like I failed. But then sometimes I get to the heart of who that person is, and all of a sudden they unlock something that they had never talked about. And I'm like, that was the interview that I needed to do. We're all in search of that one. You know, if you're doing it, okay? I was the last person. I purposely waited to be the last person that I've been to. Because I was a person who did it. No, no, no, no. I mean, in terms of like, everyone, all these media sources, we're doing it in self-advalent. Okay. A lot of people in the interview, people said you wanted to do it. Because I know I have wanted to. And I sound like I'm not ready yet. And I interviewed him recently. And I, it was a four part of you. And I thought it was probably one of the better interviews I've ever done. And I think a lot of people agree with that. And while during reveal, a lot about his character, who he was, and he competing in what it was like to compete, and what he felt, all the things he went through. All the questions I wanted to tell was, is during never talked about anything when he was competing. No, I asked him all the questions I had, which people like, but then I got the last part. I got to ask him about some of the social beliefs. And we talked about the Holocaust. And now, because he had put out some controversial statements about how he had didn't believe it or really was the Holocaust. He was telling me that Jewish people had swimming pools, and they had softball leagues there. And it was, and none of us really killed. And they started a starvation. And I was able to challenge him. Now, this was not something I even, because they thought, but happened. Because I thought maybe he would say, oh, I just, you know, I didn't really believe that. But he, that was his belief. And I challenged it, and it was real. And it was real drama, and it was not edited, and it was his beliefs versus what I believe, and people like that. Because of that real. And he afterwards he called me up and he said, you think we should take that off. Because he didn't know I was going to ask him that. I said, no, that's your beliefs. I said, you're entitled to those beliefs. And that's fine. And that's what makes you do our innate to you. You left it in there. And I thought that was, that was the reason why that interview was so important. Because it was really, that was really the way he felt it. He wasn't ashamed to say it. And I wasn't ashamed to challenge him. It was a very uncomfortable situation, because I always looked up to Doryan. And I still did. I think he's, he was a, he was a, a great, great, great, spy, was a whole time. And he's a very interesting person. Well, but it was a hard interview to do. And it's interesting that you say that, because when we started doing this, years back, there was, the bar was lower. We could interview a guy about sets and reps. And people were fascinated. I remember when I first started doing a pro body of a weekly, he would call the enter. They would write in and they would say, I have some way to eat for breakfast. They would say things like, wow, that's the first time I ever heard Sean Ray speak. You know? And I'm unfortunate. You're Sean Ray speak all the time. No, no, no, no. But no, what an all seriousness. We know we have the situation. We're back then. People just wanted to grasp that any piece of information about their contest prep, their carb, the protein, their sodium manipulation. They were cool with all that stuff. And now with the access to the world has to do with that. So what you're doing is really important day because you're going there and you're creating a layer of exposure and disclosure for these athletes that they need because the fans, the people who consume this information, they want more. They need more. It's no longer good enough for them to just come on and ask some sugarcoded interview because there's not enough that to keep people in need. If you want to know that these guys are real people with the real process and real issues in life and real solutions. There's a lot of the, to be a champion, you have to be able to solve problems. Yeah. And Dory Nage was a great problem, solve it. He overcame a lot of injuries and drama in his life to win six Olympias. That's right. And the most unbelievable fashion of the time. And that's what made him so special. Ronnie Coleman too. Look where, look at Ronnie Coleman. Or you feel bad for Ronnie Coleman as a field vet for Ronnie Coleman. I feel bad for Ronnie Coleman as a summer's pain. But he wouldn't trade it for the world. And then when he went to Olympias. That was important. So that's an important story. You know, there he went. Look, I mean, a lot of people would say, well, he's crazy. You know, look what he did to his body. He sees crippled hours. He can't walk. And he's in pain chronically. But Ronnie Coleman was in care about that. I mean, he has to want to be in pain. But Ronnie Coleman would not trade a single day for, who would fur for those titles that he had. That he did what he wanted on his deadline. And that's, and he always reveals that. He always does that. And he's in a busy. He never says, no, I don't regret anything. I regret that I didn't do more weight, you know. And so that's real. That's, you know, that's, that's drama. That's what people want to see. Because you know what? There's not many people who are willing to go there. That's right. Sacrifice their body, sacrifice themselves. You know, give up pleasure to achieve something. That's right. And that's why there's not that many great people out there. There's a lot of people that just kind of, you know, live their life and they're happy with their families. And never going to do crazy great things in their life. Because they're just not willing to go there. That's why we enjoy watching the people who are because it inspires us. Well, you know, you get inspired by the people who trust you to help them tell their story, right? I, I, I, I, I told you the story in the past that the reds part story, right? The reds part, you know, contacted me and we all knew that he had months to live. That was great. And that was something that mean it meant so much to me because he was basically asking me to He was last interviewed. To help him tell his story to the world knowing that it would be the final time he would tell that story. So it's a big responsibility and it's obviously when you take serious things. Yeah, that was great. And it went divided away. But there's, there's just been so many great moments and there's so many great people that are in our industry. And as long as we have access to them, yeah, we can continue to access. That's the key. That's right. No more gangwriters get these to remove the, the blinders. Yeah. But yeah, thank you for stopping by. He's having that pleasure. I didn't think we'd see you came crying. No, it's like in a long island. People in the north don't like to go to the South Shore. People in Florida, East Coast, as you said, East Coast, and I was less accustomed to South. We stayed a little bit above, but before I had, I got to give her a shout out. House of pain, dress me today. I love the new house of pain. Joe, Joe Corbin, the crew of House of Pain. You guys are killing it. They want a great job. House of Pain.com. And I'm also wearing this cap. You guys might not know what this cap is. I don't know what this is. It is not a San Diego cap. This is a Marjorie Stomonduyber's high school baseball cap. Now, you guys might know that I'm from Parkland, Florida. Yes. So we unfortunately have unbelievable situation there. So many families continue to heal. And so many people are doing some amazing things to make sure something like that does not happen to GANS. Our shout out to everybody at Stomondouglas and all the great people in Parkland in that day, man. It was fun doing this. Yeah, absolutely. Dan Salmon in the Rx muscle studios. This might be a precedent in history that may never be repeated. I hope it will be though. Sometimes you gotta have me down to your studios. Do you even have a studio? Come on down. I don't have a studio like this. I don't have a set up on this, but you know what they'll find out you're coming? I'll build some film films. I'll get this out. Alright guys, I know this has been a very long interview. We'll probably break it up into two parts because I thought it was that good. For now, we're out of time until next week. I am Dave Plumman here with Dan Salmon. We'll see you next time.

Ben Weedor, that was his quested life to put the, well every show we ever saw him talk at the Arnold in the Olympia every year. It was the Olympics and this guy I'm talking to the president and we're getting a send the Asian games and here's the problem. Everyone thinks it's a drug related thing. It's really not because they can do the same random drug tests they do with every sport. I mean, and I'm sure that the athletes that can beat the test and we'll pass the test and I'm sure there are natural athletes that will be able to compete and beat the test because they don't take any drugs. But here's the problem. It's how do you quantify bodybuilding? There's no specific poses and scores. You hit this pose right, you get this many points. Like you do it like San and gymnastics or in ice skating and stuff like that. They don't have a quantify bodybuilding so you can score it. Even the posing around is not scored, which is the one thing that you can actually quantify. They haven't done that and until they do that and they probably won't because I don't think anyone cares about it. You'll never see bodybuilding in the Olympics. I think you have a better chance of getting fitness the fitness division into the Olympics before you would bodybuilding because at least fitness you can score the routine. And once they don't even have a quantify, they used to have a quantify-able scoring system. If they made one, you'd be much more likely to get that one in first. But I don't think the organization has any desire to put it in the Olympics. Once you get it on the auspices of the IOC, the Olympic committee, testing committee. Now they're going to want to drug testing and I don't think our bodybuilding organization wants any part of that. And I don't blame them. It's not worth it. It's not worth opening that can of worms.

Welcome back to Live with I'm Dave Palombo and today we have a very special guest. He's a superhero of sorts. They call them the Batman. The man I'm talking about is Aaron Baker. Welcome to the show. Brother Dave, what's up, man? I got Batman here. I'm so excited, man. I remember you know, we're getting in the magazine back when I was really getting into it in the late 80s and early 90s and I really hadn't started competing yet. Man, I see pictures of you. You'd have those Batman costume on and I was like, man, that's what I want to look like. You look like a superhero of sorts, you know, a pre-alibious superhero. Thank you. You got to have fun with it, man. That's what I believed and that's what I was doing. I had to figure out some kind of way to get my name remembered while I was coming up to ranked and being a Batman fiction hero that helped me have a little bit of fun with it. The thing is, the Batman that you were was not the Batman that's a kid's note today. You were the Michael Keaton Batman, right? Back in the day. You know, right around 89, I was in the Amateur National Level ranks, aspiring to turn professional. Michael Keaton came out with the new darker version of Batman. So there was a whole slew of Batman T-shirts, earrings, all sorts of memorabilia collectors items. So I had a ball where in different Batman T-shirts every day, you know, and match in the socks and having fun with it and doing photo shoots and Batman earrings and it just, and guess clothes and as Batman, just had a ball with it, you know. I went out to goals. I think it was the first time I was 1994 and I went into the gym. I mean, you didn't have a Batman costume on in the gym, but used to wear those tight, hot skin outfits and unitar, and I'm like, this guy is unbelievable. You were probably one of the most impressive in the gym body builders because you were always lean, you had the great structure and you would wear these outfits like that, like I mean, everyone had a look at you when you were trained. It was unbelievable. Thank you. I was playing superhero, you know, that gave me a lot of pleasure. I was getting to just have fun with the physique, you know, so many people, everyone's got their own style. You know what I mean? Some people loved to be covered from head to toe and Grace Wetz and crew neck and hoodies and, you know, that's your bag. Cool. I just, I don't know. I just like to play superhero. That was one of the things that inspired me as a youth and really introduced my, my natural artistic eye to, you know, to physique. It's like, okay, there are real people that look like that. Right. So you ain't the body building Aaron. I don't, I don't even know the story to be honest with you. Well, my older brother Larry got, he ordered a Joe Weedor 110 pound weight set. We all had that, yeah. And then he began to scrounge up every rusty ugly weight plate that he can find in the neighborhood. And he just began to work out and he drastically transformed his physique in like a year. Oh, wow. And he's shorter than I am, lighter bone structure, you know, the genetics were there. And he developed a nice physique. Did you give them a nickname? And of course, I used to sneak and read his muscle magazines. And he would always arrange them just right where he, he'd know that I'd been there. Right. And my, my magazines. And I'd, okay, okay. And as soon as he leaves, I'd be looking at the articles of Robinson and Zane and, you know, and, you know, you name it. People of the heyday. No, I'm not. You might mind most like, what did you like look up to and say, like, I remember Lou Ferigno always like struck a chord with me, but who did you look at and say, that's what I want to look like? Well, as a, like a 14 or 15 year old young brown body builder, first guy that caught my eye was was Muhammad Mac away because he looked a little like me, you know what I mean? And I thought this guy was so impressive. Yeah. And so shredded and so majestic. There was something majestic about his poses that were captured. Even in the still shots. Yeah. This guy was like a little ferro out there, you know, and, but it wasn't very long before Robbie Robinson caught my eye. I was going to say, I think of Robbie Robinson and I think of your physique. And oh, oh, my goodness, man, even today, there are things about his physique that inspired me. I mean, I always wanted hamstrings like Robbie. There are things that, you know, come on, we want everything I Robbie, what buys like Robbie, what laughs like what a little bit as long as Robbie, he's unbelievable to guys. He's like the incredible. I mean, he's still doing it at 70 or something years old. Exactly. And interestingly enough, Dave, I read a lot of his articles and studied what he said and adapted his type of training, the squeezing, the deliberate contractions, the full range of motion, the taking your time, the mind muscle link, the pain barrier. Because they don't even write about now days. I was a serious, you are a volume trainer or were you like more of a heavy trainer? I was always in between. I believed in heavy weights and I was trained to use heavy weights because when I first started training in my bedroom with the television on, watching, leave it to beaver, you know. Now you're dating yourself. Oh, I know. I know. It's out now. You've got to be, are you 60 yet? Yeah. Wow. Unbelievable. What, what, how old do you know? 60. Oh, you just turned 60. That's incredible. You're another guy who doesn't age. I've been in a few, a lot of guys who are just turning, hitting that 60 narrative. No one looks like they're 60 anymore. Romano is like 60, he doesn't look 60, you know. Oh, yeah, we had a good side reason. Yeah, I know John. No, he doesn't. He doesn't. You know. And Richie's right behind. He's right there. It looks like a kid, man. Unbelievable. It's the ice, I equated, you know, people say, you know, obviously steroids. I don't know, good for you. But I think that as body builders, we really live, you know, a pretty clean lifestyle in the sense that we ate well, we took care of ourselves, we didn't have a lot of body fat. And you know what, you don't get the wear and tear in your body when you're lean and when you work out and you're exercise and you're in fresh air and you know, we don't have a lot of stress from jobs, we're not working, you know, these crazy, nine to five jobs. I just think that the buy and fart body building does leave itself to the healthier lifestyle, even with the addition of the performance and handspoon stuff. Buy and large yes. I mean, even when I first saw Rob in the gym and I talked to people that were close to him, I found out he barely had dessert. You know, he's he would have a little tiny piece of dessert every so often, but rarely and he just had the lifestyle. Right. And I'm thinking, wow, he really eats like that. That's why he looks. Yeah. I don't need dessert either. I don't know why I was not even the sugars. I don't like, I don't feel good when I eat simple sugars. I have a fast metabolism, I can eat whatever I want, but I just need sugars. Right. Well, strangely enough, neither do I. I mean, I tell people, look, I can go months without having a piece of dessert. It's just if I wanted it's there. Yeah. And if I have it, I have it and then I go on about my business. Right. You know, if I have cookies and a body in the house, they were last because they were just, I just don't need to go and have one every day. And I'm grateful for that because there was a time when, you know, I would have, I'd be more inclined to have desserts. I think deprivation had something to do. I was going to say dieting, leagative, one eat, everything in sight, especially when you were Venice. I mean, Venice had the best place to eat. So when you'd get a more for show, I would go out to Venice just to go eat. No. Right. No one realized that the cheesecake factory started in Venice, it was that was the first place of what? That was the first time I had to eat in the air in the 90s. I was like, holy back, I was places I'm believable, you know. Crazy, man. Yeah. Crazy. And not to mention the firehouse. I mean, of course, the buckwheat pancakes. Hey, they put those on the map. Yeah. We'll practice this to all that crazy. This is the world renowned now. You know, what did you, were you born in California? I never even remember. I was born in, actually a Flint Michigan. Another Michigan guy, man. Michigan has a lot of great body balls that came out of that. But you know, I was a kid, very young, born there, then moved to Philadelphia, lived there for maybe five years or so, then moved to North Carolina where my parents were from. So I actually grew up in North Carolina, South Eastern Seaboard. So East Coast guy, Southern Heat and humidity. Yeah, you know, I was talking with Ron love about this. There's a lot of great body balls that came out of Michigan. But Tom Platt. Iris Kyle, you know, Linda Murray. Yes, people don't realize there's a lot of transplants out of that place. I don't know what's with Michigan, but there was a lot of genetic talent there, I think. Right, right. Recently, learned that Tom was originally from there. Yeah, so I, he had told me that too. I was surprised. I even forgot about that until he just reminded me. But there was a lot of people that came out of Michigan that were, that were body builders. And they just kind of moved to different places in the country, you know? Right. Well, you go where the action is. That's right. How did you get out to California eventually? Well, I was in the military for four years. I was an Army paratrooper and who was stationed overseas. One of the things that the recruiter negotiated with was the fact that my last duty station would be in California. Oh, wow. And you could have sent me to Tim Buck II. I ended up going to Korea as an overseas duty station. But I'm going to California after. So, but by then, I was a teenage competitor. A competitor on through my, you were a military. You were a military, huh? Wow. Yes. How would you go right to 18 years old, right, out of Cal, ice cool? 17. Wow. Okay. Right out of Cal, was that a culture shock for you? It was because, you know, it's an entirely different culture. Yeah. Entirely different culture. But for, it's, it's great for a lot of people. I mean, I had parents that cared and cared enough to discipline me. And, you know, so, but there's lots of people that didn't have any type of structure in their lives or discipline. And so, it's a perfect environment for them to acquire some. Right. It's the best thing for them, really, because, you know, you go out into life, thinking it owes you a living, no respect for authority or whatever. And then you learn very rapidly that the world doesn't work that way. No, no. You know, I went to school in my life. So I always had no problem taking, you know, direction from authority. But you're right. There's a lot of people that they can't handle direction from authority. Right. And, you know, I didn't go to the military. I went to jail unfortunately for five months. But I didn't have a problem there, because I don't have a problem taking orders from authority, you know what I mean? Right. And I'm, and I'm actually good like that, because I like to be told what to do sometimes, because I'm an ultra-focuser, like, you know, I like discipline. You know? You strike them as naturally disciplined, because even your dieting was hardcore, you know, and, you know, I'm like, gee, I wish I had to work with Dave when I was. Yeah. Was, was, was, did you have problems with your dieted? Was that something that was not on point? Well, actually, I came from the old school where you dieted so hard. You know what I mean? The low carb diet, diets, when I was a teenager. Okay. And so you stripped it down and then you carbed up. And so the science was changing as the sport evolved and it was a lot healthier, you know? And, you know, as the adage goes, if I knew then what I know now. You know, but dieting wasn't a problem. Even now, that's why we can eat night, you know, cleanly and have a nice, healthy lifestyle. Enjoy it without feeling deprived. Right. But I think like, when I think of Aaron Baker and I see on stage, I mean, you had, like, some of the best genetic gifts out there. We'll talk about your, your, your conscious history to admit it. But I felt like your consistency wasn't there. And I think that, that hurt you a little bit. To be honest, that's true. That's true. I, uh, one of my best conditions was, uh, I think it was the 94 iron man. Yes. You were great though. And, and I was right behind vents and, uh, Chris. Chris, for a minute. Right. So it was, I had entered one, uh, I have BB competition. I believe it was the night of the champions the, the year before. Right. But to be honest after the WBF, um, Fiasco, I was so enamored to enter any I have BB show. I just jumped on it, you know, and it wasn't really ready. But they opened the gate and I ran in and was lost in the mix. But the following year, I really worked my butt off to get in conditions. Yeah. And, um, I thought you were in the 95 either. Say again, I think you were great. 95, I remember those shows that you in Flex Wheel are going one, two and those shows. And I am a pro show. I had him on a couple of those shows. Yes. Miami Pro show and, uh, Iron Man 95. Yeah. I mean, you know, go figure. You know, that would say when you could say I could be Flex Wheel or on stage. I mean, that that's, that's to the accomplishments that not many people could could could even hold up there, you know, flex is phenomenal, you know, um, you were fit in. No, too. And, and I, I look at pictures and I go, wow, you know, and I can appreciate, um, all of it. And it was a lot of fun. But my point is, um, even though we're Fiasco competitors, I think you are, you start out as fans and you always, you'll always be a fan. I mean, I can look at pictures back. I can look at pictures of you and look at pictures of Flex and go, wow, that's crazy. Sean Ray posted one and there's always still that deep appreciation for what it took to, to reach that pinnacle. Right. I thought I had done the job that day. You know, I thought it deserved. I did a lot of people did, you know, flex. That a lot of momentum. You still have that stigma of the WVF, which we'll talk about a little bit. That definitely was working against you big time. Without question, you know, with, with obviously, we didn't, we didn't work around that would be a big deal. But, you know, he was. And so yeah, in Wayne was, you know, there's well, but, you know, but, you know, hats off to Flex. He's, he's, I look at some of the things that after I retired and look at his physique and what he went on to and it's just stellar. I mean, it's still mind blowing to the day. So there's an appreciation, you know, always, you know, for that. You, I did think I had that one. Aaron, when you won the USA in 1990, I mean, yeah, you were spectacular. I mean, as for amateur guy, I mean, you were a pro basically on that amateur stage. No, it was, what do, what did it take for you to get to that point where, hey, Aaron Baker is Mr. USA? I mean, was that a tough year for you, did you work hard? What, what do you think changed over the course of that last year into the USA? Were you able to kind of elevate yourself to that, to that level where you were able to win? Thank you. That's a good question. Well, first of all, that was a drug tested year. I remember that, yeah. But before that, to answer your question, I had two or three years scratching up the amateur ranks trying to get my name out there. You know, and it seemed like every national show I went to or state show or something, there were people that were already known. Now I didn't grow up in California. You know, I, during the California, you know, went up against Troy Zucallado. He won the overall heavyweight that year. I won the, um, think it was light heavy weights or midwitz or something like heavy weights. Um, you know, I always seem to be going up against the name game. So that, uh, aside, in addition to diligence, I think that's, uh, where the Batman thing came. The first guest posing that I was hired for, I thought, hey, why don't I have a little bit of fun? Right. Why don't I do something to make myself memorable while having that fun? But coming up the ranks, doing the, uh, nationals, doing the North American, doing the circuit coming up. Uh, and a lot of times I got kicked in the teeth. There are times I've got lost in the lineup. Right. Until aspiring young body builders look, my first competition, I probably placed 13th. You know, out of 22. So that's, you know, but then next time, you know, back then, though, people that really sometimes it was hard to make the top 15. They did an, you need to do an elimination round where it was, it was, it was so many people in the class that they would, they would do like a comparison and then they would call out the top 15 names and everyone else went home. Yeah, I know. I know. And a lot of times guys never made the top 15. No. And it was so sad too. It's like, no one cared. Now they're like, oh, everyone's got to get a trophy and everyone's got to post back into like, sorry, buddy. See you later, man. It patching the head and they go, you can get dressed in it. I see it. I can get dressed in it. Luckily, I never was out of the top 15. Do you mean that? Yeah, but I saw those guys. I felt bad for them, man. Yeah. It was. All right. See, she had coming up the ranks. You know, you placed in second year before people were talking about Aaron Baker. I remember the talk of the magazines was he's the next guy. Now you have pressure on you, right? Because now everyone wants to see what you're going to bring to that stage. How did that year go? The prep, who helped you? How did you make that happen? It went well. Still back in those days, it was just me. I mean, I worked in nine to five. And at one point, I was in undercover security agent. And I haven't walked that department store. Oh, really? That's cool. With my bag and there would be voices coming from my bag, you know, people would walk up and go, you're security aren't you? I mean, I don't know. Plus, you don't take anything. You are huge too. What do you think? You were enormous back then. Oh, yeah. Actually, Laura Kraval started working in the makeup department. Oh, no way. That's funny. So she was working to make up the makeup. And I was doing security. And she trained at Gold's gym. Yeah, yeah. And so I was like, this moment of, hey, don't you work out at Gold? So now, interestingly enough, we both won California that year. One, like Southern California, and then the California. And then, you know, we went on to place in national competitions and win national competitions. So it was, it was an exciting time. It was a humble beginning. But I look back on that with, with fondness and, you know, is that your greatest victory? Or was it one of the provv wins your greatest victory? Well, USA was the greatest victory, you know, because it was, you know, all mine and it couldn't be taken away. It could be like Russell, Vrb, or anything like that. And just literally enough, I had a lot of drive coming in. I felt good. I felt like, okay, this is going to be in my air. I'm just going to keep going. I'm just going to keep getting better and better. And then there came the climate change with the antibiotics testing. Right. So they did it in the IFBB and then they decided this year, all of the national level qualifiers are going to be tested. So what did you do? So what did I do? Yeah. Well, I knew a guy that was a practitioner of Chinese herbs. Okay. In this guy, he would always tell me, yeah, yeah, you don't need that stuff. You know, you need to be on Chinese herbs and you're a run. You know, they're a tonics that will build your blood up and that will, you know. And so when this, this, this turn of events occurred, I checked him out. Right. So how did it work out? It worked out great. I mean, my blood was so clean. Um, very healthy, lots of energy. Right. I grew, but at the same time, if I'd known what I knew a few years later about eating, about consuming calories, about filling out, about I would have looked even better. So were you, were you really natural for that show? I mean, did you, I mean, because I know you guys took things to try to beat the test and all that stuff. Did you all like it legit? All I took was Chinese herbs. Wow. And it was really good. Like, thank you. Like things that have been around for years and also, uh, Neil Spruce to his credit, uh, did my diet that year. Wow. And um, we carb up slowly and in retrospect, yeah. If I had continued, you know, would have been even better. But you know, it takes time to learn your body and going from an old school type of regimen into something new where you can actually come in bigger and fuller and more healthier. You're still going to hurt. I tell people all the time, I said, look, there was no steroids in body building. The same champions would be the same champions. I said, because they have genetic something going on genetically that is just makes them better than everyone else. And I think Ronnie would have been Mr. Olympia still. I think you would have still been as good as you were. You proved it. You know, when the WVF drug test, and we'll talk about that in a minute, you were the best guy there because you obviously probably needed the drugs, the least, you know. So, so, so, well, when the USA, okay, you get drug testing, you pass the test because you're drunk free obviously a lot of these other guys couldn't do that. And then, you know, here you have the opportunity. You got an IFVV pro card. You've known to the IVV and can be, but you don't take, you don't go that route. You get approached by Tom Platt's and Vince McMahon who were starting to, Vince is starting to WVF organization, finding organization that thrown out big contracts and the flying guys in, how did they approach you? Tell us how that all went down. Well, we were rude. Yeah. You know what I mean? And it was a great feeling. And I mean, come on Tom Platt's. Icon in this sport. And we all love Tom anyway. He trained at Gold's Venice for a time in World Gym and was just a stellar guy, gentlemen. Right. You know, very, very forthcoming, you know, just a good catch. Sure. So, he began to approach different people. And he was in charge. He was the liaison between the office and the talent. So, it was his job to help scout out and look. And I remember when I came to Gold's gym in 85, he was still training there. And Tony Pearson was training there as well. So, they would take his out to lunch, propose what they wanted to do. And you know, a lot of people, they wonder, you know, what was the, what was the appeal. They said, look, we wanted to make professional body builders household names. Like the wrestlers, like the football players. We want to have a weekly MTVish sort of television program. We want to put you guys on the map. Yeah, we're going to use your alley too, creatively. Oh, yeah. I showed them a guest posing tape of me doing the Batman performance. And it had this really crude overhead lighting, which worked out perfectly. Yeah. Because, you know, it just popped. Everything popped and they loved it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And they sent that, sent that to them. And I wish I still have that tape. Oh, man. Sure, it's floating around some place though. But they said, okay, this guy's a character. He's exactly what, uh, so, you know, what we need. What was the offer? I mean, there's obviously was a big monetary draw, too, because you guys were making no money, you know, you're an amateur. You were probably exactly, you know, like you said, you were security guard. So, I mean, what's, what are they throwing on the table at you? Waffer wise? Well, I was a security agent, which meant I wore no uniform. I just wore a detergent. I just carried a bag in there. You're on the cover security. I have a jacket. And I pseudo blended in with the customers. Yeah, I don't believe that. First act. You stuck out like a sweat, I'm probably. Oh, of course I did. Yeah. Well, you know, and people, and you know, a day, people still stole, and I would tackle them. Just like, you know, with the cops on, and it was such a spectacle, people would just watch. That's the security footage. That's the video footage I want to say. That's me, too. That mean, I'm like, did you really expect to get away? Yeah. That's crazy. It really was bad, man. Yeah. So what have been throwing the table at you to make you want to go over to the WBF? Well, here's the thing, as you said, many of us had scratched up. And literally, in retrospect, it was the best thing for the sport at the time. Yeah. You know, who wouldn't jump at that chance? I had no I had to start a contract. Joe, we had to give out contracts after that. None. And that was one of the main reasons that he had a problem with Vince McMahon, because for years, he had a monopoly on it. Of course. He didn't pay guys. Come on. He had his hand picked. Few that he would take care of. And that was minimal. Yeah. And he'd give out magazine pages. Spreads and pages. And oh, yeah, you'll make a lot of money. Yeah, how about the money you're making? But you could be paying me so that I can eat a lot sooner. So I can write pay from my tuna fish and then you get you know, which is all you could afford. That's right. But you know what? So Joe Weater, of course, in retaliation began to procure people. Anyone that came, you know, in his midst that had potential. I mean, he signed a Paul DeLette. He started snapping people up. Did you get approached by Joe to like, save with him? No, Joe, I never had a good relationship with Joe. We are him. By the time I had a meeting with Joe, it was post WBF. Right. And he gave me some line about you were you were in another photo, you know, he didn't say that. He said, oh, you were in the other magazines. That's a joke. Everybody's in the other. Yeah, exactly. Are you kidding me? You know, but, you know, my, my, my best friend at the time, Dave Durth had a contract. Yeah, I mean, so. So, um, so he gave me a line and I realized, look, now I'm going to beg you, dude. Right. So what do you think Joe just didn't think you were Markin? Well, I don't know how he couldn't. I mean, you were, you were, uh, I mean, you were Batman. Come on, for God's sake. I won't presume to know what was on his mind, but you know, he was an old school guy in Stubborn and very used to getting his way and once he made up his mind. Right. And in retrospect, I think about well, maybe I could have said this. If I had known that that's what I would have gotten. I thought for sure, you know, right. I'm like, dude, you got way worse guys on their roster than I. Right. Do you think I didn't even do with the color you skin? Well, to be honest, I'm not one that usually beats that drum, but, you know, I do live in reality. Right. And I do know of other people that have been in that climate, you know, and things, you know, these allegedly said and, you know, we're grownups. Yeah. And this is, is 2021. It's reality. I mean, let's face it. It could be. It would be honest. I thought, okay, maybe you got enough black guys. Yeah. I don't know. I, but there were plenty on his roster, you know, I can't say that. Sure. Yeah, it was a thing. I literally thought that. I thought, well, maybe he's done enough. Well, I think it was a combination. Maybe in the fact that you, you did the WBF thing. And then in addition to that, he's like, well, how many, you know, he's thinking selling magazine's joke. It's just a business man. I don't think Joe was a race. I think Joe was a business man. And he's, yes. What's going to sell more covers, David Dirt or, or, or, or, Aaron Baker. And, and that's why David Dirt had a contract. And according to one of his old quotes, you know, that that was the case. But that, I'm not man in anybody or it is what it is. No. And even, but in retrospect, I look and I go, wow, had I in any way known that might have come that way. I would have been better prepared. I was literally floored in shocked that that was the answer that I got. So I was almost speechless. I, I, you know, you look back and you say, I could have should have, this is what I should have said. And this is, I would have made this point. Right. It, it was bam. Like, are you kidding me? Is it a booze? Yeah. And you probably didn't, I mean, you were one of the top guys at that time. So I mean, it was, yeah, exactly. And I'm sure your play seems got hurt because you didn't have a weater contract because, oh, yeah. That was, it doesn't exist now. It was no Joe Weeter. But that definitely was, was dude. I knew by who is in let's see, who's on the roster? I'm like, okay, I'm behind him. I'm. I was telling the John in, it rich, it was like, like the bus. It's like, all right. Who's here tonight? All right, Aaron Baker, you just stand right there. All the buss up, you know, you're looking at, all right? Who's here? All right, it was like that. People don't know that today. But that sort of was like, when you worked for the waiter, you got the, you know, you get the nut. Now, you know, getting back to Vince for a second, I talked to David Dirk, Ray May, Rest in peace, you know, before he had to, obviously. And he said, you guys can treat like rock stars, you know, when you move it there. I mean, first class, everything, right? See, in the beginning, and that's the beauty of it. We both made this joke and we, we tell it in interviews, you know, in the beginning, they send you limo, and you know, and take you to the hotel, and take you to Trump's hours. Take you to the, the large hotel to meet in the conference room to have a, have a discussion, like when they were making the announcement that it was going to be drug tested. It was back when Hulk Hogan was in the news and, and the unfreephy list goings on behind the scenes with referees. And, you know, it was a whole sorted business. So now Vince has to address this, this issue of antibiotics. So he causes in and he says, well, you know, Senator Joe Biden, you know, as petitioned, you know, antibiotics. Was it, was it Biden back then? That's funny. Biden was the man. He was the one who did it. He's the guy who, trouble making that was president. Yeah. And he doesn't even know he's president. That's the funny thing. I felt like, you know, what's something? You know, Newman. No, so. But yeah. So bad, you know, I've known that name since then because he's the one that he's the reason why you have the USA that was drug tested. He's the reason that the first Iron Man was drug tested. And he really should be the effervescent. Yeah. Yes. So he came in, made a speech and said, you know, gentlemen, our next show will have to be drug tested. We are going to address this issue. And we're going to show that we are. Compliant. We are policing our ranks as it were. You know, they may not have been as exact words, but that's in essence what he said. So, you know, anyway. Oh, so that's what, you know, David, I would say in the beginning, limousines. And so after the second show, which all of the, you know, you've got guys that learn how to peek. You know how to peek a certain way. You know, imagine if someone looked just as good. You were the best one up there. I thought, yeah, you and the striadam, you know, and you. Thank you. Yeah. Well, I knew I wasn't going to get hired then, where I was, but I was grateful to be. Right. But just to explain to people, the WBF was like, WW wrestling at the time. Exactly. So there was a story line you guys, it's supposed to be a foul. So everyone kind of knew where they were going to place, but it was like the act and the presentation. And it was like, it was meant to be almost like wrestling, really. Yeah. We were characters, major guns, you know, the arcane, you know, you know, the giant killer. And it was a lot of fun. Oh, yeah. I mean, we go to Europe to the Fibo and have the biggest booth there. You know what I mean? I wish it would have continued. I think it would have made it. I really think it would have changed body volume, you know. It really would have. And that's the real shame is is the pawns on the chessboard suffered. You know, in a war between two kings, the pawns suffer. What? What has only been good for bodybuilding? I think it would have kept weeter and McMahon, what can be competing against each other. And they would have had to keep funneling more money into the athletes. Right. He's trying to, you know, beat the other guy. And I think that would have just, it could have made the sport huge involved. You really could have, you know. It could have also addressed a lot of the health concerns. Maybe it would have been approached. In a more. Healthier manner, maybe we could have combated some of the negative. Stigma is involved in and just arrived at better, more healthier ways to accomplish the same thing. Yeah. You know, without all of the negative press that has occurred. From abuse and what have you. But you abuse anything. Yeah. You know, you're going to get the same result. Yeah. But Dave, Dave and I used to say. Towards the end after that second show. Yeah. Now you have many people that came in. And that's a good shape. Now life quit was the worst. I think. Yeah. But it was tough for, you know, for people that have learned to peak. They've peaked a certain way all their body building careers. And then all of a sudden you have someone saying, well, here we have this gentleman here who's going new. He has a way. It's a high-fat diet. And this was way. It was falling. Yeah. Yes. And now I had just won the USA from a drug tested year. So you knew how to do it already. Right. I took Dave downtown. That's the Kimmy man. We're, we're going to get your Chinese herbs. Yeah. So I put him on him. So that's why he came in fifth. He made the top. Yeah. And we, you know, we celebrated. It was, I remember that day when they called us. We placed that night and then we had a big, had a huge press conference afterwards. Yeah. And they called us up on stage and awarded us, you know, we had our, our medals on and everything. Yeah. And so, yeah. It was, it was, it was, what was the reason they'd been scared you guys for anything to leave? Well, it was pretty, it was pretty self-explanatory. He didn't really call us in and say we're ending it. He really left it to Tom to kind of, you know, slowly slowly kind of, let the news out. And we could feel the climate changing. I mean, okay. Now here's the point. I was coming to you in the beginning. They sent limousines towards the end. It's like, oh, yeah. Find your way to the airport, you know. So we're seeing, yes, that's the first scene. We can see that the handwriting on the wall changed. Right. And just like, yeah, we'll see you there. You know, just, yeah, that was that one. That definitely wasn't a good sign. Now David Dirtelby party is like a maniac when he was in the WBF. You know, you know, did you, were you one of the guys that saved all their money like Jimmy Quinn or did you spend it all, you know, like when you were making it? Now I didn't make what Jimmy Quinn made. Okay. And I didn't make what? Certain been now. Just one of the USA, you get offered an amount of money, which is more than you've ever seen in your life. Right. And you go, that's a great deal. I'm going to take it. And then you find out what others have been offered. So you weren't making as much as some of these other guys were. You didn't know better. No, I did. It did increase the second. Oh, it did. The second year. But, you know, I didn't, I wasn't that savvy in that regard. I didn't have the experience. You were having to pay period. Probably not. And you know what, it was, it was a good amount of money. I mean, it's, look. You get 50 grand for doing what you want to do. You know, 40 grand, 55, you know, others started out. Well, above that. Yeah. You know, now if you're used to in, in London, McMahon, you know, Did the negotiating, she's an attorney, you know, she's a pistol, you know, very short woman. I actually did, I actually did a dive first. I know her very nice. Yeah. They, you know, Yeah, very short. Very short. And it was then that I learned the word in perpetuity. That's pretty, that's been perpetuity. They were just, you know, How are you in perpetuity, yeah? Yeah. But, you know what, she always treated me well. I got along with everybody, Shane. You know, they were kids then. I know Stephanie. Yeah. And once he took us all over to the house, and, you know, we were at the pool and just had just had a ball. Yeah. And then we were not there actually good people. Like I know them personally. They're really good people don't realize they have a lot of money, but you would never know it. They don't act like they have a lot of money, you know. I have nothing bad to say, you know, about any. And as a matter of fact, um, interestingly enough, after they, they decided to make it a drug free competition. Yeah. We had regular, um, unscheduled drug tests. Right. Now, after the second competition, we were still, um, you know, locked to that policy. Right. Now we heard from the great vine, um, I could say who. But someone who understood our plight said, well, if I were you, I would start, you know, preparing, you know, to leave. So, you know what that means. Um, now, um, I did have the, tiny, herbal thing, but, you know, the background, but it was also time to cut losses and time to prepare, you know, for the IFBB. So there was one test where our numbers were, not so low as they were. So, so Vince stopped a check. Oh, so they used that as the, as the reason to cut you guys, off. Well, no, no, I'm talking about two, particularly different readings. You know, it was like, up, your numbers have changed big time, you know, and I'm sure, if I squal, like, okay, this guy's on. Yeah, but in fairness, I talk to my liaison. He put in the word for Vince. And he said, you know, you're a man who was low in the totem pole. And you know, you're trans, you're making a transition. Sure. You know, you need that money. Absolutely. You know, so, and actually, I did a little bit of wrestling. After a retired from bodybuilder. I didn't know. Oh, yeah, oh, it was a lot of fun. I wrestled with John Cena. We had a match. Oh, because John said he used to work at Gold's gym, right? Exactly. Exactly. So John, we put on shows each weekend. That's awesome. I didn't even know you did. And it just, that's funny. You know, shout out to Rick Basman, who ran the ultimate university. Did you try to get into wrestling? I mean, because you might have been good for that, I think. I actually signed a contract with another Federation that didn't last. But I had a good pay day. And I had a lot of fun. I've got, I've got footage of it. Right. It was one of those that Russell Simmons had. And it was this, Okay. It's a ribbon type of flare. So you had people from all different nations. Right. And all different types of characters and gimmicks. And so. So, but it was, it was one of those things. I ended up tearing a bicep. Oh, that's it. That was the end of that. Yeah. It healed in. 12 weeks. Oh. I was released to train. Yeah. I got back. Got the bicep back. Right. You know, and that, you know, my first thought day. Oh, no. There goes my double bicep. Of course. That's why I would think the same thing. I just said bodybuilder right there. I'm ruined. I'll never, I'll never crack a double again. Is that why you got it? You stayed away from the wrestling. You said I don't want to get hurt. Well, here's the thing. My wife at the time didn't. She didn't want me to go back into it. And it's also not. The best environment for relationships. It's hard. I'm sure. You know, it's hard and relationships. It takes a lot to traveling a lot to it, right? You know, to gird it. So from that standpoint, I wasn't afraid to go back into it. It's just that, okay, you could have to convince your wife to go back in. And at the time, you know, we had other things to deal with. Got you. So I never went back in. But in retrospect, I look back. And I realized that was probably the best thing for me. You would have been right up your alley. I'm shocked at Vince didn't even offer you something like, hey, Aaron, I know you know where I mean, you're in wrestling because I think you would have been like, been plugged right into that whole thing. Really easy. Well, you know what? I had a ball doing it. I was in the training school for what? Two years, two or three years. And we were doing regular wrestling shows. So we're getting smooth and tired. I was still green, you know, by by by any stretch, but coming along. And I think I had a with a little more time. Could have been really smooth. And I'd like to think I could have made it with the right to the right push in time. But then you would have got hurt. Who knows, you know, and then, you know, Well, here's the thing about professional wrestling. It's not a question of if you get hurt. It's when it's when. Yeah, I mean, I'm friends with Triple H obviously do his diet. He, the guy tore a lot of muscles over the years. Both quads, you know, I mean, it's brutal in your body. I think as bodybuilders, we love ourselves so much that we, it's like, it's like, even though you know you can make a good living and you probably call your wife, right? You're very popular. . He's a thing. I didn't, that's not what stopped me from going back in. I've my wife expressed that you really, you know, Please don't go back in, you know. Now, it was a dream of mine to do it. and I did it and I was given enough to get signed and I had a lot of fun with it. But at the time, the other things are more important. In retrospect, looking at the way the business works, the climate of it. It's a very cut throat. I'm sure. And it's how would I have fared in that climate? Would I have subjected myself to it? You know, and many people don't, they cut their losses, whatever. But I look at it from this perspective. And I realize it was probably for the better. Yeah. I think it was just God steering me in the opposite direction. You know, I'd had a taste of it. Got to realize another goal. And but knowing what I know about the business and, you know, and what it entails. And not any, you know, not dense is just the business itself. What it requires. So, and I learned some of that even on the amateur level when I was doing independent wrestling, coming up the ranks, you know, you get sick. You're expected to go. You got a shot. Yeah. But I've got the flu. No matter. You're jammed in. Get out of bed. But I just threw up. We'll clear it up and get, you know, so. You know, that's what you know that. It's just going to say that. How did you eventually segue out of bodybuilding? What major to side are to had enough? You know, a lot of guys stay in it way too long. You kind of left when you were still, you know, really good. What major event, you know, transpired where you said, you know what? That's it. I'm done with bodybuilding. Well, I separated from my wife. Maybe a month or so or through weeks, maybe before the 98 Olympia. Right. And so here I am beginning to enter peak weeks. Biggest show, best shape. Most months all I've ever had. Right. Trying to dial in, moved out of the house was in a hotel. Completely distraught trying to continue and hold it together. Where she sick of, where she like sick of the bodybuilding is that way broke up or was it for a different reason? No, it was, it was a number of things. And it's never one person, you know, so. Sure. Of course. It's just in, and from a maturity standpoint and looking back at who we were, who we weren't, you know, you do the best you can based on who you are at that time. Of course. And so if you don't learn from it, then then it's in vain. But at that time, it, you know, I went through the motions and did the best I could and showed up off. And I look at the footage from that show and I go, my goodness. I think I had more muscle than this show than any other show. And you had been to the United Man earlier in the year. Second, you had been third at the Iron Man in the beginning of that year, right? Hmm. No, this was 98. I haven't, in my, in my notes here, you were third at the Iron Man, seventh at the Arnold that year. 98? Is that not true? Hmm. Nope. Okay. I was six in the Arnold, I think it was 1996. I have 98 or a classic seventh place Iron Man third. I don't know. And the lipid did not place, but I don't know. So, you're saying it was a, it was a, it was a terrible year because of the relationship. Yeah, of 98. And, you know, at that time, I think I was just tired. You know what I mean? I just didn't have the focus at that time. And even retiring, it, now, I also came across an opportunity to train at ultimate university that Rick Basman used to run. Right. And that's something I always wanted to, to do professional wrestling even as a kid, even along with professional bodybuilding. Sure. So it wasn't just this thing, hey, I think I'll try this now. Right. It was like, hey, here's an opportunity to go to school. Got it. You know, and so I did that for a while, for about three years, ended up landing a fairly lucrative contract for my experience. And, you know, and the timing and all, but, you know, was embedded all for a first contract. And I have fun doing what I wanted to do. I wanted to do that for. Say again, how long did you do that for? About three years. Okay. You know, is that why you made the come, you made it come back, I think, right in the old three? Yes. So I think between two between 99, 2000, so it was like 98, 99, 2000, I was wrestling. And then I came back in 2003. And I stayed in shape. I mean, I still train hard and regularly. And, you know, I kept saying, no, I'm not going to compete. No, you're competing. No one looks like this. You're competing. No, no, no, I'm wrestling. Yeah. I'm over here. I'm wrestling. You know, and then I decided, I'm going to come out of the retirement. I'm going to go for that, that master's in Olympia. Okay. And I thought, you know what, I can win that. I don't think anybody at 42 looks looks like me right now. Sure. And events had won it a few times. And then later on, I heard, well, he's not doing it this year. I'm like, good, Vince, you go ahead. You take a rest. That would be the worst thing he was mad, right? Because he lost to like, don't know what was. Ah, okay. Okay. So I didn't have the backstory. I just, I think that was the story behind it. Okay. Yeah. I'm sure that was a pretty big upset, you know, because this is raining, raining champ. Yeah. But so I went looking for a contract. I went to the Arnold. No, not the Arnold. But the Arnold. Olympia. Right. Decided to go to Vegas, make the announcement that I was indeed coming out of retirement. Um. Stayed up, stayed there. And I was still kind of in the world, you know, I was still very much in the world. Um, of train hard, work hard, party hard. Yeah. Okay. And um. So yeah, you remember that weekend? Yeah. Back when the Craig tightest parties. Oh. You noticed I just stopped right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was back in those days. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, made the announcement. Signed autographs had a, had a good time. Went back. Did the Arnold. I'm sorry. The, um, Iron Man. Um. Mr. Peak. Peak that night. Hmm. So it was just one of those things. Um, but the contract that I was waiting for didn't come through. Um, money wasn't there. No. No. So that was the, the whole point of splashing back and then getting some backing. Um, to do the, the, the, the Mr. Olympia. Right. Right. The, the master system. Never did it, huh? It is never did it. Yeah. So. And then. No more desire to get back on stage. What, what, what change in your life. Something had to have happened at that point. Something definitely happened. Um. Everything. Slow down. I actually stopped. Um. And I was, I was wondering what was going to be next. I kind of backed up and stopped. Oh, no. And a chain of events began to happen in my life where I was. Beginning to here, what I hadn't been hearing before. I was, I had grown up Christian, but I had been not. Practicing. Got to. I had been, backslidden pulled out. In the divorces, you know, there's no, uh, reason for the, the divorces instead of drawing. drawing towards God, I just kind of filled those holes with the world. God, you got to. God, basically. You've got to basically, you know, as a warrior, so. Second. You found God, God came into your life, the best way. Well, yeah, he, he, he, had just had a major encounter. And it, there's certain events that led to it that on the, the appointed day and time, I had a major encounter that just drastically just changed everything. I mean, there's no way I could have been the same guy after that. You know, and there's an expression that Mike Tyson made famous, you know, they asked him about a plan one time. You may know this and he says, yeah, everybody's got a plan to, you get punched in the face. That's right. That's right. And that's how it was with God. So there's many people that. They call themselves Christians or they believe in God or whatever. And, but that doesn't without a transformation, then you're basically not. People say, oh, I don't go to church because there's so many hypocrites there. But the, the Greek word for hypocrite actually means actor. Interesting. Yeah. Think about that. So in many people, you know, they can have a distaste for someone that says there one thing and lives another and to people's credit, many people do the best they can under their own strength. Well, a lot of people go to the gym, but not everyone's a bodybuilder, even though a lot of people call themselves bodybuilders because they don't really simply live the lifestyle outside the gym, right? They don't need to feel that. Exactly. They don't get the rest. They don't do what everything they got, it's practice deposing. So they're pretending when they go to the gym basically. Exactly. And you know yourself. They're people that go, oh, yeah. I used to be as big as you. Yeah. You know what I mean? Oh, they go, yeah. I competed in this and I won this show and you know within a few syllables. Yeah. They don't know what they got. My uncle, he was bigger than you. I said he was. I said, I'm just like 320 pounds. I said. Exactly. So the same thing with people that live, see without the counter, there's no transformation. Sure. You know what? And you want to share your encounter, is that something like private? You know, you don't. Do it justice. It would take time to set up. Okay. And then it would be so apparent. And the handwriting is on the wall. I mean, I could say what I heard in bottom line is, you know, God spoke to me. Right. So what are you doing with this new, you know, revelation since you found God? What have you, how has your life changed? What are you doing today with yourself now? What would happen then was everything changed? I mean, I quit chasing women. I quit like a lot of things that were part of my lifestyle that I would try to fill up this God-shaped hole. It's not only one thing that will fill that hole. And most of us, you know, we grab onto other idols just to make it through the day, make it through the night. So when that happened, man, I was so wrecked that there's no way that I could have stayed the same. I moved to Hawaii and see, when you have something that major, especially if it's of a spiritual nature to the rest of the world, you look crazy. I'm sure. I was like, what in the world happened to him? And I heard all kinds of rumors, you know, I was off in Hawaii, living in cave. I joined a cult, you know, it's like, what? All these weird things. It was probably the cave they found Ravey Robinson, right? What do you want to imagine? National stuff. He's living at the top of the mountain into the mountain. Right? You know, but I just surrendered everything. Sure. You know, you can't get anywhere without surrender. And it's, so that's one thing that a lot of people don't understand. It's like you can call yourself one thing. Just because you're going to church doesn't make you a son. God, this is make you a true Christian because a true Christian is not about religion. There's countless religions. But what happened was an encounter caused a relationship that I never had. And it sparked an intimacy that I'd never had. Did you know that you felt empowered by that, obviously, as well? Oh, my goodness. Dude, even now, it's like what I do now, which I'll get into is the supernatural lifestyle. The things that I see every day on a daily basis is just still never ceases to amaze me. So I see legs grow back out. I see people healed. I see, and see when I have that encounter, my eyes were open. I remember walking into Gold's gym one day to train after this. And I walked in about four feet inside the door and I looked up and I saw so much darkness in that place. I'm sure. I went, I got to get out of here. I turned around and I didn't go back until maybe 2018. Just recently, I went back and saw my pals and as a different person. But see, I have this veil over my eyes before then. And that's not all I saw once the veil came off. I saw things in my apartment that were there because I had invited them there through my lifestyle. And it never ceases to be amazing. And it's not all about goose bumps. It's also just about knowing it's an intimacy. See, you can't really even, can't really belong to God without the intimacy. Otherwise, you're doing the best you can under your own power. And people don't change by working on their character that changed by intimacy with him. So you basically weren't, you surrendered to him as we were. Exactly. That's the word I wrote down. So rendered. It's like, how are you going to have a king if you won't get off the throne? Right. And for years, I knew who I was. I knew what I believe. I had no doubts about it, but it was different when he showed up. That's interesting. Very cool. So what are you doing now? I'm so excited to hear what this is. So I'm in ministry. Hold on a couple of times. Do quite a few things. I counsel during the week. I'm counseling. I'm teaching and preaching. Speaking at conferences. Where are you living now, by the way? I forgot to add. I'm in Seattle. Seattle, Washington. Speaking at conferences, connected to an orphanage in Honduras. Impact ministries. And good friend of mine, Tom Stamman built an orphanage about eight years ago in Honduras. And now it's a city. And it's a, they grow mangos and pigs until opium. And everything, it just keeps increasing. And so they sustain themselves by what they produce. And then they sell it on the market to Honduras. And it helps benefit the city. They also build safe houses in the states. And all over the world that rescues, battered wives in child trafficking victims. So I go out once a week and I pray for people. So and I watch God do crazy miracles. And some of that's on the internet as well. But backs healed legs grow out, the legs that are in shorter grow out right before your eyes and things like that they never get old. So I live a supernatural lifestyle. That's what? Which just when I say that, some will think I'm diluted. Some more things get crazy because it sounds crazy. But I believe you. I truly believe you. I know you do. And that's the fun part is, oh yeah, I said it's crazy. But something I'm diluted, something I'm mistaken. But others get it. Others know exactly what I'm talking about. And they know that I don't even have to convince anybody. Question is, even as I speak now, there are certain people whose hearts are being touched by what I'm saying because all you have to do is look at the world and what's going on right now. And you realize there's a lot of darkness there. And if there's a lot of darkness, you know that there's light and there's enough light. So that's what, and from time to time I will still help someone with a competition with a diet or a posing, bring up a body part. Because once you're a fan, you never stop. I mean, you counsel body goes, like, let's say a guy is feeling lost or something like that's something that you have people wanted to contact you and then talk to you. Oh yeah, I do a lot of that. I see deliverance. You name it. Because there's always a need. And we've all been through things. Bondage is bondage, whether it's drugs, whether it's lust, whether it's alcohol, whether it's drugs, you know. And it's not about religion. You can work out religiously as we both know. But that doesn't bring you any closer to God. It doesn't. Body bullying is a lot of that over compensation for other emotional, you know, short we got going on and we all know that. I mean, come on. But how? Go ahead. But to get to that next to pass that and to get past that, it, you know, that takes time. Like you said, it does require surrender. A lot of us are such control freaks that we can't do that. And so until you are ready to do that, you're not going to change anything in your life, you know. Exactly. Exactly. You know, that was the first thing that I realized is that even growing up being a believer, I never gave God my, never gave my 100%. It's just like Bondage Bowman. You know, the rules are simple. You do the work. You train hard. You match your nutrition. You tow the line. You do what it requires and you will yield the fruit. And it's the same, you know, in your spiritual walk. But so many of us want to see Jesus doesn't date. And so if you're in a relationship with someone and it is basically a marriage to God, you know. But you were like, oh, yeah, oh, I'm with you. But I'm going to take this old girlfriend out. She's only going to be in town for the baby. They'll be home. They'll be yours. You know, so the cool part is, you know, God does the heavy lifting. Yeah. You know, if you surrender, and I used to think, oh, man, you know, I'm going to be the one and these boring Christians. I'm going to be on a man. I'm not going to be my half of a lot. You know, what will I do without this in that wild? Was that wrong? Was that wrong? I probably would be the greatest high that people could even imagine they just don't realize it because no one wants to go to that place because it's sometimes it's scary for people. I like, you know, well, exactly. And it's like, it's like the book Green Eggs and Ham, which I probably be like shouted down with arrows for mentioning your doctor's, the soup book. Yeah. But you know, it's like Green Eggs and Ham. It's like all through the book. This guy is like, I will not eat Green Eggs and Ham. I will not eat them. Sam, I am. Will not eat them with a mouse. I will not eat them in a house. You know, and then finally he breaks down. Oh, dude. All right, fine. It eats them. He makes it ham. And then you see that picture of his face. You know, this is the bomb. You know, you just see like these intensity coming from his head, you know, his face. Then he's got his arm around the dude walking with, walking with Sam. So for years, you know, I thought, and I, I clung to a lot of things that, you know, give you a short-lived pleasure, you know, but they don't give you peace. Yeah. There's so many, I've trained billionaires that have a lot of money, but they don't have peace. No, it's scary. People think money brings you peace. No, but I was in an action, bring you more motivation, you know. And also exposes who you are, you know. Yeah. It's not good. But then he get money is not evil either. I think a lot of people. And then it's one of the other, you could have everything, you could, if you find balance, you could have it all, you know, I think. It, exactly. And that's another scripture, people miss quote, well, you know, money is the root of all evil. The Bible doesn't say that. It says the love of money is the root. Right. Because the love of money is what people will cut people's throat for. They will rob steel, lie. Yeah. Kill. True. True. True. That you bow down to. Mm-hmm. Right. And, you know, at the at the risk and sacrifice of your marriage or your children or your personal relationships or family. For family. How many families have broken up over money? Come on. That's the number one reason. Yeah. Yeah. Great. I tell you peace is a higher currency, you know. It's like, you know, I see you at peace a lot, you know. I've watched some of your, your interviews and, you know. Yeah. You know, it was a long process to get to that point of time too. Because we're hard hit. We're so stubborn. We know what all? Yeah. Well, yeah. Exactly. You know, the first, you know, when I was 22, I thought I knew everything. You know, I went to medical school, I went to college, you know. I went to what school? I went to medical school. I mean, so I did. Oh, I know everything, right? I have a genius. You know, I, I, I, no one's had this level of education, but I do nothing. You know, I just knew facts. I didn't know, I didn't have any, any awareness or any kind of like connection to anything. And it's that's what you're talking about. Knowledge without wisdom. That's right. It took a long time. It, it's, it's, it's a learn that though. But, because, you know, knowledge is powerful in this society, but it doesn't find, like you said, you don't find peace with that. You don't find happiness with that. It's, so you have to find a balance between the two. And that, let's again, I'm a slow learner, right? And it's that. It's a long time. We all do. And there's a lot of, uh, extremely bright people that, you know, they relegate it to, oh, yeah, that's, that's good for you, that's your courage, and that's, you know, and they don't realize that the very thing that stops them from receiving that truth is the fact that they're blocking the doorway. Yeah. Because they're clinging to this. And, and even certain people that, that are believers, they subscribe to what they think. That's not really interested in what you think. Yeah. It's like if you're willing to receive truth and you move out of the way, it'll hit you right in the face and then you're, wow, I never dreamed. Yeah. Amen. So that, man. Thank you so much today for sharing all that with us and sharing your life with us. And I think people will have a much greater perspective of who you are as a person and, you know, what you went through to get where you are. And I think it's, it's amazing. If people want to reach out to you, what's the best way for them to get in touch with you? Right now, you need to reach man, Facebook. There's a few Instagram posts out there. We're still having Instagram. We're going to get that going. Say that again. We're going to get that going. Because I've got some great shots and ours and ours. We got pictures. We're going to get, we're going to get them to put up all this stuff because we want to stop it. I'll be the first guy to follow you. You send that link to me. That. I want to be number one.

I'm Dave Pullumbo and today's guest is our Cal Pro men's open bodybuilding champion. He's going to the Olympia. He's the new honking talk man himself and one of Ion's. Welcome. That was good. I love the hat. You look like a good fan. I'm a national tendency. I want to fit in so I thought I would get that hat. What are you doing in the national Tennessee? Do you have a recording contract or something? No, there's a big event. Next weekend at Carbon Culture USA is actually a Bernie Teresa Jim that he opened up and he invited us with Brent, who's also owner of the arm of the manufacturers. Some of them are the manufacturers of our supplements. He invited us to go to this event there. It's going to be pretty cool. My friend, Jim and Fuselibi there. John, we don't want to be there. Jose Raymond, a bunch of have a. Wow. It's a little bit dearest from the fitness industry. That's a huge event. I'm glad to see during these COVID times that we're still doing events. Because this might be the first event. Yeah, that's right. Well, we're all very mask and try to stay away from each other and just like somebody's got the sniffles. We kind of get powered out a little bit. But it's all good. Was it weird having to compete on stage with a mask on? I had to ask you that because I was meaning to it. That was the first show I really seen in Vegas. We're pro men had actually a mask on. I know, but the thing is is that my mask that I had at some point I was breathing was going in my mouth. But the, the, the Derek, I when you said, if you didn't break it, it could just ask us and it won't be like a, calling like a default in the points. So what kind of my call that I got, I got, I need a break. And mask Charles had involved in his mask. So he could breathe better. Oh, that's smart. Yeah. So let's go. It's not all right. I need a break. So I said, you send us backstage and we came back for a definitive call out. It's bad enough that you dehydrated to death. It's 100 degrees under those lights. And now they got to put a mask on. You see, you can't freaking breathe. I mean, what, what other hand you kept the unique while you were on stage posing there, right? Yeah, it was a little bit harder than usual for sure. But you know what? The show did go off and you did, you did win. Now, let's talk what I really want to talk about because I'm always interested in seeing, you know, how the progression of things with people. We'll talk about what you've overcome those past year in a minute. But you know, you were at the New York Pro, which took place in Tampa, you were seven place there. What I saw you look, when I saw you on stage, I knew right away that you were over-depleted to death. I knew that was a fraction of what your potential was. Because I had been watching you and I know what your physique looks like. What happened in New York? What went wrong? And then how did you guys correct it for the cow? Well, the thing with New York, what happened is that I didn't have the right Instagram filter going on. I couldn't like crop the picture problem. I didn't have a face toon, you had some details, and yeah, so I was like shit. I think Ali Pro, I can't use Instagram. Your Instagram tools were not available to you. Exactly. What happened is that my condition was very good. There was no mistakes really made the thing that happened is that we flew in. And I thought what was in was crazy high right now. I told Doria, let's get me through that. I want to be really dry and stuff. We tried to carbon up. We did carbon up a little bit, but I was flat at the prejudging. But you know what, hurt me the most, I think, is some of the poses. I felt like I shut myself in the foot, because I was coaching down too much on their front relax. On their mum double, they don't like the twist, they want me to expand. And also the advertising was coaching down too much. So what happened is that because I was flat combined with poses that make me smaller compared to the whole lineup was like freaking swall right. Like Justin, where Doria is backstage, I was like, what the fuck is that? I'm a, he was hard. He was hard to do that. So what happened is that I did my posing to hurt me way more than my condition itself. That's the only thing that happened. I was on the first call, they put on the left. I'm on the right, I guess. My right, my left, so I did it, they're called out. And because my poses were not that great, they just left me there, they didn't want to compare. But if they were to compare me with the other guys, I couldn't assume it was very good. I think I would have made it higher only if I posed better. Right. I was fine. Even when I got seven, I wasn't mad or the, all right, cool. Fuck, I'm happy I competed. No, I know I've got to be way bigger. What can I do for Cali to fix that? And from two days out, New York drove all the way to the Cali Pro show, I ate over 10,000 grams of carbs. Wow. That's great. And I fixed my posing and I had to fix sweeter to help me out with that. And also, we had like a backstage for the finals. Usually the final picture for New York, I'm a little bit fuller. And I'm pumping more, my time was a little bit better too. It's because backstage we had this, because we had a product called Carb HD. And we used Carb HD with a cup of water. And we put like, probably a gram of salt in there with the shaker. And I drank that while pumping up. And my body started coming alive more. So I was actually a bit fuller at the night show. But it wasn't enough. And the judging was done. The coverage, I mean, they probably back a little bit, but not really. You probably back with my friend, went into that school. But yeah. So the place I feel like I deserved it. I don't feel like being higher for me at one place in your two. I would have met that character as much. Sure. You wanted to wait. Like, what can I do? OK, what's next? Let's go. What can I do to be better next time? And I just went full on with, I just did my best for the whole week. I just did the, what was the best I can do? What I do, perhaps the same thing. And Doyne was with me the whole time. Looking at me every flowers, weighing me, making me pose. And then we would adjust and adjust. And I would eat every meal pretty much like a pound of rice with a heap of scooper money at 30 grams of sugar. I was trying to pull me spill over before pouring the water. And I was stabilizing and losing weight. We had it in and out where it goes Wednesday. Wow. And then I was eating like all the 60 grams of potatoes. That is like it's crazy. I was eating so much food. But my digestion was so good. My stomach stayed flat. I heard something now. I only was in salt with my meals. I'm only used to crazy condiments. Because that I think and make your garlic and stuff can be your waste of loaded money and things. Yeah. It's salt and rice. It just goes right. I tell people all the time, don't cut your sodium out. I mean, except maybe the very end because the sodium is what keeps you muscles full. I mean, I live a huge mistake people made. We didn't cut so much on that all. Yeah, even it was telling me to salt my meals. Absolutely. Yeah, that's a good thing. Sometimes people go too crazy. At the end they cut salt, they cut water too quickly. And then they take it and stuff. If you get yourself freaking shredded and peeled, peeled, it's like, how much water can you retain in any way? It's like, people try to do some nicks and the end and try to make something. No, what do you need to do is the four months before, when you need to put that fucking effort effort. Not like trying to find some magic trick at the end. Right. I think, look, I told, I told them what's his name in Valia, the same thing. I said, you're in shape already. Stop doing it. All these crazy things at the end. Just eat and we have to listen to our coach, right? So he is listening to Patrick. Two more. So and the thing is that they did a few shows together. I guess they were still learning their bodies body. So yeah, if he comes up one show, I was seven at the New York and then I won the next week. He was seven. He was one of the biggest players that he won the next show. So it's like we, that bodybuilding is cool like that because if you're in shape, if you're really like it's shape, you're peeled, you can make great improvements in the strong amount of time. I am integrating the food, but if you're kind of off of you, you have body fat to lose and stuff and you're not like dry, there's nothing that is going to help you out in the last week. I always tell people, that's why it's a good idea to do more than one show. If the first show is what you make your little mistakes and you tend to over die it, you overdo things because you're so excited about getting up on stage and with you, there was a comeback involved because you had torn your bicep lashing, you really never got a chance to like prove how good you look. See the scar there? I got to tell you, I can't even tell on stage, they did a great job repairing that bicep. Wow. Yeah. You should have just a little bit smaller than the other one, but the thing is that all of you could tell, all of you could tell. Well, a little bit, right? Tiny drop, you know what you should send your surgeon a gift certificate or something like that because he did it right now. The thing is that this one was smaller before anyway, before my dad. I got you told. But now if you look at everybody's arms, there's always a bicep smaller because now I really looked all the time. Yeah. Well, okay. If you look at, if you look at each side of your face, one side is big and then the other, there's no perfect surgery. Perfect surgery. Perfect surgery actually by itself. That's why I do this. I'm more beard on the left side than on the right side actually. I think you've been to trim that up a little bit. A shit. Yeah. But actually, if you look at the Lee Priest's arms, he torres bicep when he was 20. Yeah. Next to Jackson, Mike Melin, they all torred it by, and the one you know is really. I didn't know that. I didn't know because we kind of talked like, because of that, I just know more about bicep. There's now, but there's a lot of pros who torred it by step and they've even if those who didn't, if you look at their arms, they're different. Yeah. You know, we've talked before about what you went through to make this original comeback. Obviously, you were down in your lock, you were basically living on the street at no money. You dragged yourself out of the, you know, a miserable situation. You made the successful comeback. Last year was supposed to be your year to shine, you know, to really start winning shows and to establish myself, your physique had come back. How the moralizing and how depressing was it when you tore that bicep? I know you interviewed that you and you said you were in a good state, but now you're now looking back, was it tough to get through that time? You know, when you, after you tore that bicep, it had to like not compete. Well, the first five hours, I was very scared and I, as soon as it happened, I went on all the tours on the gym floor and I cried because I was like, I didn't know what was going to happen. The fear was because of the unknown, right? Right. It, my career ended. I have to put all the shows and what's going on. I knew it was bad. I felt it. Yeah, I felt the fucking thing of a rip and like just rip and inclusion. It was so painful. But the most painful thing was just a hurt that it made the fuck as all this, all this work that I did, I want to come back to the stage. Sure. I want to show people the other hard work I did, you know, and I love competing and I don't want to stop. But that last hint is a little bit that I said, okay, what's the best thing I can do? How can I, how can I make sure that I can come back the best that I can be? Even if it's going to be a shit, what's the best I can do? Because that's how you can do the rest. It's not up to you. So I did that. That they after I was doing likes and then I, that I, it would the cast, who still told him by said, I was doing back. I was to chest. I did one of them stuff for like weeks. Right. That was smart. That was smart because you know, they say if you train one side, yes, stimulates the other side and directly. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a tree. I treat will never grow like just one side. It will grow on two sides, right? Yep. So it's that there's a transfer of gain is like 25, 20%. Like if you never train your life, you always train the left, the right will be 20% bigger. So there is a theory, I'm not sure if I have to explain properly. But I've heard that many times in my doctor Dr. Khan who helped me out with the tear. Yes. So I just did it the best I could do. Really? Then stop moving. The only thing that I could have done better is that I think all the sweating, you really bad infection. It was a big lump on the ground. Oh, really? I didn't know you had an infection. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you find some pictures on my Instagram or something. You could see like a big lump or they could set up to you later. Big is great. What did they do then? He gave you antibiotics. Yeah. I went to the emergency room. The doctor gave me some antibiotics. And I was on there and it went down eventually. But it was very weird. I was doing this and my farm was touching my bicycle. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's scary. Especially, I think it's got surgery. It was like I have like a synthola or something. That was weird. So you got through that. You started gearing. I'm now. You originally, I know we're working, you were endorsed or sponsored by RedCon. And then you kind of switch. What happened with that whole contract? Well, Dorian Hamilton, my coach and my pretty much wife and best friends just started with, hang on with her every day pretty much. Right. He's also the owner of PumaSons Fitness. Yep. And I had coach of TMHG training. You started your own solo company and I knew eventually I would go with them because before a silent redcon, the idea was to be part of the brand. But I had to pay the bills and I absolutely got to make it make it good offer. You know, a fully could be. So I went with them and I had a good time. It was pretty cool. It was very supportive because we had a similar pass. And I kind of really did that with me. Right. And the help of the other, then at some point, it was just like, I just feel like I just asked him to get out of it. Any, he was fine. That was nice. All right. So you start working. I know you've been working with Dorian Hamilton. So now you've been endorsing his line as well. You guys sit down. You have to put together a game plan at some point. What made you decide to pick New York pro is the first show. Or was it just because there's whole COVID thing that was the only option you had? No, my first show was the first lockdown. I had like, what's one was that? It was that indeed. So you were, you were going to compete earlier in the year. That was the plan? Yeah, yeah. There was indeed. There was a show that we were in the spring. There was a lot of shows that got canceled. I know Brazil. I was supposed to do our little Brazil. Okay. Do was another one I was supposed to do. How long were you dieting into one? You must have been dieting for eight months. December 18. Wow. Oh my God. Yeah, December 18. Had you say so mentally focused the whole time? Does I love bodybuilding? You got a lot of good Instagram followers from that. No, probably. Oh, yeah, for sure. I think I'm going to be really good Instagram bodybuilding. Now, let me ask you this question because I always believe things work out the way they are supposed to. So, you know, obviously, do you think that all those extra months of dieting gave your body a more refined look because you had a lot of detail and really good lines running through your body? I did stay leaner because the thing that when it shows that I loved down, I shot it off. I came off and I just like I lost a little bit of size and stuff. But I stayed lean. And so when it was tied to it, when the shows came back on, I was like, all right, I guess let's do Boston and let's do a, what's the other one that was there? Boston and Chicago. So let's do those shows. And then I started doing those shows and I was already lean so it was just about like getting back some muscle, getting some density back. And that came back pretty quick. And actually, you know what's funny? I decided to do New York and Cali three weeks out of the shows. Really? Yeah, what did I take that show? I didn't plan to do those shows with my girlfriend Sam just said, well, you're looking pretty good. Why don't you do the Cali pro in the New York? Right. I was like, huh? Because Boston just got canceled. I was afraid that we can't social cargo. Right. So I'm like, shit. I've been asked to or anything if I can do that. And don't say, I think if there's somebody who can pull it off, it's you. They made me a new plan. And I just, I just, all right. Yeah, it's getting shit right now. And then I did a 10 days. I was, I was ready. 10 days. Okay, pull it up. Because the thing is that I would do, it's crazy because for like 10 days in a row, almost, I probably did like eight power yoga session. I was 40 minutes of cardio in the morning. Why are you doing the yoga for? What was that for? Because it's me. Just you, you'll go, power up yoga should be part of the basics of bodybuilding. Should be cardio, nutrition, weight training, and yoga. Just like anyway. It's, it's your training. Because we're always pushing, contracting, like on a trail, linear. And then we become all bound up. Yeah. And you're doing so many different things. The twisting movement, the holding, breathing. It's good for the, the mental. It's good for the spirit. Yeah. And it grounds you. And the thing that's really cool is that it humbles you. Because I was only doing stuff that I was like, good at. And I am going to the heart room. I got, I'm getting my ass kicked every time. The heart is the hardest thing I do is harder than like this. And at the crazy, crazy ability, it increases it, it gets your way smaller, it gets too fricking shredded. You can, you can, they burn up to like 900 calories in one session. Right. You know, you didn't feel like you would get over trained in that all that yoga? Yes. Well, look, listen. I did a six days in a row. I would get easier as I, but I was like, I was just like, I was just like going on pure motivation and just a little bit. Because I was doing cardio in the morning also 40 minutes too much. Yeah, I was too much. Yeah. And 40 minutes as a sound line, but I put my heart rate over 130 for 40 minutes. Oh, so you do high intensity cardio. That's not like, I just, I just do straight to the fucking pedal to the metal. On the, on the life fitness bike. I would level sometimes 15 to 20. How do you know, who she likes doing? You're a genetic freak. That's why anyone else who would do that would, would, their body would fall apart. It's a nice, organic super pump. You're, that's called genetics. You can get away with it. Yeah. I guess, but my upper body was going away a little bit though. And it's, but I would do my weight training session after that. And then I would do yoga. Wow. No one the way you needed to eat a thousand calories a day. Yeah. I was a thousand grams of carbs a day, right? Yeah. That's what he kind of like tells me to go back. That's what he's like doing the opposite. They said, but tell me, like, hey, you should do more. You're more cardio. Right. They relax. Right. You know, like, kill out and don't do cardio. And then I feel like 10 days we pull back. Yeah. You said me a little bit more and more high days. And actually dialed in pretty good. But I mean, that wasn't what's so high. Like I said, for the York, I could carb up in time. So it seems to me as though you're an extremist. You like to do things. Thank God you got Dory and who kind of like balances you out a little bit. That's what it seems like. I would be like, you'd be able to say, I should do classic. I could probably do classic if I train myself. I would lose 40 pounds of muscle like that. I love that pose. There's a pose of you and Logan Frank. And I think in it like a posing. Oh, yeah. I loved that. I loved that picture. I put it up when I was doing my interviews. And heavy muscle ready. I think it's an awesome picture between you guys. It's like, yeah, and Laura has a, it's a, it's a pin or art. Yeah. You should do some, you should do some fine some guy who's like an artistic photographer and get some, some good shots because you know, well, which age do muscle, I do in sister Mariah. She just went for the first time. She's how we do photography. And it's for the first time she went on a trip with us to do content. And if you look at the, our YouTube channel, age do muscle. Yeah. YouTube dot com slash age do muscle. She's filming it. And I'll over up back home, big through media is editing it. It's just, they could great pictures. So there's a lot of cool pictures. I have a lot of stuff to post when I'm like, yeah, you can be in a magazine. You've got that artistic look to your physique. You got great. You know the angles to hit. And yeah, you know, I'm pretty good with like the angles and looking good on Instagram. You know, I didn't even like, I'd love to see like a photo shoot between you and Kai Green to just the diversity of the physics. Yeah, great. He's a, you know, he's his own style. And I like that. But there, I don't think you're selling posting routine in the York. I like to do stuff now. That's pretty unique also. But I love I can. Yeah, it's like I try to just find poses that people have never seen before. Right. And Milo, Sarchev said that he saw the, some poses I never seen before. So that, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I think fun with like all the classic and artsy like poses and stuff and just make a like a mixture of classic. I like a mixture of like powerful poses like a mix of door and Yates. So artistic like mixed together and stuff. I don't know. That's that's a unique talent you have. And I think that that sets you aside and kind of separates you from the rep, the packs, so to speak. It always elevated guys like Melvin Anthony up to a higher level because they were able to display their physique so well flex wheel or two. And that that definitely helps play things and helps you beat guys a lot of times that when it's close, you know. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I get the art side in me from my mom. My mom does a she has a bachelor in arts and she does well now and she does lots of arts and crafts and I've always loved art. I kind of draw myself a little bit of stuff. But during this prep, I was so obsessed with my next meal in the training. I guess that's all I did. And I was, you know, when you're prepping, well, you know, you're just obsessed. You're like, all right, just to get about the posing and stuff. And yeah, I would post in the morning too. Actually, I got through an hour in the last two weeks. Wow. And I would lose three pounds posing. Most guys don't want to pose at all because they're so exhausted. You know, that last couple of weeks. And you're going to win more. That's why you're doing the morning. Like, yeah, I wasn't at night. Fuck that. Yeah, exactly. I did like I can barely alive. I would be able to couch in the dark. Just like, no energy to even watch a show. Right. So what's the strategy now? You win the Cal Pro. You beat Max Shaw. I'm sure Milo wasn't happy about that. But that's the way it goes. Now you're going into the Olympia. You're first Olympia at the end of December over there. What's the strategy now? What are you going to change anything or are you going to go as is? No, we're going to go bigger. OK. Yeah, we're going to back up the legs. We're going to rebound right now a little bit. Clean the system before maybe 46 weeks. Yeah. You know, I think I struggled with. I thought all that stuff and just like clear it out. And but use the food and the trading to gain muscle. OK. We're going to clean the system and rebound clean the same time. Yeah. But then when it's time to be like eight to ten weeks out, we're going to fucking wrap it up. I'm going to get shredded. It gets fucking shredded and dancing that. We're going to this time is not going to. Because I'm going to release it. It's not going to push me as hard. Right. I'll tell you to back down and push too hard because he's got to feed me and I'm going to try to come bigger. And I'm actually going to try to come with muscle bigger muscles. I don't think I can gain muscle. And because I look at myself with me, we don't straightening. And or even the last one's on Instagram where I'm posing and I'm like shit. Put that up there. It's like I'm way I'm way like fuller right now. It's like. And I'm not that watery. It's like so I could be I could have been fuller. Right. So I'm just going to do my best. Lizard De Doran's coaching advices and guidance because it's like really good. And I'm just going to come in bigger. And what did you weigh? What did you weigh at the cow? Oh. I was to 61 the morning up. I took eight to meals and I drank some carbaged geod salt in the backstage. And so I guess I wasn't maybe to 63 on stage. That's a lot of weight. That's a good weight. I mean, there's not many guys competing over 260 pounds on stage. That lead. But I'm six foot and because my joints are big, I had great new him is big. Everything is big. My knees are big. And my friend was like a bigger frame. I need to I can be say I'm pretty sure I can be 50 pounds of dry muscle heavier. But that's only upper body. Keep my ways the same and be as they tell. And with that package, Jake, I don't know if I should be more confident with myself. Because I mean, I'm seeing like a feeling he dexter all the guys are like up there. Right? But now it's like, no, I'm going to be in my head. I'm coping myself with the best in the world. Right. And it's only that each of them, I should try to sing something and I can beat them out. Yeah, I think it's good strategy. You can mental strategy. So I need to believe in myself. I'm going to be a Olympia. Yeah, of course, it's the best in the world. And people are with all of these. And the other people don't believe in me. But so far, I've been pushing hard and doing my best. And I'm going to go past the path I am right now. Obviously, the one I'm supposed to take. Yes. I've got to keep working hard in that path. And I will see what happens. But I need to change my mindset about what I can do in body body. Let me ask you this question. What did Flex Wheeler tell you when you spent all that time posing with him? Did he give you any advice that you did to heart? Yeah. Well, there's a whole video on it on an age gym muscle. You do the whole session. You can learn a lot from Flex Wheeler when I learn. And it's a lot about just two weeks on the cellular access front, relax in the two poses that he told me. And he also told me like, still poses. And like, what? Still their poses. So what do you mean? So he said that you need to do stuff to catch his people attention. Because if they're looking at the stage for, let's say, 20 seconds. And you feel a second from the other guys. You're still in their poses. Right. And he said also said, hit the first hit the pose in the last two release. And they said to like, like, call out the guys a little bit. You know, like, on stage. Right. And I just have played all that stuff. It doesn't look more like it's. I thought a lot. It's a psychological war fair up there as well as as a physical. You know, yes. And he also, yeah. And I think what also helped me out with Cali is that on stage, I have like, at energy. Well, I've protected I had. I was like, I gave, I was like, Ari, this is it. This is like, it's, it's door best here too. It's not be lazy and it's not like, you know, sloshed down. Right. It's a, it's a bummer. But he's like, show. Let's put on a show. Right. So I did that and placed give me a lot of advice. I posted it for two hours and a half. Wow. Yeah. Three days out. I was like, he was telling me sometimes. I know you're tired, but I don't care. Hold the pose. I'll get a, explain something. I was like, but it, it, it, it, it made me learn that shit. I need to practice posing way more. Which are you already practiced a lot? But yeah. But the funny thing is, I need to hold the poses 20 seconds. And I need to like act like I'm on stage in my head when I pose and I need to pose more, more, more, more posing. Just like I should be. I think we need to, it's if you have no energy, you should eat more, a little bit more, you can pose more, like almost. I think of more guy spend time posing. And I, I'm guilty of this when I, because can be, I should have spent more time posing less doing cardio because I didn't even need the cardio. And the funny thing was that you do it because you want to get that extra graininess, but you know what the posing practice will do the same thing if you do continuous sessions. I have my apple watch. I can jack my heart rate up to 140, just posing. I believe that's what I, I believe. I believe that. Well, it's like if you're contracted, the maximum you can, it's like maximum effort. I think, yeah, I got, I got a business, I got a business idea for you. I like to give people business ideas. I don't have any time to do all these ideas. You should create, you know, like they had the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the 5o boxing and they had all these different crazy. You should do an hour posing like session like routine where you actually, people can get a workout out of it, but that it's, it's a relevant cardio session. You lead the whole thing and talk it almost like you're the, like the aerobics and structure, so to speak. And right now or long video, I guarantee you sell a million of them. Yeah, I'm going to be able to post on one hour first. You can do it now. You can do it. You, you get the second genic energy. You can do anything you put your mindset. Yeah, well, of course. I, yeah, I've been a, for your limpia. I don't care. I'm just going to practice practice and practice and practice and I'm going to be the, I want to be the guy on stage. Louis doubles comfortable posing. There you go. Well, you know what, I want to give you a big congratulations. You proved everyone and all the Naysay is wrong. You came back after New York and you won the Cal Pro. You going to the Olympia. Your comeback can act. I, I say your comeback is this huge success. I mean, you pulled yourself out of the gutter. You're on top of the world. Congratulations and, and best of luck at the Olympia. Yeah, thank you. I want to say something about the haters and Naysayers. Yeah. It doesn't affect me at all when people say that when people talk negative or they say comments, like, hey, what's up with your nipples, man? Like, I, I, I go with it that I, I just say, I train the both twice a day. You know something. You got it. You, you, you, you shouldn't let that's the one thing I want to say. You shouldn't let, because what happens is that if somebody hates on you on, yeah, on Instagram is because what they saw in, in, in your picture, triggered something and then that is triggered because of their experiences in the past. Right. And they react to the stimulus of you in a certain way. Of course. It's not, it's done about you. It, you should never take it as a personal. Now, what the jealousy you took, that's another thing. Yeah. So the thing is, is what if you react back, you are reacting to their reaction of it, something that triggered them. Right. So it's like, it's just nonsense. It just, it goes nowhere. It's not good for anything. You're right. You should never let somebody's reaction and impulse, emotion affect your day. You should not let them or whatever they're writing affect you because they're being affected by seeing you. So you go to stop the cycle. That's a point. Yep. Wayne Gyer said, don't let the good opinion of others influence you in any way. What's so ever? Yeah. Not even the exact. And even the good comments. Like if you say, you know the haters, ignored the good comments too. I appreciate them. Well, the good, when I say the good opinion, I'm saying it's archastically. So yeah, but, you're, you're also writing the notes of cast of weight. Because if you feed off the likes and the good comments, you feed that and you feed that off to validate yourself, you're sure you're something to head now. You're going to look for that to feel good. Right. Balanced. Yeah, you should still go inside. You would just you and the now. And you should like I said, don't let the comments affect you because they're just triggered by what they're seeing on a screen that happens to be in the shape of you. You're right. You shouldn't let them affect your day. No, go on. Just like whatever. Like it's funny. You just see their hating. It's like, okay, whatever. Good fun. Yep. I think for me, when people hate or they say comments and stuff, it doesn't affect me at all. A zero, zero. So I wish, because I see other pros and stuff that I met people all their friends and they're affected by that. They feel they're going to reply and prove something. No, chill out. Who will you? They go, why would you give them a tension? Call your mom a step. Yeah. She did a slipboard tension. You're right. You're right. It's a very healthy attitude. Yeah, I just wanted to talk about that because I've seen some pros and stuff and they're kind of like affected by what people say, but you know what? If you have positive energy and you're nice, you just do what's good in your heart. You shouldn't be worried about what people say. My whole take on it is because people love and hate me just as much. And I always say the fact that they're even talking about me in such a passionate way, whether it be negative positive, means that I'm doing something right because I'm inciting this reaction. And that's obviously, you know, I'm doing my job, you know. And also, we're our sports bodybuilding. If it was a sports, like car racing, you will talk all this, this guy's car shit, whatever. People like you talk people like you give their opinion, talk shit about the sport they love. Right. And then it happens to be us, like we are the things that in the sport, like the way we look. So people are going to bash us. They're going to comment it. Tell them what they're opinion. That's fine because if they didn't, there would be no fucking sport to be watched. It's like telling Miss America that you're she's ugly. You know what I mean? Well, she's just one Miss America. She's how ugly can she possibly be? Yeah. So the guy thinks it's she's ugly. Some people just say they want to voice your opinion because they just love like that sport or whatever. It's like this, what they do, people are going to talk shit about people like you did an emotional about and the fail teams. They fight over them. They get so involved and you know, like that's normal. So people are going to talk shit. That's normal. Let them talk shit. It's good. You know, people talk stuff. It's good. This is what sports are. People like the FFs. Favorite teams, favorite bodybuilders and stuff. Like it's okay. Like just don't worry about it. Just do what you got to do and just live and let live. Amen to that Antoine. Best luck and joyer a little weekend. Say a lot of branding, curry. He's opening a gym. You said, right? Yes. Yeah. Fortunately, he's not going to be able to come because of the pandemic and the rules. Like because he comes, he won't be able to come back to train to play the club. Okay. There's going to be a lot of things. I'll be there. I'll see you're taking the place and Mr. Olivia, basically. Maybe that's a foreshadowing of things to come. Yeah. I guess it's. Yeah. I'll be there with HG muscle with Jujimu Foods, also HG muscle athlete. Thor, my coach, the Dorian Alters going to be there. We got lots of fun and also going to HG muscle.com called AV for supplements. Okay. Right away, cold AV 10, I was praying for the belt and stuff. That's my three main sponsors. Yep. I want to thank Trifectel sponsored my food for the whole trip. Wow. Thank you so much. Yeah. So I'll try to do all the food and stuff. It's pretty good that I want to take our muscle. Thank you. Thank you. And yeah. So it's a great day to be a Instagram bodybuilder here. Yeah. I love interviewing you because you got such a good mental, you know, at look. You have fun with what you do. I wouldn't be doing my job if you if I didn't ask you to take us out of this interview with some kind of creative something you're going to do for us, whether we're posing or an impression or whatever you want to do, you take this interview and exit it in your own unique style. Okay. All right. Thanks for watching. I'm Alex Mussel. This is day journal Palombo and I wear a Swiss set of these. Not here. I thought you were going to be here.

I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is the 2020 IFBB actually NPC North American men's body building overall champion Nick Walker. He finally did it at the old age of 26 years, welcome to the show and congratulations. Thank you for having me on Dave. Yeah, I mean, this was a long time coming to you. A lot of people don't realize you've been training a very long time since you're a teenager. Even though you're only 26 years old, you've been in the game for a long time, but wasn't like, you know, a lot of guys pop in and they went into Europe too. You busted your butt, your typical, you know, northeast guy, trained hardcore and jersey there. And you made it happen. Congratulations. Thank you, I appreciate it, man. You have, you know, something that we haven't seen in a while. I call it the throwback 1990s Freak physique, you know, whereas you got all the body parts in the right, you know, order, so to speak. You have, you know, a pro level structure on your body, but you also have that, like, dense, grainy, you know, freaking muscle that we haven't seen in a very long time on the body building circuit. What are you, what are you a tripped at here? My training. I had trained very, very intensely, but low, low vibe. Kind of like it, like, doing eights. Yeah, I noticed that. Yeah, I saw you doing interview with that and I was, I was impressed because I don't see a lot of guys kind of switch the way from that. And, you know, I was always a big believer also in low volume, high, high weights. And it shows in the density of your, of your physique. That's, I believe, and I also believe that's one of the best ways to save muscle as well. When you're dieting so low, the more volume you do, you can sometimes attend the burn the muscle. And if you train low volume, you can keep the weight really high and just give out own sense to either one of two sets. You should maintain majority volume or muscle. How you used to tell people, when I would do after I would do it, like, four sets of incline presses, I wanted to go home. Like, I felt like I got enough out of it. I felt like my chest was fried already. I lifted, you know, 405 for six heavy reps. And I didn't want to do anymore. And you know, when I started realizing that more wasn't necessarily better at that point. Is that? And sometimes that will hinder recovery. Yeah, I'll be very important, especially doing prep. Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, your physique speaks for yourself. I actually, you know, when I look at your physique and say to actually, we're rising at Mike Franswatt, if you remember him back in the 1990s. Yeah, I've heard that a couple of times. Yeah, you got that, a lot of density like him. And he also train really heavy. So I mean, it, there's definitely something to it. I mean, it's, it's not like, you know, people want to know if you get that muscle from it. It's from people who put in hard work. Now, when you first started out and you were doing shows back in the early, you know, 2010 area, 2013, whatever, when you're a teenager, where people already telling you, you know, you have potential to go far or were you like one of these guys when they said, hey, you know, you know, maybe you're wasting your time. Yeah. Well, when I, I see I graduated high school at 230 pounds. Oh, I was your big kid. Yeah. And you know, everyone told me I should do my first show or do like do my, yeah, do it first show. So after I graduated high school, I did my first show, the goal was classic in 2012. Yeah. And I went from 230 pounds to 159 pounds. Oh, my God. Holy macro. Yeah, we talked about it over. I didn't. Yeah. That are the hard way sometimes, right? Yeah. I got a totally different person. But at that point, like, yeah, I've heard maybe it's not for me, but I also knew the genetic factor that I had. Yeah. And if I had a, you know, a proper coach that you had to diet me properly, but it would have been a different. Yeah. So I came back the following year, I did the Eastern's in New York as a teen as well. And I was, and I weighed 198 pounds. I won the team division. And I took third in the light at least. I was at that show. I remember, I remember, you know, I didn't remember who you were. But now that you, I was looking at your conversation. I remember, because I was, I know I was at that show. And you were very impressive. I thought as a teenager at 1998. It was, you could tell that you had, you had potential. Who knew how far you were going to go with it, but you definitely had potential, you know, a definitely. Yeah. You definitely changed your physique in that year for sure. Just in G. Gain, what, say 20 pounds on stage? Yeah. Pretty much. That when you did teen assials the year after and play second, was that a big disappointment for you? I mean, yeah. I mean, it's always a disappointment losing, right? Who beat you with that? Was that a Cody Montgomery year? Yes. Yeah. Well, that was just three feet. I remember, yeah. I mean, you know, he was the favorite obviously going into that show. Yeah. Yeah. So like, I didn't go on the show like knowing I was going to lose, but I prepared myself for that because I know Cody was the favorite. Yeah. It was going to be a three-peak, but to be neck and neck was him. Yeah. You know, close second. I was happy with it. I think I might, and I can't remember back then. I think I might have actually said that I thought you deserved to win. I think when I, in my analysis, I was at that show. I think I actually liked your physique better than him at that show, or maybe I saw a more potential, and you, I don't know what it was, but yeah. That was a good battle you guys had there. And that was probably Cody's hardest show. You would think the third one when he was the oldest would have been the easiest win for him, but I don't think it was. I think that might have been his toughest win. Yeah. So you come off that team, National's. You know that you have potential at this point. And what, what was your game plan at that point? How do you go from the teams now into that open division and have to start competing for a pro-card? Like, what's the mental, I guess, thing that clicked in your head and said, okay, I have to take it to the next level now. Well, at that point, I actually hired Jeff Long as my coach, right? Because he lives like you're from a fair amount of time. Yeah, yeah. And jersey, you're both jersey guys. Yeah. So we did a good off season together. And in 2016, I did a regional show, which was the South Jersey Championships. And I won the overall there as a heavyweight. I was actually, I was like, I want to say two to ten. All right. You're taking a run for the right after the T-National's? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then we did USA's seven weeks after that. And we sucked down to a light heavyweight. Okay. Where I placed a six place there. Now, was that a mistake going down? You think in weight or was it was it the right move? I think was the right move. I think if I stayed in heavies, I don't think I was big enough for what compared it as good enough as I was in the lights. Right. And I liked the way my physique looked there. I was almost very crisp, very lean, dry. And you know, to get top six that your first national show in a light heavyweight was she's a very competitive weight class. Right. Now, I'm totally, Nick, how tall you? Five, seven. I didn't really do that short. Wow. Okay. Yes. So, I didn't do that into that weight. So, it wasn't like you were too tall for it at all. No, no. So, where people telling you at that point, you know what? Stay as a light heavyweight, get your pro-card and then move up. That's, I hear that a lot, especially with the guys. Well, I actually know when said that to me. Now, after we did USA's, we just ran right into an all season. And we got ready for, I had to qualify again. So, 2017, I did the muscle beach as a heavyweight. And I won the overall there. And then we went to North Americans in 2017, where I think we just over-dited a little bit. And I ended up being like 200, 200 pounds on stage. Okay. And I got six there again, but it was not my question. Was it a good luck for you, yeah? Yeah. You obviously look better bigger. Yes. So, I think so. So, now you took 2018, you actually preparing for a show. And then you never competed. What happened that year? Because I think a lot of people were wondering is Nick Walker done. You know, sometimes you see young guys come up. They've, you know, they got tremendous talent. They get all this potential, like, I think of a trade brewer. And then actually, I actually compared you in a show I just did the earlier to a young trade brewer that actually lived up to his hype, you know, so to speak. But a lot of times these guys disappeared. Did you freak out? What happened? No, I had a slight issue that I was having. I don't want to get too in depth about it. Okay. I don't want to start trouble anywhere. Yeah. But I just thought it was the best move for me being young and not knowing what was going on. Okay. And I didn't want to go in my future. It continued. And then something serious actually happened. I got you. So I decided to pull out got my full blood work done and majority of everything just came back normal. Okay. So I just, I just said, okay. So I decided at that point, I was going to, I actually went and back connected after that. I got you. So you had a problem with your coach. I understand. You don't want to talk about it. Well, you, you, you know, sometimes when something like that happened, you know, and you're right before a show and you have to pull out. It's very depressing. Did you fall into a depression? Did you kind of like move past? I would've said, yeah, yeah, I was very upset. But I'm, I'm the type of guy that gets over things real quick and makes the next move. And we get started on that. Okay. So you, you hook up with Matt Jensen and you say, all right, we're going to go for, for two thousand, nineteen. We're going to do the USA. Yeah. And obviously that was your breakout year when you play second last year. What was, what was different going into that prep? And what did you actually wind up on stage? Wait, why? At USA's. Yeah. To, to, to, to 36 to 38. I was that's a huge jump you made. What did you get? We had. Yeah. Yeah. What, what are you a tribute that to? Again, that was when we, me and him actually, that's when I started doing the low vine training. Okay. We ate a lot more food. We lived, you know, high intensity low volume and everything just, just clicked. Yeah, everything clicked perfectly. You know, we were, you and I were talking earlier and we were talking about, you were telling me how for this year you kind of stopped doing a lot of freeway. It's quite sort of, make sure you waste and get any bigger. And we were talking about what, what machines and what exercises you kind of feel more nice to, was telling you that when I was competing, I tried to do the whole, you know, no squatting thing when you were, I did leg press. And I really don't, I never felt like press really well. I never really was a big leg press fan. And you said you feel like press a lot. And I think it goes back to the fact that you have to find what works for your physique. And obviously you and Matt, when you connected, you figured out how your physique rose best, which is more food less volume. And which is the case with a lot of guys. I was like a low volume guy too. If I did too much volume, I didn't recover, I didn't grow. So obviously you found what works for your physique and your body, you know, blossomed one you did that. And you did very, very quickly. My strength was going up like weekly, like by a long crowd. Well, what kind of, what kind of lifts you are doing? I mean, like what was some of your impressive gym lifts? I know you have some crazy lifts. You know, okay. So the highs, I inclined dumbbell press the 225. So high. Let me ask you a question with that. Because you know, I was a best drug pretty strong guy when I got big too. But I had problem with heavy dumbbells because I couldn't, I couldn't, like, I literally wanted a fall over. I couldn't balance the three-minute, three-hundred pounds. I couldn't balance those things. Yeah. How do you, what do you have? Someone hand you each one of them? Yeah. So basically how we did it was we just, we sat on one of my lap. And when I went, when I went to kick them back, they kind of just followed with me and helped me tell me. So you need two spiders basically, is what you need? I did. I needed two spiders. That's crazy. And then once I got going, those are very smooth. So impressive. What else are you doing in the gym that's impressive? I dumbbell shoulder press, 200 pound dumbbells. Wow. I guess the same, because someone has to hand you those things. There's no way you lift the nose off the floor. Oh, yeah. So if they had a hand to hand to the top, I'd have to make sure I had some strong people with it. That's scary too, because if you move a little in the wrong direction, you can hurt yourself a lot. Do you have to have a really strong spot? Oh, really strong. Who's a strong person? And then I also barbelled shoulder press, four-five for eight of the people. That's sick. I thought I was impressed. I thought it was impressive when I did three-fifteen for like six, but four or five for six is absolutely insane. People don't know how hard that way just to stabilize. It's difficult. That's the hardest one. Unbelievable. And how do you work up to that? Did one day you just say, okay, let's throw another 25 on each side. Did you do that? Yeah, honestly, yeah. When I did three, 65 before that, I was like, oh, this feels like I'm stopping. Yeah. And I just racked it and we put four or five on and I got six out of five. Wow. Oh, he said. You know, and the reason I stress this and why I'm making a big deal about this is because that's why you're so big and dense because you're lifting these heavy weights and you're not just doing one rep with them, you're doing full range motion and you're doing both the bull reps and that's why you're growing and people just don't get it anymore. And I think that's why we don't see physics like yours anymore because no one's willing to do that in the gym and that's scary shit getting under 230 pound dumbbells or putting four or five and pressing over your head because it's not comfortable it hurts and it's dangerous. So people don't do those things. And they can't take selfies while they're doing it. Exactly. Exactly. That's very true. That's why I had someone video it for me. To make bad as worse, you trained in pretty much the most hard-coach in your area, until this gym and that rings the bell when people's minds. It's because I've had to get to those gym owners on the show. They've been fighting the state since this whole COVID thing went down to stay open. They've been fine. They've lost their business license. They've taken the front door off and you've been training it. I didn't know this. You trained at that gym every single day. Yep. That's awesome. That's got to be a great environment because everyone is so fired up in that place all the time. Oh yeah. It was definitely an experience. That's for sure. Were you there when the cops came? Oh yeah. Was everyone just continue training and they didn't even give a shit? Everyone kept on their thing. That is awesome. They got released from prison and those were the guys right back there. That's not good. Awesome. Well, it really saved you because you had a, you needed to place the train and you can't keep that kind of weight in your house. It's one thing to have your own little home gym, but you're not keeping two or three pound dumbbells in your house. So I mean, you really need the gyms to do that. Exactly. Yes. Really, you should be taken to head off to those guys because those guys are just as responsible for you getting that pro-car. Oh, yeah. Me and the owners are really good friends. Yeah. I think they're good guys. So you come into this year's show. What did you actually weigh on stage? So the morning of pre-judging, I believe I was 247. Wow. That's, you're height. People have to remember, you're only five foot seven. Yeah. If you were five eleven, that would be like weighing 280 pounds. Right. Right. That's, because that's what you look like you're on stage. You look like you're 280 on stage. It's crazy. Matter of fact, people were saying when I put up, I put up a picture of you on Instagram, you know, thanking you, congratulating you. People were saying, this guy could have won the New York pro. That's got to be a compliment to you right there, right? It's actually really, it's really cool to hear. It's, it's that's the awesome. It would have been nice if it wasn't on the same weekend, like we would have been the weekend after you should go to California competing next weekend. Yeah. You probably qualify for the Olympia. Probably. Why are you thinking about doing that or are you shutting it down for the year? Oh, no, we're going to do Chicago. Oh, you are. Okay, which is taking place in Atlanta, obviously. They moved it. Yeah, the whole reason why we're doing Chicago and not, Cali. Yeah. We're simply just because, you know, me and Matt had this goal of turning pros since we started, like this was our goal. Yeah. And we just, he wanted me to enjoy it. He wanted me to embrace it and enjoy it a couple of days, where it's. And if we were to do Cali, I wouldn't have had time to really enjoy my, my land, you know, right? Right. Although he wanted me to have that and then start getting ready for Chicago. Are you still mentally strong in the sense that you can keep going for Chicago with that burning out? I plan. If I win Chicago, I'm going to go to the end. Well, yeah, that's an obvious here. Oh, yeah. So I'm, that win just fired me up even more now. No. It's crazy that, you know, and I always say this to people like yourself. It's, there's two types of people. There's the guys to turn pro, but then they have to work to become a good pro. And then there's the guys to turn pro who it took them so long to turn pro that they're already pro material just waiting to happen. So you can go plug yourself right into the pro ranks and do well. You know, how well you do, we won't know until you stand on stage with these other guys, obviously. But you're going to match up well because you got the size, the density, and the conditioning you're ready. And the reason you had that is because you had to work your butt off the last five years to get that. It wasn't like, you know, it wasn't just handed to you, you know, like, because you got lucky at a show, no one showed up. Right. And then like that, or you want to light away class. So you got to feel good knowing that you can go into a pro show and probably do the game and write off the bat. Oh, for sure. And I'm very excited to see how I do for sure. Yeah. I am too. I think it's, you know, we haven't seen a physique like yours in quite a while. And I think that it's, you know, the pro ranks have had a lot of older guys who were kind of running at the top of the game right now. And there's only a couple young guys that are coming up and to see like, like, you Hunter LeBraude and a couple of younger guys that are entering into the pro ranks. It's kind of like we're seeing what the future is going to look like because you guys are going to be the guys doing battle in five or six years from now when all these other guys are already retired because then I get a laugh. Daxa, maybe Daxa will be around. But no one else is going to be around seven years. These other guys that are competing now that in their 40s, they're going to be retired. So it's, it's cool to see, you know, upcoming talent. You know, when you, when you won, what was the feedback that any judges come up to you and give you some good feedback? Well, I won, which straight ones. Yeah. And they, they said everything was on point. Just work on my front last bread. Because they said, you know, when you do your back last bread, your rack is really wide. Yeah. So you know, you can hit it from last bed better. So that's, you know, we're going to practice that. We're going to try, we're going to come in, we're going to try and come in a little bigger and better condition as well. And we're just going to practice more stage presentation better. Right. You know, it's funny. But the front last bread pose really shouldn't be called the front last bread pose. I was talking about, and this is why it, it messes people up. Should we call the front last spread relaxed pose? Because that's really what it is. It's relaxing your lats and opening them up because everyone kind of, even Ronnie Coleman ever was able to hit a front last bread. His back was so big, it didn't matter. But he would like, it would always feel like he'd be doing the most muscular hit net last rest. And it locks down your lats and it doesn't allow them to open. But not been expand completely. Dory and H probably has the best front last bread of all time, you know, I think. Yeah, or Joel Stubbs, maybe, who had a great back to. But if you see, it's almost just to relax pose with these guys. It's just basically just opening their lats up. And I think that just comes with experience. I never understood it either. I always, I couldn't, that was my worst pose when I first started. It was my best, one of my best poses when I retired. So that's just comes with experience really, you know. That's great. That's great. I think a lot of people in your corner, he'd like to thank and he's your opportunity, you know, go ahead and thank the people who were in your corner and let us know, like, who was behind the scenes helping you? Yeah, so first I think my family, my mom and dad who have supported me literally since I started my body building career, literally through all the ups, all the downs, all the money that was spent, they never walked away. And never missed show. My mom, my mom loves this shit so much. She thinks she's a judge now. Oh, that's, I love the fact that your parents are into it because my dad was a football baseball guy. He had no idea about body building. He respected my dad, but he didn't really get it. I love that your mother like, fixed the team once a go to the show and yell out the poses to your dad. Oh, right. You should have seen, you should have seen. She thinks she takes all my morning pictures that I sent them to. She looked poker, teak my posing. She's playing out. It looks like shit. Chainsville. It's funny. It's awesome. I want to thank also, my coach, my Matt Jensen, who's, you know, done a lot for me. He's definitely more than just a coach to me at this point. He's definitely family and I cherish every memory we have made and continue to make at this point. And you wrap this company too, right? You're an athlete for him. Yeah, I'm a wrong nutrition athlete and a revive athlete as well. Which is awesome. Excellent. And also, I want to thank my girlfriend as well. She's been very supportive throughout the whole thing. And I always like to say this because it's true. Anyone who knows me knows no relationships like it's with me, Dorm Prep. In fact, that she's here, she's stuck through it. She's a keeper. She's either a gliding for punishment or she's a keeper like you said. Yeah, she's, you make it through a prep with me, you're a keeper. Are you a, are you a, are you a pain in the S? I mean, I used to get really grumped. I'm a pain in the S. Yes. Oh, I didn't get a gallery in the bath, y'all. And yeah. Yeah. I get pretty cranky at times. Yeah. Yeah. And overall, just everyone has supports me. I'm just very thankful for it all. And it's, it's just very humbling. I enjoy every moment of it. Yeah, well, revel in the victory doesn't last long, but you know what? What's good for you is you don't have to wait. Well, next year is you're going to be competing in a few weeks at the Chicago Pro where hopefully, you know, God willing, you win the show and you go to the Olympia and make that even more exciting. So I wanted to give you a huge congratulations. Once again, very impressive victory. You have a great physique and a great future ahead of you. And I hope you, you know, you go very far in the sport. If I was a betting man, I would put my money on you to go all the way. Thank you. I appreciate that. All right, guys, and that's going to take us to the end of another episode of live with Brought to You by Species Nutrition. I'm Dave Palombo for Nick Walker. We'll see you next time.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polonbo and today is Thursday, August 13th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Last weeks from now, there might be a lot of New England Patriot fans crying themselves to sleep every night, because they're still in the early stages of Tom Brady post-barm depression. But luckily for Pat's fans, they still have the Boston Pro to look forward to, especially now that Regan Grimes is throwing his hat into the ring. We've only a month and a half to go before he makes his season debut, the next two or three weeks are critical, because these are the moments that separate the contenders from the pretenders, but for a guy with Regan's pedigree, backtracking should never be an option. As the great general, Pat and would say, there's only one thing to do, go forward. So if he keeps marching ahead and puts one front in front of the other, I see him as being a front runner to bring home the win. I'm going to rough road for college football fans between the big 10 coming out and canceling their season, and prime time players like Trevor Lawrence, publicly going to war with one of the most powerful institutions in America. All in all, it's been a rough ride for just about everyone involved. So if all the crazy this has you looking for a stable force to attach your anchor to, Rafa Brandeo may be your number one option. Since he's been back home in Brazil, Rafa has been like a man on a mission, which is exactly what you want when you're looking for someone, tried and true. Looking back home in his natural element seems like it's a shhhad, rejuvenating, on Rafa. And when you have a guy with this type of talent operating inside his comfort zone, it really means trouble for anyone brave enough to stand in his way. During a conversation with the president, a former White House staffer was quoted as saying, Mr. President, every great man can be defined in one sentence, what your sentence is going to be? Fred, Elas Santiago, that sentence might end up going something like this. By our second season as an IFVV pro, she'd already established herself as the most dominant bikini athlete Brazil has ever produced. Even though she only had a handful of shows under her belt, a Tila's already built up a really impressive resume by collecting a handful of wins, placing eighth in her Olympia debut and fifth in the Arnold back in March. She's gotten better every time we've seen her. So if she keeps trending upward, there are only a few spots left to climb on the ladder. And finally, I want to end today's show by sending out a very happy trails to my long time Fred Brad Grove, who announced on Monday that he was hanging up the posing trunks for a good and heading into retirement. For the better part of the last decade, Brad's been a fixture on the bodygling scene, competing in dozens of pro and amateur events, including a trip to the Olympia back in 2015. But for his good, as a representative, that Brad was on the stage, he probably was an even better ambassador for the sport away from it, where he's been featured in dozens of TV commercials and various public projects. Brad, it was a fun ride while last, and I hope that whatever is waiting for you on your next chapter is even better than the last. And that does it if you had another edition of Muscle in the Morning. On day, Pellumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X Pro 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with the low-car pot tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Morning, I'm Dave Polonvo and today is Tuesday, October 6th, 2020 and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. There's something to be said for people who recognize when it's their time to step up and seize the moment. And so far this year, Boluos has been giving out lessons on how to recognize when it's your time. If you think back to the beginning of the restart a few months ago when everything was still in flux, that was when it felt like Bol really started to gain some momentum. Fast forward to him dominating from wire to wire at the New York Pro and now all of a sudden he's heading into his first Olympia with people talking about him as a legitimate threat to crack the top six and that's all it takes. One time for one person to recognize their window of opportunity exactly like he did at the end of the summer and now that his moment is finally here, it's only left for him to do is finish the job. Last night I was reading before I went to bed and I highlighted this quote that I want to share with you. This comfort is the precursor to action and I thought it was deep and powerful and true in a lot of ways. This morning I also thought it might explain how Amara's canani is feeling too. Yesterday I saw a clip of Amad training back in oxygen gym that made me stop and say to myself oh, the old Amad is finally back. It made me think that whatever this new surge of energy is might have come from a place of discomfort and it might be why he's pushing so hard to get back to the top because if you stay in discomfort for long enough at some point the universe always calls you to move. One of the things that makes champions who they are is the ability to step up and deliver transcendent performances when it matters most. When all the chips are on the table and the lights are at their brightest they're the ones who step up and embrace the moment, just like Brandon Curry is doing right now. After being a radio silent for most of the season all of a sudden Brandon's popping up all over the place looking like the transcendent athlete that he is. For the first time in history the Mr. Olympia will have four current and former champions all competing for a slice of the same pie and all the signs are pointing to Brandon being hungry enough to take the whole damn thing. I think it was the great Winston Churchill who said those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it. But by now we know William Bowenack is a student of the game and if there's one thing he doesn't want to do this time around it's have a repeat runner up performance. Late last week William stepped out of his social media bunker to post a new photo of himself hitting a back double bicep pose where you can see some of the improvements he's made in the offseason started to come together. Even for someone who's been as good as William has these last few years this 2020 line of feels like a completely different animal at the top that being said William the conquerors never been wanted to back down from a challenge and I wouldn't expect anything to change anytime soon. And that does it the added another edition of Muscle in the morning. Undead the limbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Volongo and today is Thursday, August 2nd, 2018. I'm going to find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Hey, you remember that story about the big, bad wolf? Well, I think Brandon Curry might be about the huff and puff and blow some houses down. This week, Team Curry released some new updates from Deep Inside the Heart of Oxygen Gym, where they gave their fans a quick look at some of the work they've been doing out there for the last two and a half months or so. By his own account, Curry says that he's feeling pretty good about where he's sitting right now at this point in his prep. So now that the finish line is almost in sight, let's see what sort of tricks they have up their sleeves as we head down the home stretch. Over you get, the more you can start to appreciate the old saying, don't count the days, make the days count. And with less than 50 days to go until she makes her annual pilgrimage out to the Olympia stage, fitness icon, Riled Raver, looks like she's making all of her days count right now. The five time IFBB Pro winner was spotted cranking out some high volume leg day action earlier this week. Actually, takes another step closer to putting herself in the running to become the 2018 Miss Fitness Olympia champ. I know a lot of people who think, oh 100% Riled Raver is pound for pound, one of the best in the business. So if you can bring her any game to the big stage in September, look out for her to be right there in the thick of things. Once the pre-judging starts to get rolling. This weird world of social media that we live in, it's hard to find athletes who aren't into the whole, well look at me here I am, mentality. But after falling this career from behind the scenes for the last few years, I can safely say that Rashid Al-Draker is one of the rare few. This week we got our hands on some training video of the reclusive former NPC USA champ who's only days away now from making a surprise appearance down at the Tampa Pro. Old Raker is one of those guys who almost shocks you with how crazy Density is when you see him in person. If there's one guy who could be a potential door course in this lineup, it's definitely him. Never have one of those friends who every time you went out always seems like he was ready to end the night with a bar fight. Well, a key William seems like he's one of those dudes who's down to fight the bar every single time he steps into the gym. Tuesday morning the BK beast stepped into the gym to give the bar a beat down with another crazy leg workout as once again he somehow manages to crush seven place for reps like nobody's business. When you look at the way he trains in comparison to so much of what we see nowadays a team really is that throw back to another generation of athlete. But when you keep getting better a year after a year and show after show the way he does, you don't have to worry about a whole lot of people out there trying to question your methods. As the old proverb once wisely stated, always be aware of the sleeping giant. And unfortunately for men's physique division it's starting to look like Andre Ferguson is starting to peak his eyes open. After taking some time off to regroup from his blazing start to the season, the number one challenger to the men's physique division announced this week that he was about to officially drop the hammer heading into the last phase of his Olympia prep. When you look at what he's done over the last year or so, I don't think there should be any doubt in anyone's mind about just how dangerous this guy is when he's at his best. But when you start to factor in that he's one of those irrationally confident guys that believes he's good enough to do anything. Well now all of a sudden he becomes a whole lot more dangerous. And that does if he had another addition of muscle in the morning. On day full on bow, reminding you to always be true to your passion and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And Pippe Paray is the week in here at Muscle in the Morning. And I'm Dave Palombo, and today is Friday, July 20th, 2018. And let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. As we mentioned on yesterday's show, last week in Juliena, Malacarney officially pulled out of the 2018 Olympia. And according to reports, Malacarney has stated that this is by no means a retirement from competition at this point in time. It's simply a long overdue mental and physical break from the grind of competing at the highest level for almost a decade. What this means for the future of the women's physique division moving forward probably means that we're looking at a decade of Sheneet Grant and the value of play-low going toe-to-toe, a frasier style for a title that's only changed hands twice since the start of the division. And now that we're going to have two vacant titles and a looming flex-loose retirement in the two-to-toe division, all of a sudden, the new era of bodybuilding looks like it might be here sooner than we might have all expected. One of the things you hear from people who age well is that they never stop trying to find new ways to push outside of their comfort zone. And as far as I can tell, two-toe legend, Jose Rame, and is anything but comfortable right now. Recently, the Boston Mass dropped a short clip from one of his recent leg training sessions where we see the 20-year veteran hammering out a few PRs that would have made the great Ronnie Coleman smile. By all accounts, Jose is right on track to come back and being contentioned for the title again this year and a field that seems like it's got awfully top heavy all of a sudden. But even with some of these young guys, nipping in his heels, it'd be shows up at 100% it's hard not to think that he won't be standing next to Flex Lewis trying to get everything he can handled in hopes of winning the title. Here's a saying in sports that goes something to the effect of young teams don't win championships. So I guess it probably works out in her favor than that long-time fitness that mini capes has a few rounds under her belt. This week capes and her team released a few clips from their pre-show prep to give her fans a sneak peek at what she's doing to work out the kinks in this year's routine. For the better part of the last decade, capes has been a perennial top five athlete in the fitness division. With so much riding on this year's contest, you can't help but think that this is a now or never sort of momentous for us, title hopes are concerned. So if we can get one of those vintage mini capes, Las Vegas spectacular, I think she has a good chance as anyone to be crowned the next Miss Fitness Olympia. Back when I was growing up in New York, a few of us would get together and play cards and one of my friends basements on the weekends. And I always hated when people would start calling out wild cards, because it changed the dynamic of the entire game. And when you try to survey the table of this year's 212 Olympia, one of the biggest wild cards I see has got to be 2018 New Zealand pro winner, Dr. Farghar Fadazad. Dr. Far essentially dropped out of the sky to win that show and then turned around one week later to give some of the best athletes in the division, all they can handle with this top 10 finish at the Arnold Orstralia. Since early March, all we've seen is a trail of spicy bread crumbs coming from Dr. Far and his team. But based on this little bit that we've seen, this guy could be bad for business if you're a potential top 10 finisher. Whether or not he could pull the genie back out of the bottle again for the Olympia, is still anyone's guest right now. But I can't say that it'd be shocked if two months from now he ends up finishing his season as one of the top 10 rank athletes in the division. Do you remember that old Super Mario game in Nintendo? Were you guys with double in size F-U-8, one of those magic mushrooms? Well, I'm starting to think that might be a lot closer to reality, and we all think based on what we've seen from Brandon Curry over these last few weeks. Once again, the Tennessee native is hunkered down at Oxygen Gym in Kuwait for this year's Olympia prep, where he and the camel crew seem to be brewing up some of that magic mushroom voodoo once again. Last year, Curry made himself one of the tag story lines heading into the weekend because we also saw what he was capable of at his New Zealand pro and Arnold Australian wins without having those two trial runs to work out all the little tanks. It does make you wonder whether or not they can pull off that same sort of Vegas Super size me routine again. September. And that does the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Dave Alumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I'm going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car hot tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. We love to show this is our best place to be in LA. We love to show this is our best place to be in LA. We love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to Legendary Foods, Muscle in the Morning. On day polimbo and today is Wednesday, July 28th, 2021. And let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, we are back in better than ever with another brand new edition of Recap Wednesday coming your way. And as you might have guessed, we're kicking the show off today with a recap of the Chicago Pro. Starting with the men's bodybuilding open where Hunter LeBrona came in and took care of business. Again, one of the best lineups that we've seen all year long, to clinch a trip back to the Olympia stage. As I'm sure you've heard by now, and the two 12 division was all about Key on Pearson, as you took home the crown for the second year in a row, and confirmed his place as a top tier title contender. In classic physique, Darwin, Eurebe, captioned the attention of everyone in the division as he put together an amazing look on the way to earning his first win of his career. And in men's physique once again, Ramsey's Rams came in and took care of business as he continued to build on his career year. On the women's side of things, she and all, like spectacular on our way to earning top honors in women's bodybuilding and in women's physique, the best version of Pat Gosling that we've ever seen came out and dominated from wire to wire as she punched her ticket back to the Olympia stage. In figure, Julia Waring looked phenomenal on the way to collecting the win for the show for her second time in her career. So congratulations for a great effort. Laura Leishopados was absolutely light out in the Keene as she crews to a big time win in her season debut and a strong effort from Sarah Kobak, brought home the title and fitness. And finally, we're wrapping up our coverage year with the wellness division where Cassandra Gillis became the latest athlete to punch her ticket to the inaugural Olympia ceremonies after her big victory. The deck's event on the schedule took place up in the steel city, which once again welcomed in a long list of athletes for this year's Pittsburgh Pro Masters, where we're going to run through a few of the highlights here starting with Patricia Lloyd, who is the winner in the 35 and 45 plus Keene, and figure eat of the driver managed to pull off the trifector winning the 3540 and 45 titles, which is something you don't see all that often. So congratulations. Lenore Greggson did a little bit of double dipping in her own right as she collected wins in the 35 and 45 women's physique, and in the 40 plus women's bodybuilding when the Sanchez scored straight first across the board to collect her first win ever pro career. On the men's side of things we're starting off with the 50 plus bodybuilding, we're a familiar face in Milton Martinez managed to slide in and snag his first pro win, and we're wrapping up our coverage here with the men's physique division where the ageless wonder Michael Ferguson pulled up the second trifector of the weekend, as he swept up the titles in the 3540 and 45 classes. Recap of the day comes from the first annual Janna Roe to our pro, which is a figure only event put on by the muscle contest crew out there in Anaheim, California. When it was all set in done, Brazil's Michelle Silva, Pinto, ended up as the last woman standing, which helped her secure her well deserved. The Olivia qualification for the first time in a career, second place went to the familiar face in the career in a bra who looked great in her season debut. She'll ace a shoemaker, continue the strong start to her season with another solid top three effort here as she managed to hold off a solid fourth place effort from Rahil Kushea. And rounding out the top five was none other than veteran Kim Clark. And finally, we're closing out the show today with this brand new update from your 2019 Mr. Olympia champ branding curry. After keeping himself under wraps for the last few weeks on Monday, Brandon decided to give his fans a sneak peek at what he's been working on for the last few weeks since he made the move back out to oxygen gym. And I guess the big takeaway here would be that Brandon looks a whole lot like someone who has every intention of winning his title back. Obviously, we all know that when Brandon is at his best, he's capable of beating everyone else in the lineup, including our current champ, Big Rami. So he and the Campbell crew can cook up something special this year as a strong possibility that we could see history happen again as the Olympia title changed hands for the fourth straight year. And that does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Deep. I'm Bobo reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, there's 30 year in a row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car capped hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods, muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Polonvo and today is Monday, September 21st, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. To quote legendary author Jim Rohn, success leaves clues, so I'll leave it to you guys to follow the breadcrumbs that James Hollingshead has been sprinkling around lately. According to reports, James is waking up in the morning somewhere in the neighborhood of 278 pounds, and his team says they believe it will be in the striking distance within the next two weeks. As of today, James is a little more than three weeks out from the Europa Championships in Spain, which means that he should be able to coast into the final week of his prep. So if he does end up grabbing one of the last three remaining Olympia qualifications, I don't think anyone will be able to say that they didn't see it coming. 2020 has been a weird and exciting year for a lot of different reasons between the starts and the stops and the retirement and the returns. There have been a lot of different storylines to follow, and that's in addition to the fact that we're also trying to kickstart the wellness division. But if there was ever a person who can inject a little bit of excitement into wellness, your Rishna Ayala would be the woman for the job. Over the weekend, we heard a rumor that your Rishna and her team were having candid conversations about her taking a run at the wellness division, which seems like was tailor made for an athlete like her. It might not be hard to remember now, but a few years ago, your Rishna was knocking on the door of winning pro shows in the IFB Vicki division. So the fact that she can slide into a division like wellness that lets her body do what it already wants to do naturally, could be trouble for anyone who's unlucky enough to run into her when she's firing on all cylinders. Not to make this a political discussion, but recently it came to my attention that there are some people who may not be too enthusiastic about voting for either one of the major party nominees for president in November. Now, luckily for us, we do live in a democratic nation, which means that when you go for voting, you have an option to write in the candidate on your ballot. And I think if we get the hashtag at Curie 2020 going right now, there might be an outside chance for branding Curie to make a last minute push for the White House. If you guys ago, it's our picture of Brandon standing in front of the magic mirror where he looked the part of someone who might be ready to lead a revolution. So if the US really is the land of opportunity where anything in everything is possible, who's to say that Brandon can't be the 15th winner of the Mr. Olympia title and the 46th president of the United States. In basketball, there's a stat line called the triple double, which is when an athlete has double digits statistics in three different categories like points, rebounds and assists. But since double digit scoring and bodybuilding is actually a bad thing, I'm pointing a new term, the triple single. It's when an athlete places first with all ones across the board in three straight major competitions, or as they call it in bikini, the esipissini special, even though she's heading into her first Olympia title defense, when you take into account her flawless win at the international. It puts esit in line to join Ashley caught washer and Angelica Tashara as the only other woman in the history of the division, the pull off the newly patented RX muscle triple single special. So you know, all she does is repeat what we saw in her last two outings, that triple single is basically a lock. And that does it the end another edition of muscle in the morning on day pull up, reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to live with Brought to You by species nutrition visits speciesutrition.com. On the Palombeau, and today's guest is our newest IFB pro all the way from Vancouver, Canada, Brandon, Reggie, and welcome. Hey Dave, thanks for having me. I love the suit. You know, I love the little tie and then the vest. Where are you going? Well, this is a job interview, isn't it? That's right. You're right. Except you got to come dressed in opposing trunks if you want to job with us. Yeah, I'm a fancial advisor at one of the Canadian banks here. That's awesome. A real job. I like it. Not many bodies. It's a good career. So I had to ask you at home here to do this interview with you. My friend is like hard-cruc, you know, I work with him. I do his diet with him. And this past week and when he was doing the Vancouver pro, I'm show up there. He's like, you know, I'm driving to go way in and I'm going to drive back. It's like an hour and a half each way. I'm like, what are you doing? Did you get to stay in the hotel? You did. You drove back and forth. Then you went back for the show and then you left at the night show. We were texting like it was like three in the morning by me because you guys are three hours behind you. Is it going to drive in home now? I'm like, yo, no kids going to accident. It was almost to that point, Dave. I was getting a little concerned there after being up for, you know, 24 hours straight. I almost had to pull over my wife drive. But we made it. We made it. Okay. Was it was only about 40 minutes at night. Oh, what's up? You bad. Yeah, you're hard-cruc. That's real. That's real blue collar. We like to call that, you know, tight. Yeah, that's a bad thing. But you pulled it off. You got the pro card. I mean, it's great. You know, Canada was so hard to get pro cards in the past because they had like two pro cards you can get every year. Now with the opening up of the, I guess the I could be splitting and you have the pro league now going with the new Canadian alliance there. You kind of have a lot more opportunities to turn pro there, which is great. There's a lot of great bodybuilders. You pick the right show and we nailed it on the head and now you're in the I. F.B. Pro ranks my friend. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, it's pretty well. Yeah, no, it's pretty much I guess now we have, I guess it's I.B. Pro League. There's still only two shows a year that you can get it. It's only one card per per division. So it's still not too much easier. It's only about one extra show. I think that really. So what shows are they're in Canada now? Just a Toronto pro and then the Vancouver pro. So there's no nationals anymore. Well, there is a nationals apparently. No one really knows anything about it anymore because it's the differently. Great. Okay, so they're not associated with the new league. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. We're all around on some. So I've ever been ever in switched over to the CPA. They call it the Canadian physique alliance or call it and that's the one that gets you to the Toronto and Vancouver pro. Right. And those get you the IFBB pro card. So you can compete in the real IFBB pro league, which you know, you're pro and Arnold and they limp you. Exactly. Exactly. Well, do you pick the right show then that's good. Absolutely. Yeah, it was huge. You know, the funny thing is that I've lately the last couple of years, the talent pool it's been coming out of Canada has been unbelievable. I think it's wave. I don't want to insult my American compatriots here, but I think you guys are blowing away the American talent in the, and especially the East Coast there. They seem to have all the talent there. The Ontario guys. But there's a few of us doing the thing around here and here and here and here. It's nice that you guys have a pro qualifier over there and Vancouver. A lot of people don't know the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Hoover's like California and like Toronto's like New York with you trying to relate to Canada. So yeah. Yeah, what's relatively new to you. So it's still, it's still got some time to grow for sure. The brand of you have a good story because I didn't, I didn't notice till before the interview, but you know, even though we worked out, you were a hockey prodigy. You came from a hockey family, which is not surprising seeing that you're living Canada. Tell us a little bit about that. Yeah. So I grew up as the youngest of four brothers. So my father and, you know, my uncle's ever unplayed hockey. Uh, so that was, you know, the family we were born into. I started playing when I was about four years old. Wow. Um, played very competitively through through my childhood. Um, when I was 15 years old, I was first round draft pick to the W.H.L. And at that point, you know, as him and Han, if that was when I went to Duranot, I always had, you know, passion for pursuing my education and going that route. Um, and then I saw my older brother play the W.H.L. And, you know, he messed up a schooling and everything like that. I was having to go redo high school courses just to get him to have these university. My objective was to get into the best business school in the country, which I did. I went up going to a starter school of business at UBC. And that was after he died. Give it up the hockey career and decided to pursue my education. You know, at a, at a 15, it's crazy that you can actually leave school and go play, you know, professional hockey. I mean, that's only a candidate that you, like you get away with that. Well, that's the thing. Well, they still put you in school, but you're, you know, they ship you off to wherever you got drafted. So you're, you know, it's a big decision as a 15 year old because you're a kid, right? So, you know, at that time, I was thinking about, you know, girls and parties and, you know, hockey wasn't a huge passion of mine. So that's when I had to really dig down and think about what I want to do. And, you know, sure I could have followed it for a bit, but I knew deep down that. If I wanted to play an age L, which I could have, you know, I definitely needed a lot more heart for the game than I did. So we, we discussed this early. You get burnt out sometimes when you, when you start things too early and that's all you do is a kid. But I now understand now why the Canadian hockey players are so damn good because it's like, that's what they ingrained in your blood almost from when the minute you're born. It's for sure. The fans on the way to part of the country, but yeah, no for sure. It's definitely a huge, a huge part of most people's families for sure. So did you feel at some point, you know, that you missed being a elite level athlete? Is that how you got into working out in bodybuilding? No, I've always been, I've always had a fascination with bodybuilding and it wasn't, you know, it didn't really, I didn't really become educated on actual bodybuilding until I was probably in university. But yeah, no, definitely having that, that competitive aspect to life is always something that I've always enjoyed for sure, whether it was in hockey or in school or now bodybuilding. That's definitely something that obviously thrive off of. I don't like to be sit around and be bored all day. I'm sure. Sure. Who does that mean? But the bottom line is that, you know, you did have a drive to do something. Bodybuilding is not an easy sport by any means. It's not like some of you, it's probably harder than hockey in a sense, although it's way. It's way more. Hockey just show up for your hour practice. You times a week and you're two hour game a couple times a week and that was it, right? Bodybuilding, you don't have a second to spare without thinking about it, right? Yeah. Is the new general, I mean, you're only 26 years old. Is the new generation of hockey players? Is it still as dangerous? I mean, in terms of fights, losing teeth and all that stuff? Yeah, I'm not a softy, I don't think anything's really that dangerous when you're talking about sports, but you know, I was certainly an enforcer and when I played junior for a minute there, I was a little bit of a fighter. Oh, you were. But yeah, no, I don't, I've heard they've pushed, I mean, I don't keep up with it a whole lot anymore. It's kind of, I'm kind of out of the hockey realm. I'm definitely fully consumed in the bodybuilding industry. I've, from what I've understood is at the younger ages, I've actually pushed back contact sport, the contact portion of the sport until later years, which is, you know, I'm pretty sure it's like 12 or 13 where you'd be for your lots of certain hitting guys, which is just outrageous to me because, you know, then also in your 15 years old and you only got a couple years and your belt of contact being in the sport with contact that you, you know, you're not quite ready for it. So I don't know, I think the world's getting pretty soft. So they're pushing things back. What's the difference between like a street fight and a hockey fight? Are there different rules or are there different, different methodologies you use? They're quite a bit different. Yeah, no hockey fights just squaring up and usually one guy's going to go for your jersey right away and then you start feeding punches, right? There's no real. There's not a whole lot of skill involved with no stocking fights. You can tell when a guy knows how to fight because then he'll dodge a couple punches and just clock you once or whatever and then you get you good, you know, with me, I never, I was able to get him to get him fights and never get hit. That's good. Worked out well for me, but I never really had, you know, everything just happened so fast and ever had too much time to think as much as I probably should have, but it'll always pan out for me. Yeah, you know, with all that equipment on, can you actually get hurt? I mean, with the fights. I mean, I've, I've definitely, definitely heard some guys before. I, you know, there's lots of ways you can block punches. I mean, you got your shoulder pads on, you can throw your shoulder, I've been deflected the punches and stuff, right? And then in junior and stuff, they started preventing you from taking out, allowing you to take your helmet off before you fight to you. But really, the helmet just messes up your hand more. Right. Right. Interesting. All the things you learn about hockey fights, who would have been, maybe a broken nose or broken jaw here and there, but that's what I think. Look, you're an IPv pro 26 is on now. You're young. You got you a big future. How do you, is this something that you want to pursue like as a full-time position, where you see yourself competing in the upper echelons of the IPv or is it still, so on the hobby level for you? Well, it's, you know, it's tough to, it's tough to put it until full-time retrospective, just because I have such a young family. And you know, I have to, they're, they depend on me for support and I have to support them financially. So, you know, it's, it's a definitely a risk if I were to pursue it full-time because, you know, in reality, competing in the IPv doesn't really make you any money. It's the things that you do, you know, all the side of the competitions that make you all the money that, you know, the social media now and all that stuff, the huge gameplay are getting the endorsements and the sponsorships competing itself doesn't really actually pay you anything. And, you know, I'm fortunate enough I have the ability to do juggable right now, so I will, you know, take it as far as they can while juggling both. Well, I mean, let's say a supplement company came along and they wanted to back you and they wanted to give you some money and, and, and, and, and, and, and able to pay your expenses and, and, and body both full-time. That's something that you want to do. I, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, sometimes with the coaching love that. Yeah, absolutely. Like, I'm sure everyone can agree. Everyone who's in the industry can agree that that's like a dream come true if if someone can fully support you financially, I mean, it would have to be enough. Right. Where I would be able to, you know, sacrifice the business out of bills for that. So, I mean, if it did come along and that it did take off like that, then who wouldn't take that on my opinion. What have the challenges getting ready for body-building competition while you're working a full-time job and you have two young kids, you know, 10 months and, and two years old. Uh, I'd say the only challenge really is having them, the kids being so young. Um, you know, you get a little agitated a little bit easier when the, the, the young guy squawk and at you for, for whatever reason. Um, but luckily I have my wife who who's very good. She's a full-time mom. So she, uh, she does a very good job of making sure that and that side of things are looked after and so I can, you know, focus on work and and body-building, everything like that. But it did, you know, it's funny. Dave, because we, we live up my wife and I live a lifestyle that's, you know, lines up perfectly with, uh, preparing for competitions and everything anyways. So we have the ability. Just our, we're very structured in our lives. How do we have ability to, you know, I've the ability to step my alarm for 5 a.m. When most bankers sleep till 8. Right. Right. So I get up at 5 and, you know, I'm able to do an hour cardio and make breakfast and do all my things in the morning and it'd be to work, be at work by eight. Right. Um, and that I, you know, I pack all my food and my wife helps prepare all my meals. Um, and then, you know, come home, bring the kids, the gym together. They have bigger in the gym, right? So, and my wife, my wife just is into fitness and health and everything is I. I'm so, she doesn't compete or anything, but, um, she, she looks like she competes. Right. Um, but yeah, no, it just, it works out. We didn't have, I didn't honestly have too many battles with it. You know, other than other than the odd day here and there where you, you feel around down. Everything's pretty much, kosher. Have you thought about what you want to do as your, uh, protege you? Well, you know, and just folks aren't taking the summer off. I haven't really made any set plans, but, you know, the easiest thing given my current situation would be to do that. Yeah, it's good to say. That would make the most sense. Uh, you could drive there again. Exactly. Yes. So, you know, having to have in the young kids and stuff and, you know, having to travel with them is really a lot. It's real pain in the ass. Oh, I tell them. I know. It's not the finest thing in the world. So, it's definitely even, you know, even going to the old can organ was tough to, right? Sure. Have it to, you know, we stayed at luckily stayed in my cousin's place, but I was still driving back and forth from Vernon to Klon, which is about 45 minutes. Wow. Um, and, you know, the wife's not always in the greatest mood when I'm gone all day in the kids are being pain and hurt by it. I know all about it. So, so. So, so, so, so, no, that would definitely be the simplest route would be to do back. We were in action. And, you know, I do need a bit of a rest. So, we, we have a lot of things planned to summer with the family. So, we're going to take some good, aren't I? And, uh, relax for the summer and then back to dry and ward in the fall. Oh, I just wanted to let you know that I'm very proud of what you accomplished in, you know, at the young six years of age to have that IFBB pro-cardin hand in the world by the, uh, the Kahone, so to speak. I just want to wish you the best of luck this coming summer. And, uh, obviously, I'll be in a lot more touch with you than everyone else will, but we'll keep everyone updated as to what's coming up for you next year. And, uh, hopefully we'll see you up on that Vancouver stage. And, maybe, maybe don't give you a free hotel room this year. Yeah, sure. And that's the very same thing. Yeah, sure. You're the hometown guy, man. Come on. Support the hometown and the body knows. Right? Yeah, maybe I don't know after my trophy. I got there. I don't think they're throwing out dollars like they should be. Yeah. What's the price money for the men's open there? Oh, I don't even know. I'm trying to figure out what they got. I know it was pretty decent. I thought it was a really, really, really, 10 or 20,000. I'm thinking that much. That would be nice. That would be, uh, you can figure out how to invest that properly since you're an investment like, right? Shelter, it's from tackle. Well, that's, well, that's pennies on the grand scheme of things. I know. I know. I know. Believe me. I have kids. I know exactly what you're talking about. Well, once again, congratulations on the big win, Brandon, and, uh, and good luck to you. For sure. Thanks, like it. All right. Kind of another episode of live with Brought to You by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo, and we'll see you next time.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning on Deep Belumbo and today is Friday August 10, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. After the Quahit Lantern trade shook up the entire San Antonio Sports scene a few weeks ago, things have been relatively quiet around the Alamo City. But this weekend, Classic Physicist standout Nick Cavalero will be hoping to change all of that. As of today, the Mile High on Muscle product is less than 24 hours away from making his bro debut right there in the heart of Texas at this year's San Antonio Pro. We're he and his team are planning to come out and bring some major heat. According to Cavalero, he's bringing 15 pounds of new muscle and the best conditioning of his career to the stage this weekend. And all you have to do is take one look at the photos to know that this kid isn't messing around. This lineup in San Antonio is definitely wide open at this point. So I wouldn't put it past someone like Camelero to step up and get after it while the getting is still good. If you've been paying attention to some of these box scores in the men's physique division over the last few weeks, then I don't have to tell you that things had been getting pretty weird lately. But when you're already a three-time Olympian, like better and heavy hit or Joseph Lee, I guess you don't let small stuff get you off track. Earlier this week, League and his team released a few new updates that point to all systems being a go right now. If you look at the lucky bro to win, the Salt Lake City showdown earlier this year, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this guy is in a great competitive space right now. And as long as he can stay the course, he has a legitimate shot at cracking the top five and Vegas assuming he's in his very best. Sometimes in life, I've come to realize that it isn't so much what you're willing to do that pushes you to be great. It's more about what you're unwilling to settle for that forces you to keep going. And this year it seems like second year star in the making, Justin Rodriguez wasn't willing to settle for anything less than Olympia birth. A few days after he put together a strong top five finish at the Tampa Pro, Jayrod got a nearly Christmas present when he found that. He officially plunged his ticket to the this year's Olympia stage. He'll get the chance to stand up there with the best athletes in the business on the sports biggest stage. Even though it's been a wild season in the media for him up to this point, there's no denying that this guy is in a pre-in talent when he's on top of his game. And now that he'll have an opportunity to show the world exactly who he is, I'm a 100% certain that we'll see the best Justin Rodriguez ever step out there on to the Olympia stage. Other than the fact that you can find on the map somewhere down there in South America, I can tell you very little about the country of power wide. But I can tell you that one of the best pro League athletes that ever come out of the country, Herina Gra is on her way back to the Olympia stage. The five time IFVV Pro winner is less than two months away from making her fifth trip to the Olympia stage where she'll look to finally break out of the Sin City slump. It's been haunting her every time she's made the long trek out of the Orleens Arena. To her credit, Rao is one of the athletes who always likes to let her performances do the talking. And I'm sure you can pull off a top 10 finish in this insane lineup. It'll speak volumes about what she was willing to do to finally get over the hump. Psychologists will tell you that if you just stand in the mirror and smile at yourself like a crazy person for five minutes every day, it can literally change the way you think and help your depression. And when you look as good as Breonna Ansley does right now, you don't have to force a whole lot of smiles. The rating and defending classic physique Olympia champ looks like he's ready to smile as way all the way back to the granddaddy of Amol six weeks from now where the smart money says that he should be still coming in as a heavy favorite. This when you wake up every day, doing what you love and knowing you're the best in the world like this guy does, you've got plenty to smile about. What if he becomes the first athlete ever to go back to back this year? I can promise you that his 1000 watt smile will end up being one of the lasting images to come out of this Olivia weekend. And that does it the end another edition of Muscle in the morning. On day full of old reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followers and things put Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning on Dave Palombo and today is Wednesday July 25th, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, welcome back to an other brand-spanking new edition of our XMuscle.com's Recap Wednesday. Let's jump right into last weekend's action all the way over. The Atlantic Ocean in Betiformme Spain where we had the first annual IFBB Bigman Weekend Championships. Big story here was the wind in the men's open by Canadian Hulk in Valier, who showed up looking like something straight out of a comic book to earn the wind insecure his first career Olivia qualification. The second was Slovakian nightmare, Igor Ilyis, who certainly played the role of Dark Horse in this lineup and impressed a lot of people in the process and ran the out the top three with the best overall performance of his career was our old friend Roman Fritz. Overall the bikini side Hungarian bombshell Diana Solomon brought home the top spot as she managed to edge out surging UK standout BB Hagen, who was forced to settle for second and closing out the top three on the pro side was homegrown Spanish knockout, Fristobalena Poharis. On the west coast and beautiful Riddondo Beach we had some of the best talents in the figure division show up and show out for this year's edition of the LA Championships. In the open division first place went to Red Hot Brazilian import Michelle Pinto, who was flat out awesome in her first win in the year. The runner-up position went to third year standout Melissa Bumsted, who continues to impress week after week with what she brings to the table and finishing third was better in this asset Julie Mayer. In the master's division it came down to a photo finished between Osiris Trump, who was confirmed not to be a Russian spy in case anyone was wondering and Tanya wheatfall. With Trump managing to get the nod when it was all set and done and wrapping up the top three at this year's event was Australian standout Stacey Steiner. Last weekend, Sidney got pounded with a heat wave of biblical proportions, but I'm sure the fact that some of the best men's physique and pro bikini competitors in the business were all out there turning up the heat at the Battle of the Desert probably made things a whole lot warmer. In the men's physique division it was a surging Anthony Woods who managed to find himself as the last man standing in a line up that turned out to be deeper than we expected. Bringing home the runner-up spot was the always dangerous long loop, but might have been it as all time best and closing out the top three with second year man Daniel Amaz. The big story here came from the bikini side of things however where Ashley Colt Wasser continued her relentless assault on the division by obliterating the field on the way to yet another huge win. Second place went to Sid City Zone, Francesco Lauren, who's been sneaky good so far this year if you haven't been paying attention and finishing in third in another spectacular post-baby effort was the incomparable in Napolino. Have you ever seen that picture of a monk on fire where they talk about the power of the human mind to believe in something so intensely that it can transcend its current reality? Well I'm starting to think that reigning classic physique Olympia champ, Breon Anzly might be getting that same sort of place mentally. The latest updates coming from Anzly and his team look a whole lot like a guy who has no intentions of letting anything or anyone knock him off the path right now and that path is pointed directly up to coming the first man in history to win back to back classic Olympia titles. And with the amount of talent in the division I don't think you can discount the fact that this guy is proving himself more than capable of being great when the situation calls for it. So if you can stand in there and withstand the fire, I think he's got enough in the tank to fight off the field again this September. You've never been around to hear a flash flood siren go off before the water starts to rush in. I'm sure you can probably imagine the panic that sets in over those next few minutes. So if any of you guys out there know someone who works at the Tampa Port Authority, now would be the time to tell them to start sounding the alarm. Because it looks like Alexis Rolone might be about the flood the streets. Recently Rolone and his team release some updates a little less than three weeks out from the Tampa Pro where he figures to be right there in the mix of things once it gets going. He's somewhere he is right now. Rolone looks like he's got the right balance of fullness and conditioning that he's been looking for. And once he starts hitting all those finishing touches, this guy might end up being the runaway favor to take that Tampa show all the way to the bag. And that doesn't yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Day Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to live with Brought to you by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com on Dave Palumbo and back by Popule demand. Part two, we have our good friend Carl Lennor. Thanks Dave. Thanks for having me here. Welcome back, Crop, because our last show is very popular. And I was taking notes. I actually learned a lot of stuff. And I think we always have a good conversation. So I figured, hey, let's, we got plenty more topics to discuss here. I watched the last show when I, I was just way too moving too fast to some of the topics. And so I promised to slow down a little bit this time. Well, you know, we, I think we felt this urgency to get everything out there. Now we figure, well, hey, you know what we can do a couple of these. We don't have to rush too much. So yeah. Yeah. We were talking, you know, it's funny. We were talking before the show. And I think it's relevant. Just going to think people go through this. And I think the people can relate a lot of times to the stuff that we go through as hosts of these shows. And I was telling you about my dad. He's kind of on his deathbed at this point. And, you know, his body's shutting down. And you made a very valid, you know, a very valid observation about your dad. And tell it, tell the analogy you were telling me, because I completely looked after it. When my father got sick, I was going through my divorce. So I was able to leave Kentucky and go to Arizona. And I brought him home from the nursing home. And I really believed I was going to like reverse everything. I was going to make protein shakes for him. I was going to do all the things I knew to do. But the problem was poly pharmacy really destroyed his body. His kidneys were gone. His liver was gone. From all the medications he had been taking the decades. And so, you know, we got a hospital bed for him, put him in the hospital bed, make him made him comfortable as possible. He stopped eating about four days before he passed away. And the night before he passed away, I slept outside his door on the sofa. And I heard this noise coming from his room. And it sounded like somebody took a tub-aware tub. And I was like rubbing it and clacking it on the table. And later on, I learned that they called this the death rattle. I didn't know what it was. But the next day I was in his room. Was that his breathing crawl that you hear? Yeah, my dad's doing that. My dad's been doing it for two weeks. Yeah, the airway stopped the cave in. They had a hard time breathing. They call it the death rattle. There's no turning back once that starts happening. Because even breathing is becoming a virtual impossibility. And my father probably like you, father, these guys were built tough. And they hang on and they hang on. And so I knew that that's what he was doing. And I had to talk with them. And I said, you know, what a great father he was. And he's taught us everything we need. And we can take care of ourselves. And he doesn't have to hang on anymore. And I even told him, well, I don't subscribe to the whole religion thing. I told him, you know, your mother and uncle Anthony and auntessie, they're all waiting for you. They'll take care of you. And within 15 minutes he went. He looked at me. His eyes were all glassy. Like he turned his head towards me. But I don't believe he saw me. That's what I thought. Yeah, he turned his head towards the window. And he was looking at the sunlight and he passed away. And in that nanosecond, when I realized he was gone, I took his pulse, I felt his hand, I cried. And I looked at him and I swear to God, I saw my facial features. I saw my bone structure in that man. And I thought to myself, oh my God, that's going to be me. And I'm not ready for this. And that is when my own mortality came front and said, you know, my parents told me, you don't understand what it is to be an adult until you have your own children. And now I understand you don't know what it is about death until you see a foment, you are far the pair's away because then you're next. That's the thing that comes into your head. Yeah, it's amazing. I think I'm clearly related. Absolutely, everything you said was like bringing bells in my head when I heard that's why I wanted you to repeat it on the show. Absolutely, I saw him laying there and I said, you know what, that's going to be me one day. And who knows when, you know, and it's a scary thought. You saw it thinking everything that went wrong with your parent could go wrong with you. And then what you do is you shot to say, well, maybe I could have heard this or have heard that because I eat well, exercise my dad's smoke and he drank and he didn't work out. So it's a, it's a crazy thing. And it's very depressing when you start getting into that because it become, you do see your own mortality right in front of you there. It becomes very, very apparent. I think a lot of us don't think about it, but when you're staring it right in the face for whatever it is you did four days, whatever, you know, whatever, I've been there for a couple weeks. It's, it is painful. It's tough. Well, I'd see, I just turned 60 in June. And the truth of the matter is that I'm battling some auto immunity issue. How you are? Yeah, through my gut. And you know, the funny thing is, Dave, I always thought because I hosted superhuman radio that I was going to be the guy that didn't get sick. You know, I was going to be like strong to the end. Yeah. I used to say, oh, I want to go when I go, I want to go in the hole with 500 pounds on my back. And then all of a sudden, like stuff started malfunctioning and I'm like, and I'm, I'm actually fixing myself. But the reality is that, you know, I'm 60 years old. I go to the gym and I train. But I train with a lot of problems right now. And I'm still pushing. I'm still training hard. And that kind of sobed me up like, oh, okay, you know, if I can get this problem, then I can get other problems. And maybe the end for me isn't that far away at all. So I got to really make sure that everything I do on a day to day basis is something that I either have to do or that I love to do. In fact, I did a blog post about it that treat every birthday like you're a mock twin predicted his own death that he would die when some comet came back around. And he died. Yeah. Was it hali's? Night of men. Yeah. I thought it was like every 75 years. When I was coming, and he died, and hali's coming, and I thought that was he was born on it. And he died on it. Yeah. 75 years. And I thought to myself, what if we knew the day we were going to die? And just for the sake of the blog post, I said, what if you knew you were going to die on your birthday? How would you live that next year differently? Because that's how we should live every year because we could drop dead any second. Right. No, we're no one knows when you're going. You're right. Well, Carl, let's get into a happy or topic first. Because a lot of bodybuilders suffer with different malinies. And we're always trying to like, I know as a coach and prep guy and a scientist. I'm always trying to figure out solutions to things. And I know you're very analytical like that as well. You know, you had mentioned to me a good topic that you thought would be great to discuss. And I agreed with you was these guts. These descended stomachs that alive these bodybuilders get. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little, before you give me your insight on it. I wanted to say, when I got to a certain size, I was suffering from the standard stomach also. And I found that one of the things that really helped me out a lot was fiber. Was adding to dietary fiber in twice a day. Because I'm eating so much food. I think I wasn't getting rid of it all. That was one of the problems. Okay. And that's why I really was high up on creating my own fiber product, which I did in fiber lies. And it became a very popular supplement that's available on the market. But that's one of the things. But what I noticed was when I downsize my physique over the course of 15 years from whatever it was over 300 to down to like, you know, almost about 195 right now. And I feel really good at this way. My, my, the standard stomach, my thick and abdominal wall, everything came down. And my, my waist is actually really small right now in my stomach is flat. And I can vacuum my stomach. And I just, it all, it took, which turned, which tells me that a lot of that was high-perchirphied muscle, whether it be in the form of the, you know, the muscle in the abdominal wall or the muscle that's in the organs, you know, the colon as a, I would, I would dispute that part. You, you, you had me all the way. You, you write on, so first of all, all of the extended stomachs we see embody building a dietary because 70, 6% of the American population has gut issues. They have extended stomachs. They burp, they burp, they belch, after a meal, they feel like somebody pumped air in there. So this is the general population. They're not using insulin, they're not using red pads, they're not eating 5,000, 10,000 calories a day. So we, so we have to look for the lowest common denominator of what is possibly going on in our population. Okay. And, and we're actually doing a show next week that looks at the fact that the increase of probiotic use parallels, the increase in swollen testinal bacterial overgrowth. And there's a good doctor who's saying, stop taking probiotics, you don't need them, but that's a different story. But, but what, what we're seeing is completely dietary because I'll give you some examples. Leapree's never had a disdented stomach. I'd love to know what he ate and what he didn't eat, but more importantly, in Australia, the quality of food is different than in the United States. But you're living in the US though for many, many years though, Carl too. I'm eating, I'm talking fried chicken by his own mission. Okay. Well, then I'm wrong about that. I was going to use him as a post-aboid, but if we go back in time, Arnold could do a vacuum pose. A lot of these guys could do vacuum poses back then. And they were hyper muscular. Maybe not as hyper muscular as some of the bodybuilders today, but nonetheless, the tortoise shell that these guys have today. Yeah. I remember the first time I saw it was Gustavo Badele. I was like, oh my God, every time he switched poses and he inhaled, he had a lead his stomach out. He looked pregnant. And we see this as rampant today. This is inflammation from the esophagus to the aina state. All these guys have girded. They all have, they have obstructive sleep apnea, whether they're treating it or not. They're gasy, they're bloated all the time. They're farting. They have terrible bowel movements, but they're consuming 10,000 calories a day and they're pushing so much food through them. These guys are inflamed from their anus to their esophagus. And I'm going to say something and people go, oh yeah, he's a quack because they said that about so many things I said last time. But glyphosate round up, glyphosate is an anti-microbial and they sprayed on crops. Okay. glyphosate is an actual antibiotic. Moncanto has a patent that's 10 years old for combining glyphosate with a moxacillin to treat antibiotic resistant diseases. Now think about that. This is something that sprayed on your crops. Okay. So when I both know what happens when somebody takes low dose antibiotics, it destroys the lining of the gut. Right. It leads to IBS, to celiacs, disease, rheumatoid arthritis. All of these autoimmune disorders all start because of gut permeability. Right. Well, if you're today glyphosate is ubiquitous. It's in food, it's in drinks, they're finding it in human breast milk that mothers feed their babies. It's in tampons. It's everywhere. And a lot of people don't realize that they're consuming glyphosate throughout the day. They're eating away at the lining of the stomach. Once the lining of the stomach is destroyed, once the gut microbial diversity is destroyed, the stomach, the intestines, the large intestine, the small intestine, they become populated with fungi and with microbes that were never supposed to be there. The small intestine is supposed to be, it's not supposed to have anything in it. Right. And everybody got microbed. That's why if you look at these people, Dave, the distension starts right at the thorax. It just literally pushes out. The small intestine is transverse, right near the liver. It goes right across. That's the small intestine filled with gas and pushing out. And then the stomach just becomes round from their own because the entire intestinal tract is in flame. So I would predict that a philodity's bodybuilders did a urine analysis and looked for their glyphosate load. They find that it's very high. It takes a long time for the inflammation to go away. It doesn't go away sometimes in a year. You have to, because it didn't become inflamed like that in a year. This is like after decades of exposure. But that's my bet. It's, look, insulin, testosterone and estrogen, or even oxytocin, or having effect on microbial diversity. What we're seeing today is inflammation from, from, from the asophagus to the Anis, is no doubt my mind about it. And they get brain fog from it. They develop other issues from it. If it stays around long enough, they're now, the show I'm doing next week, links, probiotic use and, and metabolic acidosis. A lot of people don't realize they have metabolic acidosis. They wake up in the morning, they have brain fog. They just take more caffeine. They don't realize that some of the early signs of metabolic acidosis is headaches and waking up in the morning feeling like somebody, your head is stuffed with cotton. So, how do you, how do you combat that coral, do you think? Okay, so what I'm doing right now to help reverse some of my autoimmune disorders and it's working for me. The first thing is, you and I don't like enzymes. We had this conversation back in like 2000 and 7. But here's when to take your enzymes. If you take your enzymes with your food, you take hydrochloric acid, amylase, protease and lipase. Those are the, the four things you should take. You take those and hour and a half to two hours after the meal. I did a show three weeks ago about using baking soda before meal actually makes a lot of the symptoms of autoimmune disorders go away. There's a published study. When I got down to the nitty gritty, I said to the scientists, so what is it? Is it the alkaline of effects of baking soda? Is it the CO2 that's released? He says, no, when you take baking soda, the rebound is to produce more acid in the stomach to overcome the buffering. So what these guys at Gals are doing is they're just increasing the acidity of the gut before they introduce the meal. I said so in other words, enzymes could be used. He goes, yeah, I think so. But what I discovered is if I eat a meal about an hour and a half later, I'm belching. I shouldn't be, that meal has moved out of my stomach. So there's undigested food still in my stomach. That's when I take the enzymes and I swear, the belching goes away immediately. Immediately. Yes, yes. And the other thing that it does is this, the doodnum is the vestibule where acidity changes. The gut has high acid, hydrocholk acid, the stoichi of one, the doodnum is where actually, a bicarbonate is, is excreted so that when the, the chime, the food moves into the small intestine, it doesn't have any acid left in it. What's happening here is the doodnum is becoming populated with microbes. And then it just keeps on growing into the small intestine. If you start taking acid enzymes, I got to slow down. In between your meals, it will actually destroy the microbes in the doodnum and slowly into the small intestine. You can actually read yourself of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth by starting that. And then obviously avoid all sugars and starches for a period of time because we're now finding out, you're going to get a kick out of this. The culprit microbe are the lactate producing microbes, lactobacillus acid, dophalus, lactobacillus this, bifidobac, these are all lactic acid producing microbes. These are the ones that are being seeded into the doodnum and the small intestine. And these are the, and what, and what is everybody taking in antibiotics today? Lactobacillus, they're down at kimchi, they eat in yogurt. It's all, it's all the lactic acid producing microbes. We're not supposed to have that many of them. Okay, so, but what I, I, but the whole thinking is that everyone is deficient in these, in these microbes and that's why everyone's taking probiotics. What do you say to that? Well, what if we're finding that that is an incorrect assumption. You see the problem being just mentioned that you just mentioned leaky gut and permeability and the gut because of all the depletion of the good bacteria there. So how do we receive the, the colon? So so first of all, you, what you don't want to do is preferentially plant one type of microbes, okay? And what we've been doing for the past five years with the probiotic movement is just giving ourselves one type of microbe. So the first thing is that you got to stop this preferential seeding number one. Number two, your body will correct, your, your microbes react to your diet. By crawling with diversity changes in as little as 24 hours based on the food you eat. You know when I'm using to help cure myself, Dave, you won't believe I came home from Ireland after drinking booze and eating bread. And I swear to God, I felt friggin horrible. I just started doing the dron the diet. I'm eating beef and eggs for every meal. The bloating went away. The gas went away. My stomach is flattening out. Uh, and, and a lot of my symptoms are starting to subside. So it depends on what you eat. That's what will influence what you do. What do you think is doing a ketogenic diet? And your stick is in a protein and fats basically. But see your, your, your, what a ketogenic diet you and a ketogenic diet to me is a bed of diet than the ketogenic diet that most people are doing today. I've done three shows about this already. Yeah. Look, the prevalence of ketosis in our ancestors was only during starvation now. Right. This stands something. A half a millimole of ketones in the blood. Most people wake up with that if they didn't eat too close to bed time. That's not what I'm talking about. But today there's this senseless challenge. Well, how, how high can you get your key? Oh, mine, the 4.5 millimole. The only time that happened was if you were starving. Right. So that actually creates genetic imprints in you that you are not a good hunter. You're actually a good starver. And that kind of ketogenic diet is not good. Unless you're battling brain cancer or seizures and you're using it therapeutically. Right. The ketogenic diet you and I talk about, which is very high protein, moderate fat and very low carb. The body goes, oh, we're getting a lot of food. We're producing ketones. Maybe one and a half, two millimoles a day. But I'm getting a lot of protein. This guy's a good hunter. Yeah. I agree. All right. So what role do you think that growth hormone IGF1 insulin plays in gut distension if any in your theory? I don't believe the notion that people promote completely that IGF1 and growth hormone cores rampant organ growth. I, while there is evidence of some organ growth, that's not the reason for the distended stomach. I agree. I think that a sensible regimen, like I use, I use a growth factor 1 through 29 and GHRP 6 every morning and post workout. I'm using only 100 micrograms of each because that is the saturation dose for adult men. You don't need any more than that. I don't get super hungry from it. I don't get flush feeling from it. If I get flush and hungry, then I use too much. That's a sensible regimen. That's not going to cause my gut to blow up. However, these hormones do influence microbial diversity. So for instance, it's like, I use oxytocin post workout. All, all guys should. So oxytocin increases a particular micro called L-Routary, which is associated with longer lives at better age. They do play a role in microbial diversity. I don't buy the whole, it's making me big and fat in my gut. I don't buy that. I believe that the antibiotics, especially GH and insulin caused the organs to swell. And I don't know if it's an inflammation thing or if it's just growth hormone and insulin make all the muscles swell. That looks good in skeletal muscle, but in smooth muscle, obviously it doesn't because it's all located right in your abdominal area and it's pushing the gut out. So I think there's a combination of what you're, I think your theory is partially right, but I don't think it's complete because we don't see it in actual bodybuilders and they're eating a ton of food. But you see it in way more in GH insulin using bodybuilders, Carl. And you're right. And that influencing the microbial diversity of the gut could be leading to them being more susceptible to getting that inflammatory response in their gut. There's no doubt about it. So as a bodybuilder who has to eat all this food, and what's the taking drugs, is there any solution? I think that you have to be cautious about your choices of starchy carbohydrates, grains. So I just did a show about a study that people can join. If they go to my website, superrido.net, you can join in. There's a glyphosate study right now. You have to pay for your own glyphosate test, but you become part of the study. How much? $99. And I just got, yeah. And so what I think people need to do is they need to become cognizant of foods that have the highest level of glyphosate. Now wheat does because they use it to synchronize the crop. They literally spray the crop of wheat two days before harvesting it so that they kill the wheat and it's easier to thrash and separate and do all that sort of stuff. Okay. Well, there's a couple other crops that I just found out I didn't know about. All beans, beans, legumes, chickpeas, they have the highest degree of glyphosate retention because they do the same thing with beans. They're using it to synchronize the crop and oats. My beloved oatmeal. I have to eat organic oatmeal now because oats was number three on the list. So it's wheat, beans and oats. You have to buy your gan. I heard brown rice too has a lot of that. Does it? I don't know about rice because brown rice in here. Because the husk. Well brown rice, okay. So there's a different issue with things that have husks, right? Any kind of seed. The anti nutrients that are designed to keep bugs from eating them are on the shell of the seed. So white rice, they strip the husk off. Right. All the anti nutrients, the lectin state are in the husk. That's why I don't eat brown rice for that reason. Right. Or wild rice. Interesting. You know, because you always hear brown rice is better. You can, while all these whole grain type stuff and now we're hearing stuff. It seems like call every week they come out with a concert at the same state and they say, one week they say fish oil is good for you. The next week it's not going to be a few. One week brown rice. No white rice now they say, why rice don't eat brown rice. It's so confusing even for people like you and me who are kind of in the industry and know on top of the food chain, how does a beginner person know what the eating, everyone's afraid. So what I tell people is don't listen to anything. Listen to your body. Your body will tell you what your foods are not being processed properly and which ones are. I just did this rant at the end of today's show. I said, if your dietary approach, then let's just call it your diet. Requires you to belong to a group, go on cruises with people who eat like you. Orgue with people who don't. You are making choices not because they're good for you, but because you want to be one of the club. That's not how you should pick your diet. Yeah. It's a paleo guy. It's a vegan. The vegan, the paleo, the ceto. I mean, come on. There's people on the internet right now. They've been on ceto for seven, eight months. They're so depressed. They're losing their hair and the people tell them, well, just eat more fat. No, get off the freaking diet. It doesn't work for you. Yeah, yeah, not everyone doesn't work forever. You know, it's funny because I was in the store once and I was buying some, I think it was like a red bean burgers. They were made. They were like burgers. They were made out of beans and I just happened to like unusual foods like that. It's not that I'm a vegan because I eat, play and check in and fish and something like that. But someone saw me there and she's like, oh, you're a vegan too. Good job. And I was like, I didn't want to disappoint her. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Way to go. What else do you like here? Let's get some huddestroy, and all these other ingredients, you know, vegans. But you know, I just think it's hysterical. You're right. Club, people want to belong to club. The funny thing is I like the old Woody Allen, you know, line that he kind of was, I guess paraphrase and grow after Marx. I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have someone like me as a member. You know, that's right. Right. That's funny. Yeah, but it's what happens is when diet becomes dogma, you've lost all rational, critical thinking to approach the diet. If you eat something and you don't feel good, but the rest of the people in your club eat it, then you don't belong in that club. Because you don't, you don't, you don't you should be in that food. That's it. Simple. Well, good. Very good advice. You know, hopefully maybe some people learn some stuff about the standard add. I still think it has a lot to do also with the structure of the person. People are long torsos, tend to have less distension. People are shorter torsos, like high green, tend to have more distension. But yeah, I think the foods we're eating are definitely influencing it, and you brought you shed some really interesting light on some of these topics. The question Carl, before I let you go is, how do we get these? These, these, these ingredients that are sprayed all over our crops and all of our ready. What do you do? How do you not get them in your diet? If you know what, it, it, it, it, it first of all, there was no glyphosate found in meat, like beef. There was no glyphosate found in chicken. Uh-huh. There was, there was no glyphosate found in booze, believe it or not. And he thinks that it was, of course, the fermentation process, uh, uh, uh, uh, ferment actually broke it down or denatured it or whatever. You have to find out, first of all, what your glyphosate exposure has been. Right. You got to get tested. People hate to test. They just want to buy something. Well, that sounds like me all buy it. You don't even know if it's going to work for you because you don't know if that's why you feel that way. But get tested and learn which foods are high in glyphosate and avoid them. It can be done. It takes a little discipline. But look, serious bodybuilders, they're eating chicken and broccoli six meals a day. If anybody can do it, they can. Sure. The average person, you know, a long time ago and you and I have actually talked about this, I divorced myself from flavor. Uh-huh. I, I'm not a gastronomist. You know, I don't want to have all you know, I'm the bathed in a chipotle. So no, give me a steak, give me four or five eggs. I'm happy. Yeah. So if you are driven by gastronomy, you have to have sexy, amazing dishes, you know, Michelin star restaurants, you're going to be exposed to a lot more this stuff, unfortunately, because that's where they use it. They're using it all these commercial establishments. But learn what has glyphosate on it. Listen to that show I just did. I forget what show number it is, but it's at super-radiol.net. And learn what has glyphosate on it and do your best to avoid it, get tested, eliminate those foods, get tested again. Very, very simple. You know, I, I'm going back to my, I think I'm going to go back to my original diet. And it works for me when I was at my biggest and my hardest and freakiest, I think it was probably the safest diet. I'm going back to eat McDonald's every day because I think that's the only, at least you know, it's in it. McDonald's is, is it, you know, China and get McDonald's, you could eat McDonald's in California. It's the same McDonald's you're going to get. And you know what, I think artificial foods like that, the way McDonald's is made is the way even the future. Probably the safest, at least you know what you're putting in the stuff. Well, I was so, so on that note, when I don't bring food to the studio and I get hungry, I go to Wendy's. Yeah. And I asked them off the all the cart menu. Yeah. I said, can you and they say sure, and I go, give me six beef patties, the large ones. That's a pound and a half of beef. And I sit there and I eat them and they look at me like I'm crazy. Yeah. Half of it. You know what? It's safe. I know what's in it. It's just beef and salt. That's it. Right. It's flavoring. And then. See, after all this, you thought everyone thought they were going to take on this, this very wise insightful, nutritional mantra and secret. And the bottom line is calling, I am telling you, go freaking eat fast food. That's the bottom line to save the thing that you can possibly eat. And on that note, we're out of time. Until next time, I'm Dave Lumber with Carl and Naur for another edition of Live With.

Alright, until I've vision on rxmuscle.com, this is astabe better known as hashtag astabe brought to you by species nutrition visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm your host of the Furuki Fizz. Is your 30 minute question and answer show with Dave Flumbo all your questions on diet, training, supplementation, IFBB pros, competitions, whatever's on your mind, it is all on the tables. We now go to Dave Flumbo Dave you look like the kind of a promoter you would see running up and down the biggest strip tell us about the elaborate ensemble you have on. My good friend Rob Swaffer, the Mexican national shirt, it's great. I mean this thing has got all kinds of blingol over it. It's got the back as even better. I don't know if I can turn around yet. I don't want to ruin my life. It's just an awesome shirt this thing. I don't think I can wear it out. I think it'd be too embarrassed to wear it out. For TV it's great. I feel like Bob Chicker will a little bit. Those little suits he wears up on the MCs. The Mexicans not had to do it. They just bling it out and they're like, man, we're throwing a party. We want everyone there. That's really what the national's worth. It was like a three-day fair. Just like non-stop, you know, fun. He was down there. He lives in Mexico now and he sent me back to shirt. I had a wear. It's the represent. I also want to say another thing. My good friend, Mr. J, George Smolley. I've been talking about this for two years now. I think he finally is ready to put these on the shelf. Mr. Pots, potato protein, potato chips. They're actually regular potato chips that have their ruffles, potato chips that actually have a protein coating on them. So all the different coatings, all the flavors. That's where the proteins. 12 grams of protein per bag. I love these things. I'm completely addicted to them. They decided to put them in this new white bag. I think it's a good idea because what happens is you can actually stand them up and they stand up on the counter by themselves. So they're kind of like a great promotional piece right there for themselves. And these will be available soon in all stores in 7-11 and stuff like that. So Mr. G, congratulations. You've got a great pride here. We're completely addicted then we fight over these in the office. Thank God Mr. G supplies us with 20 of these. And my kids eat them. I eat them. My wife eats everyone who's in the office. Tyler Eat some. And they're just delicious. And we could justify and because they got protein on them. I'm vacuum Mr. G. Of heavy muscle TB fame. Let's go to the questions. The first two questions on the show from the Dave Palombo experience at first question. When taking antibiotics, why wouldn't tapering up yield more gains over the period of time? We know we can only add muscle so fast so if taking 500 mg of test a week, let's me gain a couple of pounds a week. Why would I ride that out until I hit a plateau and then add more tests or another ballic? Well, having said that, why would you take any more than 500 mg of test? It goes back to the old saying when you first start, you don't eat a lot of stuff. At some point you get to a threshold where you're like, you know what, I want to maximize my gains over the period of time. So if you're doing an 18-week cycle and half that cycle you're doing 500 mg a week, you might be losing some gains that you might have been making had you been taking a thousand milligrams a week. Now, having said that, if you do 2000 or 3000 milligrams a week, you're not necessarily going to get more gains at that point, you're just going to get a lot more side effects. So, you know, personally, I think that about a thousand milligrams per week is ideal for muscle gains with the minimal amount of side effects. When you go over that, you tend to get more side effects when you go below that, you don't get as much muscle growth. So that's why, you know, in people that are experienced users, that's usually the threshold amount that you'd want to do. You never want to go kind of less than that because once again, you're not going to maximize how much muscle you put on because you're only, you're not on all the time. You're not on three to 65 days here. You can't do that. You won't respond that often. So when you are on, you want to maximize the ability or you maximize your ability to build muscle during that period of time. And if you're not taking enough, you're cheating yourself in a sense. Second question, again, from the Dave Plumbo Experience app, on a maintenance diet, is there any benefit to metabolism, tossing in a cheap meal, or a once weekly, higher at day. So I guess the question is, cheap meal or cheap day on a maintenance diet? I think you should always have a cheap meal. I think you should never eat the same thing all the time because your body stagnates. It platoes. It understands what's going on. And then what happens is it stops making progress. So whether you're trying to lose weight or whether you're trying to gain weight. Now if you're trying to maintain, I think you're just going to get stagnant in the sense that you're going to feel like, all right, I just don't feel I'm losing the drive to go in the gym. Always give your brain and your body that extra something special. That meal meal meal meal, you can kind of let loose once a week. Think about it. If you're eating six times a day, seven days a week, that's 42 meals a week you're eating. Okay. If one out of 42 meals is something a little junkier, okay. You're not setting yourself back anything. If anything, you're only making improvements to your physique. And you're only going to help spike your metabolism and shock your body into new growth into new fat loss. So I think it's a good idea to have a chain meal once a week. ATL fantasy are quant sleeps, genetic also have you ever seen someone put site enhancement oil in outer quant sleeps with good results. I don't like to do site enhancement oils in the quads. You always, almost 99% of the time it's going to look lumpy and fake, okay. Genetics, a sweep to your legs has a lot to do with the genetics, but it has a lot to do with building muscle. Everyone's quad shape is going to be different depending on what your genetic potential is. So if I blow my legs up as big as they can get and the next guy does his, the shape will look completely different. You can't really influence that. However, you can influence how much muscle you put on your body. And that's what you have to work on. So whether you have your feet positioned this way or this way, this way, this way, you're probably not going to change that much on the development that you're going to get on your legs. However, if you open your stance up, you're going to involve more adductor of the inner thighs, which is going to girth and make a girthier quad. You keep your feet close to the other side. You're going to really just target and quad and kind of eliminate that inner thigh, which a lot of times gives the muscles the leg muscle to smaller. Look, because you don't have as much your missing out on a whole muscle group. So while foot position is not that important in or out with wide and close does make a big difference. You know, there is ways of influence, you know, how your legs look, but ultimately your genetic shape is your genetic shape. Excellent. 187. I've been training for nearly a decade now. I've competed. I've been ripped. I've been strong. I've had striations of invasculoid, but I've never had my self-alic vein pop out. Is there any signs or training method to bring out one self-alic vein? You're talking about the vein that goes right down the middle of the bicep. And you know what, I had one of those from the day I started training. Okay, it wasn't that big. As I got bigger and bigger, it got thicker and thicker and it looked more impressive and more impressive. So I always had veins. You know, I haven't now. I'm only 190 pounds. So that's just my genetics. Can you make them come out? Can you make them bigger? Yeah, through training. But genetically, if you don't really have them all the time, you'd probably, the only time you'll probably have them is like right before a show. And you suck out all the water and you burn up all the subcutaneous fat. If you tend to be vastly lower all the time, you'll get more of asking them before a show. And that's just the way it is. Some people have a lot of superficial veins and very low body fat and thin skin. Like myself. Other people have thicker skin, but they put muscle on. They have more dense muscle on their body, because that's just the way their body is a wire. Once again, a lot of genetics. A lot of Olympia related questions from PT Heavy Online is this the year that Flex Lewis gets the throne and then Carolos 98. Dave, can you get Phil Heath on this channel? I don't think that Flex Lewis is going to lose unless we see how he's shooting somehow get a visa from Iran, which we're in the process of working on right now. I'm involved in this project. I don't know if it could happen, but we'll see. And we'll get Phil on the show. That's in the works as well. Obviously, as you guys know, Phil is no longer exclusive to AMI and he's able to do interviews. Once again, if I do an interview, however, I want to make sure it's going to be something special and something that's unique, not like everyone else is going to do. So, it might not happen overnight and we're in talks with him so that's definitely on the pipeline. Sean Willey, Dave, do you have any tips to help tighten up loose skin designs? It naturally tightening up over time. You know, that's a question I get asked a lot. And to question I don't really like because I don't really have an answer to a lot of people. People come to me and they show me this, they would 300 pounds and now they're 180 pounds and they get this loose skin hanging on their lower stomach. What can they do to tighten it up? A lot of times, there's nothing you can do. But then there's a lot of times where I see spontaneously people lose weight and they keep it off for six, eight months and the skin tightens up. So I don't ever like to say it's impossible but it's unlikely if you have that loose saggy skin there or that it's going to overstretched a lot of times it doesn't come back. Look, I have on my back my arms, I have loose skin just for being, you know, having 24 and charms and now I have, you know, whatever, 16 and charms of 15 hits or whatever, they all I don't measure them. You know, it's just the skin was stretched out tremendously when I was huge, you know. And so I have loose skin, I have no body fat but I have some skin there. It's not hanging, you know, terribly but it's still there and it's bothersome, you know, if I was going to walk around with a shirt off, I wouldn't like it. But hey, that's what happens, you know. It's better to be 180 pounds in shape and lean with a little loose skin than being a fat slob with no loose skin, right? I mean, let's face it. That's the bottom line. Now, for a lot of women who come to me and they say, hey, I lose skin under that of my arms, I don't know what to do. On my butt, it's loose. I don't really, I kind of, I'm in shape and they show me pictures and they aren't shaped. I'm like, you got to build more muscle there. The muscle will stretch that skin tight and that's really the only solution. Now, if it's on your lower abdomen, unfortunately, most of the time the solution is to get a tummy tuck, you know, tummy tuck, you know, skin reduction there. The top roller wants to know if being on an anti-estrogen and finasteride would make a dose of testosterone more and a ballad than it takes in a low-intzense less of it converts. Well, if you have less testosterone converting to estrogen and DHT, you have more available to build muscle. So that's just logical. If you block the estrogen production, you block the HCH production, you can have more testosterone available. So that, you know, there's nothing really to shocking there. However, having less testosterone and less DHT doesn't mean you'll build muscle better, okay? It'll mean you'll build muscle better if you have more testosterone about around it doesn't mean in other words, they don't, estrogen doesn't stop muscle building in the matter. In fact, people have a lot of estrogen build muscle better, usually because estrogen sensitizes and angiogen receptors to a certain degree. I think that's why women can take lower doses of drugs and they can grow better. I think because they have so much estrogen in their body, they actually have better angiogen sensitivity. Not to mention, they're angiogen receptors are better just to begin with because they don't have a lot of testosterone in their body. They don't produce any. It's very, my new to mounts coming from adrenal angiogen and it's like the HAA. And so they have to be able to be responsive to that. So women have a double bonus on building muscle quickly. That's why when I see women taking ridiculous amounts of drugs and a ballics that have tons of side effects, I cringe because there's no reason to them to use that. A little animal, you know, and they can put a lot of muscle on with that. Claw, Dave, have you ever refused to coach a client for a show because of extremely unhealthy blood work? No, because I always see it as a challenge to fix the blood work. If I get to one with unhealthy blood work, I want to get them to have improved blood work. And a lot of times, just putting them on like macadamia, no oil, fiber lies, omega lies, these, you know, are like a liver, you know, liver stable from molecular nutrition, kidney stuff. Once I get them on this, I clean up their organs, we clean up their blood, you know, and they're doing terrific in one to two months. And a lot of times their doctors will be, and then they lose weight on top of that because they're on a diet with me. Their doctors like, I don't know what you're doing, whatever you're doing, don't stop. I've had so many people tell me that. And a lot of times, it's just because I'm getting their diet cleaned up and I'm getting them to lose weight. But then you put those essential fatty acids and are very important. And fiber, very important, pulling toxins and lowering LDL cholesterol, you can't believe just on a couple of supplements and a little too diet changes how radical you can change the blood work around. Moving to 222 advice on holding onto leg size with age. Note that he is, don't stop training him. You know, so just stop and you lose the muscle. It's hard to get it back. Obviously, I had the quads here and I was at the gym a lot and I still can't train legs well because I have this quite a still partially torn. I'm going to need to have it on the surgery probably in the next year or two whenever I have free time. I think good luck for that. So I lost a lot of leg mass and I don't know if it would come back if I trained it. But I think the guys who never lost the mass to begin with, they seem to be able to hold it. I've talked about Dexter Jack to me in the age of one. He never lost any leg size. He never really had huge legs to begin with but he has good legs and he never lost the leg mass and so he's able to maintain it because he's still able to train he has no injuries. That's the key. If he would have stopped training for two years and just kind of like do nothing for his legs and they shrunk up and then he went to try to put that size back on, he'd have a difficult time. And that's just the way it is. So the key is don't, if you don't want to lose legs, don't stop training your legs. Tyron Ram Deep can you tell Subanchar or Riddhmea you said you had it during exercise. What does it feel like? The weird thing is it doesn't feel like anything. I don't even know what happened. The only reason I knew I had it was because I was wearing a heart rate monitor when I would ride my bike. You put those scraps around your chest and you have a little readout on your latch out, on the little garments, readout on my bike. And I was seeing, I was looking at these high numbers and like this is impossible. I feel fine. So I went to the doctor and got a check and they thought it was a mistake too. And then they tested me and they'll like, no, you're really, you're throwing these crazy rhythms. So, you know, to play and say, obviously, I don't want to have a heart attack or something like that. And I never had an episode where I actually felt it. But I don't want to get to that point. That's how people drop dead suddenly on basketball courts or on soccer fields, I don't know where. And so that's why I addressed it aggressively. And I think you got to do that. You got to know what's wrong with you and what's right about you. And so that you don't get surprised because people die because they get surprised because they're not ready for it. If you're ready for, or you have a contingency plan of something happens, then you could get through the incidents. You know, I don't, I try not to do super high intensity exercise anymore if I can help. But that doesn't mean I can't run up a flight of steps. It means that I can't, I can't go bike riding for an hour straight, you know, pushing maximum, you know, RPMs. It's not smart. And it doesn't serve any purpose. And I'm not preparing for the, you know, toward a France anytime soon. Tell your own limitations and it doesn't mean that you should live and fear them, which is means you should beware. Watching ass Dave on our ex muscle.com brought to you by species nutritionals. Got a Carlston iron burner Dave. What's the best way to build a nice tricep ed? You know, I always found at least in my body because I have very long arms that using isolating what unilateral movements with cables work the best. And you know, I really learned that from Vince Taylor. He said that, you know, you don't have to go crazy super heavy with compound movements for arms because they respond to isolation type movements. So, you know, if I do reverse grip pull downs, if I do one on push downs, if I do over him cable extensions, I can say I can do that that's my new shoulder. It doesn't hurt. Or if I can't make extensions, even some kickbacks, you know, that's going to really isolate my muscle, my tricep heads. And I can go heavy on those. And that's going to build muscle. I found that that was the best way to probably the second half of my career. I built my arms using these techniques. Heavy weights, isolating movements, unilateral one arm at a time. And I have good arms. I, you know, when I started out my father used to say to me, he goes, you're never going to be a good body. You just don't have the arms of these guys. And I'm like, it would drive me crazy because I knew he was right. And it took me a while, but you know, I built 24 in charge. So, anyone can do it. If you put your mind to it and you eat enough food and use the right training techniques, you can add muscle to your body. Let's go to Jacobi, Alber, Alvi, Dave, how does a mega fats bring down inflammation? And it's something like omega lies comparable to kidney stuff in terms of inflammation reduction. Yeah, kidney stuff is special because it reduces inflammation around the kidney tubules. And that's by reducing the inflammation and allowing these tubules to dilate more. You can get better filtration at the kidney tubule, which means you're going to get lower creatinine and the UN levels, which is what we want, meaning the blood is being filtered more efficiently. Right? I mean, that's what we're looking for. But the omega-3 fats, you know, specifically DHA EPA, which is the omega-3 intermediates, actually reduced total body inflammation. There's actually another fatty acid in omega lies called pulmetallag acid. It's an omega-7 fatty. It's not essential, but it's also a terrific reducer of total body inflammation. And obviously when body inflammation is lower, the incidence of heart disease and any kind of cancers and chronic degenerate diseases decreases. So these are mega fats by their nature. The omega-3 is just reducing inflammation. Now, it's interesting. The omega-6 fats will be actually put in omega lies specifically coming from primos, well, gamma-limalag acid, GLA. Also, it's probably one of the only omega-6 fats that's anti-inflammatory as well. So we only put the anti-inflammatory fats in omega lies, so that it's hard to healthy and you know, you're getting the fatty acids that are very hard to get from the diet. And that's the key. Because you're not going to get these essential fats from your diet, you could be deficient in them. So rather than be deficient in them, I created an insurance policy type fatty acid supplement. You take that every day and you don't have to worry if you're getting the right amount of certain types of fats in your diet as long as you're getting the fats in. And that's the key. That's why I like to really focus on diet-wise, on the mono-insaturated fats, which are not essential, but they're hard-healthy. Like macadamia, and other well olive oil, if you can find real olive oil, even have a cod oil. Those should be, you know, the predominance of a lot of your fats in your diet. And then the supplemental fork should come from your omega-3s and 6s. Another Olympia related question from Tony Melzond. Do you see anyone new cranking the top six in the open class this year? If so, who gets balanced out? I'll give you the top six from last year. Bill, the Romney, Bonack, Dexter, Rodin, and Rolie. I don't think that might, I don't think we're going to see anyone else in that top six that's going to really shake up anything. I think you'll see it in the 2012, you're going to see some new talent in there. But I don't know. I just don't think there's anyone, you know, maybe Nathan the ash should get sneak in there. But then again, who do you throw out of that top six? That's the question. No, if Kai Green would enter the show, I think that he would be certainly in the top six. And someone would get booted out of there. I think Rolie's going to move up. If anyone was going to get kicked out of that top six, it might be like a rodent, you know, because he's had some health issues earlier this year, although I hear he's looking really good and he's at the best ever. So I don't think we're going to see the same top six this year. Cosm L centri or Rimidex. Is it a must-during cycle? Does it help with libido? Can someone off-cycle? Use it. Well, Rimidex blocks the conversion test often into estrogen. If you're a person that aromatizes testosterone really easily, meaning you convert a lot of testosterone to estrogen, a remees is an absolute must-during. And you know who you are. You know when your estrogen is your whole water, your nipples are sensitive. You hold body fat in your lower body, like a woman would, and that's an estrogenic person. That's the person who absolutely needs a Rimidex. When I was on hormone replacement, I never took a Rimidex because I just didn't need it. I didn't aromatize that much in my body. And I think it's because my body fat levels were really low. So you have to figure out what you're genetics are. Now if you do take some a Rimidex and you lower your estrogen, you're going to suppress your natural testosterone much less because it's estrogen that suppresses the pituitary from releasing LHNFSA, which stimulates testosterone production. So if you don't have any estrogen around, you're not going to shut off that feedback loop, and you're going to produce more natural testosterone. So once again, you got to go by what are your genetics and are you estrogenic and not do you need your dog you need it? Stolen adult 2 with a question on a column Von Mologer based on your experience, will column Von Mologer be able to squamp beyond 315 again or better yet, bring his quads to the development he once had? I thought I was going to be able to. I was actually squiding 225, you know, and from easy reps and I thought I was going to go back to 315 although I wasn't ready to push it at that point. But you know what, my quad just didn't hold up and it like, oh, now he's a younger guy. So he should he'll find. He should recover from the surgeries. Long as he doesn't try to repel off the side of a free impairment, something like that. And he's here with just something like that. He should recover and he should be out the lift again. He should be out of the belt branch warranted. The branch warrant wasn't doing crazy stuff either after, you know, his surgery. So who knows, you know, I'd like to see him get back. I like his physique. I think he's got a good personality. I'd love to interview him, you know, one of these days. And I think that he's a real talent. I think he's his own worst enemy right now. TJ O'Connor, the vacuum pose has been a super popular has become a super popular pose once again in body building and especially with the classic physique division. My waist has always been small, but I can't seem to create that sucked in look. What are some techniques to help hit this pose effectively? And the shout out, Shani Grant responding below on that question as well. Okay. You know, I, I, I, I, I love the vacuum pose. I do. I think, and I think I like because no one was hitting it. Now that everyone's doing it, it's kind of making me a little, I'm just not kind of getting a little bored with it. To be honest, not everyone should hit the vacuum pose. Okay. Because not everyone looks good in the vacuum pose. Some physiques don't look that good. It's just weird looking on them. So, you know, if you have a real deep ribbox like Arnold did, you know, that vacuum pose is a, and that vacuum looks great. But a lot of guys that doesn't look great. So, you got to determine what works the orthozyg. Don't try to be someone else. Don't try to hit a vacuum just because you think that's a classic pose that you have to hit. It's silly to do that. Only use it if it works to your advantage on stage. And you know, you can look at pictures and you can say, hey, that looks good or, it doesn't. And if you're not sure, ask someone else that you know is going to tell them the truth. I'll tell you in the truth. If you vacuum pose, look good. And what was the other part of the question? No, that was the question. I thought there was another piece to it. No, no, no, I said shout out to Shini Granthagashi, I was going to get another, the part of the question was how do you get to do a vacuum pose? Now, if you're having trouble hitting the pose, you can do these intestinal excess breathing exercises that I've talked about in other videos. But you kind of just put your hands on your stomach. You suck in, you push out, you suck in, you push out. You do 300 of those a day. That's working that transverse abdominis muscle. That's the inner layer of muscle under the rectus abdominis. Though that layer of muscles are responsible pulling in your stomach. That's what you're doing on a vacuum pose. You're pulling in your stomach and then throwing your arms up so that you hitting that vacuum. So you're blowing your air out and sucking your stomach into the same time. But if you don't have strong transverse abdominis muscles, you're not going to be able to pull your stomach in that much. That's why you got to start doing these intestinal breathing exercises once again. In, out. It feels unnatural to push out, but you push out, you push pull it, you push out, you pull it, and you do that 300 times a day. Within I promise you within a month or two, you're going to see a complete difference in the way for you execute that vacuum pose. Car 84, how to train and eat right with an active chronic ulcerative colitis. You got to be careful, you got to find what works for you. The food you know, you're going to figure out which foods you're body tolerates, which one doesn't. A great supplement is by standard processes, is by as well you have complex. It's got a very strong extract of as well you with a couple other anti inflammatory herbs in there. You take that and it seems to calm down the colitis tremendously once again. You've got to be able to eat, you can't become a victim of your colitis. You have to find a way to get it done. Get those meals in, eat clean, try to stay away from irritating foods. Try to take a probiotic, whether it be a body sour crowd, a couple servings every day. These are things you've got to do. You have restrictions on yourself when you have all sorts of colitis. But if you live by those restrictions in there and you know what irritates it makes it worse and what makes it better, then you can control the disease. Bahama Jamal, would you please talk about sugar alcohols and sugar substitutes like stevia and the difference between them. How are they calorie free yet taste so sweet? Well, there's different sweeteners. There's aspirate which has been around forever which is just two amino acids. A phenolalanine in a sporadic acid. You mix them together and they taste sweet. I don't know why people get so crazy about aspirate. I think it's going to cause everything from cancer and death. All these ters, autism and all these terrible things. I don't agree with you. Two amino acids mix the acid, can't be that bad for you. Now if you eat anything in an excessive amount, you're going to get side effects. So being said, don't overdo it. Now, splender is like the new generation of like equal. Because what splender is, it's superlose. It looks like a sucrose with a tablespoon of molecular, but then they've altered it chemically. So your body doesn't recognize it. And so you just don't absorb it. But it tastes, it's actually 10 times more, maybe more, sweeter than regular sugar. So that and you can cook with it. It has a good texture to it. So here's something you can certainly use. Now, steveer is something that all the naturalistic, the naturalists, I like to call them, started using. Oh, we can't use autofrocious sweetness. We only can use things from nature as if amino acids are not from nature. Whatever. So steveer actually is an herb that they find in the grown wildly, that actually tastes sweet. And the province, it's got a slight bitter taste to it. So you have to really kind of blend it. Usually it's mixed with some kind of other sweetener, artificial sweetener, to kind of even it off, and allow it to be consumed without having that super bitter taste. I happen to like it a lot. If the right type, steveer balance for me is the best one, because it's steveer mixed with the inulin fiber, which is unabsorbable, sourced fiber. And I see people get really good results that steveer balance you can even unlimited amounts of what you're dying, if they're worried about it. The problem with the splendor and equal packages is they add a gram of dextrose, or a gram of, usually, it's usually dextrose that they knew put in there. Well, I've seen multi-dextron. They're all, it's basically sugar. But it's only one gram per pack, but most people eat five, ten, five, and twenty packets a day. So that's not a good idea to do. So when you're dieting for a show, stick with the steveer balance, off season, if you want to take in a couple packets of sucrose, not a big deal. Like I said, I put it in my D-Cath coffee every morning. I know people that add it to their shakes, they make it a little sweeter. There's nothing wrong with that. Tantos, oh sorry, I just want to bring up sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols that they used to use back in the day would give you crazy diarrhea, malabsorption. They would terrible. The new one's say, like, you know, a rithritol, they're sugar alcohols, but they kind of don't really, you know, mess with blood sugar that much. But remember, guys, there's no such thing as a free calorie. Every carb count. The only carbs you can't have the count would be your five-risk carbs. But sugar alcohols is still coloric. They're not sugar, but they coloric. Time for a couple of more questions. Panos, Dave, I've heard that when you use synthetic H-H in the morning, you must not eat carbs the first meal, but thanks. Is that true? Is it release of insulin, make any negative effects on your synthetic H-H? And what's your opinion about the best time to take your H-H during the day? Yeah, I like to take a growth hormone in the morning. Because you're the most catabolic in the morning. You're having the most catabolic hormones coming from cortisol early in the morning. And then as the day goes on, cortisol drops and your natural and your hormones go off your animal hormones. So you might as well take growth hormone in the morning when you're the most catabolic to try to counteract some of that, right? Because then you're going to grow better. The problem is that a lot of people, I'm just trying to think, what was the original question? I want to go back. Oh, wow. I'm kind of blanking on that as well. Oh, yeah. It was a long question about the best time to take. But that's time for me. Yeah, I remember. I remember, as I was going to say. Oh, by having carbs, yeah, for me. So when you're taking growth hormone, because it's actually growth hormone already and you're not worrying about your body producing its own, you could eat whatever you want. Because no matter what you eat, you could eat a gallon of ice cream. It doesn't matter how much sugar is in an ice cream because if you inject G-H, you've got G-H in your bloodstream. Now, if you're trying to stimulate your body to produce its own growth hormone and you're eating a high carb diet, high sugar content, okay, that could suppress your natural G-H release. But we're not trying to get our body to release G-H. We're actually taking synthetic G-H. So it doesn't matter what the environment is that you put it in, if you're taking synthetic G-H, you've got the G-H in your body and it's going to act like G-H. And that's the bottom line. But if you're taking something that stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary gland, now you have to look at what's the environment around it because maybe you won't actually release as much G-H as you thought, if you have an ostimulus that you're giving your body, make sense? Think it should. Mm-hmm. Sorush SRD can you explain sodium loading? I'm not a big sodium load. I believe in sodium loading the whole diet, meaning that never cut your sodium. Heat would ever salt you want, it's a matter of fact, salt your foods, the more sodium you consume, the less sodium sensitive you become. How do you become sodium sensitive? Well, if you don't need a lot of salt to your diet, what happens is your body gets the senses low sodium. So it sends out a signal to release the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone's job is to re-absorb sodium and water. So eating salt will actually make you more salt sensitive because the longer you go with that salt, okay, your body starts to release and then a hormone known as aldosterone. Aldosterone's job is to re-absorb sodium and water. So if you're eating no salt, you're gonna have high aldosterone every time you do eat salt, you're retaining. If you're eating enough salt in your diet already, your aldosterone production will never go up, okay, because your body doesn't need it. So when you do eat a big salty crazy meal, you won't absorb that whole meal. You'll actually pee at everything and get rid of it because you don't have super high aldosterone. So the biggest mistake people make is somehow is restricting salt in their diet, thinking it's gonna get them leaner and it's not. Prime time, what's the idea behind having your feet elevated while winning backstage for a show? Well, the problem is when you backstage, okay, if you're on your feet, all the fluid that's left in your body will pool in your legs and you'll get swollen ankles and a lot of times your legs can smooth that a little bit. By laying down and elevating your feet, you're allowing the blood to come back to the heart and get re-circulated efficiently without that blood leaving, okay, the circulatory system and what happens is the blood's not really leaving. It's the actual clear fluid portion of the blood, the water part of the blood that was leaving and going under the skin and is gonna create more subcutaneous water, okay, we don't want that. One more question is from Iisha and Thayton. It's a question that we used to have a lot on the first few episodes of Iron Davey. Some say bodybuilding is not a real quote sport, your take. You know, you're going to the gym, you're working out. It's a physical endeavor. It requires proper nutrition, it requires sleep, right? It requires the use of possibly performance enhancing drugs. That to me is a sport. Now, bodybuilding is a sport, but bodybuilding competition is judged like a pageant, like almost a beauty pageant. There are certain guidelines that you want to look for and muscle size and conditioning and something like that, but ultimately, the judges pick who they like. What the overall look is that they're a pit that they're attracted to. That's like, hey, that's what I think bodybuilding should be about. So there's real no in stone rules. You can kind of vote for whoever you want as a judge. And so that makes it a pageant in a sense. So it's a sport in the gym when you compete. It's a pageant. Don't get upset when you don't get the placing you want because you think you deserve it. That doesn't mean that everyone else agrees with the European end of the way you look. Some people may say, you know what, he looks good, but he doesn't look. I don't think that's not a look that's appealing to me. So that's why people get frustrated. And you can't get frustrated. It is what it is. That's the way it goes. It's not a subjective sport. It's a opinionated sport. And the judges get to decide who they like and who they want and that winner circle. That is going to do it for this episode of As Game Again. Broke to you by Speeding Nutrition, visit speciesnutrition.com. For Dave Lomo and our producer Tyler Shore, I'm Siddee for Rokey. We'll see you next time.

And as you're showing, Dave, the plumber, all your questions on diet training supplementation. I, if you've you pros, competitions, of course, this past weekend, exciting, temp of pro and the Olympia in less than five weeks. So we now bring in Dave, plumber, Dave, every week, we get about four or five questions about stand, efforting and his vertical diet. Well, you just spoke to stand about an hour ago. Yeah, I know stand for many years. And we go back. He took my guru course. I did his diet years ago, a little bit as off season diet. And stands for these guys, like, really educate themselves on everything that they're doing and really immerse himself in it. And he's, you know, he's launching a new business. He's got this new diet. He's promoting it's basically like, like more of a food diet, you know, trying to get your nutrients in micronutrients from all the food you're eating. And he's been implementing it with a lot of these strong men that he's friends with, like, Brian Shaw. He's got a food service that kind of caters to the diet that he recommends. And he's working. He launched that. So he's a real business man. And so I like talking to him. So I like learning from him. Actually, I like to hear all the way. All the way, he came up with all the ideas he had. He had a tons of real estate. He bought and sold back in the early 2000s. He did the same thing with a, he built it to telecommunications business. So he's just an interesting guy. Plus he's got, you know, he's a, he's an awesome power left there. And he's a great body of older term pro at the Masters and National Years ago. So I, I just like to surround myself like with people, like him that are super successful. And here with, you know, that they did and I know the community really likes him. It's got a very popular YouTube channel now. So we got him on and I think it's, I think people like the discussion aside from my microphone issues. I was having that it was a little buzzing. The interview was terrific. Luckily, Stan talked most of the time. So again, it keep an eye out for that live. Would Stan ever been coming soon to Rx muscle dot com. Let's go to the question. The first two questions from the Dave Palombo experience at the first question. Dave, what are the process by which facts affect cholesterol levels positively and which ones are most effective for this actions? You know, what we found over the years and I always suspected this is that facts really don't change. I shouldn't say that. Fats don't really make your cholesterol worse. Okay. So you, you can need a ton of cholesterol and you're not going to have high cholesterol. But if you're trying to sugar your body will synth it seems like sugar is like almost like a catalyst for your body to start synthesizing more of its own. So what they found is that high sugar diets actually result in high LDL cholesterol, which is your bad cholesterol carriers. And that's just a cause and effect. The American Heart Association came out recently and said that the consumption of abstract rate of fats don't have any bearing on cholesterol levels. And that's a huge statement by them. For them to make that statement is validation that that's really a fact. I've been saying it for years anyway though. I mean, I have 24 whole legs a day when I was diving or getting ready for my shows and for trying to put weight on in the off season. And my cholesterol was always low. So there is a genetic component to cholesterol. But fact consumption doesn't seem to alter it as much as what your carbohydrate consumption happens to be. Now, by taking good essential fatty acids, okay, like what I put into a mechanized fish oil, even in permausa, you could definitely influence positively your cholesterol profiles lower LDLs, somewhat raised HLs, HLs, increasing by supplementation is more controversial subject. We're not really sure if there's a cause and effect on that. Taking in mono and saturated fats like a macadamin, anodol, extroversion, all-wheel, if you can find the real extroversion. We'll also lower LDL cholesterol. Likewise, fiber consumption will do that as well. But the bottom line is that the fat that you consume in your diet really doesn't seem to have a bearing anymore on the cholesterol that you're eating. Except that if you eat good fats, you can lower your your bad cholesterol. It doesn't seem like you really could raise it by eating the wrong fats, which is interesting. Second question again from the Dave Blumbo Experience app. If T3 increases metabolism of all nutritional components, if you took it off season and ate more protein, couldn't this yield more muscle due to increased protein synthesis? If you take off, why I didn't catch with what they said? If you took off season and ate more protein, could it have yield more muscle due to increased protein synthesis? Not necessarily because what the problem is that if your thyroid is not low to the game with it, you take extra thyroid, you're going to speed yourself up too much. What's going to happen is you're going to invariably eat up muscle tissue. You're going to metabolize it. Remember, if you're low in thyroid, taking thyroid will definitely increase protein synthesis. If you're already at optimal levels, you increase your thyroid too much, then you become catabolic from it. Now obviously taking out of all steroids and clumbuteral and GH can spare muscle to some degree. My guys can diet real hard on high amounts of T3 and not lose muscle. But in the average person, that's just not the case. I take them to thyroid. The off season is not necessarily a good idea because it's going to speed you up too much and it's going to make it hard to gain weight. Let's go to our Instagram questions. Again, our Instagram handle is official underscore Rx muscle. If you're following us on Instagram, check our story for an exclusive deal at Speciesnutrition.com. Let's first go to Ashley Burns, the difference between GHRP6 and 2 and what and how do you choose 1. You know, according to what I've read and anecdotally done by trying a couple of these different ones, I found that the GHRP6 seems to be the most potent with the least side effects. The only side effect of GHRP6 seems to be hunger, which if you're trying to eat more food and gain weight, it might be good. I have guys, and I'm using the GHRP6 just for appetite increasing. I don't know how great it is in terms of GH release because I don't think anyone's really tested it. But from what I've read and conceptually on paper, GHRP6 is one of the stronger ones better than 2. Kyle Maranucci, how do you know when to cut out red meat? I'm currently a bit over two weeks after my show and my leanest ever should I even cut it out totally or keep it in. It doesn't make a difference. If you're in shape already then there's no reason to cut it out. You're probably who look worse if you do. For some people I cut red meat and I switch to more fish intake because fish seems to be a better insulin sensitizer, which means that you don't release as much insulin, which means you burn fat better. So when people have trouble with burning fat, I usually switch them to all fish at the end or egg whites, and that seems to work at getting them lean or much quicker. If you look good already, don't change anything. I always tell people that don't mess with what looks great. Big John Gaines working out sciatica, I have it bad. My daily functional pain is about a four and I can get through all workouts and day-to-day life like that. However, some days like today it puts me out completely and I can't do anything. It's at a 20 now. I've been seeing a doctor and hopefully you can fix it. I think it will be the same if I worked out or not thoughts. You know, it's impossible for me really to know. First of all, why are you having sciatica pain? Is it an injury? Is it an hour ring of the spaces, the framing, the terminals come out? I don't know. Sometimes working out makes it better because it stretches out that area. It opens up the space a little more, gives those nerves a little more room to go. So then I think, you know, prod it and pinch it off. So the answer to your question is, I don't know. But you got it to go by feel. If you feel good and you feel like, you know what, hey, I'm going to go to the gym. It's going to help stretch me out a little bit. I'm going to feel better. That's fine. Don't go and try to set any records, especially if this is your first day back. Feel it out. Mikey, Diesel Dave, I just finished up a show on Saturday and I'm going to start your Clean Out Protocol next week. I remember you saying you should still run your diuretics post show for a certain amount of time. But what is the best time to stop them at post show? Clean and T3. Well, CleanMeter on T3 should be tapered down over two weeks. Usually when CleanMeter all you go down to 20 microamps twice a day for a week and then 20 microamps per day for a week and you go off. T3 can you go right down to 25 microamps per day for a week and then half of that. 12.5 microamps per day for a week and then go off. That those are easy to get off of. As far as what was the other question I'm trying to think they were asking. You're still run diuretics post show. Sorry. I'm losing my mind. Only use the diuretics if you need them. Some people think, oh Dave said use diuretics. I just keep using them every day the week after the show and they're like ridiculously dehydrated and feel terrible. No, wait. If you gain 10, 15 pounds then take a half of the isidin' before bed for a couple days. But you don't necessarily need it necessarily. Wait until you start gaining, you know, excessive amounts of weight because if you just keep taking a take and take a take and you're going to eventually have a big rebound off of it. But if you use it only when you get swollen and you get that extra water after you're body you won't rebound from that. BT4 Live Dave your thoughts on using libido pills as a pump blood flow supplement and then he throws in I guess for workouts as well. Yeah, I've talked about this before. You know, before by Agra before Seattle was around they used your Hindi for like erection medications. It really didn't work very well because your heavy can increase blood flow through the body. You know, it opens up the blood vessels a little bit to asserting the grain. When they discovered a biagrant which was the first erection medication, what they did was they discovered something that opens up the causes, the age-old dilation that causes the, you know, a pump effect what if you want in the genitals exclusively. So, biagrant increases blood flow through the genitals which is what causes erections. It doesn't increase blood flow through the rest of the body like that. It doesn't have that same effect. So, people take these biagrant before they go to the gym thinking they get it at about a pump. The only place you're getting a pump is in your, in your pants. And that's not going to help you perform better on, in the gym or on a body-building stage. So, don't be silly people. You know, stop doing, stop the insanity, okay? You just do them crazy stuff. If anything, you're more than likely to pass out on stage because a lot of times it lowers blood pressure. These, these, these anti-irection drugs were originally blood pressure meds that just happened to have as a side effect that you got in a row. That you got an erection from it. So, I wouldn't recommend taking it when you pour your alcohol at stage. Once again, don't do crazy stuff before you go on stage. Trust me. Christy Cookie, why do you think there is more drama and trash talk these days more than ever a cough cough Sergio O'Liva, Junior cough cough? Seems like social media has, in their opinion, ruined the sport beyond repair. And guys, and to talk more than letting the results speak for themselves and staying humble. More guys are offended and trash talk and let it get to them more often than it shows. So, in general, your thoughts on, I guess, the reason increase in trash talk in body-building social media. Well, these, these athletes know that social media is important for the marketability and for making money for themselves. And what's going to draw people to their page other than, you know, the great pictures of these athletes? Trash talking. Think about how many views, you know, Sergio, yeah, so how many views just and gets, you know, just in a regular way. You know, Justin Rodriguez, when they post shit about each other, they're getting crazy amounts of interaction people looking at what they're doing. I don't, I'm not, I'm the, I'm the post-journalist social media, but I'm not excessive about it. And I posted up a couple of my clients who did really good last weekend in their shows and actually was the weekend before that I think. Well, some of this weekend too, but I posted like, well, the winner is that I work with, and I got a lot of, I get tell you, I got a lot of people signed up with me for coaching after that. Because maybe they didn't know that I was still coaching people or maybe they didn't realize the results I got with my clients. And when they saw all these people, they didn't really, really well. People signed up with me. So it works. So I understand why guys go out there and sensationalize things and they trash each other because they think, well, who cares? Doesn't really bother me. And I'm going to get people responding to me and, and eventually that could lead to more business for myself. And I think that's exactly what people are doing. Worst Brown, Europeanian of using a Cerma-Rellin for bodybuilding. How effective is it compared to H.H. Avenue prescription for this along with testosterone? Cerma-Rellin is a GHRP or growth home and releasing peptide. It's Simulade's growth home and releasing hormone. It's produced by the Hype of Falmus in the brain. And what it does is it stimulates the pituitary to directly release GH. The problem is that everyone responds differently to this stuff. To compare GH to Cerma-Rellin, it would be like comparing H.C.G to testosterone. Because you're trying to make your body naturally produce a certain amount. You can't naturally produce anywhere near what your body could take. What could be, I guess, injected in usable form. Meaning that if you take three, four, I use a GH. You couldn't possibly do it released that much GH in a Cerma-Rellin shot. So the comparison is not good. If you can afford to take the real stuff, you're going to get way better results. Consentine Malamov, where you influence by Binsjuron as legacy, your method sound like you think the way that Vince did. I like a lot of what he says. He was a big protein fat advocate for building muscle and for building that animal effect in the body using nutrition. He was back in that 80s year, although when they really were using more red meats and heavy creams. So they were going with protein in fact, the fat sources were not necessarily ideal. But the concept was the same. A lot of the results they got were really good because of that. People enjoyed being in a ketogenic diet. He really was ahead of his time back in the day. He was training wise ahead of his time, diet wise, supplementation wise. I always say, I think if I've seen father, it's because I've seen stood on the shoulder of giants. Vince was one of the even scrumptious giants that guys like me and Chad and all these people stood on top of to see further. So he got us to this point and then we went further. I actually don't know if my dieting techniques were directly related to reading about his stuff. It might have been more of the spual and some of the other guys, but he certainly influenced me in some degree. Because I remember reading about his diets and his philosophies and muscle manganes, something like that. So absolutely. Marco Tunisi is a janky-lating away your testicles are forced to produce more testosterone. No. When you have an orgasm and you inject that, you're just releasing sperm. The sperm that you've produced in the testicles that were stored in the epididimus of your testicles are now just released through the spermatic ducts into the, you know, out of the urule or your rethro. It has nothing to do with testosterone, production whatsoever. You can have sperm production in the notestosium. It's unlikely, but you, you got to remember, when you go on a cycle and you shut your testicles down essentially. Okay. They're still producing a little bit, but not much. They're still producing a little sperm and not much. Okay. So when you, when you ejaculate on when you're shut down, you basically it's all the prostate and that's different. And all those, those little glands in there that are releasing fluid. Okay. But, you know, when you go back on and when you go off, excuse me, you body turns yourself back on. Now you're producing a dog and the stuff releasing sperm doesn't lower testosterone. Despite what people think, you know, the old adage and a Muhammad Ali never had sex six weeks before. Fights, we go to week in him. It's just not true. Jane Ramirez 58. Dave, how would you treat shoulder pain, which severe arthritis? How would I, I'll tell you right now, I can't imagine how to hold the time. I just suffer. I don't take any pain meds. I had my left shoulder replaced. I took some pain meds for the first four days after surgery. But I'm saying, I never needed pain. I never used pain meds. While I had the shoulder pain and while I was walking around, but now my right one definitely needs a replacement. It's been, it's been a year and I'm ready to get this one done. But I still don't. I'd rest right now in that in pain. Everything I do, moving wise hurts. But, you know, once you get on to the pain med, you know, path, it's a brutal pathway and a lot of times leads to bad places. So, if you could avoid it, I would choose that. So, avoiding it, I take arthritis, 10 pills a day, you know, five twice a day. Every day, religiously, along with my female allies, which is my minerals, which are going to help prepare the bone. And I just deal with it. And it seems to work okay. Once again, it's not getting better, but it's not really necessarily getting worse. It's just getting a little annoying at this point. So, at some point, I will get this right shoulder replaced as well. Noah, the fox, what is the best set-slash rep scheme you found to bring up your calves? I've told people this story before. I was a big believer in, you know, high rafts and high sets. My calves do not know what I would never grow. And I was in the, I was in the actual gold gym medicine. I remember, Lufra Rigna was on the machine next to me. And I got up and I was doing some calf raises. And I started really light, you know, with the way I warm up setting. Which was still a decent amount of weight. And I did this set, and I'm like, holy mac, but my calves feel pumped, man. And it's, you always get a better work at gold's advantage because of all the celebrities in them. And I'm like, this is weird. So I went and tried to do a couple more sets. And all I was feeling was the bottom of my feet hurting at this point. But I wasn't even feeling into my calves anymore. I said, you know, I wonder how I would do if I just did, like, one set of standing, one set of c to calves, since they hit different heads of the calf muscle. And just left the gym. That's it. At the end of my workout, bang that I had to take no time at all, give it a hundred percent intensity. I've one set to really, really focus on. And I did it. And I would do it twice a week every three days. And it worked great. My calves grew. So that isolation, that ability to get full range of motion, to have a nice, you know, rested calf before I'm doing my calf raises, it made a world of difference. As you are, BB20, what were the cycles of Arnold's era like for a types and doses? So I guess Arnold, that classic era, I, this question has been asked in different variations of the poor, but we'll address it here. I, look, I don't know what Arnold took. I, I never sat down and talked with him. So for me to make speculate would be merratic, okay? What the guys did like, they liked they animal back in the day, they took the animal pills, they took windshield tabs, they used a lot of decker and cream of all, you know, pre-emovol and probably went to show a really popular and contest prep. And there was no really aromatase inhibitors, they would use all the decks and stuff like that. So they were very simple cycles, they were not high in doses. No one did a thousand milligrams of tests, they would do like 500, that would be a huge cycle. And it worked for them. So training and eating was impeccable on, on point. So maybe today's, body goes to take a play, you know, page out of the playbook of these past champions, maybe it's not all about the drugs, maybe it's more about how you train and how you rest and how you allow your body to be intuitive. Let's go to a trinketous vialis better for bulking. So it's kind of a two per question here. What's better for bulking? One gram test 500 test slash 500 EQ, second part. Also, it's someone can handle the trend sides and has healthy kidney liver BV values. What a BOK to use in 10 weeks or a bit more. I think 12 to 16 weeks would be fine. And I think that, you know, I would go higher in the test, you know, anywhere from up to 750 milligrams a week, you can do with some sort of an anabolic, which maybe a lower dose is in what you're recommending. I see a lot of cycles today, by younger guys are trying to be centered on the, they think that they use more anabolic and less testosterone, less side effects than they'll grow better. The test posture is the number one building muscle building hormone in the body. So you want your base to be high in testosterone, where the B750 a thousand a week, those are really your effective dose just and combine that with an anabolic, whether it be, you know, 150, 200 milligrams of tremble on a week spread out or or DACA or EQ even or master on. You're going to get results. Remember, steroids build muscle, okay, and spare muscle loss. So it doesn't really matter what you, you know, what you're taking. You can get ready for a show taking an anagreal day. You can get ready for a show taking, you know, one shot of test of me. If you die hard and you take the right supplements, you're going to look good. Tall man Dave, I was thinking about taking caffeine pills for free workout was wondering if 200 mg around 5 p.m. before I train would be too much. I don't want it to keep me up all night. The only thing I drink all day long is water and I don't like coffee. So my caffeine sensitivity level could be different from coffee and soda drinkers, your thoughts. One more time. What does he want to take? It's a 200 mg caffeine pills at around 5 p.m. before he trains. As long as it's not going to keep you up all night, that's what I would fear. I mean, if you're pretty well adapted to caffeine, then it'll probably be alright. But if you're taking it, it's six o'clock at night and you're not getting home to like probably 8, 8, 30. You're going to have trouble sleeping. That's a lot of caffeine to pump it to your body. Unless you're one of these people that has a very, very high tolerance to caffeine because you consume it all the time. The Russian Prince 96 Dave, I'm considering doing my first test only cycle and read a lot of different opinions on what it should be like. The majority people say that less than 500 mg of test won't do anything while some others like Jordan Peter for example advocate lower doses such as 250 or 300 to start with. What do you stress? I'm a big believer in, and I think a thousand milligrams of testosterone per week is a sweet spot. It builds the most muscle has the least side effects. I think once you drop down from there, you're not as effective. If you take 250 a week, you're just basically replacing what your body naturally produces. So you shut your body down, you replace it. That's a waste. 500 is the first threshold that you're going to get good results from. Okay, 750 is better than 500. A thousand is better than 750. And when you go over a thousand, you get diminishing returns. You get more side effects rather than the muscle growth. So I always found that a thousand of me to sweet spot. If you wanted to make it easy, you could take 250 milligrams every other day. And I think that's more than adequate. Interesting one here. I just want to save this one because the question that we ask about you during your competing career, we'd like to save those towards the end. So what's the basic nickname? Is it okay to give blood while on a A's for example, a low TRT dose of 200 mg? In terms of donating blood, do you think you're talking about? Yes. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, I don't, a lot of guys give blood just to kind of get the thickness of their blood down. Because if you take some red blood cells out, you're watering down the blood a little bit. It won't be as likely that these blood cells will stick together and cause a clot. I think it's a good idea to give blood if you're hot. But if you're not super high, sometimes you know the benefit that you get performance wise in the gym and doing cardio, because you're a better oxygen carrying capacity is a better way to go. Ashenic with hands, I know you're a big Mac nut oil fan, but what are your thoughts on butter? I used to spray olive oil until we educate him about it's low smoke point and losing his nutritional value when cooked. I think what I use is I use grass fed butter. That's the cows were fed grass rather than green. Most of the fats in the butter now or a lot of them will be these a good essential Omega 3 fats, okay, with the DHA EPA and them. And that's just good for you. So I think that's a better way to go Mac oil obviously, to Rithagoy to go as well. You don't want to have too many pro inflammatory fats which are like corn oils and soy bean oils and stuff like that. Those are just not good for you. Tony LeBeeb coming down a prep, what do you think of a zero calorie syrup flavoring, Splenda stevia, Walden Farms should they be cut out? I add them into my oats and my egg whites and they make the meals that much better. Yeah, you know, I named a million ingredients, so I don't know what he's using. I wouldn't like the Walden Farms stuff. You know, some stevia base, you know, sweeteners, even a little bit of the superlose like the splender, okay, even some as per tank, I don't have a problem with you. You know, equal packets are fine. As long as you're that overdoing it, when you do anything excessively, you sabotage yourself. If you do it in moderation and you're doing a little bit here or there, that's fun. Olympian prime, let's clear the air about this so-called cyclical ketogenic diet or CKD, where people eat enormous amounts of carbs once a week, 400 to 800 grams worth your thoughts. That's what they call this cyclical ketode diet. I don't, I think, from my experience, okay, a ketogenic diet is super, I guess effective. However, you can't eat for a whole day, okay, or two days, then the Shane had this body off the side. It was basically a ketogenic diet, but you ate for like, you know, both days, sat at a Sunday on the weekend, and it just sat you back to you for you. You can't recover from it. So all the good losses you got up to that point now are negated and reverse. You're might not gain any weight in the long run, but you're not losing weight. So to me, I'm not a big advocate or that. I don't like these super high carb days every, you know, five days or six days. It just doesn't work. Question on ice-sized by species nutrition, J, G, or G, Dave, I sliced a 100% stage 100% protein, but it's 27.5. Well, he's test 27 the new version, which has been about a year now, 27.5 grams for serving up a 31 grams serving. I thought 100% will be 31 grams of 31 grams for serving. Could you explain? I repeat the question, sir. I'm not sure. I'm going to grasp the one. So he said the ice-sized states 100% protein, but it's 27 grams of a 31 grams serving. I thought 100%. I got it. It's a 100% way isolate, meaning that we only use way isolate protein in there. Now, when you take a way isolate, okay, and you separate, okay, when you take, I should say way protein from milk and you separate and you filter off the lactose and the crap that's out of there. You can only extract so much protein. Currently, given the extraction methods that are available, we use the highest quality way isolate that you could possibly get. So there's no extraction process that is better that can yield a higher amount of protein per serving than what we have. So 27.5 grams of protein is actually 27.8, but we have to around that. 27.8 grams of protein per 32 grams of serving size is the highest yield way isolate on market, okay. So it's 100% isolate. We don't have any other, you know, like we don't put concentrate in there or anything like that. Now, we do have some isolate that's been further digested into what we call hydrolysis or hydrolysis. That's just digestion products of way isolate. Now, we only put a little bit in there because if you put too much in there, it destroys the taste. And once again, I'm a huge believer of having a high quality protein, but it's got a taste good because if people don't like to taste them, it then not going to buy your protein. And so I really pride myself to be honest with you. When we assess the cost of what it costs to make isolation, the flavoring system is so sophisticated and comes from like these certain flavor houses, it's almost like nestleys. You know, it's that expensive, the flavor system. That's more cost, that adds more to the cost than the actual protein itself. So my flavor system is more expensive than the protein. That's how disgusting and how stupid I am. But it's also how brilliant I am because we have a great tasting product that's clean. It's actually lactose free. No isolate is lactose free, but if anyone says that on the container, they're lying. But it's so low in lactose that it's not going to affect you even if you lactose intolerant because I am. And it just goes down and you're it's enjoyable. People look forward to drinking the shakes and that's what you want. If you have to say to yourself, oh no, I've got a shaking your tongue and if this is horrendous, I can't stand the taste. Eventually, you're just going to stop using the product. So we pride ourselves at species that say we have the best tasting highest quality product. Yeah, we might be a little more expensive than the next guy, but you know what? Isn't it worth paying a buck or two extra to have the best? I think it is. Last question from Matt 3.0. What does it actually feel like physically to walk around really heavy and really lean slash hard? If her dory and say it was painful on the feet, Interested to know what it actually feels like to be in that condition. It's a challenge, you know, when I was at my heaviest, I couldn't every minute of the day, I would you know, sock down a shake or put down a meal and go to the gym and train. I felt like yeah, I'm growing, but I could not wait to get home and go to sleep at night because it was so tiring to walk around with that body weight. You know, I literally, I would, I remember Paul Delet and I was talking once, You see a lot of body weight was they kind of hooked their thumbs in their pant loops of their pants or their shorts because it's so heavy to hold your arm up all day. And to walk steps was brutal, put your shoes on was brutal. And this was the off season. Now when I would die at down and I would probably wait, We'd come down under 300 into the 280, 70s. I would feel way, way better. I was still big, but it wasn't like I was hopping and puffing and wanting to go to sleep all the time. So it's not, look, you know, think about what it is to be like a fat person. Okay, I can't imagine what a fat person must feel like carrying around with that weight. Being in athlete, you know, big athletic and having a lot of muscle and carrying that weight around is got to be better because it's more functional. But it's still damn heavy. I'll tell you the day I knew that I was too heavy was when I would go to the, we would go to the beach in the 90s all the time on the weekends in the summer in New York. We go to Jones Beach. We bring these like, you know, these aluminum chairs because they were light and we carry them. And we'd sit on the beach and I eat my food and, you know, we'd make fun of people and people probably people around us would make fun of us. I mean, you know, big juice heads and everything like that. And every single, at least every other time I would go, I would lean back like to like see something or reach something and all of a sudden the chair would just go right and right half. The aluminum would actually just snap and half under the weight of my body. This happened from when I was about 280 up to, you know, over 300. Then I got into my car and I told the story before. I had a Pontiac Grand Prix with T-Tops and I got into the car and once again, I think someone, I think someone was beeping behind me and I reached back and turned around and all of a sudden I heard the seat go snap. And I actually snapped the seat of my car. A car seat because I was, I was 320 pounds. It's a lot of weight and I was a functional 300. So when I leaned back in my back, which was huge, you know, musculi contract that against that seat at my weight, it was like I was actually trying to break the seat in half and that's exactly what I did. So I knew I said you know what? I think I'm going to start diving. And I had to bite me car. That is going to do for this episode of ass day, but brought to you as always by Species Nutrition.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA PIXX Road, there's 30 year in a row. And what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching tasty pastry. It's a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Alright, tell vision on RSMuscle.com. This is as Dave better known as hashtag as Dave. You're a 30 minute question and answer show with Dave Plumbo all your questions, diet, training, supplementation. I have to be pros, news, bodybuilding, anything outside of bodybuilding and beyond. It is all on the table as we now bring in Dave. You just recorded a preview video for these, this weekend Chicago Pro. A show that had the late inclusion of one really winkler. A lot of big names in the show, Hunter LaBrada. Mahama Shabana has had impressive form this year. A son, Mustafa, Max Charles. A lot of excitement, but as you did know, this is really show to lose. I think that, you know, look, I mean, Rulli Winkler is by far the number one guy in this line. I mean, as much as I love Hunter LaBrada's physique and I think he's great, you know, he obviously really impressed the hell out of us last year. And I'm sure he made improvements this year. There's no doubt that he's coming back better than he was. I don't think he could touch a Rulli Winkler who's at 100% because I think 100% literally Winkler could potentially win the Olympia this year. I think Rulli's coming in and make a statement. He's got to be really upset from last year, not being able to do that Olympia, getting that COVID at the last minute. This is an important show for him. It's an important show for a number of reasons. Number one, it's important because he wants to let everyone know that he's still around and he's still one of the best out there. Number two, it's a retribution for not being able to do the Olympia last year. And number three, he wants that momentum going into the Arnold and then going into the Olympia. And so I think we're going to see an amazing Rulli Winkler. If we don't, this could be the writing on the wall that maybe something's going on with Rulli. But I don't, I've seen some pictures from, you know, that he's posted over the last couple of weeks. I mean, this guy is, looks insane to me. I hope he comes in at his best. He'll be hard to beat. I think Huntsal Abraut will be right there, Mo. Shabani is going to be right there. So I think we got a lot of great guys in this lineup that could potentially do some serious damage. And get, I guess what, that, two 12-class and classic class are also going to be outstanding. He got a key on pierced in and there. You got a carriage badge on my guy in there in the 2012. You're going, this is going to be a lot of battles up on that stage. And I'm thinking we're going to see some, maybe the best show in the year. We posted a picture of Caripadjo kind of a weeks ago. I mean, Ricky Form, heading into the Chicago Pro. Check that video out right now. It is live on our YouTube channel, Dave Flumbos Preview of the Chicago Curals. Go to the questions, the first few questions. From the Dave Flumbos Experience app, Dave, I know that your Keter Genie diet works great with building muscle losing body fat. But I'm trying to understand why a lot of pro bodybuilders knock it down and say Caripadjo are way more beneficial for bodybuilding use if you can explain. You've got to look at who's at the person you're dealing with. For the average person or the introductory bodybuilder, getting in shape for a competition, a lot of times a ketogenic diet works really well. It works amazing for women. Because women don't do well with carbs and women don't have crazy fast metabolism with the exception of there is a few. And I've worked with women that you got a few carbs to. When you deal with guys who however are at the elite level and they're packing 280 pounds of muscle on their body, they're competing for 10 years. They have muscle maturity. They don't walk around with a lot of body fat because the metabolism are insane. Those people need carbs. We all need a fuel source. But when you have that amount of muscle that demands down like energy, sometimes eating a ketogenic diet just can't provide that fuel source. And what happens is you want to be using the protein you're eating anyway for fuel. If you could eat carbs and I tell you, look, I've been using my ketogenic diet for years. And what I've found over the years is that for people who can metabolize the carbohydrates and eat the high protein and moderate fat, that's the best in area. But for most people, you can't give them high protein, moderate fat and moderate carbs. It's too much. They won't lose. So there has to be an expendable nutrient. So I find it for people who don't have those insane metabolism. A lot of times, using a ketogenic diet is a better approach because you're giving the body what it needs, high protein, moderate fat. Okay. And having said that, a lot of times with most of the men I work with, I don't go exclusively into a ketogenic state with them. I do some days with carbs, some days that are higher in fat. And that seems to work. And then as we get closer to the shelf, they're not losing enough weight. I'll go to more protein in fat days and go maybe into a ketogenic state. With women I usually go right into a ketogenic state because they do better in that. Why? Because their brain has a fuel source all the time. They don't get cravings, they don't get moody. I'm giving their body fat. Okay. Which is what it needs. And women's bodies, if you don't give them enough fat, especially essential fatty acids, their body will hoard fat in their lower body and the lower half of their body. Even though their upper body may get super lean, their lower body stays softer. The cost of the fat that they have a high amount of estrogen in their body. So women do better on ketogenic diets. Plus they don't like to be bloated. So when you eat no carbs, you don't hold any fluid. You look better and you mentally feel better. So once again, it's not for everyone. But if you ask that most of the people who don't like ketogenic diets are people who don't need to use a ketogenic type of amount of protein. If I'm a pro and I'm 280 pounds and I can eat carbs and I can eat protein and some fat in my diet. Now I'm going to get ripped. Why would I take all the carbs out of this no reason to? So it's not a knee jerk. Hey, this is what you have to do. It's what's the person goals? What kind of metabolism they have? What's their body? Muscle mass, weight and what's their activity level? And then you can figure out what works best. And that's what it's all about. It's about experimentation. Every person is a little different. Second question again from the Dave Pull-Ambo Experience app. Thoughts on the supplement and AD. You know, I started taking it because it's good anti-aging supplements. What's the good for brain function? I used the oral form a bit for probably six months. Then a tight medical center. A good friends over a tighten. They came out with an injectable form of it that I tried and I liked. I got to make sure a little flush when you first take it. Almost like a nice and like effect. But then that goes away after a couple minutes. And I used that for, you know, I'm still using it actually. So I find that it obviously you can inject it. It's got to be more potent at least in my mind, right? But the pill form that I use from life extension has gotten good reviews as well. So you could use both. I don't think it's necessary if you're under the age of 35 because what it really does is helps the mind of a congeria function better, which are found that all the cells of our body including brain cells. So I think it's one of these like more of an anti-aging type of situation. As we can older, this is something you might want to add to the next. They would glue to fire and glue to fire is great. But if you're really young, you probably produce enough of it naturally in your body. And you may not need to take a supplemental form of it. Obviously if you're eating, you know, a lot of, you know, taking in toxic compounds like antibiotics, it will help you deliver detox. But I find that an AD is something for probably the people over the age of 35. Obviously people in the 50s and 60s would probably benefit it for most because those are the people going to be the most efficient. Let's go to our Instagram questions again.

So truck full of pre-visitments, iron debates, interviews, the whole nine, just like we do pre-contest heading into the big contest season. Let's go to Neil Zaluski, Dave, what physique did you aim to emulate when you first started bodybuilding? You know, when I first started just just working out, I wanted to look like, you know, Stallone and Rocky and Rambo. And then it went to like more of a like an Arnold like, you know, the, oh, I can't really Arnold in some of his movies, Conan and Predator and all those movies. And then, you know, once I got past the whole movie star look, then I, you know, and I started getting it to competing. I, during the A-tademy, you'd influence something. When I saw the amount of muscle he was able to add to his body, the way he trained, blooding guts, high intensity, you know, less set, more intensity, full range of motion. I just, and I saw the nasty put on his body. That was just captivating. And I, and I've said this before. When I was at that 1993, I think it was gasposing. You did it the NPC Atlantic states. He had already been Mr. Olympia, but he made tremendous improvements between 92 and 93. And he got on that stage and almost 300 pounds, gasposing six weeks before the Olympia. And he blew everyone's mind. That's, in my head was the moment that I said, ah, ah, that's what I want to do. That's how I want to look like that. And so that was really a big, I guess a big, it gave me an image of my head to strive for. That's what I was striving for. And I said, you know what, if you can do it, I can do it. And I did achieve, you know, the 300 pound mark. I did have the level of leanness that he did. I didn't have his structure. And that's why I wasn't Mr. Olympia or a pro. But I was able to use that as a, as a vision of my head to achieve. It's hard to achieve some of you. You can't envision it. Once I saw Dory did it, I was like, yes, I can do it too. Let's go to Tony win, Dave, and getting back in a weight training almost 50 years old, haven't touched gear in over 10 years. Any advice on natural products to elevate to stonstron levels? An average guy, working at our manual work in only 30 minute break training. But so he was asking, I guess about natural stuff. And then training, would you keep it to a minimum, maybe a couple times per week or do you think maybe one body par per day and during the day worth relying on a couple of quick protein. So he's going into the whole thing about this. It must just stick to the natural supplements to racist sauce from levels. Well, for the, with training, I always find that four to five times a week is enough for as far as weight training. And I like to do one body part per day. If you're going to do four days, obviously you can combine some body parts. But more five days a week is good. You definitely want to take at least two days off per week to rest. Maybe at 50, you might want to go to a three day rest four days of training. Having said that, I think the best natural way to, you know, a lot of people don't realize it. As we get older, people think your testosterone drops. What really happens in a lot of people and they don't realize this is that it's testosterone you're producing is the same as it was when you were a little younger. More of it is converting to other stuff. And the other stuff that converts to, when I've said this a million times, I'll repeat it because it bears protein, repeating is testosterone can convert to estrogen and it can convert to DHT or dihydrotestosterone. The DHC when it gets too elevated, it can go as hair loss, it goes acne, it goes prostate enlargement. When it converts to estrogen, we know the worst thing that estrogen production does in the body and it's not gyneclamaz, it's not fluid retention. The estrogen shuts down your pituitary gland. Okay. What it basically does is it goes to the hypothalamus in the brain and binds to estrogen receptors. It tells the hypothalamus stop producing, genetic trap, genetic tropic releasing hormone. The genetic tropic releasing hormone is necessary for the pituitary to be stimulated in your brain, which then produces lootinizing hormone and fall-facilstimulating hormone, LHFSH, which stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone. So if you have too much estrogen around, you shut down testosterone production in your testicles. So it's a vicious cycle. So we get all there. We produce more DHC in estrogen. We have less testosterone around and then we shut down testosterone production with the all that estrogen production. So it creates a havoc on the body. And it does a very easy solution to the problem. In addition to trying to directly stimulate testosterone, naturally, which we can do with the espartic acid and a couple other products out there. My testolized product that I produced from species nutrition utilizes natural ingredients that block or blunt the production of DHT in the body and blunt the production or bind up and pull extra estrogen out of the body. Because you can't really naturally inhibit estrogen production because that would require something like an aromotace inhibitor. But you can grab up the extra estrogen and get rid of it from the body before it binds to the hypothalamus and shuts it down. And that's what testolized uses. Those two methodologies of limiting estrogen, blocking DHT production, and then also naturally or stimulating, early, the production of testosterone. When you put all that together, what you're doing is you're recreating a youthful scenario in your body. What is producing testosterone and it's staying as testosterone. And that's what you're real. That's the best way to naturally enhance it. So if you took like testolized three pills twice today, I guarantee you'd see a benefit. Not only that give it to a lot of kids who have bad acne problems, it cures that women as they get older and they get sending hair sometimes because their DHT levels start to predominate because the estrogen levels go down and you can take a testolized to limit the DHT production in your body and you'll see benefits of that as well. So that would be my suggestion. If that doesn't work and you just feel really low and you go for testing and you're super low in testosterone, you can contact titemeticalcenter.com, tell them day to lungo set you and you can go in hormone replacement and you have them give you an HRT dose testosterone to make GG. And I think that that would also solve the problem. But if you want to, I would suggest trying it naturally first. If you can't get it into a good range, then opt for the other hormone replacement. Well it's good to classic physique, Nash. Dave generally speaking, what's the best way to space out and dose HCG for an effective PCT after a moderately dose 12 weeks cycle of gear, not looking for the full protocol just in the ECG aspect. How long you take HCG's really up to you? I mean, for guys that are going to go back on a cycle in eight weeks after they stop, I usually do two weeks of HCG, two weeks of cloment and then four weeks off everything. If you're not going to go back on right away and you're going to stay off for six months or longer, you can do HCG for two months if you want. And I usually, I usually dose it every third day in my pregnancy protocol, my baby making protocol that I give out, I do it every other day. But for purposes of turning back on the body, every third day is perfect because you get like with HCG getting an initial dose and then you get like a second pulse after three days. So I like to do it every on every third day type of situation and usually I do anywhere from a thousand to two thousand I use every third day. And what that does is it gives you a body a nice jolt or it gives your testicles at least a nice jolt and they'll start producing more testosterone. And if you keep doing it on a regular basis, you're going to keep that testosterone production going. Now, if you're trying to clean your body out and you're trying to like get those receptors to regenerate, you don't want to stay on HCG consistently because you're going to keep your S testosterone elevated too much. You're almost wanting to drop a little bit so you take your HCG, you stimulate, let the testicles start producing something at least, then you can pull away the HCG and then whatever, you know, your body does it will probably drop the levels down a little bit because now you don't have that artificial stimulus there anymore. That's when I usually have people kick combated. So the question is, do you want to turn yourself back on because you're going to go back on in eight weeks or are you going to stay off for a long period of time in which case you might want to use HCG, you know, continuously. I take a shot of HCG every couple weeks just to kind of like wake my body up. Even though my levels naturally are good there, you know, they're still a little low and I don't really want to go on HCRT. I don't feel I need it but I like to take a shot of HCG every three weeks or so just to kind of like, boom, give my testosterone levels a rise. I stay on my test-sized products and my estrogen and DHCR lower and everything seems to work really well in that case. It was good to team team band band, good for another post-contot test question. I've always wondered and one of the explanation of the rebounding event at the contest. I wanted to place a lot of people who don't want to go. In my show Ultra-shredded and now when I eat a meal within an hour or two feels like I've never eaten any food at all personally, I've made a very good rebound putting on 15 to 20 pounds a little bit of cheating but mostly all my meals have been clean just off the quantity larger, score wondering what this physiological, I guess this question is the physiological science I guess behind the rebound given his circumstances that he's gained 15 to 20 pounds but he kind of wants a better explanation as far as coming and shredded eating feeling like he's never eaten before yet putting on that weight. When your body is being deprived of nutrients for a long period of time because you're dieting and I'm just trying to mobilize stuff out of the cells. You want to burn, you want to duplicate glycogen out of your muscles, you want to duplicate glycogen out of the liver, you want to mobilize fat out of the fat cells. Your body is not happy about this. You're hiding once to store it. Once it's trying to restore itself to what it was prior to you starting to die it but what you're doing is you're putting yourself in a deficit of energy, you're taking fat burners, you're doing cardio, you know. So you're doing all this stuff is making your body mobilize stuff out when it really doesn't want to. It likes to stay the same all the time. That's why we have a certain set point. The body will fight to stay at that set point. If you try to lower your weight, okay, by burning fat, it's going to fight you. If you try to gain weight, it's going to burn up those extra calories. That's just the way the body works. So now you do this for 16 weeks, right? You get in the best shape of your life, you're a 2% body fat and now you start to eat, okay. More food than your body requires. Okay, glycogen stores are empty. They're going to start filling up with carbs, okay. You're going to feel bigger. Now your body is going to have a more volume-wise muscle cell which is going to put it in a really out of bulk, you know, state. Now the muscle cells want to grab protein and store them as muscle tissue essentially because it's scared because you've been restricting it for so long. That's the phenomenon. That's the anabolic phenomenon or the anabolic rebound phenomenon you get. It has nothing to do with the drugs you're taking. That's why a lot of people say, oh, I got to do a massive cycle after my show for six weeks to get the rebound. You don't need to. You have so many drugs in your system already if you're taking out of all it's that you have enough there to grow. It's the food. It's the targeting of the food because a lot of people after a show they eat a lot of junk but they don't really have a regimented eating and they actually wind up night eating enough protein. They're eating too many carbs in fact. They get bloated. They get they don't feel good and then they never really achieve anything. You have to have a single, your mind has got to be focused. Okay, shows over. I took my break. I took a few days off after the show. I'm ready to go back to the gym now. I'm going to build some muscle. I'm going to eat red you meant it. It doesn't have to be super crazy clean but you can eat more food but you got to get those six meals, seven meals in a day. You post workout shake and if you do this religiously for four to six weeks after your show, you will put on muscle. Your body wants to build muscle after that. It wants to store. It just wants to store. It also wants to store fat but that's why you're not going to overdue the food because you don't want to get fat just because you're, you know, but ironically enough that the push your body is going to build so much muscle after the show is over, after the diets over. A lot of that storage that would normally happen in a typical off-season scenario is not going to happen here because your body is using all that fat that you're eating and the stored fat as a fuel source to fuel the muscle building process. So you've got the perfect environment to grow. It's not about, it's a lot of people think it's about the drugs. It's not. And when you withdraw the drugs and you start doing PCT right after a show, it's actually good because your body is cleaner and when you're cleaner and you're not eating and when you're not taking a lot of anabolic, your body has a better appetite. So the key is getting enough food in training, stimulate, not muscle. You don't want to do a lot of sets. You don't want to do a lot of, you know, different crazy exercises stick to your basics and I promise you you'll put muscle on after your show even in the absence of taking drugs. Let's go to lag and no excuse. He wants to know what's far as dumbbell pullovers. If you can maybe want to demonstrate this by gesture, can hit the chest more than hitting the lats. You know, I probably if this was two years or I wouldn't be able to demonstrate anything like I'm going to reach out in my head but I can reach out my head now and I could show this. You know, Dorian was a big pullover guy and Dorian's fault for Dorian did them for lats and he felt if you sit in the machine, the old Dorian was pullover machine. You sat in a machine like this and there was like a pad here and a pad here with a bar you grab and you went back behind you and you pulled the bar down driving from your elbows which is really basically driving from your lats and he felt it had built more of the the lats that kind of sticks out from the front when you do that front lats spread. So he liked those pullovers. Now the other pullovers we kind of laying back on a bench and with the dumbbell over the bench and you kind of bringing it over here. I always felt that work more packed and almost like the serratus anterior muscles here that kind of connect the pack to the abdominal muscle sure. I never really felt it as a full blown chest exercise. It was always either like you said in the normal machine as a lat type of movement or the dumbbell pullover more as a serratus, you know anterior muscle here. These muscles right here. It definitely adds detail to your chest area because these serratus connect right into the pecs and it definitely can help your lats flare a little bit more if it's used properly. I think people do too many sets sometimes they do too much weight and they don't really feel it in the muscles they're supposed to feel it in. It's not a fine actually it's not really a fine exercise alone comfortable especially with the dumbbell but you got don't go too heavy that's the key just because dorn and used a 150 pound dumbbell doesn't mean you have to use a dumbbell that you can control and squeeze you know that muscular chair in the pack and and serratus area when you're on a bench if you're trying to do it for lats and you get on it on the pullover machine you don't want to be cheating on that either pushing from your hands make sure you're driving through your elbows. It's good to blow off me day a train legs till they're dead but I ended up being sore for four to five days after and the pain is unbearable any tip to reduce soreness. It's almost something you just started doing legs I never really got sore even on the worst most brutal leg workout I ever did and I did some brutal leg workouts. I never was sore for four days except when I very first started when you first started the first leg workout I ever did I remember I was in the gym in the gym in Pennsylvania and I decided I was going to do squats and I started with the 10 pounds on each of the bar and I'm squatting that's easy 25 and I had never squatting before and I got up to and someone said don't go heavy the 25 so you first leg workout I'm like I got strong legs I put the 45s on 135 and I do like that six or seven reps that was a little wobbly you know because I had never done it before and I'm telling you the next day I could not sit on a toilet bowl I was in so much pain that I didn't do legs again for two months after that I saw never do legs again I can't I can't deal with that I didn't see it was that crippling I couldn't believe it because the weight didn't feel that heavy to me but I had never done it and so two months later I decided I was going to do legs again and it did this time and only I was only sore for like a day or two and then the next time I did that was sore for a day so if you're sore for four days and you're not a beginner something's a little wrong you're you're absolutely overdue you're probably doing too much volume and too much weight but if you do enough if you do the weight and you're using full range of motion which it sounds like you're getting a real workout there's no reason to do 25 30 sets you're doing too much you should not have that delayed muscle soreness for that many days that is a absolute side that you're over training your legs. interesting one here from AJ 49 Dave your thoughts on fine grams of loose scene of postwork out before any protein consumption in order to increase proteins synthesis the studies look very promising. I mean loose scene we know turns on m tour which is basically that it flips the switch in the muscle cell it says to the muscle cell alright start engaging and protein synthesis now you need to feed in the amino acids you know from protein consumption to actually start building repairing the muscles. They found you know doing these studies that yes loose scene is the main contributor to turning on this switch however they also found that loose scene in association with the other amino acids in other words like a way protein okay isolate that would have because scrupal way protein isolate has like a lot of loose scene and it has 11,000 milligrams of branching amino acids so this this probably 6,000 milligrams of loose scene in there and they find that the loose in content in association with the other amino acids in a whole food source the animal food source is a better or more potent stimulus I think of and then from what I read of m tour than just taking pure loose scene would be. Now if you're a vegan and you don't take animal source to a protein which all the plant sources are very very low in branch chains you might want to add a you know like a product like my amino evolve is a fermented amino acid product so a lot of vegans can use it you might do a scoop of that postwork out then go home and eat your vegan meal that's fine but for people who eat you know animal source or protein I still say way isolate is the gold standard postwork out. Hardly brochacho does bulking really matter if you're not on antibiotics or seeing that almost all natural dudes including myself that both just get fat and the loose the way and look the same when they were cutting time at their time again and again with insignificant improve. So if you're bulking and you're just getting fat and you're not putting on muscles and that there's a problem there. I work with a couple of people and I have two clients right now very very loyal clients there they're they're really dedicated to body going it it I like working with them because they're so passionate about what they do but they're not making the games that they should be making they're taking they're taking some kind of lot of drugs they're taking drugs they're eating the food they're taking the right nutritional supplements but yet they're not growing properly and and you know I have to say to my summary well what can possibly be wrong here because you gotta be sure all I can't see here. The read the food that doing you know they're going to the gym that the only thing that I don't have control over okay it would be being in the gym with these guys especially if they don't live in this country right so I'm like send me videos training videos of you doing your squat workouts your your incline bench workouts your shoulder press all the main movements I want to see how they execute and and with both of these guys I noticed when they showed me the videos they were not doing full range of motion they were doing very short range of motion because they were trying to live too much way they weren't engaging the muscles they were supposed to engage like a lot of times people get on that bench and they start rolling their shoulders forward so they can't get the weight up and they cheat and that's working front the altcy you're not using your pecs because they're not keeping the pecs up you know and back okay if you can't lift the weight the right way then don't it's too much weight you got to light in the weight up so a lot of people just I think they're not training properly and that's why a lot of people not getting the results that they want and that's one of the reasons why when people both they think are I'm just gonna eat a ton of food take a ton of drugs and I'm gonna get big no you're not if you're gaining a lot of weight and you're not training properly you're just gaining fat okay if you're training properly however and you eat enough protein okay and you don't want to overeat the carbs just to be the sake of putting weight scale on you know putting weight on the scale but if you're eating enough calories in terms of an up protein enough fat and some carbs to fuel your workouts and you're training right and you're doing the supplements in and the gear you have to grow okay so it's a lot of times it's a training phenomenon now so I don't like when people say to me I got a bulk up I got a gain 50 pounds so you don't want to gain 50 pounds you have to gain muscle so if the 50 pounds is a terrible 50 pounds that's not good if the 50 pounds is mostly muscle and some water retention and a little bit of fat that's fine okay so yeah when I coach people and we start off on a certain offseason plan that might be very comparable to what other people doing I have to change it depending on how the person's progressing if a person is just getting fat then I'm gonna cut back their carbs and and put them raise their cardio a little bit and then I have to say to myself why are they gaining muscle and then I got to look at their training what they're doing so a lot of times also some guys a lot of people out there using fake drugs that's why I recommend to everyone highly recommend because I see I see these tests come in all the time to get the Roy test kits that I sell from Bill of Wellen on my daypalumma.com website and test your gear trust me everyone who goes on my on my site to buy a kit if they come back with something that doesn't seem kosher it's not meshing with what they said to me to an email and they say what do you think of this color reaction and a lot of times the stuff is either nothing or it's test propinate when it should be you know pre-mobile or it's test propinate when it should be a test an athate or it's test propinate when it should be trend alone there's a lot of fake stuff a lot of worlds come back as dianibule rather than an anovar or windshield you have to test the drugs out there a lot of the GHS fake test them it doesn't keep believe me you'll have a your mind will be put at rest because if you're not growing because you're on fake drugs you're wasting your time essentially so these are just some of the pitfalls that I find that people have to answer the question you don't need to get fat to get more muscular it's not a live show where we just got a question of the species in bots from Chris Tyson can you take test a lies well on TRT? Absolutely and a matter of fact it works very well well on TRT because you're taking like let's say you're taking 200 milligrams of testosterone week you know you don't want that converting to DHD but at the same time you don't want to annihilate your DHD production because then you you need to lose your sex drive and you can be sensitized your ability to grow so I always tell people test the lies is good because it kind of just blunts the HC production likewise if you're producing if you are an aromatizer okay TRT doesn't necessarily warrant you taking a RIMITX because it's kind of like there's not a lot there that's to aromatize but in some people they aromatize and the estrogen then shuts down their body even more and sometimes they lose their sex drive so by flushing the extra estrogen out of the body the a test lies people seem to have a better TRT experience on a test lies than on nothing else now if you happen to be someone who's super aromatizer then you might need a little bit of aromatics you know uh wall on TRT it really depends on your blood work and and how you buy your response uh let's see if we can blaze through these last three uh okay pun day can you please speak about lymphoma I have these hard painless lumps in my tons of layer behind the neck even in the groin area not sure what it is well you know lymphoma is is that's a pretty extreme diagnosis that's like saying you have a pimple on your body and you think you have a melanoma okay so i would if you're if you're you're worried about it i would go get a check out more than likely you might have a viral infection in your body and your body's lymph nodes are cleaning it up and so they're swollen um but i would you know if it's something that's there chronically for months and months and months i would absolutely go get tested because it could be something serious it's probably unlikely that it is but it could be something serious let's go to v rod i need to take a blood test soon for my test levels i mean you need to be around 800 total how many weeks would you say it takes from around a total to sawstron 2000 lower my levels to 800 if i completely stop injections usually up to three weeks your levels will go down considerably because that's the these long acting testosterone that's there let that's their life span essentially three weeks and four four weeks you can get yourself really love if you want but if you're on hormone replace them with a clinic and you go in and your levels come up at 80 when they when before on HRT they were at like 500 they're going to know something suspicious now something is clinics might not care but you know you might want to just drop down your you might want to go off for two weeks and then go back on your HRT like at 100 milligrams per week and just leave it there and then go get tested you know at the fourth week mark and the level should come back in the range that they were normally at when you were only on HRT that would probably be my recommendation last one here from the same as sure does more strength build muscle or more muscle build strength it goes both ways really although i've seen skinny guys have a lot of strength i've seen guys in the gym who are 180 pounds bench press you know 450 and i'm like how the heck are they doing that i could i could barely do that when i was 320 you know so you know getting stronger doesn't mean you're getting bigger because it's just because you're strong and you have good tendon connections and good natural genetic strength doesn't mean you're going to get bigger because if you're an eating enough food if you're not doing full range of motion you know that's not going to you're not going to improve your muscle size however what i found was when i first started i wasn't super strong i was strong above average but i wasn't like some of these prodigies are but as i got bigger and as i built high quality muscle using full range of motion and really using correct exercise form my strength went up through the roof so i started as a guy who wasn't that strong and when i got to my biggest i was super strong i was in planning 405 for you know 68 reps i was told to press him behind the neck 315 for rep for 68 reps i was you know squatting 700 pounds for 3 or 4 reps so i i i got super strong because i got so big and i had functional muscle that that was using full range of motion so i would say that muscle size usually is what leads to strength but in some cases some people just happen to be genetically very strong even at a lower bodyweight that's going to do for this episode of as they remind her right now on the channel they plumbos preview of this weekend's exciting exciting chicago pro for talashore and day plumbo i'm sad if you're new to the next time

I mean, I was getting pharmacy drugs when I was competing in the 90s and for me, a thousand milligrams of testosterone worked really well with like, literally we were using three to 400 milligrams of acropoise a week or four to 500 milligrams of dechiro week, 76 milligrams of trend balloon, which was called parable in back then two or three times a week. And we were building lots of muscle. I was using three to four I used maximum of GH per week, but it was all pharmacy, you know, great stuff. And it worked. And I think a lot of the problems today is that there's two problems. One problem is that people think they need a ridiculous amount of drugs to be huge. The other problem is that the drugs are not dose properly or they're not the actual drugs that people think they're taking. And that's why the the Roy test kits we saw, I sell on my daypalumbo.com website sell so well because people are always testing their products. And unfortunately, a lot of the stuff out there is either nothing or it's cheaper ingredients. In other words, people think they're using trend balloon or they think they're using dacchar and they're actually using test propane. They think they're using anavar that's using dianimal. It's a huge podge of mixed mishmosh out there. And but if you can get pharmacy great stuff and you know your gear is good, you don't need quite as much as people think.

Welcome back guys to another edition of After Hour. I'm Dave Alumbo with a skeleton crew here. They'll be joining in shortly though. I got Jimmy to bowl drive and truck, dump some soil, get Mr. G, at the Mr. Pots protein warehouse, bacon cookies, and John Ramile will be joining us shortly. I don't know. Greg Valentino is missing an action. It's really my fault because we're filming an hour early today because my kids are off from school because this supposedly you don't have to have these crazy hurricane. This is what's going to be a hurricane. Now it's downgraded to a tropical storm. It'll probably be some heavy rain but they cancel school so I got to do this early. What's up guys? What's up Dave School? When I have someone, is it some of the school or is it just because, well, because of COVID, my son's doing DPK which is before kindergarten over the summer as like a summer session and then my daughter goes to the daycare they are where they are the same place and then my other daughter is usually in the office and she's going to start in August. But if I have three kids at one time in the office with my wife and I who was processing on the species orders, we had a huge sale this past weekend with like 1,000 orders. We want to blow our brains out so you know. Imagine you have three kids running around, you're where else they're while you're trying to bake cookies. By suddenly climbing in the oven, my daughter would be mixing up stuff, you'd go crazy. Look at you see you're going to a giant any from a pop operation. That's what it's like kids. The kids eat it. Oh, Bob. Oh, there he is. Jimmy. Jimmy, where are you? Is that the big green? I'm in the water. I'm in the water. You can't fucking jump. I take the trout to the plane. Yeah, I was just saying here. The Guadi Airports is a nightmare. Now, I know they've been redoing it. Jimmy, is it still under construction? Oh, are you kidding me? They're going to have to fucking extend years. They're going to have to structure up here. You know, it's funny. About five years ago, they re-did Guadi Airport. It was really nice they made it. And then they decide, you know what, we want to make a new airport terminal. So we're going to build it in the parking lot of the other one. So there's no parking. And they tried driving the trailer. They've stood as fun to find it. It's nuts. And it's right off the Grand Central Parkway. You can see that park. There's no room to do anything. So all you have is massive construction and blockages and the versions and detours. And I don't even know how you can drive that. The stress level is insane there. I'm driving the trail. We think I'm losing weight. I'm sweating. I asked. Before I had to take a shit out of here. It was the port of body over there. And it's a fucking hundred degrees out. I had to pull up. I was stuck in my ass. Come on out in a fucking port of John. I couldn't even breathe in that motherfucker. Yeah. All of blue water was splashing up my ass. It would be that I got into the fucking house. Fucking horrible. Fucking horrible. Yeah, yeah, I love the angle too. It's funny. Look at all the cars you see. Now guys, this is during the middle of the day with this. Everyone's at work. Can now take the cars that you see on that parkway and multiply that times like a hundred. That's rush hour. That's like people start getting out of work at like 3.34 o'clock to like 6 o'clock. It doesn't move because this is no way for anyone to go. God forbid you have to come pick someone up at the airport at that time. You might as well just not come. You know, it's not worth it. Rush out. Rush out. I want to clock. I want to clock and start now. Oh, yeah, you're feeling for good about it. Oh, no, I got to open it. I got to open it. Well, you know, and maybe it's not as bad now because everyone works from home now. No one wants to work in an office anymore, right? Oh, it's bad, bro. Bad. Really bad. So now what are you doing? Are you dumping dirt? I'm just being over there. Yeah, I'm going to demonstrate what I do now. I've got to have photos. Feel it while I'm doing it. So now let me just get this thing. Well, you guys, you guys get to see fresh hair and what I do over here. When I fucking I shit my pants every time I dump this fucking thing. Now give me a. You need to sell the truck, take the dirt from where we're going to pick the dirt up from. I'm going to show you right now. So here's the body of right. Right. That's a little brand new time. It'll all be this. Yeah. Here's the dirt we've been dumped in. Yeah, it's going to. Where are you getting the dirt from though, Jimmy? Oh, we're getting it on base shore. It's all right. You got it dry. You got to drive two hours to base or to pick up one dumb truck worth of dirt. Yeah, dumped trailer. So find some place as to get it. Why can't they drive that into this special? This is, I'm doing a TV show, bro. My buddy, Birder, mama. He makes sure that I don't fucking kill myself when I'm. You've got to hold this thing when I dump it. I want you to go to film. That's special dirt over there. It's got commoner in it. Pigeon shit. And what else is in it, bro? Don't shit, what else is that? Yeah, don't. Pigeon shit fucking, you count this. And it mix it all in in nice and nice. Sometimes I think a shit in it too. So that's all mixed in in nice. And then I use it for planting. Well, over like what? He's saying, we're doing all the planting. Oh, I thought he was for like landfill. Oh, this is for actually like planting. Oh, no. This is for the plant. That's why we got a shit. He's gonna get all the fermentation in there. Like junk those, he's a cook. So we got to get all that in here. And just wait and cheese for a nice and nice. And I'm saying that's funny. So actually, I wonder when a load of dirt costs you think to bring in from Bay Short to look water airport. I'm thinking to 35 yards. That is probably like three, you know, probably three to 500 hours alone. Oh, that sounds so bad, I guess. I've got to open up the gate. You're going to hold your lead. You're beautifying queens. Making a LaGuardia look like it might actually. Oh, yeah. Well, look, we got some cheese over here. Look. I like it. See that nice to cheese out of the barrels. You know, you know, I'm in the bottom of it. I think when they finally finish this terminal, it'll actually pretty nice. See it's power up there. See the tower up there, Dave. Yeah. There watch everything I do. Yeah, bird. Hold that. Yeah, they have much to bullshit. What time I got out of the fucking truck with a, what, what, what, what, what, my hat? And I got a focal to the form. They told me to fuck it. I'm gonna have my hat on. Really? You believe this shit? Wow. Yeah. No, pretty good, Jimmy. No breakdown. All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Look at that. Look at that nice, nice, smells even good. Tilt the net. Who's responsible for? Who's responsible for planting all these plants? Did they have like a landscaping company? Oh, yeah, big company. Yep. That's where I'm working for right now. Yeah. That's awesome. Bird. Bird. That's a very long truck, Jimmy. Oh, yes. To trail of prouders, they know joke. This is part of the fuckers got some weight behind it. The hat, he's got that old fuel. Oh, you're gonna want a bird that's gonna throw me. You're gonna see birds here and how I'm gonna, baby possibly kill myself. How many yards, Jimmy? Is that 20 yards? Yeah, 35 yards. 30 yards, 30. 20? I just get 35 yards, George. 35. Yeah, yeah. Now, if anybody's full out of that back in that truck, Jimmy will cut that part out, all right? Yeah, anything else helps out in the back, please cut it out. Let's go to the Hoosen there. You know, Jimmy often can be in there for all of you though. Oh, he's probably one of these to my pillars. I heard he's in the barren zone. I don't know, one of the pillars in the barren zone. Oh, yeah. Just got some, you know, who knows? Grabbing away the guys. Yeah. I looked at him. I said, oh, can you see me? We're watching, yeah, we're watching. Yeah. Oh, okay. All right, good. Yeah, good. I'm very impressed that your Bluetooth headphones work so well. Oh, yes, but shit man, I paid $135 for this. I was gonna say you know, the radio that Mr. G does and he's sitting right next to his phone. If anybody wants to go to headset, it's called the Blue Park. It's, it goes on one of the epic, but that's what's legal. You can't have two ears closed. I don't want your driving to 12. Yeah, they did the right. I was going to say they should hire you to advertise there their product. It's, uh, you're on the right. I got a black off a little bit. See what happens. Funny how his signal is. The guy's in a Mr. G signal. The guy's in flux with that. Yeah. He's in a car. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. So now the whole, the whole truck is on. Okay. All right, baby, here we go. Should I hold back in that truck? See it'll lift up, huh? And dump that? 60 foot in the air. It's motherfucking goes with a full load of dirt. Wow. Crazy. How heavy is that truck with the dirt? Oh, it's about a million. About a million. Maybe it'll like a hundred, twenty thousand in the back. Wow. And that's a truck weighs about $35,000. I guess you know, so yeah, we got some weight here. I could say imagine. Got some weight. Imagine running into something with that truck. If you just go right over it, you know. Up there it goes. You guys get the visual. Yeah. Our cameraman is not focusing on the dirt though. You've got to move over to camera a little bit. Tell him. Oh, look at the trailer. Yeah, we can speak through a bit of English every time. I got to, I got to, hey, Jimmy, there's not a little maybe a stand on it. Oh, I want to see the dirt. You know, there's the stuff that can do it. I want to explain. So what happens is the dirt. Of course, I got an aluminum trailer. The piece of shit. The dirt, the dirt sticks in the fucking smell. I got to get it all the way. Fuck it up. I got to make the sight of the cross in the movie. That the fucking thing don't get fall. You know, some folks are having a fight in the fucking town. There's a blow. There's a blow. Okay, you know, Shane, let's fight. Fuck the dangerous man. Now, what happens when you get to move the truck up a little bit? Because I didn't look at it. Yeah, I saw the dangerous thing now. You got to move the truck up. That's another dangerous thing because if the bro goes out of level, when you got to load up the shit, come by, Charlie. It's over. You know, like that fucking commercial son got Charlie. Some kids play on the back. It's Charlie. Yeah. That's what the fuck that happened. I would love to see you surfing on that. That soil as it's coming down. Right? Wouldn't that be cool? Like with a little surfboard. Yeah, yeah. I could definitely. I did that when they. I mean, Sandy. Sandy. I mean, Sandy came. They had like two stories of sand. Wow. Long Beach. Like up to two blocks. I got washed up. Let me ask you this question, Jimmy. Have any get the dirt in the truck? That's a better question. Oh, pay a load. He's there. He's yellow. I got to run this. I got to run this. Follow the fucking reverse. Get the last to the dirt out. I see. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I got the fucking. I'm pretty. How do you know if the dirt's actually out of the back of the truck or not? I mean, I can tell you. I got my spot back there, bro. This still some stuff in there. Just in case you need me. I know. I know. I get as questions in a lower than beds of business. You're actually your spotters today. So we can be in spot. Well, I got one spot. I'm having the birth of. You got two spot. You got the whole audience here. But I think. Oh, yeah. A little bit of dirt in there. Yeah. I can't get it out. Bro, it's impossible. Yeah. I give the majority of load. I'm saying. Yeah. Oh, fuck. You can go sell whatever's left to like some little low lady to plant the tomato. Garden or something like that. Thank you, brother. He's your paperwork, brother. I don't care what you think you can burn it on. I don't care what you do with that. Next week. Well, let me see what's in the bag. I don't know if it's fine. Yeah, yeah, for filming. Yeah. It's a little bit of dirt. Not too bad. No. You see that fucking gay thing holding the middle of the trail. Yeah. I did that with the yesterday band. I just don't fucking. So you went in there with the yesterday lady. We're digging out the truth. Oh, and he hurt. He hooked the floor and ripped the floor up. So I got a fucking hole in the floor now. You have a, you have a damaged truck as usual. Let me just shut this door. Bro, just just just cast me shut the gig. All right. Thank you. Or show them how I got to pick my fucking balls from fucking living. I don't know if anyone else. But it seems amusing to me. I'm the muse by what you're doing. So. I get it. Everybody a little look. I want to get the first dead. I got to move the fucking dead. I'll be like this. How many guys are going to wait for something to sit to happen to you? So that you can do bitch. You can play to that and I think that's really what it is. That's really what it is. I got a fucking day like that. Nobody else escaped. Just open up on the bottom. Like a normal person. I got a fucking bottle. I got to break my fucking balls. Everything I do. I'm impressed that you know how to do all this. Did you did someone teach you how to do this? So you just figured it out. Who's that thing? I said, did you have to go to schooling for this or I mean, how do you know how to do all this? I tell you, years ago. I got the license, right? That's it, right? I'm not my brother. I see tomorrow, right? All right, but you didn't want to get it right tomorrow or something. Let me look, check Daniels. You actually come back again tomorrow. Yeah, every week. So you just do what you would do. You run one load per day. Two. So you're going to come back again today. Oh, that's it. You just take it right here. Who's that? Yeah, I think I wouldn't have sworn it down. Well, you did want to come over there. Okay, all right. Look at that. Look at that. I got this view. The worst part of the whole job is driving to LaGuardia. Oh, yeah. Getting it out of here. It's a son of a bitch, man. Let me tell you. Then what would you make for driving this truck, you know, back and forth twice for the day? What did they pay you to drive this truck back and forth for the day? Well, it's union. So you got to buck on the books. Get about four. One hundred a day. Some shit like that. That's good. That's a lot. Yeah. Well, they got to be paying more than 300 load. And he's getting 400 bucks. But that would be okay. Yeah, that's about 400 a day. Maybe a little more actually. Well, if you're getting 400 in the load cost 350, and that's 700 hundred for too long. Oh, that's that. That's what I get paid. That's not what he gets paid. That's what he's paid. That's what he's paid. What is he charging for? What is he charging for? For those loads of dirt. The truck. Well, with the dirt in the truck, it's over $1,000. Yeah. Well, that makes sense. That makes sense. That's a good deal. Yeah. It's a pretty good deal. I got to get on this fucking gray stuff to buck for you over here. That's another fucking thing. Now, if you were in Florida running these these, I got to fuck the Mario and tell you over here. Go on this motherfucker. Nobody's done his bitch. Now, Jimmy, this is what maybe you should do. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. I paid. I think we've paid like $200. I think a truck load for some dirt to fill my house that. In Florida when they built houses, they got to, they got to have dirt delivered to build them up higher. So the water runs off. If you had a little truck, you got a little business going. You probably make a lot of money down here in Florida. They're building left and right. You know how to do it. Yeah, you gotta get the, yeah, you gotta get the thumb trellas. Those are the thumb trellas. Make the most money, you know? Yeah. You have to realize it. I paid, you know what I mean? I mean, I think it was $250 per load. Think about how much money I paid. I mean, that's one person, one property. You know, so you can make some good cash if you did that down here, you know? Oh, yeah, definitely, right? I like the sound like the thing is, you know, like, keep it over here in New York. There's a lot of money. I mean, I like the sound like the thing is, you know, like, keep it over here in New York. There's a lot of people who can't get the A license for the fucking drug addicts. Right. It's not really hard to get an A license. You know, you're driving in Florida. You know, there's no little Guardie airport here. The driving is so easy. You'd be like, this is a breeze, you know? It would you would enjoy it, actually. Okay, here's the pocket. Look. Yeah. That's the grand social right there. Yeah. No. It's quiet. It's quiet right now. No, that's not. It's funny. You're in the clear. No, no, no, no, come in up on the story of Boulevard. You guys take the law and express. Get out, probably. Get out. Get out. Look, what are you? You got to take the express. Oh, you, okay. And New York, you can't take the parkway with the truck. You got to get on the expressway. Oh, no. No. Well, the cleav you, you can. The cleav you, the expressway. But no, you can't take, yeah. You can't take no parkways. They're going to take the back road. The story of Boulevard. Didn't wash street. Oh, these fucking bad 94, it's free 82nd, every, and all these fucking, and this, this tight hurt. How do you do that? You just know where you going? I think we're welcome. All right, let me, let me go to Georgia anyway. Georgia, I want to talk about the last week you called off the Big Liney fight. You said you didn't want to hurt him. And I knew this was going to be a, I knew this was going to be a bad idea for you to do. I knew they were going to come back and Lenny came back with it with a vengeance. with the vengeance with a video and message to you. Let's play this video clip. George, are you there right? Yeah, okay, all right. I can't play the big-line clip, hold on. I'm going to kick you my legs, feel up. You know, it was a total of 10 seconds. Big-line, he's back in training now. He's planted the fight. You, he says, you know, he's calling you a complete moron again and he's, he's trying to, you know, boss, fire up the rivalry. The moron stuff, that doesn't bother his butt. He's the same. My prox have arse thinking of, yeah. That's trying to irritate you now, that's all. With that told with it, but you know, that's, that's over the whole thing. Everyone knows it's but everyone knows it's bullshit, but you know what? I just want to say, he's obviously trying to antagonize you, which is obviously he wants to fight you. I mean, since you're going to go, there's no more mercy, right? I mean, it's a copercut. No mercy. So what happened is Rob said, I said, Rob, Rob Zillard. I spoke, I spoke, I spoke, the Rick, Rick, and with all the fighters, we were speaking, you know, because Rick fights, guy can't, guys not training, guy can't even take it, kick, he harms bad. Just one kick. You don't know that. He obviously feels that you're being, you know, that you're, maybe you're trying to, you're trying to get out of the fight. Then we, well, because they weren't posting, then I decided we'll do a box of match. So this way, can't really get hurt. And then then when I said that Rob said he had pneumonia. Well, people get pneumonia. I mean, people get sick. Well, I told you, Lenny was going to get sick. He's not going to be down for the hope for three months. He got three months of this fight. Yeah. But if he has the moly, he's not going to, the moly is to sit. I mean, yeah, well, he's out of the, he's already done. I mean, he took his antibiotics and he's to feel good. So I mean, he's back in training. Yeah, well, please. Now, that now it's, it's back on. So the fights back on officially. Yeah, now they're, they're like, two fucking assholes. They, they haven't created anything to hope fucking life. And they try to destroy somebody's a business. This is exactly like they fight against the rise on the school. You see, I agree you are right now. I think that's the, I think the idea was to get you angry. It's because he's like they did that. I'm not, it's, they're cowards. What they did is cowardly. You know, we told them how to promote the fight to very beginning to do stuff. And he never did. And then once, once, once I said, you got it, then he started doing things. Yeah, but I think there, from what I watched in their video, I think they feel like, well, it's three months away. You know, what, we're going to promote it. But it's not, it's still a long way off. So, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll mention it here and there, but we're not going to go crazy on promoting to get closer, because then people kind of lose interest. They asked me, Rob was always concerned about letting it get, they wanted the quarry of the, oh really. I think it would be better for this quarry. Perfect, personally, but you want to, I'm a book, I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not, it's not WWE. I didn't do it. This is, it's not what the, why I did in the beginning. Right. The very first thing was to got this, I lost it up. Number one reason. Yeah. You got these, these pumps online that that's saying shit about people's businesses to try to get, you know, rolling their companies. Right. And you got to stand up to them. No, that's the bottom line. So the fight's on and you, I, you, I, you, of the mindset now, I don't know what the parts of the whole line. Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, it knows your strategies. Is it, is it a no mercy strategy? You're going to take them out as quick as possible as that is that your, your fight strategy. That's what they're like, but they don't want, they don't want once, once explosive and entertaining, right, not stop, you know, either either either the old five, five minute rounds of like non stop action back, book or you come out and I annihilate the person. Yes. You're going to try to annihilate them. I'm annihilate them. Okay. You're trying to take you away everything I worked my whole life for. I'm going to, I want to annihilate them. Now, when I was looking at that, at that, him punching that bag, it looked like he was almost like hitting it with like the, like he wasn't really hitting it, right? I don't know. He was like, it looked like he was doing this. No one, he can't hold his hands up to protect his face because his shoulders were can't go up like this when they met me in person. They didn't realize how strong I was and how big I was because I'm in the, I'm in the most shittiest sliding you can imagine. A little puppet when they saw me in person and it is, it's just like you're just all too. People will realize you're over six foot, you know, so you're impressive. It's like Chuck's you know and Charlie Alarm's, you know, you didn't see him in person, you beat them in person. Yeah. And you know, you're with a real world. Well, I got new to you. You're no Chuck's you know Charlie Alarm's, but you're definitely dangerous though. Those guys did, let's put that for Joe, I wanted to just analyze Lenny's punching skills and there are black I'm skills, maybe. Let's see, let's watch this again. Yeah, hold on. Yeah, I don't know what this any, any, any power behind those punches, but you don't a lot of weight behind himself. Yeah, everyone is first of all I spun, everyone in his punches I would knock down. Right, are you knocking right down? Yeah. It's a joke. You know I'm telling you right now, with over 300 pounds, you know, behind him, so there is some power behind that. I gotta play devil's advocate here otherwise I'm gonna win the game I've put in day once a last I fight every day right I get my I get my teeth knocked in I get my arms pulled out I get punched kicked yo people laying on top of me that have skill that have been finding the whole life let's let's look at this from a person let's let's let's assume let me let me let me give you a scenario obviously when he's got a little bit of power behind him we know he's got bad shoulder's never like that but he's got some power he's got some size mine let's say he he clocks you would it would it would have punched like a lucky punch okay can you take a punch you think from Lenny are you have you built up that kind of resistance yeah I can smash all the time I'm like a first of all I fight like I fight like Rocky I take my shot in other words yeah I go right yeah I'm dead yeah you're not gonna I already have it well he doesn't know this look if you asked them alright to tell a truth when he tried to push me and I stood there I could have pushed him right the fuck over really yeah no skill you can't go in and in a fight fight without any skill whatsoever especially in an MMA fight you can't even punch the big one in 10 seconds well yeah I was I I think that uh he's serious though about fighting you I don't I don't think he's like just playing along you know I think he really wants to get in the ring I don't know what's gonna happen but you know I I I'm gonna have I'm gonna choke them out on barm kick his legs out I'm gonna destroy him he I I don't can't what you do okay stand your feet can you do it from your feet boxing I'd like to it's more exciting when someone gets knocked out like what a punch you know he's going like this yeah he's swinging like this down he like yeah I don't want to see an arm bar and he's like that's boring I was just step by step this ball as he's doing it yeah I do it I do it I do it ankle kick right there's like that's boring now once he's on this back he's like a turtle he's not gonna be able to turn over bitch they it's a come I kick his ankle and then I come with all the right down he's chin I boom can you guys can talk to better strategy I want to see a knockout punch I don't want to really no one wants to see a knock him on his back it's that's gonna be boring you know I'm not listen I get him when I get I'm gonna take him down but when I when I get him on bar I'm not gonna arm bar I'm gonna stand up and tell him to get the fuck back up when I not be able to get off that's the problem what what are you gonna do let's them off the canvas oh yeah yeah oh he lost to get up what if you any stays out they're gonna work till he gets up now you just take him out with a punch if you're gonna do it so then at least it's we can we can play it in slow motion over and over we can see his face like oh I'm training I'm I'm training I'm most of memory when someone hit when I get kicked in punch who could we get there is the fight off we got to have someone ringside in case you know someone gets hurt I don't get things but Dave my brothers and Bob that we listen first but oh no we're John I need John with your brother first of all I'm sending the whole thing up these guys aren't paying for nothing it's in the course like like 12 15 grand a set this whole fight up they're not they're not giving any money in that you're gonna want what what do you what hold on what are you spending money on here they're to pay for the place got paid for the doctor right gonna gonna get can we get a celebrity doctor like the victim press or someone like that so that you know the at least it's like you know related to our our industry yeah we could you could have you could you could have some find somebody I mean now we start promoting you know that's not the press he'd love to come to this thing problem yeah and if he had a bloody tears that he muscles or he though that he could repair them too you know because he's a North and Beat Exeter listen he's making a money he's not only that he's making a mock yeah at an MMA fighting that's what he's doing you understand so I represent what I'm going in training at one of the top MMA places training places around and I can't go in there and show any of the any other skills that show every skill that I've learned in there you know he thinks he thinks that you don't need to train the fight that you can just walk in lifting weights and just fight right that's not how it works of course not but but it's still interesting though the whole thing I I'm I'm I'm the muse by the the whole I'm glad it late I thought lady was gonna silently go away but he didn't he he came back with an engine to you so that's that's good that's that's good for sales of the ticket sales not that you're selling any tickets but how are we gonna watch this thing I want to do well I don't think you didn't pay from you I need you to do for free I need you to do it for free I'll tell you why we didn't we do it for free and get it's fast it's because we're having a million people watching so that's how you tell me more it's gonna be you'll have a hundred thousand probably who will eventually watch but what's gonna happen you don't someone there if you need people there with their phone live streaming it on their phone so your might as well do a real live stream and with good quality so people will just watch that you know who's going to live stream you're gonna we can all send Tyler there you can do it we can as long as we have a just make sure we have a wife I and the gym that's good enough so that we have to get they have to they have they do so they have two cameras now so we can bring our we can bring a computer something like that and stream it through the computer something like that yeah but this this thing is gonna get names of you know where is an area holding this thing again in in Orlando yeah I've the sports flat flex the land of it's 20 minutes so it's sweet thing it we think I think is that people from around the world have become into the Olympia yeah well do it on status between twelve and six you're crazy you're crazy no one's gonna go because yeah you're gonna people gonna be too excited about the Olympia you're gonna lose an audience I'm telling you you cannot do it at the Olympia it's the dumbest idea of all time it's between twelve and six we're gonna have a double amount look you know when we would go to the Olympia the Arnold we're running around like maniac and then when you have a little bit of downtime you got to eat and get ready to go out again for the next that it's not I was trying to jam it in down telling you you're gonna you well the guys went to the fights Jimmy Jimmy and Jimmy the bull and all those guys went to the fights that you stuck to a steep fight you know it's two people who work the body building fans and not gonna watch it because they're gonna be at the Olympia you're jamming it into a weekend that's already got too much going on and you're gonna be an afterthought I'm telling you this should be a it's own weekend because people will will watch it because it's just just just just to see what happens I don't know if they're that excited about it but they want to see what's gonna happen you know get Dave get the sponsors and because it'll have things you know I don't think anyone in their right mind with sponsors but but but I think it it'll be absolutely amusing for the top of the day and then pay review yeah I'm gonna pay to see if because someone will be there with a phone live streaming it you're not gonna be released that we will let them you're not gonna be able to police it's someone will be there or what will happen is someone will grab the live stream and they'll put it up right after the live stream's over on the computer because they'll tape it off the computer so you're not gonna it's not gonna be you're not gonna get them to the live viewers it's same thing with the Olympia they can do the same thing with the Olympia they do and they do all the time people stream it to their Instagram you know yeah I'm at the but look I'm not gonna go trouble for doing that no no at the fights at the fights they have people walking around making the people to the right you know if you live stream it someone at home will tape it it's only gonna take it it's gonna be two minutes right as soon as you're done they're gonna put it up on there on on the on their on their YouTube channel and then it's gonna get a million hits on those YouTube channels because no one's been sick that's well that's my point and why wouldn't spot the one spots right it was gonna be a residual they absolutely done either what are you there okay yeah yeah are you listening to all this I am would you explain to him why no one's gonna pay pay for you for this fight I'm gonna go to the second okay you're only gonna be able to get measurable metrics if you do a real a real view and you're not gonna get that if people are operating it so there's no way there's no way his brothers involved in a John what his brothers involved now robbing oh Bobby smells yeah yeah cuz he's like Mr. Crab's on SpongeBob he sees money this is just invented by the big of a million dollars on this fight how much if they think they gonna make a million dollars what are you paying big lady by the way for all this since he's participating in this we're giving him we're giving him 200 tickets right and then whatever whenever comes up because I'm doing it you gotta give him a percentage of the of the gate don't you think I mean he is with the talent here yeah gale gale gale gale get five or ten percent all right well you better make a better get a contract written up is you're gonna get a tickets to take a chance to take a chance to take a chance you can't you gotta give him something you got no one by a ticket no one's gonna buy tickets they're gonna watch it for free no one is buying tickets the only you can't use the Olympia as an example because the Olympia puts on a paper you with commentary right okay you got you got you got you got at you've got commentary you've got people talking about you know gonna have some videos and so if you got a whole set of comments you got you're not getting any comments who's commentating Marco Antonio Barrara you have been raised wait you know of John don't you look Marco I'll get Marco to come do the thing is the thing is this fight is gonna last 12 and a half seconds okay and I'm being generous all right so so you're only gonna get you're only gonna get excited me if it goes like the distance and it's not gonna happen be Lenny's gonna fucking die within the first 10 seconds so you don't you don't have an appointment Tyler but that's the problem George he is you don't have a real opponent this guy is John let's watch the clip again let's get let's get pumped up again hold on yeah right watch this he's not it's not it's not the way it's the fact that I can walk up there and take them a sharpie and rightly initials on his cheek right now he's wide open he's just started trading for the fight John give him a break he's a fucking coward fuck that's why he says cookie cut that's he says he doesn't want to die that's why he's stomach he's that big he's a coward that's why that's why they're trying to tear down my business and we'll fire them you think in it life him and fucking rock okay so now we're on a completely different deal I got about Mr. Jesus fired on you it worked Lenny did it with Lenny's video worked right the balls are trained that's why it's he's that's why he says cookie cut up because yeah I don't want to fucking die and go out of strict diets and sacrifice the suffer so I'm gonna say I'm not like a cookie cut it so I'm coming like a fat fuck just like the fight I don't have the train fight and then I'm got guys who train fan of me are pussy yeah we're gonna see Lenny what a pussy's like maybe playing possum John maybe he's just not Mr. G think that he's not training just right I think he's just doing his best butterbeen and Tim in person I don't care what he does I don't care what he does this is about this is like picky wood going in for the championship no it's not it's Georgie Georgie it's not it's alright this is like this is like Bruce Lee going against P. We Hermit but when he's not jerking off in an an actuated movement all right this is not a contest if you if you if you are if you had a worthy opponent this would be a different story you don't have an opponent you're going up against a piece of glass this is in my business online and then like okay then if that's what you want to accomplish then go find them walk up to him with somebody video and toss some of beating don't make this whole fight down this way better John I don't I disagree with it it's a way better whole fighting is a far I think we got to get Victor Priskin here is the doctor know that they bring side to doctor though he's already presided one over one death at the Olympia or that's not but you don't want to you don't want to put that on him I think who's now who's going to be the referee because if there is a big landing or you get in trouble you know we you guys are not young guys we got to stop this fight you can't you know we don't want any apparently Lee priest is doing everything he's working to corner he's resting he's doing it virtually though John we need to do it every please the referee from Australia we need like bojax and we erase his cause you work out you've already can't get rose we he's the man hook it we get his guess referee we need to guess referee I don't want like a regular guy who can we get John oh yeah I'm Charlie arms yeah I'm about maybe Ricky maybe get Ricky Ricky there's a good Ricky would be perfect definitely come on the right height too Ricky and you Ricky fit yeah yeah Ricky Ricky said he's wrong we did want you 22 miles on his right you mean it but actually Jimmy to bull yeah but Jimmy does Jimmy does another rules though I think that I think Ricky fights Ricky fights the man I'm Ricky fights Jimmy work you're Jimmy work you're cornered in yeah no Jimmy why don't you guys to be there so everyone to come meet you will come meet the laptop yeah hang out the sponsors come there and have their stuff so what's what Bobby Small's gotten what's his his business model behind this whole thing what's going on I want some trash hey Greg you guys game it up till you you guys started really early I didn't know because yeah my kids are here we have a tropical storm they cancel school so I got to get you if I would know tonight I was you don't look at my know it's not even raining yet right Dave's no yeah I know it's been raining but it's not it's nothing that it's gonna be like a typical Florida that play you know it's like a 90 clip oh I want Mr. Greg to see the big one he clip I don't know if he's sort play the big one he clip we got to watch this again again it's I love it I can watch it I watch it all day long I love it I hope he makes another one I mean don't what are those those are punches I'm trying to figure out what's happening he's actually got to be sent hands to you even though he's not really does any terrible day I'm telling you I kind of wanted to say that fast now hey he's only moving to this far yeah that right doing this definitely like he's playing rock and sock and roll by exactly what the hell is he doing he's like I kind of wanted those reducing machine he's really gonna go through this yeah he's he's called out Mr. G again called again complete more on are you serious yeah if not if but Greg it's not that he's they said my my my prox I got them sick and I have my prox I have arstic in them and that's what that's what that's what has to stop why would you waste money on arstic yeah they do have steroids and I'm sending you guys want to check it out so now you're pissed and now even if he puts his hands up like this it's gonna be like the little rascals you know what I mean it to fuck and put the hands up you'd be having like even from the curtains you'd be punching him and shit he's making a mock we had a fighting on you on YouTube like like fighters don't have to like you don't have to train to fight and that's and every fight you know that's it that's his little lanye stick you know to kind of get you guys all fired up a little bit you can not train you if I'm lady I don't want to get you fired up I would you know nobody could fight a train fighter somebody who train I don't care even a best street fighter bad ass dude let me taste them they can't last a 22nd fight seems like an hour when you're in a fight I said before you got on this fight is not lasting 12 and a half seconds so so it's it but my point was to all of this hype about paper view and where are you gonna watch it if you sneeze you're gonna miss this fight yeah so you might you might actually break Jorge Masspedal you might break his fucking record yes I think it's three seconds right we need like multiple cameras instead of we we can analyze the the knockout or whatever happened yeah because we're gonna we're gonna endlessly analyze four seconds of footing I want to see you know punch to the face I want to see like face exploding I hope I yeah we got to film it with a high speed camera so it's really not dangerous to lanye because I don't think he's got a last long enough to really get hurt do you know because Jorge's gonna hit him yeah if Jorge hits him okay would have fist anywhere in his face disguised done unless lanye could take a punch we don't know you bones break George he's strong his fuck there's no way there's no way there's no way lanye is gonna survive what was that every test you cover up your face he's gonna go like this you know George he's gonna do George he's gonna be hitting the belly he's gonna punch himself into face what if he plays the the form in ropedo you know no he's Ralph Cramden that was he's being clipped George he just hands and not like that he's not wearing a mouthpiece he's gonna have to wear a mouthpiece when he fights so he's not training with a mouthpiece right now yeah again it's it takes you breathing it's 50% less breathing John knows so I wear my mouthpiece all the time I went I went right away last time for an hour and 15 minutes on the sand pulling a 250 pound pound with my mouthpiece in you know Jorge thank you're ready to fight carnima Gregor that would be a much better payday for you George I think you could fight carnima Gregor now I think you're ready to challenge a broken hole to a fight that would not a George no I mean I'm proud of him he knew what it is he's not like one of these guys because he knows he could probably just sleep a beer fucking he had hot dog strike beer go to bed each night get fat and go in there it's still fucking knock a motherfucker out but he's not doing it he's actually taking it like he's fighting my Tyson you know he should he's wise will be the UFC championship of the world and that's that's what I'm finally I'm not looking at Lenny I'm looking at Lenny as as if he's a champion I'm not looking at him as Lenny so I'm treating as he he's gonna try and kill he killed me and I can't let that happen I got a rap this thing up and I wanted to say I and I'm sorry guys like once again I miscommunicated because we the kids with cancel school but I wanted to try to get this thing changed I don't think it should be on the Libya weekend I think you're ready yes let's say you're a tone weekend okay let's work let's stay let's work on the date then okay okay can we fly what we should make it we should make it Easter now it's Easter pastor ready what are you talking about next next now we're not going to next year now Halloween Halloween Halloween Halloween's not a bad idea but let's do it close to you right here do it in both do it in both are over there because this way you guys are all close to each other I can drive across alligator allie it's not that long far from you I don't want to go to Orlando it's a fucking nightmare there let's do it in bokeh area find a gym there and that's the best way to do it well they have American top team is there alright that's fine I'll end yeah I gotta probably would have gym in bokeh why can't you but why can't we do it like an RX muscle event where we are yes like when we actually make it like a little X-bow our own little X-bow like Bruce versus Tyler Kevin for shows going on on the camera what's that Tyler said we can live stream it easily with multiple cameras you can do it no I don't mean just we should but like you put something interesting what I mean something something some show of hotest answer I mean the Momo meet us fucking yeah we get a little more I'm not absolutely with babes with a few things you know that's it I get a protein I'm gonna be booty you need girls I'll take yeah I grew that well hey well Mr. Mrs. RX muscle no you need pole dancing yeah he was triple con got to get Jack win going from big lighting we want to be here wet t-shirt on you need out the biggest hits contest you gotta have something like that all right we gotta see my little life Georgian big landing well teacher there you go you do many people would come just to sit and talk with us guys and and right before being able to sit down and ask Jimmy to pull you know a fucking crazy question look at this line except it'll be over and and and all the questions have to be delivered by bitches would big tension wet you know what's funny no I bring a little part with the question on it no like walk like what were like oh we're not all the way to hand the question to Greg and then Greg's got to read the question no show read the question to Greg so say like Joe from Pittsburgh wants to know how big your arms were at the biggest and then you'll get to answer her and then she'll walk off stage would have what a thong on and then that'll be interesting we just want to go go I just want to go to the craft I was thinking about that because I was thinking about having our explosive barbecue all the fans coming hang out with us you know but this is exactly what's all right put together package yes we're gonna get to girls you've got to have girls we don't have girls this is not gonna know it doesn't have no one cares they just want to see these two guys be the girl you need ring girls you need I think don't you not your granny's not for now I think yes yes yes you I love you get you get emails all the time all this though the people would love to come hang out I think that's what the energy of getting the the the the trainees for big line E for the ring girls and that would make it much more entertaining to get where I could I could we do it when I did with MD like the RX barbecue why could we have a barbecue after the barbecue we had a question and answer we'll leave for it and what's the day Eugene mission and fucking and Mellie Mellie had there I'd always people I did all the MC I did the question answer people were crazy they loved it you know I mean usually pretty sit right there answering the most fucked up questions right I mean he's a lot of that cuz we're the characters we're not like he said the fucking body brothers we do have these interviews we're interviewing the diet what they're on the America championship and he said well you know it's really hard for us and people sit there and then you know you know it's Joe Martin arts and you're like who the fuck is this guy on our X this week you know wake him good you know you just wanted North America pro how do you feel you know really you know you're gonna go for the real work on the details of it I got to wrap this up my kids are getting a revunkest in the other room and they're starting to destroy shit so we'll work on the details I think this

the veteran the marine vet wants to fight Rob Zilly I get I sent you a 60 second tape oh yeah well yeah and that's up to Rob he'll have to determine that I don't really care I only want to see you in big lighting fight to be honest with you so we'll make it happen guys that's what we get to love you all love you damn love you guys bye

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA PIDX Road, there's 30 year in a row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car capped hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. We're going to be in LA PIDX Road! We're going to be in LA PIDX Road! Welcome back to legendary foods, Muscle in the morning. On day polo and today is Wednesday, October 7th, 2020. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, it's October, it's Wednesday, and we've got a huge week ahead of us. But before we jump into next week's action, we need to take a look at what went down at last weekend's Minneapolis Probecene. Bringing home top honors in the open was an emerging star in Gabriella, Muscius, who looked awesome on her way to collecting her first career win. The number two spot went to second year pro Maya, a study, and rounding out the top three was former Junior National Champ, Jennifer St. Peter. Let's move on to the Master's Division where it was all about freedom of Martinez, who racked up another big win in her 43rd show as an IFV athlete. Second place went to Paul Aline and closing out the top three with a strong performance with Katie Michael. Since there was only one show in the dock at last weekend, I thought today would be a good time to do a little looking ahead to what's on deck this coming weekend at the Europa Championships in Alecante, Spain. Some of you may have already seen the official line up for released on Monday by Pro League officials. And just as we expected, this show is absolutely loaded all the way across the board. Not only is every single division going to be represented here, if you look at the list of names, it's a whos who are bodybuilding. This show has all the buzz and feel of a major event like the Arnold Plastic, except the stakes are even higher here since we're talking about having three Olympia qualifications up for grabs, which is unprecedented as far as I know. This is one of the few musty TV events of the season, and whatever happens here will have major ramifications for what happens three runs from now on stage in Planet Hollywood. Obviously, one of the biggest storylines of the weekend heading into this show is Big Rany, who absolutely needs to secure one of the top three spots in the men's open here to qualify for the Olympia. For me, the one burning question I have about Rany heading into this contest, all centers around how important this show is for his place in the hierarchy of bodybuilding. Let's not forget that this year we have Phil Heath entering back into the equation and flex Lewis making his first run at an open title, which means by default two people who are used to be solid top five contenders will be on the outside looking in. And for ramming, not snagging, one of those Olympia qualifications could almost have a domino effect, because now we're not just talking about wearing fits into this year's contest, we're basically looking at this having a ripple effect that extends for years, which could ultimately mean that we've seen the last of his run for a legitimate top three contenders spot. And I get this is all speculative and that's what makes this conversation fun. It's what it is that makes it fascinating, but we won't really know how this whole thing plays out until the dust finally settles. The other part of the equation in the men's open here is the depth at the top of the lineup, which is being headline by the season debut of Rafa Brandeo. In the beginning of the week, Rafa released a pre-show progress photo that was so impressive I think it put him in the pole position in terms of who the public sees as the favourite heading into the contest. In a lot of ways, I think Rafa actually has the most to gain here with a win. Not only does it qualify him for his first career Olympia appearance, but it also legitimizes him as a top ten athlete in the division. The work that Rafa has put in with flex Lewis in his crew down in Florida has been well documented. And behind the scenes, Chris Ascitos has been pulling the right levers and guiding the ship. But that doesn't make this any less of a huge moment. We're all talking about the opportunity for a career defining win against one of the most popular athletes in the last decade. This is a huge deal, and I can see Rafa coming out of this weekend as the biggest winner of the bunch. And that's something we have to wait to find out and see. And that does it, yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on the Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions to make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Motor 30 year in a row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car cocktail. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is October 2nd 2020 and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. This is way to take yourself out of the game as an athlete is by playing not to lose. Because the second you take your foot off the accelerator, somebody else is ready to go speeding right past you. But luckily for John Delorosa, the word slow and down aren't in his vocabulary. A few days ago, John's camp posted a video of him training back with flexed Lewis' crew inside their private training facility and showed John looking as big as I'd ever seen him. Around him, by athletes at this level, forces you to step up your game where else you get left behind. So the fact that John is playing for keeps on a daily basis is probably a blessing in disguise because it'll have him ready to hit the ground running at the start of next season. Back in the day, we used to say that pictures don't lie in bodybuilding. Nowadays, between Photoshop and filters and everything else going on out there, with the cameras, you can't always trust the photos the way you used to. But I do trust Rueley Winkler. A few days ago, a new photo surface of Rueley standing in front of the magic mirror with the camel crew who said that this year Rueley's bringing in something that we've never seen before. For someone at this stage of his career, I don't know if Rueley's cape of both completely revamping his look, but it's good to see that his confidence is riding high. So if the photos do end up telling the whole story, maybe this will be the year, we see him challenge for a top two spot. You know why good movie trailers are awesome? It's because they build anticipation. They give you just enough to suck you in and make you want more without giving you too much. So in a sense, the value of Quaylo's entire Olympia prep is like one giant movie trailer. This week, Natalia's camp released a video from a back training session that showed us just enough to get everyone excited about what she's bringing to the Olympia this year. As the two time defending Arnold Champ, this could be a huge spot for Natalia, because knocking off someone like Sheneek Rand in the peak of her career would be the biggest upset in history. So if the final product does end up being as good as the trailer makes it seem, we're all in for one hell of a show. If you remember two weeks ago, we did a segment on Big Rami, and we said we're their smoke, their fire. Well, it turns out we were right. And in case you missed it on Tuesday, news officially broke that Rami was going to be competing at the Europa Pro in Spain next month. Where he immediately comes in now as the pre-show favorite. That being said, I do think this could be a double-edged sword. If he wins, now all of a sudden the hype train kicks into overdrive and there will be 50 million people on social media commenting about how he's going to win the Olympia. But on the flip side, if he comes out flat and doesn't win this show, people will be waiting in line to pile on and talk about how he's been overrated as an entire career. Well, Rami, the balls in your court now, we're in the home stretch. It's time to put up, or shut up. And that does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods, Muscle in the Morning. On day polumbo and today is Tuesday, September 29th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. A big part of growth in life is learning how to step back and reassess because when you're caught up in the grind of the day-to-day, it can be damn near impossible to gain the perspective you need to make sure that you're still on track. But now that Patrick Moore is in a position to step back and take a breather, these next few months could be a pivotal point in his career. According to Patrick, for the first time he's excited about moving into his offseason process. He and this team are planning to use this time to really dig in and do it needs to be done to take him to the next level with the hope being that 2021 will be the year that it all comes to fruition. So as long as they don't lose sight of who they are, what it is they need to do, I think a little bit of time to reflect could be just with the doctor ordered. Good runners and good bodybuilders have one really important thing in common. They both understand that running their hardest at the end is the thing that ultimately separates them from the pack. So I've been a vowsick now that you're coming down the home stretch. Here's my question to you. How hard are you willing to run? With the Chicago pro about one month away now, these next few weeks, are the make and break at time that could potentially set the stage for how these last few months of the season will play out. But if she can push through the pain and make one last final push, she can end up being the one who breaks the tape. Set it a million times before, where this smoke, there's fire. Just ask anyone living on the west coast. Now lately in case you haven't been paying attention, there's been a little bit of smoke surrounding big rammy. As rumors have started to circulate about him potentially jumping in to compete before the Olympian. Just to be clear, we didn't start the rumors and we don't know if there's any truth to them. But the smoke has to be coming from somewhere. And if there's smoke in the air, that means somewhere below the surface, something must be burning. So I would keep my eyes open and try to read the TV's because we might be seeing the big man make a return a whole lot sooner than we expected. And finally, we wanted to close out today's show with an update on Sandra Graghalis. Last week, we reported that Sandra was indefinitely out of commission after undergoing surgery. But thankfully, as of a few days ago, it looks like Sandra's well on the railroad to recovery. Late last week, Sandra released a few post surgery update photos that generated a lot of buzz, mostly because she looked like she hadn't even missed the beat. I don't know what that means in terms of her training and competing this year, but at least on the surface it looks like she could be ready to go by the Olympia, which I hope is the case because adding a 100% Sandra Graghalis to the mix always makes things way more exciting. And that does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on the Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And something we don't often see is that Jene actually went back post-transition and competing against men just because I guess like it was kind of like she's gone back and forth competing with men and women based on I don't know what I mean that's just a dick move no pun intended Okay pun intended I'm a fucking tranny so I can make that pun anyways Day Palombo here with an RX muscle rant all right guys and preparing you're just gonna be a controversial one Want to say right off the bat? I have a very good friend. Okay in this industry Originally his name was Mad Croc he transitioned he's now a woman you probably know him as Jene Marie Croc he was a powerlifting and bodybuilding star You know tremendous amount of muscle mass one of the nicest guys of a met I've interviewed him as both Matt I've interviewed him as Jene There's a I guess you could say a YouTube personality called Blair White okay Supposedly you know from what I gathered she is a trans gender herself She was a male now she's a female and she has a very popular YouTube channel It's got about a million subscribers so that's obviously a lot of people watch these videos and she did a video on Well part of the video was was dedicated to Jene Marie and her I guess to stain at the fact that she felt that Jene Marie Okay was looking to compete against women in powerlifting and bodybuilding and she found it Appalling ludicrous you know She even called it a dick move at one point in the video Now if anyone if you any of you guys know Jene Marie okay Not a bad bone in this person's body sweetheart, you know just loves to lift super passion for for body-billing and the strength sports Whether she's a girl or she's a boy or she's back and forth and she considers her trans You know fluid gender I guess you could call it It doesn't matter she loves to lift okay, so one of the things is she doesn't identify her sex with You know how big she is muscular However she's also said that she never would consider competing with the women because she knows it's unfair And it would also cast a bad light on the transgender community because she would be trying to you know Be people who are genetically and who are muscular and theory to her because she developed as a male Okay, and she knows that and she's gone on record even on our TV show She's gone on record the thing I was never compete as a woman bodybuild. I would never compete as a woman power left it because I would break every record it wouldn't even be it would not be fair I understand that but she still identifies herself as a woman So why this Blair white has decided to go on this this attack and I call it I call it cyber bullying I call it trans bullying if you wanted to know the truth I don't care if she's a transgender or not She attacked the jenei put her down made her seem like she was trying to you know get over on the fact that she had all this You know muscle that she developed as a man and now was trying to use it to exploit You know the woman side of the sport and just beat everyone just because she wants to win things that's bullshit because you know what Jenei Wouldn't choose a natural bodybuilder Competed in the open division with all the people who were using drugs because she didn't care She just wanted to be the best next to you could be and what you decided to To use Supplements she's still competed with the same people she wants to be the best of what she does She doesn't have to win the women's division and she never ever went on record So I think it's a polling that this girl I don't care I'm gonna follow with she's got I don't care. I'm gonna be subscribed. She's got it. I'm gonna count popular she is She's bullying jenei Marie and I'm gonna stand up for our iron brothers and sisters in this sport If someone on the outside goes on the attack and tries to cast an dispersion and make this person seem like they're not A good person and that they don't have a genuine heart and that they're looking to take advantage of the fact that they're That they've decided to transition to another sex For purposes of promoting themselves because that's just not the case So you know what get your facts straight okay, Blair as my father would say You know I don't even want it my father would call her a ninkum poop because you know what If you really wanted to verify your facts and see if your story was accurate you could have called her up You could have reached out to jenei and jenei would have gotten back to you in two seconds amount of fact I think jenei told me because I just was looked out at the phone with her that she Her people that she's you know Publiscist and everything has tried to reach out to this Blair white and I don't think that she may've heard back anything so Blair should have reached out to her God her side of the story before doing this condensing you know YouTube video on her probably just For you know to get people to watch her stuff because it is obviously very Polarizing because you look at jenei and she's huge and she's a female now and of course she's an easy target But that's what bullies do they they pick easy targets and they go after them You know what I I appreciate and respect what Blair is doing on our YouTube channel in the sense that she's trying to get more Notariety for the trans community and if she whatever her political you know Views are I don't care it doesn't matter because everyone's a title through her pain But before you go and bullying someone and make them feel bad about themselves in a subject You know nothing about the body bullying and fitness industry get you fact straight I'm Dave polombo within our ex muscle rare You're lying to her or you're lying to others and you're lying to your subs

We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Alright, it's television on rxmuscle.com. This is Ask Dave Betterknown as hashtag as Dave. You're 30 minute question and answer show with Dave Palombo. All your questions. Die, train, supplementation. I have BB pros, news, whatever you think is on your mind is all on the table. Now generally, as you can see here, I am not coming to you from the Rxmuscle New York Studios at Room is currently in use by my grandnought. I am currently coming to you from my three-year-olds room. I am your host, DPRWC. As we now bring in Dave Palombo, Dave, hilarious episode last night of after-hour. So, Larry's, but I left us on a little bit more of a serious, nature topic and that is the first of all, we saw Big Lany breaking the bottle over his head and you all reacted to it. We talked about the Olympic runner who I believe won't be allowed to compete because of a failed steroid test. She then proceeded to blame the steroid test failure on a burrito. Pork burrito. They're vilifying pork again. I didn't really know what the reason was, but I went back and looked while we were doing the show and I saw that they, I guess they supposedly, supposedly, they were not that the pigs can produce an angelone like compounds in their system. So, somehow they equated that that's why the runner failed to shape the pork burrito, which is ludicrous of course. But what I think happened was, they only use animals. Everyone knows that most of them use very short, at the end of the box so that they get tested the stuff that their system right away. But there's so much fake stuff out there on the market now that you could think you're using like, something like really fast actually, I try to tremble and acetate maybe or winstrel. And you'd theoretically, it could be tanked with that guy. They could have put that guy in there because it's cheaper instead of master on something like that. And she probably was using something fake. And that's why I tell everyone, I know I saw like a broken record, I saw like, you mother's asking about your homework, but I'm telling you. The reason I give out information is because it's necessary. And test your steroids. I tell the women this especially because these women use anivore thinking it's anivore. They say, oh, it comes from a good source. I know they got guess what, test it. And you know what, 50% of the anivore out there is, is Diana bowl. Because it's cheap to make. It's way cheaper to give you someone a Diana bowl pill in charge of an anivore price. Because the price of it Diana bowl pill is probably 50 cents. The price of an animal or pill can be two bucks, three bucks sometimes. That's a huge difference in profitability. Same thing with injectables. Prima bowl is the most expensive raw material you can buy for any animal. It's not even that strong. But for women, women can use small doses of it. The problem is that 99% of the Prima bowl in out there is actually testosterone propane. And the reason I know this is because I sell these right test kits on my day. Pull on mo.com website. We sell a ton of them. And people as soon as they get something that comes back bad, they set me an email with the color. With the violence. What does this look like to you? I'm like, it's test propane. What does this look like to you? This pill. Unfortunately it's Diana bowl. I see it all the time. So especially if you get, now for someone who's not getting drug tests in like bodybuilders, it doesn't matter. But if you're an Olympic runner and you're doing a little gear on the side, you know, in your offseason trying to, you know, because what they do is they can't do it during the, the, the running season because they get intestinal of the time. Okay, two, two suspicious, but when they train in the offseason, try to get better for the coming year and build strength, that's when they use the antibiotics. Now if anyone knows anything about DACA, mandrelones can stay in the system for up to 18 months to the metabolites. So if she used it say in January, once she was training in the seat, there was no running season and to put on some strength and she thought she was taking, you know, like I said, like a short acting compound, like maybe like a, you know, like a wind stroll or a master on or something like that. And she was actually taking an engine loan. Now she's screwed for the next theoretically 12 to 18 months. She's going to test positive and that's probably why she's so like how the health type test positive. So they got to find a, they got to blame it on a pork burrito, which obviously the Olympic committee didn't buy. And they banned her for four years and she was the record holder. She probably would have won the gold medal at the Olympics. Great runner from the United States. So guys, the take home messages get your Roy test, check your stuff out, men, women. Because even if you're stuff, you know, even if you're not being drug tested, why would you want to waste your money on using something that you might think is trembling alone and you might think it's actually master on and it's actually test officer and proponate. And you're, you're giving people good money and you wasting your time or even worse, it might be nothing. You could be completely wasting your money. I can't tell you how many growth hormone tests we sell. And I'm telling you 50% of the GH comes back as nothing. Okay. So the take home messages test you here. Test your gear and put down the pork burritos. Let's go to questions. The first few questions from the day, Pulumbo experience. The first question on the never ending quest to burn fat. Can you explain thyroid levels? What is low and what would benefit from exogenous health? My former coach never really explained or addressed it. For thyroid, you're talking about what I, what I was saying, your thyroid was for thyroid hormone, what's an antibiotic, yeah. Explained, yeah, thyroid levels. All right. So look, I could give you the best way I can explain it is to explain myself. Okay. I'm going to make a thyroid hormone and put the thyroid hormone at my thyroid removed. So I put the anti-four or the elophyroxy. That's inactifyroid hormone that's what my thyroid gland would naturally produce. My body then converts the T4 that I'm taking into active T3. So my body basically knows what it needs T3 is and it'll convert it to me. That's the best way to replace thyroid hormone is to give yourself T4. Now, if you have a thyroid gland that functions normally, okay, and you take T4, it's going to do nothing. It's not going to convert because your body's already converting your natural thyroid hormone into T3, which is the active form. So if you're going to supplement with thyroid hormone, you've got to take active thyroid home T3, also, side-to-mails at one of the brand names of that, another brand name would be Sino-Mell, which is the Mexican version. But what is adequate thyroid function? It's whatever the normal range is, and I don't remember it off hand, the normal range of T3, okay. So if you're thyroid stimulating hormone, which is the pituitary hormone that's produced that's stimulate chithyroid, is it the normal level, it would imply your T3's at normal level. I always tell her when to check everything, TSH, T4, T3, if they're all normal, then you're good. Raising that up a little bit will increase your metabolic rate a little bit. But really, and I've said this before, the urability to burn fat is really dictated by the metabolic enzymes in your muscle cells, in your mitochondria, how good of a fat metabolizer are you. So while my replacement of thyroid hormone didn't alter anything about my body, didn't get leaner, I didn't get fat. And the reason is that thyroid hormone doesn't control my levels of body fat. My mitochondria in my muscle cells, how they burn fat, which is superior to most people, that's my genetic gift, is still there. As long as I have thyroid hormone turning it on or allowing it to work, then I'm going to continue to be dipolumbal and have dipolumbal metabolism. So once again, what's adequate? Do you need to run higher levels? Higher helps a little bit, but it's not going to turn a fat genetically fat person into a fat burning day polumbal machine just by adding thyroid hormone. And that's or even uping it a little bit. That's important to know. However, when you combine thyroid hormone, T3 with plumbuterole, with a diet, with cardio, then you're going to start burning more fat. Okay? And it'll be dictated on an individual by individual basis, because everyone's fat burning machinery is different in their body. And that's what you have to remember. It's not the dual end all. It's just another piece of the puzzle that's going to help you to lose weight faster or a body fat faster. Second question, again, from the day polumbal experience app, Dave, what's glucogon? How does it work? What does it do? Okay. Glucogon is also produced by the pancreatic cells. There's two types of hormone producing cells in the pancreas. One is known as the beta cells which produce insulin, which we know that does it drives nutrients into the muscle cells. And then we have another hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas, that's known as glucogon and glucogon, move stuff out of the cells. So if you have stored glycogen in your muscle cells or liver and your body's blood sugar drops, glucogon is released and glucogon has the cells or tells the cells liberate glucose into the bloodstream and raise blood sugars, because we need more sugar because the blood sugar levels are going low. So they work opposite each other, glucogon and insulin. Now the cortisol producing cells in your adrenal glands can also raise blood sugar, but they do it a different way. They turn amino acids into glucose. That's known as glucogonian genesis and that can occur in liver and to some degree in the kidneys. So that's a stress hormone. So if you're really, you know, really, really low and your body's under tremendous stress, your body can crank out more glucose via that route as well. But if the muscles have stored glycogen in it, usually if blood sugar drops, glucogonus released, the problem with the type one diabetics that take insulin is that when you inject insulin and it goes through the liver, a lot of times the body will release glucogon. And response to an insulin injection, which is what you don't want, right? Because here you are trying to drive new to this cells into the cells and your body's releasing glucogon, which is pushing them out of the cells. And that's why type one diabetics have to take a lot more insulin than you would naturally produce to accomplish the same feat clearing the blood of glucose. So glucogon is not something you would ever inject. You would ever use that. But that's what it does inside the cell, inside the body's use. Let's go to our Instagram questions again.

Give tough question here if you're ready for it. It's from Lee Priest official Lee Priest handled. Should I wear blue or red, a blue or red shirt today, which is more antibiotic? Blue is definitely more antibiotic, I would say red is more catabolic because red is the color of the devil, right? I think blue is more antibiotic. Somebody's not associated with blue with muscle gains and red with fat loss, maybe because red kind of in my mind would be associated with raising metabolic rate and burning more calories and stuff like that. So I'd say go blue. Now I wanted to mention one thing, we do have a giveaway to do today. I think we missed the last couple weeks, although we're not doing this show live, those we can't do that. But next week, when we go back to live, next week, we'll do the giveaway is the legendary foods giveaways again. All right, so Lee, now you know what to wear for today. Let's go, actually, so we're getting a lot of questions. I don't know if he touched on this in the last episode. A lot of questions about when your next guru course is going to be is going to be virtual is going to be in person. So what can you tell the audience for those that are asking? I'm looking at my calendar right now. I think we haven't scheduled for July 10th to be honest with you. I have a check. I'll have the post-drup this week on the end of the week on my daypalombo.com website. I think we're going to be online. We're not ready to do anything in person yet because of COVID still. So we'll be online, which is great for all the international guys and girls who want to take the course because I have people, the people like the India, they got a wake up like it like four in the morning to date the class. I feel bad for them. But you know what, we have a great crew. I always have 15 to 20 good people in that class. They ask great questions. It's going to be once again. It'll be from nine in the morning Eastern Standard Time to 6pm. We take a break, a one hour break for lunch. And it's a really fun class because we go over everything from diet, supplementation, drugs, offseason, pre-conscious. I ask, answer every question. I mean, it's so comprehensive that by the end of the day, when I get to 6pm, I'm so drained. I can't even speak because I really, I give a lot of emotional energy to that course. It's, it's really near and dear to my heart. I really feel that educating people the next generation or the next generation. I should say is very important because I want to make sure that the coaches who come out of this course can take their clients to the next level and be true coaches. Not just in a sense that they have experience, but they have the knowledge behind that experience so that they can give people the right information. And not give them bro science information that's going to wind up hurting them down the road. So near and dear to me, check it out and just check my back with my website. I'll also post on my Facebook and Instagram when the next course is we're making the posts. I believe it is once again July 10th weekend and you'll be able to sign up at the Palombo University link and once again the link will be on my website. So I also want to mention that the questions we addressed earlier in the show related to the day, Palombo experience app. People don't know what that is. That's the app we offer. You can download it at the iTunes Store Android store and it's $29 a month and you get access to everything I've ever written, everything I've ever done video wise, all in one place we put up a workout every single week. I answer everyone's questions on the apps. If you have questions for me, they get answered on the app in a public forum. So everyone sees everyone's questions and everyone's answers which is I always wanted to do that because I like to see what other people are asking. Because a lot of times it's a question I have and I don't even remember and this way it's an educational tool. So you're constantly going on there, reading people's questions and answers and you're learning on a regular basis and then I also do a Q&A video. Kind of like ASD, except it's an extra one. More education based on the questions of the app members and that goes up once a week as well. So you get a lot of value for your money and you've got a personal trainer in your pocket. So you might want to check that out. Yeah, a lot of good questions. See how many we can get through. Let's go to Peck Pockman. Dave is natural competitive bodybuilding really natural as then are they competitive completely clean or are some mild form of drugs involved now? I mean, just if you can go back into yeah, clients you coach, what you've seen, what you've heard the truth beyond the matter. There's no such thing as natural bodybuilding. There are some people 100% natural in the sense that they don't use any illegal performance enhancing drugs absolutely. Are all the people who compete in natural competitions natural now? Because for most of these organizations, they call themselves natural but they're really just drug tested organizations. You beat the drug test. You beat the drug test. I mean, that's what the Olympics are. You think the Olympics are natural? Come on. It's called beat the drug test. Sometimes you fail the drug test like this runner. We just saw it recently who's banned for four years. You're rolling the dice. If you pass the drug test, you win the Olympic gold in your hero. If you fail it, you're a criminal. That's how they, that's how you branded this country. This is unfortunately how it goes. So are there natural competitions out there? They say they are. Is everyone natural? No. Are some people natural? Absolutely. And that's a personal choice you have to make. I just feel that if you're going to use antibiotics, can you get a huge drugs that are banned by these organizations? You might as well compete in an organization that doesn't test you. Because why be a fraud? You know what I mean? If those organizations should be reserved for people who don't want to take drugs, that feel like it's a protected environment. But unfortunately, it just isn't that because people want to be champions. They don't care if they have to cheat. They don't care if they're going to be the big fish and a small pond. It doesn't matter to them. I competed in a natural organization for one or two times when I was natural. And you know what? The second time I competed, people thought I was a natural. So I said, you know what? I'm not going to deal with this stuff. You know what? The truth is I want to be the best. And if I want to be the best, I got to use stuff. So I started using some antibiotics that I never competed in a natural organization again. Because I said, you know what? If I'm going to be the best, I got to compete against the best. And it's my choice how much I want to use or not use. Just because you compete in an organization that uses drugs. That means you have to use the most drugs of anyone out there. Because the amount of drugs you use is not an alicous to how well you place. As much as some people may think that that's the case. It's not. Okay, taking a threshold amount, eating right, training right, sleeping enough, having some genetic predisposition. Those are the keys to success in bodybuilding. And if you think it's all drugs, you don't know what you're talking about. Let's go to tank MCG. Not sure if I have this question last week, because I saw this in question, but I'll ask you if you remember it, we'll move on to the next one. Does posing or flexing the muscle being worked between sets have any value? You know, I don't think it makes it. I don't think it makes you harder or leaner or I think what it does is it gives you a better mind muscle connection. That's what I found to be the hardest when I was going through about. I found it hard to be able to control the muscle that I wanted to use. Not only in a workout sense, but in a posing sense on stage. Now, as I got bigger, it became easier, maybe because I had more muscle and I could feel it better. But really what I felt was that the more I practiced my posing, the better body awareness I had. Some people just genetically just pick things up and have really good body awareness. They know where they are in space, they compose well, they move well. Other people need to practice a million times over to get that same, the builds up those neural pathways, that's me. I'm a guy who's got, I got to practice it mechanically a thousand times. And then, because I'm a creative person, then I could creatively hit my shot and move creatively. Because now it's ingrained in my neural pathways and now I can artistically release it. I can't do two things at one time. You can ask my wife if I'm working on the computer and she's talking to me, I don't hear anything. I'm like in my own little world. Whereas I know people that come up my wife come up with it, she can watch TV, she can be yelling at the kids, she can be sending out orders on the computer and she won't make a single mistake. So, everyone is a little different like that. And I think that you have to just accept and figure out what kind of person you are. And if you need to work more on your posing because you just don't have that body awareness, you don't move well on stage. You can learn to. The key is not saying, well, I'm just not good on stage on that kind of practice. No, let me do you got to practice more than the other person. Let's go to Leon James Fit. Dave, you've explained that GH causes new muscle fibers and you will start to see the difference around the six mark. I guess six week mark period depending on the dose. The question that follows that is if you build a new muscle tissue from say a year or two of GH and then stop all year and working out once you start back up training a year while you have muscle memory to build back the tissue that GH caused that you never got within a ballics or will you have to get back on GH? What I explained was that when you take a compound like growth hormone or IGF1 and you're producing new cells, you're turning stem cells which we used to call satellite cells and other called stem cells. We turn these stem cells which are basically the lobs of nothing and we turn them into muscle tissue using a growth hormone which will differentiate these stem cells and turn them into muscle fibers. Once we do that, they're muscle fibers. Now, in order to see the results of those new muscle fibers we produce which are very they're going to be microscopic cells. We want to get them enlarged. How do we enlarge muscle cells when we train? We break them down, we build them up. We take steroids which make them bigger. Once the GH makes the cells but then we have to make those cells bigger. That's why I said this usually like a lag of six months and it's not six weeks, six months I find. So the cells that you've made have created today in six months you'll see them get to their full size. If you train hard and you do everything else right of course. Now, if you stop training and those cells shrink up again, you still have those muscle cells that are just smaller and that's what muscle memory is, right? Now you go back to training again after taking off a couple months and boom, they blow right up because you already got those new cells there. They're not changing. Once you've turned them into muscle, they're muscle and those nuclei are not going away. They make it smaller but they're still there. So once you want them back, you just have to start eating and training again and they come back pretty fast because you're just blowing up the size of those cells. You don't have to take GH to do it. You don't even have to take steroids to do it but if you obviously would take steroids and you train heavy, they're going to get bigger faster. Let's go to Cobb Brey. This is about your competition career but if you have any successful stories in clients as well, you're most successful contest car-blood protocol. You know, I try a lot of different things. When I originally started training and competing in the early 90s when I was really doing, I started first started doing well. I didn't eat anything. It was like a protein and carbs and I would carb up. I would just load tons of carbs because and I could not get full enough. So what I would usually do is I would have like a pancakes and syrup and butter on the morning of the show and that would fill me out a little bit but I always looked better the next day after eating like a maniac Saturday night. Then I realized as part of my whole, I guess you could say, Quest to figure out the whole fat equation. Fat's are necessary. Fat's actually go into the cells and they actually add volume to the cell too. There's something called intermuscular fat and some of that is necessary for fullness. So when I my most successful carb load was when I realized I didn't really need as many carbs as I was eating. I needed a lot more fat. I couldn't cut the fat out because by taking away the fat, your body is what happens is when you start eating carbs and carb loading, you basically stimulate in the metabolism. So what's happening is a lot of those, especially if you have a fast metabolism like mine, I can eat a 500, 600, 700 grams of carbs for the day but my body is using the mole for energy because it's because my metabolism is going through the roof. If you have fat as a buffer in there, your body can use some of that fat as fuel and a lot of those carbs now that you're eating will get stored as glycogen as opposed to just being consumed as energy. And that's when I realized what the formula was. So my the last couple years from 2001 to 2003, like all the years from the 2000, those four years from 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4, I realized that I didn't need to eat a thousand grams of carbs to carb up. I can eat, you know, three, four hundred grams of carbs. And I can keep my fat high at 150 grams or whatever I was eating, 160 grams of fat per day along with my protein which I didn't lower. That's another mistake people think, oh, you don't need as much protein because I'm eating more carbs. If you lower your calories, okay, or keep your calories the same and just change the composition, you're not going to carb up adequately. So I needed to keep my food intake high and add carbs. And that's what I did. I didn't reduce fat, I didn't reduce protein. I added carbs on top of all that stuff. And that's when I looked full, but yet I wasn't blowing out my gut and constipating myself because I was eating a thousand grams of carbs a day. And that just what that's what works for me. And it's works from 99% of my clients. Everyone's in a while. You got to freak shut. You got to do crazy stuff with. But for most people, that's the way to go with it. Don't cut the fat and protein back and add some carbs. Depending on how carbs sensitive the person is or how much you need to carb up, that'll dictate how much you give them. It's good to have an abandoned bed. You know, it's good for them to show which creates more hamstring growth, leg curl machines or deadlift variations overloading the stretch position or the peak of the contraction. Look, I'm a big believer in squats and dead lifts, build the whole leg, you know. And, you know, hamstring, ludes, that's a lot of, a lot of deadlift. You get a lot of stimulation in there. And I'm not talking straight like deadlift. So I'm going to regular dead lifts, press and off the floor. Pull that weight off. Squats, when you're lowering that weight, that's all hamstring, you know. So you're not going to get huge thick mass of hamstrings from doing leg curls, okay? Does it help? Of course it does. Is it going to give you the dense look that you see like some of these freak savants as you know? That's lowering the weight on the leg press, lowering the weight on squats, okay? Dead lifting, pushing, pulling that weight off the floor. So I'm going to be using those glutes and hamstrings. And let me tell you something, the adductors, the inner thighs are really important to the hamstring pose because when you put that leg back, a lot of that stuff that hangs back there is not just hamstring. It's adductor too. On the side pose, when you put your legs together and you see that nice drop that we call that hamstring drop, it's really not a hamstring drop, it's really an adductor drop. The inner thigh gets pressed against the other one, it hangs and then just a little edge of the back of your leg is your hamstring. But it's a lot of adductor in there too. So don't neglect the adductor compartment. Open your stance up when you squatting, dead lifting, you know, or pressing, let those adductors work. Well, it's good at the rectum rhino. When should you get your blood worked on post-show also? How long would you say to stay off for a proper clear out? I tell people wait at least four weeks to get blood worked on after your last antibiotics shot because it takes at least three or four weeks to clear all that crap out of your system. Probably the best that would be do your whole, you know, clean out right before you go back on cycle, usually after which should be about eight to ten weeks of clean out. Okay. That's when you should get your blood worked on. So when you clean your eight weeks off, go get tested, check your kidney function, liver function, all the other stuff that goes along with that. And then, and I've given that, you know, I send all the time the list of blood worked to people should get done if you've not a contact me. And you'll see a true, you know, or a pretty true snapshot of what's going on in your body. If you go right after you competed a week or two after you're going to be all, you're going to have levels all over the place. That's normal. I mean, that's to be expected, I should say. So try to wait to you by the clean down and start to regenerate a little bit, then go get tested. This question from Elaine, I mean, is a simple question, but we have a special episode of Guru Talk, a show where if you have it watched Guru Talk, the premise of this show was really bringing on, we bring on Guru's, we bring on experts, you know, who really do, you know, dive into the deep science of bodybuilding, health, special episode. The question is about lowering DHT, but if you want to maybe give some insight on this upcoming episode of Guru Talk, DHT, how to keep your hair all tied in and a very special guest. Yeah, well, we're all going to love this episode because I know we're all of us here in this room today are interested in keeping our hair. And Jay Campbell is very, very knowledgeable in this whole pursuit of hair regrote. Okay, and I look, I've been into this whole thing, I also, anyone has lost hair and likes hair. So people say they have, they don't even care. I don't, I look like a murderer if I straight my head. So I like to have a little bit of hair, and Jay Campbell is doing a lot of research on copper peptides and they're regenerative, in fact, on the hair follicle of the head and how you can control also some of the hair regrote. So we have a really good guru report to all coming out. I'm a very high DHT converter. That means that I convert a lot of my testosterone into DHT genetically. When I got my DNA tested and verified that as well, I have a defect. I convert too much testosterone to DHT, which is probably why my whole life I broke used to break out with acne when I was a kid. And it was very oily and stuff like that in my skin because I'm a big DHT converter. Now to give you an idea of how much DHT DHT I produce, I'm on no hormone replacement just whatever my body naturally produces testosterone wise, which is about four to 500 on a total testosterone test. That's my body naturally, but this is, I take the nasteride every single day for the last 20 years, 2.5 milligrams. And my DHT levels are not low. They're like normal in the middle range, which tells you that if I didn't take it, I would be through the roof. Okay, has it made me grow back any hair probably not? Has it slow to stop my hair loss? Maybe, I think it might have. And that's why I stay on it. It's also protected from my prostate. Because I'm a DHT converter, a high one. Okay? What Jay Campbell kind of revealed on this episode is that a lot of what we think, you know, the old thinking was that if we can get DHT levels low, we're going to regrow hair or preserve the hair that we have on our head. That's just, it's never been the case. It's not consistent, you know. So in other words, some people notice good results, some people don't notice results. So it's not just DHT that causes hair loss. The genetic component to it, obviously. But what Jay was explaining and you'll see on this episode is that a lot of it has to do with the health of your scalp. And the blood flow to your scalp. The blood flow gets reduced. Okay? You lose hair. And there is a way to bring back the blood flow there. If you watch this episode, it's absolutely tremendous. I learned a ton of information from there. And I'm going to tell you ways that you can actually bring back your hair growth and restore it relatively quickly within the scope of probably 90 days. So check that group of talk. I think people really like it. That group of talk going live tomorrow noon eastern time on the R&C muscle YouTube channel before we ask our final question. And if you are watching us for the first time, subscribe below, hit the notification bell just like tomorrow's episode of Guru Talk yesterday's episode of After Hour, and then of course, our live episode of Heavy Muscle Radio on Monday where we had a special guest surgeon, Olivia Junior, who came on and talked about the video that he posted over the weekend and some of his thoughts as far as I guess his news getting out when he intended to put it out. So he clarified everything on that end. And then issued a challenge to some of the top body builders to compete at this upcoming misad the oral classic rather, the oral classic invite list being announced yesterday. So again, all that and more, subscribe, hit the notification bell. You're not going to miss anything coming up on the R&C muscle YouTube channel. Final question from Tattoo by Tony. Do you think it's possible that Brandon Curry could bring up his legs enough. Brandon Curry and his coach Abdullah posting a picture over the last couple of days from the 2020 prep. You see Brandon Curry, his condition back. Obviously, that is universally known, Brandon Curry, one of the most evolved upper bodies. One of those evolved body builders on the scene, but obviously many people were talking about his legs after finishing second of Big Romney last year. So could he bring up his legs enough of the put where he could have a chance to win the Olympic title back? And I guess I'll add to that in comparison to someone like that of a big Romney. Yeah. I think it's important to understand first of all, first of all, let's look at Dexter Jackson and Victor Martinez who were two of the greatest body builders of our era. They didn't have great legs. They had balance to their body. And that's what it's about. They had harmony. Victor's, you know, he was the original X frame guy. His body wasn't anything huge about anything. Rammy's got these huge monster quads, but the reason why Victor and Dexter did so well, because everything flowed well and when they were in shape, they were almost impossible to beat because of that structure. That's Brandon Curry. Curry won the Olympia because he was genetically just perfect in the sense that he had an X frame. His legs are never going to be big. They don't need to be. They just need to be really hard and full enough. And if he puts that formula together where he gets everything in harmony with each other, when he's posing as he's so plight, plethe, pleasurable to look at. His physique is so pleasing to the eye that you want to see the guy win. So the question is, can Curry beat Rammy? The answer that is absolutely yes. He can win this show and become Mr. Olympia again. But the tool he has right now, just showing up at his best full enough and hard enough. However, Randy holds the cards in his hand now. He's Mr. Olympia. He's the biggest guy on stage. He's got good symmetry for a big guy. The question is, is he going to come in in shape? If he comes in like he was last year or even a little better, no one's beaten him. Because he's the biggest bodybuilding after all is about muscle. And he's got more muscle than everyone on that stage and he's Mr. Olympia. However, if Rammy comes in off and we've seen him off, before he's only managed to shape one time this past season. He comes in off which I don't think he's going to. But if he does, that opens the door to that next level of guys and knocking at the door. The hotty shootins, the branding curries, the William Bowenax. And if Curry's at his best being a former Mr. Olympia, he is a very good chance of winning the Mr. Olympia title. So my advice to Brandon is, don't try to be something you're not, don't try to come too big and give up your conditioning. Play to your strengths, bring that to the stage. Dexter did it his whole career. He was always right there waiting for people to screw up and then he would win the show. And he did it 30 times right over 20. How many times did he do it? I don't even know. He eats. 29. He did it 29 and 30 times. So the point is that Dexter is a great model for Brandon to follow. You don't have to be the biggest guy. Just be the best guy. So there you have it. That's going to do for this episode of Asdae, Reminder tomorrow noon Eastern Standard Time on the RX muscle YouTube channel. New episode of Guru Talks for all of those of you looking to keep your hair and who will loss some hair. We're going to grow it back. This episode is going to be for you. For Tyler, Sean Day, Plumbo, I'm Sidney Furuki. We'll see you next time.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Food Expo, so it's 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car hot tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm the polomba one. Today is Thursday, June third, 2021, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. I don't know if you guys remember this show we did a few weeks ago. When we talked about William Bonak starting his Olympia prep, where he basically told his fans to wait and see what happens after he puts his foot on the gas. Well, we didn't have to wait very long, did we? Because on Monday, William released a new clip from a back training workout we saw him hitting sets of 405 for reps, which isn't all that crazy in and of itself. It was the way he looked while he was doing it to court everyone's attention. He didn't come right out and say, what his weight is, but he looks like he's easily gained 10 or 15 pounds of pure muscle since his last update, which lets you know how insane his genetics are, because it takes most people years to put on that kind of size, and considering that he's really only starting to get back into the flow of training and dieting now, just imagine how much crazy he'll get over the next few months, once he starts cranking up the intensity. Sometimes when people reach out to me asking for advice about what they need to do to turn pro, I have to give them a reality check, and ask them if they're sure that this is what they're really want to do, because the majority of people aren't willing to pay full price once they see what the cost of admission is, but on the flip side when you know what the cost is, and you're still willing to pay full price for it anyway, you don't look for discounts or shortcuts you do what Nick Walker does, pay in full with no questions asked, even when all the hype and all the attention and people tripping all of themselves to tell him how great he is, Nick stills in the gym every day, paying the damn fee and trying to figure out what he needs to get better. No discounts, no shortcuts, not on credit cash upfront. If you want it, you pay the cost because the price doesn't matter. Most of us, when it comes to bodybuilding, telling people to worry about the things that they can control and letting go of the things that they can is good advice. Trying to worry about controlling 10,000 tiny variables inevitably drives people crazy in the long run. So the more of that stuff that you can block out, the better. But then again, some things are just too big to block out. So you can't help but shift some of your attention to them. And if you're prepping for the Tampa Pro, Charles Griffin falls into that category of things that are too big to not pay attention to. We've talked a lot about how deep this lineup in Tampa is and what the long-term implications of a win here could mean. But you'll have to go through him in order to do it. When Charles has an all-working, he's an absolute monster and you can't not account for a variable like him if you're one of the other athletes competing in this show. I realized earlier today that we hadn't talked about the Portugal Pro yet, even though it's a little less than 10 weeks away. So I figured today's is good as any day to start. Because according to reports, it looks like the Portugal Pro will be the first time we see Jose Maria Mette, Warraberry, aka Madelman on stage this year, even though he qualified for the 2020 Olympia because he won the San Marino Pro at the end of 19, he never competed, which means he basically hasn't set foot on a bodybuilding stage for the last 18 months. And I guess the most casual bodybuilding fan might not even know who this guy is. But believe me, when I tell you the man is dangerous, he might be good enough to be a top six Olympia finisher right now. And if he shows up in Portugal ready to go, that classic physique contest might be over before it even starts. And that does if he had another addition of muscle in the morning on day polimbo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We're going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of net carbs and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Pullabbo and today is Friday, June 11th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. In the entire history of the Mr. Olympia, an athlete has never lost their title one year and then turned around to win it back in the following year. And that's a lot of years and that's a lot of history and I don't think any of it matters to brand and carry right now. A few days ago I saw a video of Brandon in the gym and I honestly thought it was probably the best I'd seen him look 17 weeks out from a show. Whatever he did in the offseason worked because he looks like he's coming in and recharged and ready to go. And if we can get a 2019 Brandon Curry conditioning with a few of the 2021 improvements sprinkled in, it might be the perfect recipe to make history happen. I would say for the most part, it's been a quite year in classic physics so far. But I will say this, some of the performances we've seen have been great including what we saw from Divine Wilson when he won the Pittsburgh Pro a few months back since that win in Pittsburgh. The vines been pouring all this energy into bringing up his weaknesses so we can show up to the Olympia weekend ready to be a top five contender. If you take Chris, Terence and Breon out of the equation, it does feel like there's some wiggle room there in the slots of four and five. So if Divine does come in with a better look than he had in Pittsburgh, I think that's good enough to at least force the judges to take a fair look at him. I don't know if it's just me, but for whatever reason it seems like there's been a lot of injuries this year. I know there are injuries every year, but this year it feels like it's been over the top and now it looks like the injury bug finally got around to take the bite out of Santiago, if you weeks ago, Santiago suffered a growing injury playing ice hockey and it apparently was his severe enough that it prevented him from doing any sort of training up until a few days ago. From what I understand, this isn't something that requires surgery so he should be fine with everything healing naturally, but it's still a tough injury to have at this point in the season. So hopefully he'll be able to rebound in time so he can still hit a few shows in the late summer or early fall while he still can grab and the Olympic qualification. Finally, I wanted to close out the week with a segment that I thought was pretty cool, especially if you're a UFC fan. Recently there's been a video floating around of Stan Efforting training with John Jones, and for those of who you don't know, John Jones is why they regarded as the best mixed martial artist fighter of all time. Stan's been working with John for the last few weeks as his strength and conditioning coach to help John get ready for his next fight, which I believe will be as a heavy weight if I'm not mistaken. If you completely honest, I have no idea whether it's a short-term thing or of John as planning to keep Stan on board for his entire fight camp, but I will say this. There were a lot of parallels between boxing and MMA. So John wins that next fight is a heavy weight. I can absolutely see more MMA fighters starting to work with coaches like Stan or myself to help dial in their diets for some of these big fights. And that does it the end another edition of Muscle in the Morning. Dave O'Lumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions. Make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We're going to be launching the tasty pastry for the low-car hot tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is Monday August 9th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Have you ever heard the expression? They're so far behind in the race that they actually think they're in the lead, because that's the phrase that pops into my head every time I see new updates from Chris Bumstead lately. The raining and the fending two time classic physique Olympia champ looks like he's well ahead of the pace. He set heading into last year's contest and up to this point everything we've heard coming out of Chris's camp has been nothing but positive in terms of how he feels about his prep. Here's another thing to keep in mind about Chris. He's only 26 years old, which means he's still younger than Phil Heath was when he won his first Olympic title. So if he still hasn't even reached his peak yet, and this is where he is now, we could be looking at another decade of dominance that will be pretty much unprecedented in the modern year of bodybuilding. One of my favorite Jordan Peterson ideas is that we see what we aim at, which is why it's so important to aim high and focus our energy and attention on trying to dominate everything we do. Like in guarantee you that if you ask Nick Walker right now what his aim is heading into the artle and the Olympia for the first time is response would essentially be championship or bus. The updates that we've seen coming from Nick and his team over the last few weeks have been crazy. Oh, I see. Oh, he's our. And I'd expect to see that ramp up even more as we get closer to October. Say what you will, but Nick's delivered every time out, despite people saddling him with expectations that would have been completely unrealistic for most athletes. But the thing is he keeps clearing the hurdles no matter how high they are. And at the end of the day, that means that wherever he's aiming seems to be hitting the mark, put the Olympia being nine weeks away now right around now is usually the time when we start to see those midway progress pictures trickling in from people that make you stop and do a double take. And if you've been paying attention to what James Hollings had been doing lately, that's exactly what you did when he released his latest update a few days ago. One of the things that jumps off the screen right away when you see these pictures is how he's been able to keep his waist in check with adding muscle that he's been doing during the off season, which is something bigger athletes like James struggle to do sometimes. That said, we still haven't had a chance to see what this bigger and better version of James looks like on the Olympia stage because he decided to sit out last year's contest. And when you think about some of the other names that occupied the back half of the top 10 last year, trying to figure out where he fits into that group should be one of the more interesting things to keep track of as we start getting closer to the show. We haven't talked about the Europa Pro Championship as much lately, but since we're only about one week away now, I figured that we might as well get into it. Starting with this brand new update from our old friend Nathan De Ashe, as we reported a few weeks ago, Nathan moved back out to Kuwait to train at oxygen and get ready for the show. Since I get from him, is that he's feeling very confident about where he is right now. It's been so long since we saw Nathan and Pete condition at a bodybuilding stage that I think people might be forgetting just how good this guy is. Because we're talking about someone who could be a legitimate top 5 Olympian this year. And it shows up and blows everyone out of the water. They're in Spain, consider it a warning shot. Because what we see at the Olympia 7 weeks later will be even more dangerous. And that doesn't yet another addition of muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X Pro 30 year in a row. And what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car caulk tart. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is Tuesday, June 29th, 2021. And let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Listen, if you woke up this morning and thought to yourself, man, I wish Dave would do a preview of the Portugal Pro. I'm muscle in the morning today. You're in luck because that's exactly what we're doing. Starting with this update from Hoz-8, Mente, Bubi-Ari. A.K.A. the Madelman. A few weeks ago, he confirmed that he will in fact be competing in Portugal next month, which will be his first time on an IF-3D stage since he won the San Marino Pro back in 19. From a structural standpoint, we might be looking at one of the most underrated athletes in classic, because the one time that we've actually seen him compete on a pro level, he was absolutely lights out. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure who else we can expect to see in this lineup, and I'm not also sure if it even matters, because he shows up at 100% there might not be anyone in the building who can touch him. If you're one of the die-hards who watched our show every single day, you might remember a segment we did on High Tour Galbeo a few weeks ago when we spotlighted the former amateur Olympia winner after one of our sources told us that he was getting ready to make his pro-dative. At the time, we didn't know where or when we knew that something was in the works, and now it turns out that that's something we were talking about is going to be the Portugal Pro. The official announcement came just last week from High Tour's team, and they believe that he has a legitimate shot to win the show out right there, which would obviously earn him an Olympia qualification. We see these pictures of high-tour alone in the gym, and he looks like he has all the tools to step right in and be a factor in this division from day one. But we should all know from experience that what we see in the gym doesn't always equate to what we end up seeing on stage. But if he does end up being in the real deal, he'll add another interesting piece to factor into the equation once we start getting closer to October. One of the other pro-dative is to keep your eye on, and Portugal will be in the open division where we're going to see 25-year-olds Ukrainian sensation, Vlad Suka Rukko, make his way to an IFB stage for the first time. Vlad won his pro-card back in 19 when he won the overall at the Danish James Classic, and instead of jumping right into the pro-circle like some people expected, he decided to take all of last year off to pack on some size, so we had enough muscle to be competitive in the open division right from the get-go. Based on what we've seen in the photos, he should be coming in right on the money, as far as conditioning is concerned. And that alone could be enough to get a massolid look from the judges, depending on who else to size to jump into the lineup. For only being 25 years old, this kid's already got a ton of quality muscle, so if you can hold this look for another few weeks, you'll be well on his way to securing his first top 5 finish as a pro. Even though it's still a little too early for me to know what the entire women's physique lineup looks like in Portugal, I do know for a fact that Laura Pintato is planning to make her season debut there. And if you're a fan of the division, that's something to get excited about. Two years ago, Laura finished 50th of the Olympia, and as you go back and look at who finished in front of her, you can make a legitimate argument for the top 5 group being the best that we've ever seen in the history of the division. When Laura's conditioning is on, she's good enough to beat almost anyone in the division on any given night. So if she shows up looking even remotely close to the way she did a few years ago, I don't know if there will be anyone else in that lineup who can hang with her. And that does it. If you had another edition of Muscle in the Morning, I'm Dave Alumbo reminding you to always be true to your passions, and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo and today is Thursday June 28th, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Most business gurus out there will tell you that working under a deadline is one of the best ways to get your assing gear because it basically forces you to take action. But with the biggest show for career now less than 10 weeks away, I get the feeling that Missy Farrell doesn't need any extra motivation. This week the fitness standout was caught knocking out a few sets of late night shoulder action as phase two of her Olivia Prep continues to move right along. Earlier in the season Farrell put together the best overall look of her career to earn a win at the Hawaii Pro so they can just build on that foundation and bring something new to the table at the Olympia. I think she has the potential to wind up. Bigger Top 6. Finish her. I know people like to get a little crazy with these throwback Thursday posts, but today I think one of my agg try to take things to an entirely different level. Today we saw the perennial title threat release of new updates that show off some of the improvements he's made during this year's Olympia Prep, where he's apparently been focused on bringing up his back, but the hope that it'll give Missyut to move up a few more spots. At this point in the prep, by if he looks like he's carrying around more fullness and density than we've seen in years past, so if he can carry out all the way today, guess all of a sudden I think he can be competing for a serious Top 10 Finish. Normally, I wouldn't go around recommending weights and cakes as a contest prep strategy, but when you look as good as Christy the Thome does right now, I guess you're earned the right to tell everyone else to keep their mouths shut and follow your lead. Less than two weeks away from bringing her talents to the stage in Chicago, the rookie women's physique pro looks like she's on pace to bring the heat in the windy city. Thome showed some flashes in her rookie debut at the Upper Midwest Championships a few weeks ago that definitely caught some people's attention. So if she can come in about 5% tighter overall, but still keep enough fullness to give her that 3D look. I think she might be good enough right now to potentially challenge for a Top 5 Finish. Ladies and gentlemen, just when you thought it was finally safe to come outside again, all of a sudden we find out that the Bungie man is back roaming the streets. After months of sitting quietly on the sidelines this week, the Bungie man himself, the 2017 Arnold Classic champ, Sandra Cling Millen, reappeared at a nowhere to strike fear back into the hearts of the mere mortals once again to surprise update from McMillan's show said you're looking like he's in championship form again, which is crazy when you consider the fact that he's still more than 2 months away from the Olympian out. Whether or not this means that Sejrka's officially a Top 4 Olympia threat is probably still debatable, but if he shows up and hits it out of the park, I don't think there's any question that he's got enough talent to make himself a serious contender at this year's contest. Now that hockey season is over, I'm sure the whole 2 dozen San Jose Shark stands that exist on the planet Earth right now, I'm probably sitting around watching old YouTube clips waiting for something finally to get excited about. And if that happens to be you, then this is your lucky day, because this week men's physique all star, Andre DeGosman, and now is when he was planning to make a stop at the San Diego pro this weekend. The Gosman is fresh off the biggest win of his career two weeks ago at the NorCal Championships where he was flat out brilliant from the minute he stepped out their on stage. The role that he's been in over the last few months, I think that right now he has to be a clear favor heading into this weekend. So when recap Wednesday rolls around next week, don't be surprised if you see us saying that we told you so if this guy comes in and cruises to another easy victory. And that does it's yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Day Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions. And they should have followed us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Explain Nothing Nothing Nothing To that leaves a big impression about that win Meaning I mean you can post up that back shot People say it's like morph to something You know, Instagram Not There's you know he's not peeled I mean he's the winner So you know Was he the best man there? That's what people want to know Do I think he's the best man there? No Okay, so you don't think he deserved the win What what was better about him from Tampa to New York and and what in your mind was still not good enough His can was better Not that much better though I mean I still think he was he still think his tank had been better though Yeah Come on I mean It shows It's bodybuilding So it's I mean Is this like like top notch conditioning? Well I mean he looks good to me he just doesn't look he look you can even look at his face he looks like I want to go home That's that's the look he doesn't have that beaming smile That most of these guys have after you know when they're Competing to win a shot I mean I think of Sergio leave a junior with that I'm so happy to be here you know smile every time he's up on stage You know that's what I'm used to saying from bodybuilders Yeah, I mean I just the mean the fact that a matter is when a boil it all down You know he like wide with a good front last spread and I just I I'm That locks first like you know I would say like You know I'll ask you as he peeled here So let's just play double zamp Okay, does he is he is he very hard All right, this is this is the back shot you're talking about Let's talk from behind Yeah He's not as glutes and hamstrings were not as peeled as and it they probably are a little harder than he's not really hit him completely here But you can tell he's not crisp here. Well this is back detail Yeah Let's let's pull up some let's pull up some comparison shots So I think that might that might work better for us and we can look at what the line up looked like You know and that first call out Yeah, talk to me a little bit when you first saw them all come out together And they call that first you know that top seven grew about give me your assessment of them Um, apples and oranges Too many call out at once But I can I'm smart enough to figure out you know the apples from the oranges Um, you sell it showing right with all the fruit all the fruit and allergies you get it I don't like it's one in the morning. I want to listen Um, I'm pretty still involved about it building Here's your first one. I'm a black that right there Can you see that Chris? Nope. I can't see it. Just tell me who it is. I know exactly what these guys look like I watched every did this show in detail Okay, this is the first the front double by separate Antoine Valiant Antoine's been first call out for sure Right. Yeah, I was I was not that impressed with Antoine. You know and when I look at is When I look at is Instagram stuff Well he's got to decide if he's going to be an Instagram bodybuilder or real bodybuilder What does that mean explain that because people look I mean I say it all the time and people look like I think I'm kidding is People post up pictures and they look like Dorian and they don't look like that in real life So I mean I don't understand why they do it I mean here How do they do that though? I don't say they do that you know It's the same it's like make a effect Right someone can throw on makeup and like lighting and then you know you get a gorgeous girl And then you you go see her and she's not gorgeous. Yeah, so that's the answer one from That looks nothing like Instagram Pull up an Instagram photo of front double by South, see which guy wins Let's do Desirees You know Do you think that he that he just maybe over-depleted to the show? He just because he looks really good on Instagram, you know like you say you know That's the point. I mean so who doesn't or maybe maybe he just has one of those illusionary bodies, you know Right Illusion No, no, no, no I'm going to show you I'm going to show you There's the answer one in his Instagram, but look how high that's hydrated and that's all filled up Let's see which one he looks better on Yeah, yeah, that's that's not the real in on right Yeah Well, that's the answer one we see an Instagram, but I mean maybe he's impossible to He did over-depleted here and he did you know suck out too much and maybe he sacrificed some size and some fullness Um, could be I mean could be That's a that's a real possibility I mean it's either one of the two he's he just sacrificed, you know he flattened out Or he just doesn't look like those Instagram photos in the first place Yeah Well he finished his seventh year he was seventh place And you know this is still you know he've run me at 20 by set You missed all of 2019 Sees and essentially he has a competed since Toronto and 18 So I mean this is I guess a good come back for him I mean I I think that I think he was just over-depleted here to be honest to be a conditioning look good to me Yeah, he didn't look like he belonged in the first call out to me because it was a tough first call out Yeah, yeah Alright, let's first let's go back to that comparison And we kind of like um, the vertical look Okay, we can do our tjoshio Front double is obviously Antoine doing Walker John Delorosa Hassan's off from going from the left Invalier Abe you got the wrong people in there. There's no Walker in there Oh, excuse me Max Charles I'm sorry I'm thank you. It is late tonight my mistake. So it's Antoine Valions Max Charles John Delorosa Hassan was off a Invalier and Patrick Moore Patrick Moore and Justin Justin So you see this first call Was this a good top seven that they called out were you happy with this group Yeah, I mean it was a good you know it was a good top seven minus Antoine who do you know why don't think really good right who would you have put in there instead? I I think they don't need to call seven. I think you can call you know six and figure it out from six. I just think it one you know He was any threat to in any way to the other six you know what I mean? He was not beaten that Olden His space with them on any any poses Right Now when you first saw this Hassan was in the middle Did you think that this is with the way it was gonna stay? Yeah, I thought it would be a done deal for that my thought was a done deal for when he came up by himself so And people were going crazy on the live past Yeah, I mean they were going crazy because he looked crazy And when they moved them off the middle but did that was that that was a bad call confusing to you It was a bad call yeah, wasn't couldn't no wasn't confusing to me. I was I was just I mean I wasn't confused. It's called a bad call All right Okay, I'm I'm asking your opinion. Obviously. This is just your opinion Yeah, I know me losses there too. What did me a loss? Huh? I heard I know me losses in an attendancy health max trials. What was me loss was me Let's go in crazy? No, I mean, I think me low start see the problem with met you know I mean, it is apples and oranges like everyone there has some type of strengths max has got tremendous density And muscularity in certain charts overwhelming crazy most muscular Mobile crazy hands on hips most muscular crazy abs You know side chest is borderline crazy, but he's got gaps of course, which is his back But standing from the front you know he looks you know really good You know also in that line up was Delaro's a too soft Um A lot of people thought Delaro's a mine of gotten the the nod you know on this one Which which a lot of people? No, I'm just saying that the speculation looking for judges or whoever you know Tyler I know Tyler man was the head judge He had these guys positioned as one and two after pre-tudging right. I mean the way it was set up Yeah, that's how it was positioned. Yeah It was that was that an unpopular decision in and from when you from where you was sitting with all the people I think the I'll tell you the the pre-jet and the two people who got the most response from the crowd because you're asking about was that a Popula decision so you're asking like what was a crowd response Right the two people who got the biggest like wow Was Hassan and just done I'm a quickly those people that people like sit up and say wow You know and they would say go through their mandatory as you say wow you know Um And nobody else I mean I wasn't saying nobody else but those were the two you know Yep, well he has that he were looking right now at the top four this was the final claw to pre-jet It was Patrick more John Delorosa in Valier and Justin Rodriguez. Yeah So obviously They were positioning these four as your top four yeah Hassan was not in there Okay, at that point yeah, no What in close now? I know a lot of people were were not happy about this because a lot of people felt Hassan deserve for the up there What was your thinking did you think that they would make it a change? In your estimation that Hassan looked different at the pre-jetging from the night show and you that much different Not one bit no So he should have been up there right from the beginning is what you said Which seemed like it was verified at the night Did just just just ask yourself this because if you want to dissect it Okay, this picture you're looking at is the reality of this picture is that leaving pre-jetging probably Delorosa Because he's next to and Valier are in the middle and they're battling out for which play state First in second first in second tell me where Delorosa beats Hassan was stuff on what shots Well, I don't know you were there you tell me Well, you just go by pictures and you tell me I send you a pretty you know mean Well, I I thought Hassan looked in saying you know I think you know to feather twides in and Oh the answer because I was I was there and I it's a retorting question and the second follow-up to that We had this in Valier really beat On what compound to bodybuilding and what what Aspect is he beating Hassan in I think the only thing that in his better at is probably just his width and and his structure in terms of size Would you go like that he's why yeah, he's he's wider And I think sometimes judges can get bamboo's will do that initially initially they work through that though Delorosa fights not a width contest But it is to a certain you come up Um, okay You could argue that because he's wide he doesn't even have enough muscle And and does not have enough because he is wide Yeah He looks like he on stage Yeah, so you want the actual great play right for a break down Ian has the same issue that Wolf had don't you think in a sense With figuring out fullness versus Conditioning Yeah, but Wolf could get peel sometimes well I mean both competed a lot more than Ian I'm just saying Ian seems to be suffering that same Delama of what do I do do I come in full and not as hard do I come in ripped and and fold it's a good You're right for tall guy for tall guy with a lot of width which he has It is hard to You always play that you always struggle with that because you're trying to fill that frame out Yeah, that's a big frame and You try to fill it out and you're not tight enough and then you try to like say shit, you know People said I was entirely enough and then you try to burn it down and then You get tight, you know really sharp and you say oh you know big enough Right and I mean that's a that's an impressive shot the side try so I'm putting up Which one he's got it? I don't I usually you can see these pictures. I don't know what you can't see But this is I have a side try set of Ian Valier up on on the screen Yeah, and he's very impressive in that shot Yeah, he looks good in the side tries He looks so there is obviously look the guys got some serious talent What did he miss the mark on at this show was a conditioning fullness? You tell me like if you work his coach what did he do wrong? Both he was like low flat and low watery I mean that's why that's why you get that disaster backshot I mean you can have a That that says at all nothing's popping and nothing's pulling is that in your estimation nerves Anxiety or is that just he didn't do his homework? No could be it it actually could be nerves because I mean you can be Pretty damn full and hard and if you suffer from anxiety And you worry about what you're gonna look like at a pre-judging It's called being washed out when you and that just means you need the full-booking or hard-looking Right, and then you need a pizza like that night you wake up with no stress the next day and have two beers and you like peel Right, and is that what you think is going on here? I mean because you're right He looks like he's flat and he's just this is a lack of sharpness there and he looks very unhappy in his face and I and like I said He's like one of the nicest guys like you know, I've ever you know, I've ever met He's even he loves body building the guy will talk body building all day one He just doesn't seem to enjoy the competitive process Yeah, and It seems to cause him a lot of stress and anxiety even by his own admission That's not me making this up, you know, he told me this on an interview. So That you know that that's a problem that some guy suffer with their whole career you know that oh Yeah That's not uncommon Yeah So I mean so I mean the packed people But the era the delts could be you know he's got the Brain sense and it's like it's a curse you know what I mean because you do look good in the lineup right I mean he does you can't think but lineup he's got wide shoulders this hips and narrow I wish you know He's got big shoulders You know for big guy he's got full enough legs But the knock is always gonna be you're not full enough. You know big enough right Let's let's talk about second place Justin Ryan Regus who's another guy who was not in the second position or first position after pre judging and a lot of people I don't we're talking that I don't You know what yeah a lot of people was thought he you know at least the life stream people that were watching thought hey here's the winner and He didn't he wasn't in first or second position after pre judging and then all of a sudden you know at the night show We saw that we see Justin winning or not winning but you know get actually getting a first place vote but Facing second Yeah Justin made Massage Improvements He actually was one point Chris off of off of winning the in at the night show he was one point by the end I I had him Second in pre judging and Probably first or second in the night show Now he looks like like a victim Martinez here doesn't he he's starting to get that even hit some of the same Victor twisting poses, you know in that front double by Yeah, I mean he he's got a small waist he's extremely wide Got a great The P L T Conditioned Oh or him like best condition head to toe Probably him in the show So that loan okay, right when you talk about body building Talk about either But you talk about condition or you talk about incredible flow with condition that needs for size I mean, so I mean he had a prerequisite to win the show which was the condition and decides Right, where is legs a little behind the upper body in your estimation Always are they always are but you know what look at the lineup he's in do you got people that that condition right there Just smoking a lot of people in the top first call out put the put in act double against that People say all shows the one from the back Right, no you're right I mean I was very I was very impressed with him because I thought when Hassan came out you know I thought okay Hassan is tied enough to win it. You know he's not peeled But he's got that high green tons of muscle when you flex it things go crazy. Yeah, and when just came out I said oh You know, I guess what they're gonna contrast here is true conditioning with size against mammoth size and fake not fake conditioning, but you know In fair conditioning Hassan compared to let's say Justin Before we get to Hassan let let's talk about John Delorosa who some people thought he was winning after pre-judging or at least he was in second place You know he's got a very balanced physique when I did my assessment of the new Pro you know a couple days ago before the show I said here's the guy who's one probably more approach Was then anyone in the lineup He's got really no flaws to his physique in the sense that he's not missing anybody If I he doesn't have it spectacular about it, but everything flows well When is he in shape he's dangerous because he wins shows because he's so balanced What was your assessment of on a one to ten scale of of all the John Delorosa's we've seen from one to ten Tenming the best which John Delorosa did we see too 6.5 for 6.5 Okay, so you're like You're saying this is not even anywhere near his best No, it's not tight enough Okay, and when you say tight enough I mean is he flat here or is he just not conditioned enough His body counts too high Okay He doesn't look like he's holding down much fatty, but he's he's got to accept the physique because he holds on to his weight really well You know, I find What would you have What's that? I mean he's got lute here. I mean in the perspective He don't have the right glove. He's got the left glove Right, right no you're right You're that's why I'm laughing you're right I'm gonna show the picture right there people go well I have two body bills why I helped you like and they both from Chicago and they said I can't get my right glue my right glue for some reason doesn't strike I said no that's because you're right Book has fat on it So you could you can have one glue having my fat and one doesn't okay This this picture is a good I mean I know the lighting's not the best, but There's not a lot of back detail there. John's had more back detail than that Yeah, is that because he's flat or is it because he's not lean? I don't see it any fat on his body really that much it just seems like he's like very like nothing's popping though Like no, maybe I mean Yeah, I mean He He was flat in the in the show and I mean he was he was not tied enough and I think that Probably was from being flat in the show I think so I don't think he really because you know you can tell when John's not in shape because his face is like he's got the big round face But he's he's pretty lean is face here you know at least for what I'm looking at Right, I mean let's look at his face His face is pretty pretty lean, you know So kind of well you look that's good news for John anyway because at least he knows he can correct this now You think we'll see John next week at in California? No You don't okay no What are you thinking is going to what you think he'll do Chicago? Which is brilliant Atlanta this year? Yeah, I mean he might do I don't know it's just total guessing but you know Yeah, he probably thought free judge and he's going to be in first and he didn't end up in seconds Right, I'm You always have to have those contingency plans, you know because these guys all want to be a limpia Yeah, it's one surprise Chris they didn't make a top three goes to the limpia Especially since they have this you know the stain show coming up they're going to give top three a limpia qualification really old All free these guys should you know gotten you know invites I thank you I'm looking Do anything I don't know you gotta have people in the lineup though, John Chris Don't try to be a limpia There's no call like I mean there are qualified people because you know you gotta get some more people into the white Let's talk about his on the side obviously we know you work with him so you of course you're biased But but at the same time let's talk about the narratives of his physique and and then what you would like to see improved Are you talking over me that much or is my microphone working? I'm I hear you but I'm trying to give you my I may be not hearing me I'm trying to just give you a assessment of of what the situation is that I want it Then I want then you can answer my questions what was Great about Hassan what was it could have been better Great about him was the biggest guy in the lineup by a lot great about him was a By far the best side tricep probably the best side chess probably the best back double after jett or maybe Justin's Most musculars just notki socks off cross-straded quads not quite lean enough Okay, so you feel that he could have been tighter. Okay, that's that's honest. Yeah, let's look at that side chest for a minute. Hold on Subscribe side chest not many guys. No, I had a side chest like that full packs you know big arms decent enough you know hamstrins from the side We see better than we always compare them for Paul the mail, you know because he looks a little like him we see better than Paul the mail Do you think Paul looked like that video I sent you? No, Paul was afraid you know Yeah, but this guy's different level Okay, this guy's a real deal Do you think that the judges look he definitely moved he moved up at night? I mean in the finals He wasn't in the top four at the end of pre-judging and now he finishes in fourth year so The judges definitely rewarded something that maybe they missed at the pre-judging Do you think that he could have that the reason maybe he didn't win the show was because he wasn't at his best by your own admission That's just this is his best by far It's his best by far, but it's we know that he can be tighter than this you know he can be tighter than this Okay, even though he I know you're saying you're saying you you think he's You know how this works conditioning win show so if he's not 100% Condition maybe the judges are not don't want to reward something that they feel is not Perfect yet We've seen it with other very good competitors that they've held them to a higher standard and didn't let them win shows Flex Wheeler was a guy that they made really bring his best to that USA before they ever gave him that Victor you know outside of outside of just in I mean he's harder than and and he's harder than and Delorosa by a lot by a lot Keep if you're not keep flowing through the pictures. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna give you a Back double bless that thing He feels as he feels like Jason low out of his mind. No Is he hard enough for the monumental amount of size that he has absolutely yes? It's how they bodybuilding context But you know And vibe People who are You know either gigantic or like black-doubt condition I think this was a I think the pre-after pre-genie was it was a Travesty that he was not in the top four I'll give you that I think that the the reason he did win the show was because he wasn't his best and and like like yeah I mean you even said Justin Rodriguez you know in your estimation was probably back there right Because of his condition Condition Right Justin Rodriguez had the best condition Right, so but I you know you and I know conditioning win shows. I mean we see it all the time That a surprise show How's that but how's that put that back in condition compared to ants? I don't I don't I don't I can't explain it Do you think that Eam got got a gift is that what you're saying because of you know that the second place it in the hind hunter and in Tampa two week or three weeks ago I would not have in first place so You know I think from a purest bodybuilding standpoint in terms of muscles La blah blah blah blah blah guys condition shape flow I thought it would go down to the wire to Hassan and Justin and And I Be surprised because Justin was you know very very condition That you know people are in the panel who are making the real decision not just for an outer pinions like me We would say like you know I love the condition and just it for Yeah, yes your sons like her sons Yeah, most muscle sure Well, I don't think just Dave Dave does Delorosa or or and yes, no look like that No, they've had different physics look I think that has this is my sense look I'll give you my assessment I'll give you my assessment my assessment I wasn't there Was that I think of anyone in the top five I think who's Thomas suffer has got the most Well, I shouldn't say has got some of the best potential of Anyone that lineup to go to the Olympia and be of Olympia contender Okay Because he's got the muscle size He's got the crazy you know separation in the muscle He's got the flow to his body. He doesn't have any gaps. He really has no weaknesses But I think that like this might I believe that They're holding them to a higher standard because of that because they feel that he could have been later and if he brings that level leanness to the next show I think what he said is you're gonna do california next week The is that thing ago And if he break comes in You know a couple pounds lighter. I mean he should blow the line up away don't you think I'm sure you get a torch room. I'm sure you get a torch room for a week, right? You know Best again Well, you're gonna put them I'm sure you can do cardio and low carbum and everything like that and I'm sure That's what they want to see they want to see tight, right? Yeah, I'm just playing like I'm just trying to be explicit about the idea like when you look at that on shot And look at the peckstrations and the crustaceans and the quads I'm saying okay Where is Deloroses you can't say they have different physics because one How son's twice a size of Delorosa and he's twice a size of Ian So it feels guys don't even have of the detail that he has Explain you explain to me other than oh they want to see him like feel like feel he Just to get to the Olympia to get to the Olympia Well, they know there's another show next week. They know we're gonna see him again If he comes in better next week and he destroys everyone He'll be the talk of the town he'll be the He'll be the guy that everyone's talking about going into the Olympia is the guy that you know who can Really mess with the top five someone that we were waiting to show up and and shock everyone, right? I mean That adds another level of excitement as far as I'm concerned You know That's how I think they're seeing it, you know, so we'll see what happens. Let's let's talk about max trials Because Max brought a really good look to the stage. I know he's working with me a lot now and I know Milus is Was very adamant about the fact that he felt he should have been higher. What what was Milus saying did Milus think match in a one I think he thought he should have been I don't know if he thought he should have won but he was really upset that At the placing they got You know in these Max has got a most muscular and a sight just an an ab shot and hands on hips most muscular deaths Beyond fabulous Superdense super-striated Of course the knock against him is like separation hamstring detail back the hill so You have to play if you're judging what a max of weaknesses versus deliroses weaknesses You know someone else is because Because they everyone has weakness this line up His max from behind and he's seen him yeah, I mean max is certainly not harder than Anyone from behind yeah, I mean in terms of like I would please He's just to put he's just tied his value or put him in back down Yeah, I think they're all you know you can you can say a value air max you can say a son they're all pretty no one really was like dry Chris except for the Justin Rodriguez right? True, I'm totally hundred percent Absolutely, so they were everywhere and I think that's where you're and then I understand where your frustration is your frustration It's like well no one was really that hard so like you know why is his son being held to a higher standard right Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean You're not going to get up against you know how he chopin Now and also it's bite by my my theory if if Conditioning when shows you're saying well then why didn't Justin Rodriguez win the show Right, I mean that's a point is like I can always just You know Period I agree with that if condition and win shows you you know then Justin should have won and just and should have won right and let's Unless too small and Justin had Added a lot of muscle so you could make the argument that He's big enough and you can clearly make the argument that he's you know peeled enough In the realm that condition win shows that he was the one or the show That makes sense Yeah, no you he wasn't press it. Let's let's talk about Patrick more who is in the top four after pre judging a lot of people said out It's guys top four and then he winds up out of the top five and it pretty after pre judging what what happens with him? Let's let's pull a picture him obviously work with him as well. So it's it's tough, you know You know you it's like your competitors swapped places, you know almost after pre judging What's the what's the what's the greatness and what's the not so great? about Patrick more in the show Super conditioned head to toe Yeah Super conditioned just needs more muscle Civil as a yeah And you know it did the weird if you look at comparison shots with him and people you know I goes right to him In terms of flow shape condition In many cases, you know if you pull up a comparison like a side right stuff or side chat You know he's got lots of bells and whistles. He's got the camp frame from the side the glutes and hands crazy ab explorations He's got glutes but Yeah Real glutes not just you know So you're saying more and I agree with you. I think he just needs more size Was that was it a mistake? I To after the Arnold we said the same thing we said we said Patrick needs more size Was it a mistake for him to maybe to compete again or you know And see get that kind of physique that doesn't matter he grows into his you know shows Because he's not he's not pushing the envelope, you know and That mean He can grow you know the irony is that he can grow you know I mean So what is he in his your now see shut it down for the rest of the year Chris Hell next week and then after calville probably take the r-off Okay, he's not really Have a hat is when he went from the first New York pro he did where he got 13th to jump to the winning the cal pro the next year Yeah Yeah Who in this light of do you feel that was not what? In terms of condition him and Justin Rodriguez with the two who were you know quote the most condition You know, they weren't any lacking body parts They were in terms of condition. You know some people have like all the peel from the front and soft from behind Or from behind the little soft They weren't tremendous shape those two When you uh look at this right When you look at this shell as a whole How would you rate it on one to ten? I mean it was a good show just because I'm critical of the like the you know people in the show Doesn't mean it wasn't a great show I mean that You know the ups You know and but value still very good body bill they're died Delores a very good body bill max Charles is a very good body bill there and and the list after people who did make tops Sixth people outside the effort either good body bill is potentially really good body bill So I mean it was it was a Competitive it was more competitive than two weeks ago and damn for five weeks ago whenever the You know more yep Yeah, I want to bring up one more name a Phil Klohaar who I worked with You know was fourth and Tampa a couple weeks ago Brunnan I thought what was a much better look here in New York To New York pro and he winds up in tenth He was actually looking he was lowered the net after pre judging and he moved up but Let's pull this picture Was he overlooked Yeah, he was all looked big he was all looked out he's big and he's hard and he's legit hard He's not like you know He was in very good shape let me see if that picture justifies it Yeah, it does justify look at the shoulders arms pecks and abs on that I mean that's He was very impressive Yeah, I was very surprised and he but I know he was very upset with with the way placed and that you know I talked them there. I'm a great guy to give someone like a like a consolation speech like And tell don't don't don't get too upset about it and come back better because you know I've experienced some a lot of Poor placing is in my time, but maybe I didn't deserve some I probably did but some I didn't and so you know I could I had to take it on the chin and you know if that's what bodybuilding's all about right? I mean sometimes you you do great and it comes out and you're you're happy with the placing and sometimes You know it just doesn't Somehow you missed I don't know in the lineup. I don't know why you know maybe wasn't known I don't know not at much of the household name It happens though it really happens He's very This is all time best I thought yeah, yeah, I thought it was to it work really hard I mean really hard and you know it was it he's another guy who it's very hard to get that balance between Fullness and conditioning with him and I really thought we we nailed it pretty well here So you know he's gonna he's gonna come back better and better He's gonna keep improving and we'll see him again. I think in Chicago, which is really Atlanta That show and hopefully maybe he'll get a bit he'll get some more love at that show but I I's nuts, you know when you get overlooked you get more attention You know brought to you Then when you warrant and so then the judges are ready to see you the next time they see you They're like oh, that's the guy that we we maybe we over look Let's take a better look at him and a lot of times those guys will move up and actually become future names, you know in the in the lineup so It happens He's like Early like maybe 40 or some of that Like 30 spring chick yeah, he's not he's not like he's not like in his 20s or anybody's You can't tell because he got that age of space, you know He's gonna have one right one space Trick and he should continue to compete and all the shows for the last of the year of the show Yeah, he's got a definitely do Chicago so I know that that's I don't know what's I don't think California is on the on the table but definitely Chicago is It's expensive to go to these shows too, Chris, you know it's it's not like It's $100 to watch pre-judging finals from the back You did Really Should I I didn't even know you were going should it tell me what I do you would have a press best General's mission Let's let's talk about the the 2012 were you impressed with Bol Luis the one Yeah, he's really good Yeah, thick Really really good side chas really good side tricep um I think he was tighter he was better five weeks ago when George Peterson beat him Right and and to some degree he was He He could have walked away in second place here too. I mean Jason low came in just Inside out upside down jizzled and hardcore What what makes Bol Luis's physique Impressive to you like obviously the you know the judges like the piece though I super super appealing looking side tricep inside chest um He just looks really round ball guy on the those two shots His back Double is pretty darn complete. I think it looked more complete because it might have been a little bit leaner five weeks ago when he Book tremendous also When he was second to George Peterson He doesn't really have weaknesses He could stand with the vacuum in the lineup which is impressive Yeah, his most muscular he his arms look gargantuan He's just he's got real dense looking muscle you know what I mean And And he's he's got you know he's got the lat he's he's in condition Right He now he was impressive. I was very impressed with him And you know I think that you know he's he's gonna be a guy that's gonna get better and better and you know He's like he's like a workhorse to that guy. You know I call the the workhorse guys It's just like you know just keep plugging away plugging away plugging away I mean and He's still there you know. Let's talk about your guy Jason low moving up from classic Which is you know not an easy thing to do to the two 12 division something that we only really we heard a lot of George Peterson we heard about Key on Pearson doing it Jason low is like always on the quiet we don't really hear much about him and then he shows up at a show and he impresses the hell out of people Talk to me about the decision to move The you know the decision was moved to move was made Probably think Two or three years ago. I think when he did the Arnold and I've been coming to my hotel room and and who's doing classic day, right Right and it was days to cover the glutes Right and blutes and ham from nuts and let's go that's too bad And then you know he's doing classic but I had him ticked all the like oh hit a most most kiss and they're on Master most most kiss so well he does anybody like I'm gonna hit it anyway Yeah, you know or I'd say Hit a side try stuff they don't ask for side try stuff. I know I know but I want So um You know that's that the That's the way that wacky shot He want to give power that I'm done in the open he would have won to open and that with the if conditioning rise on that one Yeah, that looks like and he fell Put that up next the hands back Crazy he Jason low is one of these guys that like you don't think he has the genetics to do it and then as he's gotten bigger His his physique has gotten like better. I think Sometimes guys I think they classic is the way to go because it is only you can make the way but sometimes people just look better bigger you know Yeah, he does yeah He looks better bigger He was inspired by and so the classic journey for him Dave the interesting story The back half of that is he came to the Arnold's one time and He was doing the Arnold classic and the the classic division And he was just Chisel that he was in my hotel room and he was so chisel to make the way like like this, you know and Raphael Vrandeo was there and Luke Sandout was there and I was there and we watching him pose and we he was put on we were just memorised by the detail Yeah, and He looks at like something funny like you know Screw that clap, you know he encouraged him to do you know to do the show That's cool. Yeah, I guess they became I don't know if he became really tight, but I know they became very friendly And it was Luke who drove him you know that the end to Abandoned classic and say you know you know and guy because if you if you look at his Instagram, it's I pb I'm just quite broke who I told I told Jason Jason I watch all your workouts. I mean I don't watch all of them, but They're like here I am diving and doing 140 dumbbells, you know, he's very strong. He's very hard to work That's a strong looking physique right there You could tell he trains heavy. Yeah, he's got a rugged physique for sure for sure now You know congratulations him. I think I love to see him on an Olympia stage again So guys, I think he can really hold it on a get some let's talk about let's talk about classic physique though because We had another jump Logan Franklin who was a men's physique guy for years Made the jump to classic in the any one no and I always tend to be pictures and I and I've no Watching his progress and I'm like this guy looks really good took him but it's good two years to really grow into this class But and he know he told me he was gonna make the jump and this was gonna be the big year Obviously got the ladle on the business of the whole COVID thing, but I mean he he really is I mean from this is the first man's physique guy That I really so jump make the elevator make that jump and not only just jump but make a successful jump Get no heat he he looks good. He's he's like I To move out minute and I start on stage. I said oh he's like the Chris from step b version You know, I mean that His legs aren't quite as good as bomb status details don't as good but it's structurally that similar, right? Well, he's improving. It's like he's making his improvements as you know in front of our eyes because He he's a perfect example of like a guy who is a young young guy who didn't have the muscle to to be A bodybuilder yet so he went into into men's physique and then he didn't but and then when the class came out He wasn't really yet ready for that but then he grew into that now he's a class again We yeah, I can I don't I can fully expect possibly to see him as if as an open bodybuild at some point. He's he's very driven in that sense He might not just stay here Look at that shot first right. Look at that Arnold shot Yeah, let me say a great shot That three quarters back. Yeah, he looks good. Look at the glue. He's good. He looks fresh Right, fresh muscle after we can class it can be already burnt out on stuff But in classic and you're doomed Yeah But I'm just saying look I mean that's a great great. I mean he he knows how to position his body. He's you know He looks like a seasoned guy. He's been bodybuilding his whole life. You know, and that's You don't see that that are often so I think you know he's look I like when I see guys that are gonna add fresh I guess you could say blood to the the divisions the new divisions you know and so I'm I'm excited to see him on stage. How does he do against to bring on an ansley and and Chris bumps that and those guys I mean can he hold his own anything You know I think I think Not quite yet. You know what I mean this is something in terms of You know to me to me he looks okay, if he looks like a very good classic bodybuilder which he is Yeah, and bumps that pass As a regular bodybuilder. So that's where I know he's saying yeah, I don't get something he's there He's at another level. Yeah, he's at the level of the same thing with Briona you know Briona could pass us a brick 12 guy and that goes for same thing with George Peter somebody was in the classic You know, I mean I always said on this show like well, he's not really classic at all Yeah, you know he's bodybuilder So I think Logan has like Traditional like golden age Classic lines, but if he had to stand between bumps dead in Briona. I think they have muscle maturity And they're they're actual density would Sure, you know, I was exposed what he doesn't have yet Yeah No, I agree I agree I wanted to bring up I don't know if you watch the whole is you watch the whole show Yeah I watched I watched the 2012 and the I think it girls Of course not Nicole Graham I got I got a pull a picture of I'm really really impressed with that But since you're probably gonna see around safe. So let's see you'll see you're here how good a shade These figure I'll just keep getting dead or and better and better What a great what a great look there I think she's gonna be super dangerous that the at one be a this year She's looking at the canvas Lewis yep Crazy I Can't see I actually see she's actually hitting poses here Did she see this I'll look at which I thought she was a woman's physique better first because she's got such a great physique Look at this look at this I'm looking at the pictures on the NPC news online look at this shot With the heels on Chris She can take women's physique yeah, right if you wanted to I'll find his that Yeah, she she's got the luck She can she can definitely be due crossover if she wanted to with one point Chases never yeah, yeah, I like I like when people have fun with it That was great so she she won figure the raining miss Olympia The Tila Santiago she won the bikini pop a picture of her cute for a little love It's always cool when you see it like a miss Olympia or miss her Mr. Olympia like a better in a right in like a New York pro show like a regular show Isn't it just it's great for the fans you know the fans actually did It's sometimes it's such that these fans only get to see these Olympia champs at the At the what's the look all the Olympia now they can she actually comes in doesn't near crush is no reason to have to do that Except the Odyssey using is a warm up and that's great you know and glad that they some people are not afraid to put the Put it on a line I ran into London Murray there I heard she was there. Yeah, what what did she did you talk to? Yeah, I said, Linda I said, you know you want to be only persons I said you the most when people see you you were one of the You must get all the time the same question which you might find a fan service like Either how old do you now because she looks so good for her yeah, whatever that is she can be caused the 60 right Yeah 58 I know she was close to 60 I knew it she's amazing she doesn't age she's like Linda Wood White remember Linda Wood White Linda Wood White was the youngest looking 70 year old You know Right she's wait until she turns 80 she'll still look for she'll look the same she doesn't age then you at all Let's talk about Well You broke up the opposite sorry Let's talk about Ari Sithia who won the men's physique Did you see him yeah We press Yeah, you are okay Yeah, very impressive well deserved Yeah, it's about deserved you know I mean it's it's funny those That class usually goes to like I mean if you're in Strictacular you know the best condition usually come on on top I think this is like he announced he this is the fifth time he's gone to the Olympics qualified for Yeah, he's always in there he's always in there he's very consistent I am always reporting on him on a muscle morning to He gave a very good genuine genuine Speech about making it back to the Olympia you know people like it from microphone and the faces Yeah, you know, I would like to thank my sponsors and my parents and all my turn You know, it was just pretty much for Well, that he came out the winner and it came across a little speech which I don't think he was prepared to give and you know Tark Being excited to go back to the Olympic this time in the fact that you know this idea that You know he's no genetic freaking his mind that he just worked work work work work work is made it When to show every yet to get to the Olympia and it just expands the idea like you know if I can conquistelf doubt and A accomplish a goal like this with my body to make it to Olympia then I can accomplish anything it was a really Excellent impromptu speech which made it you know impressive Rather than some pre-planned packaged Right It's nice when people can you know Our appreciative of where you know where they are, do you think? I guess that's the best way to put it Great way, put it. He knows he's a totally aware of the idea that I just won the show I'm going back to the Olympia people don't get to do that. It's a huge accomplishment You know at the same time, you know come come across not We come come across Appreciate it because not because it sounds good but because you actually are it was a great speech He probably don't think so I'm glad you did that that's important right I'm glad you do Let's talk about women's bodybuilding which they added to this event Milo Ash winning that we can pretty spectacular Yep, I see that I you know I was trying to figure out what happened with New York Pro obviously Steve Weinberg usually holds the New York Pro Up in New York obviously New York was was a no go so they moved it to Tampa which look like it looks like Tim Gardner took it over almost you know It was like almost like Weinberg passed it off to them. I don't know if that's the case or not Steve wasn't there. I know that probably you didn't want to travel. I don't blame him and Sometimes him got you know wings of strength involved with that with the event and they added women's bodybuilding Obviously which is good because they need qualifiers. They need to qualify somebody's women for the Olympia obviously so Milo wins here she qualifies For the Olympia obviously I like to see you know Ravansy like like someone win by default She's she's really good. I think it's a good representative of the of some more good together in a Olympia stage. You know come December I agree with you. She's got Good shape which I spoke to Lander ironically about vote, you know the change in the shift bodies and female bodybuilding compared to 25 But she has good good flow good shape and I think that's a huge prerequisite for You know being doing really good in these winning these pro shows including going to the left So you want to have a You want to have people off there with good shape. Yeah, and let's the finish it off with Rachel Adams who won the arrangement of Rachel Daniels excuse me who won the women's physique and I I live in the like her physique to she is really Pretty peels Who would a one in a contest between Rachel Daniels and Milo Ash What do you think I don't know you tell me I wasn't there Would have been close right Yeah, what have I closed Somebody like I'm you know I'm trying to I'm trying to lay down my case for combining divisions I'm never gonna let off that you know I they'll never do it, but I keep putting it out there and saying just combine them combine them combine them combine I'm cold Miss Olympian women's physique division Brand champion Miss Olympia put them together Just do it guys Those Yeah, well, you know We're we're kind of running out of time and I know you're running out of steam so we're not gonna We're not gonna we're gonna do another show on the North American championships Maybe you and I'll do a show during the week and analysis of a breakdown in that We'll look at the pictures we'll pull up some videos stuff again. It was such a humongous show Gary you did had broke the bank on this one and I don't know how he did it He told me himself because I didn't think there was gonna be a big turnout I think they got a big a turnout that they never got and I think there was over 1500 people there Chris Competing this week. I think there was like 600 bikini competitors alone You believe that I can believe that and real Who said by building it who said that did that you know the no one's competing? Obviously with all the gyms that were closed Chris for like six months It's amazing how many people were able to find the place to work out Refresh Yeah, I tell you the resourcefulness of people in train right we're crazy We'll find the place anywhere to try Yeah everyone I know found a place to train with there's an exception of maybe three three of four people who Move to a transition from a commercial jam to building your own Jims and they are garages and they ended up you know Garages to the extent that they say god. This is great. I'm never gone back to each Jim You know, Chris I love the idea of going to the gym when I was when I was competing But the truth is if I was let's say you and I we're in the era right now this cold I mean I would have spent every nickel I had to build the best Jim in You know in my house that I could possibly do Because it was that important to me, you know at the time it was like I wasn't saving money for like to buy a house I was the body building was way more important than I would have spent every penny you know To get the equipment I needed and you know when I would have bought all freeway stuff at the time because I didn't care about machines You know you don't really need machines machines or a luxury item don't you think Of course, if you have a power apple you have a bench you can do everything right? Yeah, yeah, you know what I always say You can with a flat bench and a bar and a couple sets of dumbbells You can train all the body parts if you create them yeah, look I see these guys in jail training The the resourcefulness of what they do there and and these guys have unbelievable physics When people cry to me that they don't have a you know a cable crossover machine You don't have a hammer shins chest machine. I laugh Right We spoiled this oil this oil now. That's the truth Look if you're a body builder in today's world With viruses closing stuff down and now you know that they they will quarantine and close gyms You better have backup in your house you better you better get a set of heavy heavy bar bells and dumbbells and having this backup because You know unless you have someone who owns you know someone owns a gym Because otherwise you're gonna be you're gonna be screwed the royal one and if too risky if you're a top level body, you gotta have access All right Chris, what do you even need tomorrow morning and a few hours maybe use it see it's one by the parents six thirty Have you noticed that the travel was easier or harder with this go home COVID thing going on Oh, it was easier but you leave the airport David you get on a plane packed with people Really, it's it's not funny Sold out But it's I so there's no separation and there's no there's no six feet separation on plane You Who it is now now?

We'll see you next week you

Happy Tuesday here at Muscle in the Morning on Day of Columbus. Today is July 17, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. As they say tough times, it will make tough people. And after more than two decades in the industry, I can honestly say that I haven't met too many people, tougher than 2018, thank Hoover Pro, to 12 winner, Mama D'Aurah. Two weeks after his huge win north of the border, the former two-time Kennedy National champ, released a new photos, that give his fans a good look at what a truckload of post show carbs and water can do to a body. In case you missed it, we did a great interview with D'Aurah a few weeks ago. That's a must-watch TV. That is new winners interview is up as well at the RXMuscle.com website. One of the worst parts about being an entrepreneur is the constant itch in the back of your brain. It tells you, someone out there is probably working harder than you right now in this very moment. But when you're putting in the kind of work that women's physique stand out, shruronic a hint in is, there isn't too much time left in the day to sit around and worry about what everyone else thinks. For the weekend we saw a team Henten drop a short clip from one of their latest back training sessions as the potential championship threat starts to head into phase two of her Olympia prep. As far as we can tell, Henten looks like she's on a mission to make the judges call her name when they finally sit down to announce the first call out. And if she can manage to get it in by to the party, you'd never know which way the score cards might swing once things start to get rolling. According to the Ancient Japanese code of the samurai, being loyal, courageous and honorable, were the big three personality traits you needed if you wanted to be a warrior. I don't know about you guys, but I sure would hate to be on the other side of the battlefield if I knew I had a face off against women's physique superstar Jennifer Taylor. Last year's Olympia runner-up has been in full-scale prep mode for the better part of three months now, as she gears up for a return trip to the Oralines Arena to come back and take care of a little unfinished business. Even with last year's top two finish inter-pocket, this year's lineup feels like an entirely different animal in more ways than one. So if she really wants to make that final jump up to championship status, now it would be the time to buckle up and get ready for a long fight. The race to fill the vacated fitness Olympia crown is probably one of the most under-reported stories in the entire bodybuilding industry right now. But nine weeks from now, I'm sure a long time veteran Bethany Wagner wouldn't mind one bit if she was asked to step in and fill that vacancy. Late last week, Wagner was spotted knocking out some high volume upper body action out at her home base in Bridgewater, New Jersey, where she's been out there training like a complete animal in hopes of becoming the next woman in a long line of generational champions to earn the title, Miss Fitness Olympia. From the minute she stepped onto the division, Wagner has been one of the truly elite fitness talents in the pro league. So come September 15th, don't be surprised if you end up hearing her name announced as the next in a line to take over in this suddenly wide open fitness division. I remember sitting in the press pit last year looking at the classic physique Olympia line up and thinking to myself that the race for the top two literally felt like a coin toss. And believe you me, no one knows how close that race was better than 2018 runner up. Chris Bumstedt, with his second career Olympia now less than three months away, Bumstedt and his team looked like they're pulling out all the stops as they start to head down the back half of this year's prep. According to my people close to the source, the 20-something superstar feels as good as he possibly can at eight weeks out from the biggest show of his career. And if he shows up even 2% better than he was a year ago, that might be all takes to get him over the hump and solidify his status as the new king of the division. That does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the morning. On day, Columbus reminding you to always be true to your passions and they should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Food Act Road. There's 30-year-in-a-row and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car pothar. We've got three and four grams of neck carbs and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Polumbo and today is Friday, August 7th, 2020. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. According to the New York Times, best-selling offer Jim Collins, CEOs who have what he calls level five leadership ability is one of the primary drivers behind the sustained success of any great company. And a bodybuilders are the CEOs of their own corporation that makes level five leadership especially important, which is why someone like Henry Peer and Nose bet at the top of his third-air game for so long. Throughout his career, we've seen Henry take a consistent and principled approach to success and if you just look back at his track record, the results speak for themselves. Success and leadership started at the top, which is something that Henry's understood from day one and it's also the reason why I think his best days are still ahead of him. I want to stick with my organizational cultural theme for a minute and talk about the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people, which is one of the most important things you can do in business and bodybuilding, or just in life in general. Surrounding yourself with the right people who have the best interest of you and your company in mind is the key to being successful in the long run. Just ask Dwayne Quamina. A few years ago, Dwayne was just an upcoming guy who hadn't even made a blip on the radar from a bodybuilding standpoint. Today, he's a former top-tenal Olympian who looks like he's training back in that direction again in a big way. You can't go from good to great without having a great team behind you. If he's going to keep his arrow trending upward, the other people who are on his bus with him will be a big part of that reason why. For savvy investors, bear markets signal a time to be aggressive because they present the best opportunity to load up on assets that should have a steady increase in value as the markets turn around. In considering how turbulent the bodybuilding market is at the moment, it feels like the perfect time to invest in an upside-guide-like carot-bazzo. The way I see it, carot's in a perfect position to be a high riser in the 2012 division. We have shows getting canceled left and right in athletes are being forced to pull out from one reason or another. That opens the door for someone like him to take advantage of a golden opportunity. Since he's getting closer and closer to being able to leverage some of his capital, wouldn't be surprised if he turned himself into a hot commodity down the stretch. As far as American military history is concerned, there are very few men who've ever had a reputation like the late General George S. Patton. The time was famous for being absolutely relentless and is actually quoted as saying, my motto in battle is, go forward. So if I were staring down the barrel of the biggest fight of my career, the way Chris Bumstead is, I think channeling my inner pen wouldn't be a bad place to start. For the most part, it feels like Chris is already marching pretty steadily towards his first title defense, which is exactly what you want to see from someone in his position. But it's only August, which means the battle is just beginning. So that means the motto from here on out needs to be two words, go forward. And that does it yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Day Palombo here with an R-X muscle news update. The Mr. Olympia Classic physique. Pre-judging just let out and it looks like Chris Bumstead will be making it three in a row. I was pretty convinced after pre-judging that Bumstead not only looked the best on stage, but the judges just seemed to favor him at every single call out. He was always in the middle. His structure is so big. He takes up so much space compared to some of these other guys on stage that it almost looks like he's a giant among children on stage. And that's what classics about it's about proportion. At his height, he holds a lot of muscle on his frame. And the guys that are like right next to him are short guys. Terrence Ruff and Brianna Ansley. And that just gives Bumstead such an advantage over these guys because of the fact that he is so wide and so tall that everyone's eyes just go to this guy. I remember when I used to watch Cory Everson back in the day. And I remember when she would come out there saying she had the same effect. She just, her structure was so big and she was tall and she just, you couldn't take the riser off her. I think Bumstead is clearly a solid first place here. I don't think that there's absolutely unanimous. There's no doubt in my mind. The competition really now is for second third, fourth, fifth because that's where it's close. And it looked like Terrence Ruff and was going to be the guy in second place for most of the pre-judging. And then right at the end it seemed like Brianna Ansley really came on and searched. And I noticed the Weinberg had him in the middle next to Bumstead. And that to me tells me that I think he's getting a little bit of a nod toward the end of the pre-judging as the guy who's in that second position. But I think between Ruff the Easle and Brianna Ansley we're going to see a battle again tonight because I don't think it's decided yet. It was very, very close between those guys. They match up really well. Brianna's got, I think more density to do is back Ruff the Easle. I thought could have been a little bit drier but you know, it's hard to tell, you know, sometimes exactly, you know, you know, grainyness, I'm not sitting in the front row there. But I have to tell you that those guys match up really well with each other. Brianna obviously's got the amazing biceps, Ruff the Easle with the tremendous, you know, presentation. Those guys, I'd like to see a caught just those two guys to be honest with you. I think that's what they got to do tonight. If they do that I think we'll be able to tell better because with the problem is when Chris bumps did's in it, you almost can't look at those two guys and they're on either side of bumps that said they're not next to each other. Although they were next to each other, you know, few rounds out there. But I want to see in the middle those two guys go head to head with each other because they are matching up really, really well. Now, one of the surprises was, and I have to give, you know, complete, you know, really props to Steve Weinberg. He worked these guys and you know what, he could have just made a quick call. And I don't think we would have seen what we saw here at the end and that last call up because a lot of guys work their way up. Errs, a calisinski really, really impressive. You know, he wasn't in that group initially and they moved him, moved him and finally he moved into that, you know, what I would call maybe the fourth position, you know, that seems to be up for grabs. Also, Ramon Roka from Brazil who works with Chris Asido also in that fourth position potentially. So those two guys battling out, and then of course you got Alex Cabernero who is, you know, probably has the nicest shape on stage, but not as much muscle as some of these other guys. You really, there's no flaws in the guy. The guy's conditioning is perfect. So I think it's going to be Cabernero, Errs, Calisinski, and then Ramon Roka battling for that fourth spot. And that would be fourth, fifth, sixth, I guess. And so, you know, it was really a good classic physique pre-judged. And you know, after last nights, you know, men's open, everything is kind of like not as good because we're used to seeing these big monsters on stage and then we go down to classic, which is beautiful. But you know, you still, you keep saying, maybe we need to see more muscle on these guys, but then you forget it is about proportion and these guys can only weigh so much. So I say, Bumstead, a clear first place here, Breon and Ruff Diesel battling for second and third and then Errs, Calisinski, Ramon Roka, the new guy, so to speak on the block with Alic Cabernero, who's a seasoned veteran battling for that fourth, fifth, sixth position. What'll happen? I don't know. We'll find out later tonight. I say Bumstead is a shoe-in for the win.

J1 j was like 274 in 2004 Olympia. I correlated with like Jay's shows So also you know you're off was born this day rich piano You know you're sitting right inside died on the 25th of August So We have to give him a Two years now or so or I think it's been food. Yeah, I don't even know what was a cause Now there's no cause of death Well this is cause we just don't know it yeah, there's rich and durian There was a rich we competed I miss rich. I really I really liked him a lot of get a lot. I didn't hang out with very like that But you know we talked to on occasion I interviewed him. I just I liked him a 30 I liked this break Maybe seven stuff if it was a little attractive but self-destructive but you know I liked the fact that he was able to innovate all this stuff himself all this stuff that was all the slogans and t-shirts and You know all the stuff you do with YouTube everyone copies what he does now You was he was really a pioneer in this episode People don't realize he edited his own video Did you know that? He would shoot all this video during the day they have all this video and then he'd go back to his room at night At these ex-bos or go back to his house and he would edit like like for hours and I believe I know I'm an editor too. You know, so It doesn't take three seconds like black when he's to be when I used to work for black men He would be like We would she we would be to show right Chris for like what hours now was like Eight ten hours 12 hours to the day back we literally walk out the door back when the video going up I'm like First of all it takes like at that time It was probably took an hour to download the video alone to the computer then you had it render it you had a you know Yeah, I mean it was like it it was a long process, you know, and that was sometimes I was doing something to build concept I was doing it I'm like Steve you think we think we can maybe get some of the eat first before we before I just spent 12 hours at a body Get just put it up just put it up. I'm like Steve it doesn't go it's like a Zillian megabyte you're gigabyte You don't push your button and it's up there just put it up don't even added it just put it up like But I Oh my god, these people are so close Did you you saw the article I sent you right that they fired the packer? Ignuse yeah, I think news been there a long time Yeah, no more catching kills no more you know, it's it's funny that he had you know when you said that Dave I was I was wanting to Like throw him under the bus Because you know a bitter that he kicked a road now and we let me I like them within 35 seconds of finding out that you know Robins supposedly break this bank robber And so I was trying to be critical, but you know, he did a pretty good job with the Olympian I mean when all said I think I'm money they raised the money then You know at the end of the day he raised the money and and If nothing else You know that was something great For the for the bodybuilders, you know, were the other classes too I mean I don't think he was you know the disconnect goes like you know the speeches of like Of him and rarer our for bodybuilding they felt so like Like created you know like like like he was reading a script because how could he have like this Passion for bodybuilding When you've never been around to their in it or you know, it's not like I think you like the belt Yeah, I mean he he may like it look he inherited a mass over there and It got messier messier the whole am i you know thing and you know, it was then the man then magazines It matter anymore and I mean what it's like it's like you're steering the Titanic You know as as Ramon puts that Dad to the bottom notion If you're you're magazine if you're running a magazine you know Franchise so to speak you know it's not a good it's not a good business to be and into the smart No one reads you know The only equivalent is When he bought the magazines at the absolute highest price ever right Because that's the only reason Joe sold them it's like I told you about the real estate guy before we came on the year the only What reason this guy I know Just sold this you know building that just so spectacular I'm like why why? Why simply so really when someone gives you a gigantic jack? You can't say you can't say no. Yeah, so that's where that's saying You know I got no further was too big to refuse There was yeah, you know the same thing I have snake you I have snakes first that I you know what you like I don't want to sell but people have made me offers I couldn't refuse and I said what if the snake dies tomorrow What am I crap like I take $10,000 for a snake or something like that? No, so the point is him buying the magazines is like Someone going out and buying a 60 unit apartment building and then within three years coats as you know You just can't rent these anymore right just pack them up. Yeah, so you know Nobody's gonna read anymore the difference is though that the land that the building is built was promised And we're still working on it just they're they're real estate there is worth nothing, you know So thank you know we're lucky we're lucky lucky that so what would it happen if they were to kind of Business who what would it happen to the Olympic what does auction? May well Dave maybe Maybe maybe maybe he knew the writing was on the wall and Said thought you know let me get out of it. Yeah, tell me did you know to your riddle that'll let me when they did Yeah, I forgot it so can you imagine now If Jake would did not buy it and here we are an able in the show. I mean here we are in September or the show They would he cancel the M.I. would he cancel the one with COVID going on everything is you know But thanks on he was doing it so I think you know it will come back maybe next year into it maybe yeah, maybe So it was a good I mean it was a good for them to sell it at that time It was thank God it was good for body building the Jake board when he did however I bet you if Jake would have waited or buy you a lot cheaper But Is what it is Time I'm glad to get one piece of happiness. You know I I don't know if I sheven show the picture I have getting on the show your boy there My oligarch me I'll smile like come on he's gonna smile the whole time. Yeah, you know he's he's staying with a friend of his in the UK I guess for a couple weeks and then he's going to Turkey and staying there for two weeks so because from Turkey to the United States You can fly no problem you can't fly from the to the UK to the United States so He's doing that and I think he's gonna hang out in the US probably for a few weeks before the Olympia or for a few months I should say right you know you wear that. Yeah, I just found out the other day You know I only found out in the context of See staying in your apartment building So somebody said You know come on you might want to think about Coming now because what what if just the one if well we said that we've been speculating that for weeks Why didn't these guys just come here? What if England goes nuts for COVID? Yeah, you know They won't let anyone out So anyway, I'm getting them on the show. I'm interviewing them this week And the picture I saw them I don't I'm sure you saw the same picture It's like a hands on hips oh you look sick fill he He looks and know I couldn't believe how big he was what what then I happened to him. He's enormous Should I show the picture? I don't know I get a picture Let me see if I can get the picture I'm gonna you know put up on again. I'm going to say a told you it looks like Phil How did he get so big? What's he been doing? I'm you the guy's what 49 years old brother. I can't tell famous protocol Seriously though. I can't believe how big he is he just um You know I think what happens Dave honestly is Well, I'll give you this in my opinion is with come all you know he he He want me live here and it And he always had ultimate confidence no arrogance but confidence you know in his abilities to be competitive to win it even when he was third when when flex Wanted I saw pictures the other day Dave with him in flex. It was pretty darn close that year Yeah, they just Had them like 90 like they had them more than they would social distance them on stage He never got next to you know they'd spread them out so to speak Because he's he does not have weaknesses so that Perseye so he looks better on stage and he really has any help. I think what he'd be limpia I think that it I think It's something in him where he wants to come back to show people that He is To 12 Mr. Olympia and he likes you should ask him he likes the idea Of succeeding somebody who won so many times you know, I mean it there's something important to him I think a lot of people thought he was going to be a one-hit one-hit one-hit one-hit one-hit and And I think they're going to be surprised when they you know If you can ever find that picture and both it. I think that'd be surprised I'm working. I'll keep talking as as thickness So I mean he's fit he's a deckster. He's 50 or 49 and one of the two he's got to be close to 50 right? Yeah, we went to we went with him. You know we went to Qatar for two or three weeks My family and his family and They when somebody trains I've never seen anyone ever Below up in a training session like he'd like if he does show theirs they get three times bigger And if he gets if he does pecks the pecks get like this Right, but you know when people go like oh I got a really good pump He's he's a genetic friend. Yeah. Oh pump up like he'd do like You know back and you say any back looks good. So I'm gonna just a back and it'd be in a tank top and Be pumping pump and pump you know training training training He just explode That's just genetics. I mean First of all anyone who can hook and hook and be that good at that You know late of an age, you know that's genetics too because you know Most people fall apart That's the one you're either Ask him same thing. It's like Dexter any injuries no ever never ever Well, I think my elbow hurt me for like you know who do you know my heart might can 7 it was There it is It's pretty impressive for a 312 guy He looks massive he looks like doring that yeah, he looks crazy How the legs Yeah, he always a good legs He has no wish him with legs his legs a round for his body and then deeply separated And he gets paper thin skin. I'm I'm really impressed in that picture I'm glad that he's smart enough to get to the United States early Yeah, that would have been like we're seeing a stay He hasn't Contacted you in that sense He should hide up there and may that would be perfect place to hide And his healthy by brings all family to Oh Never know a little ever to quote yeah, never know a little No All right, what else do I have to report I get a lot of news Okay, what's your next topic? I don't know I'm looking He can't solve the report of the I know that I wanted to So dance Solomon Yeah, Dan was posted something on the Olympia I'll see that I guess they got a you know shack heel on Neil is going to be the ambassador this year like Jay was last year And I think it's because I think they got him through rock chibaz you know rock chibaz It was a good pro body bullet is on right he trains shack I think it's land through there So they said I got the shack like spotted when he was at the Olympia last year and he They're gonna make him the mess so I guess Dan is doing some kind of like a Olympia talk with Shaquille and Neil and Monday night They should be if they should get baby gold bomb too You know a shack and doors is everything just Google look the stuff that shack and door Yeah, do you know how You know how they this will works Yeah, he's like the George form in the modern year, right? Yeah, he and door I'm surprised he didn't grill I'm surprised he should take over the George form and grow this should have the shack grill He just Google they put all the products that he endorsed he he's very wealthy, you know he owns a lot of businesses He's a very good business guy He's probably more people think he film is a great desk, but he was probably more successful as a business man Oh, sure I was watching some program on him. They but they were saying over businesses he owned Yeah, and he's all over the place it's funny because I saw a we used to watch you ever watch that show tanked When they build fish tanks, yes, they built him attack. You see that tanked they built them They're crazy for a stack yeah, they built them a great fish I didn't know he was all into a aquarium fish, you know like I was there's your connection once you're dead Yeah, you know I'm setting up another fish tank. I told you that right yeah, yeah, so I have this channel called muscle fish on YouTube and I haven't posted a video on four years I posted my first video because I'm starting to like put together the ingredients for this new fish tanks I kind of teach people I'm I'm back, you know, at least you have all these monster fish tanks in New York and some I'm building this new tank and so I put up with I put up another video I actually have I have like 18,000 subscribers on that channel I don't even do anything with it, but people like to it's a timeless thing because you go watch fish tank videos Doesn't have to be from yesterday. You know it doesn't matter that actually these things up four years ago People on the street at fish so Now and I told you I told Chris I was camera we we bought a the property across the street for us by my mother and I was gonna do live in there and it came up for sale, but they have this crazy coin pond In there which I'll show everyone it when I'll do a tour of the property when we finally take it over next month and So now these coil like giant Chris so I have I now I got my monster fish back. I didn't have to even get a fish tank so And on the property that they have an outdoor like self it's like a pond it's like a runoff pond You've seen things they dig these things so that like you know float There's an out there's a baby alligator living in it Chris the thing is like Wait to get that property day to be out here. No, but you but it's today, you know it's this big it's not gonna It's a small alligator, but you know they can they make grow and they you know it's taped out this like little pond So now I'm we're concerned because you know we get obviously the kids and stuff like that Get me my this alligator when it gets bigger so now we have to get rid of the alligator But you can't call fake Florida fish from wildlife they won't come unless the things over like four feet Yeah, they get calls all day long so right the calls are they like so they're gonna basically tell you go you know We don't care so now I had my idea was to get in a little robot Chris and Don't with it with a big net and go out there and try to net the thing myself Now obviously we would have to videotapeness right? I'm gonna say put that and then it's like all video tape. Don't worry about it No, here's another and another angle to visit the equation you know you know who Denise Missino is right Dr. Denise Just moved back Denise was used to live in Fort Myers, but she had because out in California Our husband was working for E.N. entertainment there is a video editor shoot video in that is the so they moved back just recently to to Fort Myers So and you know Amanda how we're close and obviously I know Denise really well So I got to get Denise's husband Greg to come and and filmed the Epic adventure of the Dave removing the baby alligator from the text of the property cross street Probably the biggest video game it might be right biggest video of all time Especially like a her or if I fall to what Fall to the water Amanda's like what are your phone the one I'm gonna The alligator's a foot long and what are you gonna do to me? Take a toe off no it's not gonna it'll probably run that's the worst part of being that I'll be soaking wet you know You know nothing's going off if I see you're defibrillators gonna go off First of all I'm not really afraid of like Alligators and stuff like that that are that small like if there was a big one in there I would be scared out of my mind of course, yeah, but You know Well we went you sent us I know you didn't send us it reminds you the scene from jars remember You remember draws? Moopy Yeah, you know you the gentleman if you're asking that story Amanda so Quint is the guy you know they hired the old guy to hunt the shark right and Richard drive his place is like marine biologist and just and he's like He's like he brings the shark cage with them on the boat they're gonna go hunt this fish right I think we go hunt the shark and and Brody's and and Quint is like who plays by Robert Shaw who actually won the Academy award for this Part of these like what are you gonna do with that cage? Mate He's like I'm gonna put it in the water. I'm gonna go in the water with the fish because you're gonna go in the water with the fish he's like Shocks in the water You're in the water Chockies the you That's the thing you know, you know like you're gonna be a history there But that's a reminds of you know But the alligator's not that big but it's still the whole idea of having it Having to get an alligator out of your own part, you know, it's kind of fun in the sense And I gotta get Amanda because I want to do I want to put fish in the pond. I want to I want to stock the pond with some fish Obviously if that baby little alligator's there mommy alligator or daddy alligator is probably Careful hiding or yeah Somebody nearby Now I'm probably not because you know that did behind my house, you know I have that big gators slew is called That's where the alligators are in there So what happens is I think when they when they get a little old enough They'll they'll come out of the water and they'll go look for the wrong little ponds to hang at it so they can have to Throw in so much that they try to get the leave home and have their own apartment, you know That's the I was telling them that's good seeing tell me about your chocolate venture My wife when I'm canoeing or Kasi kayak in last year and getting argument with me all the sun She declared that there were great white sharks in Maine and Supposedly does not man a big fight about it and she saw plenty of seals So she said where the food is there's shark so a lady this summer not performance Was vacationing from the York City swimming and she got eaten In full by a great white shark wow and so lately We've you know there's been these shark sighting so today we went I said let's do something get other house Took everyone out we went to this place called the lobster shack and it's outdoor picnic tables right on the rocks and I'm sitting there eat my food and sure enough Right by I went nuts. I was so excited Because I've never seen it you know shark in the wild because we always joke about it Right, but you see that you know that water break Then the fin right come out skis even if I'm landing you scare Workside it I was more excited than skated I was It was a boat near that's how I saw it I saw a nice little sailboat name I wanted to start to talk about sailing yeah Couldn't get the S out of my voice Adam I'm on my mouth before you just have a shark yeah It was exciting And I That was it the last try I mean kidding come back up or she didn't come back up The whole newspaper flavors I wonder I work you know probably tell Tabi tag I won't probably was my Luz amount of zaccia right now. Hey be careful. Yeah, it's great scene. They made Play a YouTube license. What make Nick Trajilly Is Nick did Nick says he called you and trying to get it back or something try to find out what is that That movie looks like shot and kept she jars were shot was a shot and kept on I think what it's what that's what the fake place that's the great white love keep God Yeah, I'm sure I think they go all the it's amazing they travel all the globe these sharks The ones in Australia seems to be much more aggressive though Yeah Because they get the seals there they go to that seal island and they eat the seals I mean if I'm sure you did you watch shark week? I've seen it yeah, I love shark. I love shark It's great.

Welcome back to Live with, on day polombo. Today's guest is the 2021 IFBB Miami Muscle Beach Classic Physic Pro Champ, Zee Ganderus at only 24 years of age. Welcome to the show and big congratulations. Thank you. 25, but close. Wait, it doesn't matter. You just turned 25? Last year, it's just a number though. That's the thing, it's been a long time. I'm going to show you the show right here today and looking forward to answering some questions and going from there to get it. I'm actually more excited to actually see that big try into one. I always love when the promoters come up with unique trophies. This is always one of something like this. I don't have a sword or something like something I can actually hold onto. A trophy. This is a great picture on your Instagram. You're proposing with that. The funny thing is that God, you actually live in Miami because I don't think you could have brought that on an airplane. I know man. So, you know, it was crazy. When I went to when I got my pro-card in 2019 that they'd be seen as close. Right when I was packing up for the flight, I'll leave in the RB and be. I have everything set up. I placed my trophy on my briefcase and I went to get settled basically. You'll take a shower, you know, get ready and I fell off my briefcase and broken half. Yeah, man. So, it just fitted in there and, you know, yeah, man. Definitely, it could do some damage though. Oh, yeah, it looks like it's not like plastic. That's like serious, real, right? Oh, yeah. It's definitely, you look like a chocolate man. You look like a chocolate man. You want to do like a pose, you want to like, you know, get yourself spray, spray paint to look like an aquaman and do like some kind of a photoshoot with that thing. Yeah, yeah. I definitely want to take some cool pics with this. I'd be pretty cool. I didn't think about that. All right, so you 25 years of age, you know, you've been training for about 10 years now. You've only been bodybuilding really well for about four years as far as competition goes. You won the 2019 NPC Nationals. That's where you got your pro card. I don't think a lot of people saw you coming. I think you caught me by surprise. I didn't, you know, when I saw the pictures, Chris Cito, both of us were really impressed with the way you looked in this win. But I don't think anyone would have ever predicted that you were going to come in there and dominate that show like that. Yeah. So, you know, you know, my mindset is basically, I like to stay low-key. So, you know, obviously when you, you show up, you know, you kind of just, you kind of know in a way what your competitions like. But to be honest, since I ever started competing, I did my first show. I was 22. And then from there, you know, I've always, you know, my motto is, you know, stay humble, but hungry. I never really cared about the competition. I was coming there and I always just kind of show up and basically be the best I can be in that way about anybody else. And, you know, I'm not putting myself on blast and, you know, say, oh, I'm a win this. I'm a win that. Because everybody's out there grinding. And so, I'll tell you this one thing. You did New York pro. And I remember seeing you on stage because I commented to Chris, we did the analysis of the show that I thought you were, you know, you were not standing straight on as much you were like, kind of like three court of turning. And I thought you were losing him. You're with that way. And I think, you know, maybe Danny, you and Edge, you out that way. Because he was, you know, his posing presentation was really good. It seems like you corrected that for this Miami muscle beach show. But I was very impressed with your conditioning at that New York pro. I mean, between you and Danny, you know, and you told me you didn't even prep for that. You could have flipped the coin. I don't think anyone would have complained with you would have show as well. Was that a disappointment? Was that an encouragement when you, when you play second? It was, it was definitely, it was definitely an encouragement. I could say, you know, being able to stand up to some of the, you know, top athletes in the world. And especially, you know, Danny has, he's a Olympian four time now. We'll put those out. You know, basically, I took that as a, hey, I'm up here. And we're just going to make improvements and get to where we need to get to. And I was actually prepping for the New York pro. Really what made me do the New York pro was a, basically, move from North Carolina to Florida, like Willis, to Florida. And from Willis, to Florida, I went out to Orlando to do a photo shoot at the Iron Religion and then I spoke with my fiance and my sponsor in they said, you know, the New York pro was about 10 days away. So, I basically, it was like, you know what, I look pretty good in these shots. You are, you are, you are ready. I mean, you wouldn't know what would say you weren't ready for that show. No way. Yeah, I was, I was definitely like, you know what, we can pick for it. Conditions on point. We just got to, you know, make sure, peak week some point and go from there. I was pretty tired, man. You know, doing all these shoots and traveling, you know, back and forth. And the one thing is, like, I've always like tried to practice routine and get me more fluent in, you know, just to display more physique. And I can say that I didn't even practice any type of routine. Honestly, I just always really focus on the manateories. Very good at the manateories. Really. You have, you flexed the story. The thing that I, excuse me, the thing that I just want to stop you for a second, because the one thing that I found very impressive is that you know how to flex every single muscle group. You have very good body awareness on stage, which a lot of guys who are kind of new to the sport don't have, but you are able to flex everything at the same time and that's something that once again, I don't know if that's because you practice a lot or you just have just a good mind muscle connection. But you absolutely know where your body is in space on that stage. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely feel it, especially getting more experience. I can tweak some poses like, you know, the side chest. I can keep my chest up more and create less openings between my arms and little things like that, you know, with my legs. I can, you know, like you mentioned, you know, staying more of three quarters, you know, that will actually cause you to lose some width on your thighs and your legs, you know, overall just a quad to, you know, the X-frame. So, you know, just things and, you know, always you stand out to the side with one of my legs and then for that show, you know, I wanted to try something to look a little more classic. So I kept my foot in front and kind of created more of a classic look versus like, you know, creating more of a mass look. So that's probably why he beat me in a way because he's more mature and he was able to start more because he had, you know, a little bit more separation in some areas. I think what happened was what you were doing is you were now wearing yourself by putting that foot in front of you rather than after the side. So you weren't looking what I'm showing you true width, which I think you have a tremendous width on stage. Yeah. Yeah. And I actually got some feedback from out, you know, the head judge, Tyler Manion, you know, he basically was just like, you know, a little bit more quag width and back density and that's kind of, you know, overall, you know, obviously you want to improve everything, but that was one of the key points and then the posing, you know, obviously comes, you know, with, you know, experience and practicing. But those are things that really need to work on and especially like for my class, you know, that density is going to be, you know, E. Look, conditioning when shows and you got, you're finishing and spades and, you know, Danny Union is a season, you know, plastic guy. He's a top, you know, six Olympians. So, I mean, that has to be pretty encouraging for you that you kind of pushed him to limit there because Danny is a really good at this show. So I have to think that you're going to be in that top seven conversation all day long, you know, come Olympia time. I feel like I have a rare, really good chance of, uh, turning some heads there and definitely improving in these next, you know, 17, 16 weeks and really stay tuned in to my body and really feed it and train, you know, the way it needs to be trained and just, you know, add that muscle to that area without going to, you know, my wake cap, which is 1952. What do you mean? I feel like I show. For Miami, actually came in a little bit fuller versus the last two shows, the last two shows New York and Milwaukee, I came in at 188. I could have got down a little bit lower, but like I started filling out Thursday night, just slowly, slowly, always clean, carb, never. I never go out, eat a cheap meal like burger and fries, like, you know, that stuff always weigh all my stuff out and really just taper it in through day and taper it into the night, you know, and then, you know, I don't do no crazy stuff, man. That's where people go wrong. It might work for some people, but I like to keep it consistent, you know, because if I have to adjust some things or, you know, I don't want to spill over and you have to think that classic is not really, it's about size, but you have to be dry, you have to be lean, aesthetic, look, you can't have your stomach, not just in food when you're on stage because it's going to blow out, you know. So I always try to get fast, fast, adjusting food that's going to work for me versus something my body's not used to and have an eight and several weeks, you know. Yeah, I think you have, but you've got to use what works for yourself. I mean, obviously you guys don't just all of a sudden, you know, do things that they've never done. You test it out, you know, weekends and advance, you know, you do tap runs and you obviously know what works for your body, what doesn't work. I think that's why people always ask, you know, you know, what to do and I'm always like, well, you know, what did you do if it didn't work, then try something else. If it didn't work, then stick to what works, you know, you don't try to reinvent the wheel if you don't need to, you know. Exactly. And that's where people go wrong. They try to do all these little trips and, you know, little like, additives and like, all of me, you know, two things, a peanut butter and rice cakes, sugar, honey, like, you know, like, if you come in, just keep it consistent up until like, you know, last couple of days, really monitor everything, you know, even the salt, you know, even getting down to that, you know, sauces like you have to monitor everything and don't really overthink it because let me start overthink and stuff. You start stressing and it's really good. Yeah. Do you have your work with someone? So basically, you know, pretty much, I've always been self coached. I did have a coach that coach me for the NPC Nationals, which coach me for the last two shows, which was New York and Milwaukee. Okay. I reached out to him because, you know, I kind of needed a little bit more mentorship and a little bit more monitoring, you know, and he helped me, he helped me get my pro-card, you know, he's last two shows and then, you know, moving forward, he was like, hey, I want you to take a break. And I was like, soon they'll walk off me and walk you, show the stage, I emailed I FPV and I was like, hey, I want to register for Miami because the next day I was actually going to move there. And I was like, no, why not? Like, why not try to like keep, you know, so week away. And he's like, I want you to take a break. I'm not going to cut you for the show. You're on your own. So he's like, okay. So you know, I was like, all right, all right. All right, all of a sudden, you live right there. Why not do it, right? It's not like you. I mean, like, it was in now trying to make my name here, you know, I want to try to be able to, you know, get myself out there and it's a very great opportunity. Just like you said, you were kind of surprised or wasn't to need people that competed. Yeah. So, you know, in this crazy, like, the guy that beat me that played second and the walkie was there too, as well. Oh, wow. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I ended up he got second and, you know, came in. I got, got first. So it's all about, you know, the time and play. So I was there. I showed up and I came in fuller. Yeah. And that's what they wanted. So that's what I mean. I think it's important. Yeah, I think it's important to compete more often, especially in early in your career, because stage experience is something that you, you know, you can't buy that, you know, you have to just experience it. And I think that, you know, like you said, just the way you present your physique, let these different judges look at you, give you feedback so that you can perfect your look so that when you get to an Olympia stage or an Arnold classic stage, for instance, you can do well, you know, and you can dominate there, right? Because it's a learning experience. You do one show. You really sometimes don't even learn that. But I know guys that have won, done one show. They won their class. They won the show. And then they think that they're perfect. And they show up at the Olympia and they get, they get slammed because they just really don't have enough experience. It was just kind of like a lucky show they want to, you know? Yep. And it's crazy. You know, and you know, one thing that I've always never really done was, you know, never really actually went up to the judges for their feedback. Right. I'm just, you know, looked at myself and be like, all right, this is what I need to improve on. Sure. But the last three shows, they, you know, it's kind of crazy how we kind of linked up on, you know, met Tyler, you know, post show. I went to the bathroom, you know, he was in there. And we kind of talked about what we needed to improve on. And then Milwaukee, I was actually going back in there to the venue because I missed play something. And as I was coming through, the head judge was like, hey, I got something for you because he had, you know, obviously the checks for the, you know, the winnings. And he's like, hey, you know, here's some feedback. And he said, you know, he'd get a little bit more arms, a little bit more legs. And then the judges from the, uh, listening tray, he, uh, he told me for the Miami show. He said, uh, don't hide your legs. Hit more front shots. Right. Um, everything else, you know, pretty much looks good. Yeah. Um, you know, that's pretty much what I got. And so all these little things, I'm going to, you know, improve on. So moving forward, I know what I need to do. And like I'm going to revert back to what you said. I actually do have a coach now. Pretty well known in the industry, uh, Adrian, his team name is cuts. Um, so he's definitely going to stay on point with me. He's got a lot of Olympic athletes on his team. And, you know, I take the series just like he does. He lives this in that's his lifestyle. And, uh, you know, we really, really got a good playing going so far. Um, you know, obviously coming off a show, you're going to rebound. So we're going to, you know, keep that under control. Um, and then moving forward, we're just going to slowly increase the food. And, uh, you know, stay healthy in the process. Man, it's all about longevity. And this is part of two. You got to, you really, really got to be healthy. Um, you know, so this is how we're approaching things and, uh, it's going to take it, you know, every, every week, you know. And even like every three days, like I'm checking in with him. So I'm just making a cheer. I'm going to point. Right. Um, really the key thing is that diet and the training, you know, like a lot of people get it wrong. They get it twisted like, it doesn't matter what you take. Man, like if you don't have those two things, you ain't doing nothing. And, you know, and that's where people go wrong. Like they just think about, you know, all these little, you know, shortcuts. There's no shortcut for hard work. So you got to put it in, man. Hey, men to that man. Yeah, you got to look. We know food builds muscle training. The gym builds muscle, uh, the supplements, the, the gear. And that kind of is just like a little bit of an enhancement. But if you don't have your training and your eating down and you're not resting enough at night, getting your recuperation, you know, you know, you got it. Nothing, your body's never going to change. And I see people all the time. Well, I know guys from the gym, they have not changed for 30 years. I've seen them in the gym. They've never changed. They all take year and they all think, suburbally, bodybuilding lifestyle, but they never look any different. Because, you know, they're not doing things the right way. They don't have the eating down. They miss the hills. You know, they, they don't, the training is pretty good. But they don't really push too hard in the gym. Because, you know, they're kind of, they're too busy socializing. And that's, that's most people who work out right there. You just, you know, there are a few people who will push it, you know, to the limit. And, you know, that's what it takes to be the best. And, you know what? You are the best in Miami. And, you're going to be going to the Olympia this year. That's a huge, huge pat on your back. And I want to wish you the best to lock up there. It's crazy, man. You know, when I first started competing, I never saw myself up there. I wouldn't be honest with you, man. I always did it because I competed because it was a competition with them. Myself versus like, oh, I have a dream to go to the Olympia. No, I basically did it because I loved it. I love this lifestyle. I love the passion that, you know, it drives me every day. And one of the quotes that actually learned recently was, you know, results driven, passion fueled. So, you know, that's how I live in a way as well. And also kind of my motto is like, stay humble, but hungry. So, you want to always, you know, basically, you know, where you come from and the people to support you and, you know, where do you're at today? You know, you want to give things. You don't want to be in grateful and, you know, you obviously, you know, everything can be taken away. So, you got to make sure that, you know, you can't your blessings and, you know, you live day by day. And also the hunt, man, that you guys stay hungry. You know, what do we do when we go out? You know, animal goes out to go get food. He's on the hunt. So, you got to be careful, you know. You basically just, you just got to apply those things every day and know that, you know, you just do what you love and things will come and things will come in. I can go on a really big story on, you know, this, how me and my fiance met, you know, it was actually through my old coach. And this is what job I mean today too. A lot, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of passion is job me closer to her. We met through my old coach on that hand back in 2017 at a local show. He does like the tanning booths on ends for the lead performance tanning things. Yeah, he's a pro tan. And once we're short, he was coaching her at the time. And I saw a picture her on his page, Instagram and I was like, wow, you know, she looks beautiful. I clicked on her on her story. And she was kind of like talking about, you know, her experiences and stuff like that. And one of her things that she said that really stuck to me was like, you know, you try to adopt somebody's personality to fit your home and I just like, wow, you know, that's what I'm going to do right now. You know, with my past relationship, you know, like I said, you know, when I turned pro, I just kind of like pushed all my body building everything away. And I should have looked at it at a different level, like a professional level and I didn't and COVID and all that stuff happened. But I was always put down and, you know, long story short, I threw a little emoji 100 signed to her and we just kind of like started talking and vibe and I was backing up September. And you know, here we are today, man, we're like closer than ever. We've been through a lot and we're going to keep them through a lot. We're actually creating our own platform and trying to help people. So it's really going to be really big and her name is a friend Jessica. She's Italian. She's actually going to do her first well. This competition here in Florida at the Melchancy Show. And I'm actually, you know, coaching her for that. So, you know, I'm going to give her a shout out her. Her Instagram is there. That's what you're talking about. That's what you're talking about. It's amazing how the, the, I always call the meaningful coincidences how you meet people and how things happen. If you had to work with that coach, you wouldn't have been met the girl. Things don't happen for, you know, for bike. Do. By chance. Everything is got. Great. Something. Helogen design behind it. And, you know, you got to just kind of follow you knows. And it'll take you in the right place. And I'm glad you guys met and I'm glad you guys are doing well together. And that's, that's awesome. Great story. Yeah, man, it's crazy, man. And like I said, it's a long story. But I may give you the brief, man. And it's, it's, it's, it's a blessing. It's a very, you know, once you find somebody that you truly know that they're there for you. And, you know, that they're going to be there for no matter what, you know, you can't let them go. And you can't be, you can't be ungrateful for it. You know, you, you, you really got to take the time to appreciate, you know, what somebody is giving you. And I can tell you right now, I would not be in this position today without her. Because she, like I said, she's pushed me. And the people that supported me, you know, I have a very good sponsor. He's actually definitely, you know, put me in the position where I need to be. He's, he's paid for my show of tans. My show fees, air fair food. Everything that's, you know, brought me to this level. He's even, uh, came to the, you know, you know, like putting a roof over my head to where I can compete, you know, be able to live this lifestyle without him. I will be here today either. So, um, big shout out. His name is actually, uh, Barack DeWare on Instagram. Um, so, uh, he's, he's definitely blessed to me. So I'm not gonna, you know, give him any, you know, you know, uh, I can't say nothing, you know, he's got a lot of, whatever, but never with me. So big shout out to him. Uh, you know what, the people that support us, you, you got to show gratitude towards because everyone, you know, has different people who are behind them that make them the person they are. You're girlfriend, obviously, you, you, you, you, you're sponsored. You have a support team. That's important. And, uh, like I said, you did what you had to do. You're gonna be at the Olympia. And hopefully we're gonna see you in that top five call out. And, uh, you know, we're gonna hear a lot more from Zika Andrews in the future. And I appreciate you joining us here in your story with us. Yes, sir. Definitely an honor man.

Welcome back to live with Rothier by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo and today's guest is the champion and classic physique of the IFB Tampa Pro Show. The man I'm talking about is Henry Pierre and no welcome. I'm sorry. That's it. You just won the first Pro Show. You go into the Olympia. You've got to be thrilled. I want to hear some more enthusiasm. I got it. I'm in the show guys. You better come check out one of the best physique you've ever seen on stage. I deal with you. Is that better? That's better. Much better. 2015 you won the Canadian Nationals in Bodybuilding. Turn pro. A lot of people were talking about you as the next coming. You always had that classic look to your physique. Did you ever think you would drop down to classic physique division and compete in that or because you were a bodybuilder your whole life? Well, actually it's pretty, it's full of dimension that cause obviously yeah I was a bodybuilder always been a bodybuilder. Never thought about being something else. Dad had bodybuilder. But back in 2011 I participated in the Mr. Universe. The world called the fire. I'm at the rear of the IFPDA League and there was back then even a classic physique division. And my height was 61 plus and I had to be 225 on stage. Which is clear. Yeah, which is clear. Something unattainable for me something that would never go down to. So I never thought about going back to classic. Right. So you compete in it as a pro a couple years. You never really won anything big. All of a sudden they decide they're going to raise the IFPB pro classic physique weight limits within each height by 10 pounds. And all of a sudden now you go from impossible to make weight. Now all of a sudden there's a real reality there. But yeah, I don't know if you saw yourself as a classic. And what made you make that final decision to say, you know what? Let's do this. I know you work with Chris and Cito was Chris involved in this decision or did you make this yourself? No, I think it was on my part. First the main reasons you could I took a long time off this year and the off season took seven month off. And I was about to get back into the group and I wanted to do a show this year. I didn't want to take a year off. Right. So I was looking at this schedule of the season. I was looking at the show that we left. And I had no time really to do my regular off season prep and on that at the same time, which was a good timing. And all this that day, like you said, raised up the class by 10 pounds, which should bring up my class to 204 pounds last year, same time on stage in for the 10 pro. I was to 49 on stage. So 9 pounds away. So yeah, at that point I thought to a couple of Chris, we talked about it. Things like it should be really attainable for you. And I think the physique that I present, the aesthetic that I have matches also the category, because you have a lot of bodybuilders doing the switch. And in my mind, I mean, if you're on a class seat, your physique has to turn the sword match, you know, the category. Just being a bodybuilder doesn't mean you want to go class because you fit the weight, has to fit the load the posing and the aesthetic of the classic physique. I'm going to make a controversial statement right now. I feel, and you'll probably, I have a feeling you're going to agree with me. You were, you were, you almost took a whole year off. I mean, you, you, you, you literally prepared for the Vancouver Pro show in nine weeks. I know Chris, tell me and I know you can firm that with me. You came in fourth. I, believe it. And I, Chris, and I thought you should have won that show. I think you were greatly overlooked at that event. Was that an upsetting, you know, placing for you? Honestly, that that, it was a toughest prep in my life. We rushed that prep really two hours of cardio a day. It was good for social media. Yeah. But I mean, I was, I was sucking it up all kinds. So I think I showed up maybe at age percent, which is maybe to the max of the shape that I usually the package that I'd bring. So I think it was a bit off. I think I could play a good place better in my opinion. But I mean, you know, I was just a bit, it was, it was really rushy all that prep going there for my season. And then we took boom on stage. I was really quick. Because it's something that we're taking note and that's not going to happen again in my book. No. I'm glad you said it because the, here comes the controversial part and say, but I don't even think you're your best that I've seen. I think you could be way better than what we've seen already. And I think if the Olympia, you're going to finally hit that peak form that we've seen from you in the past. Yeah, sure. I mean, I think it looked pretty good in Tampa. Chris was putting satisfaction. We almost nailed it closer to 100. But like you said, I mean, that's phase that if I come to you digging, if I keep going, I'm going to improve and get better. And this is what will, will schedule in here. And some more definition, it's called more artists because it's, it was a toughest part for me here as to come down from a way that music and beat at which is like usually 50 to 55 on stage. Looking full as, you know, as it's how looking hard rock. And then coming down 10 pounds, even 12 pounds less in this thing condition, the same look, this is what's hard for me right now to just target since it's my first year. But I think we did a very good job in Tampa Pro and they guess we'll be better. Yeah. What do you have to weigh on stage for the Olympia? Sorry. What is your weight? What's the maximum weight you can weigh on stage? 240. I cannot pass before you. I'm the weigh-in and then thank you very, very, very, to 38 at the weigh-in at tempo. All dressed up. And I'm in Long's leave and I'll full of jolly pants. I step on this, get on it. I was 28.6. So there's still a bit of room. Thank you. Right, right, right. Well, I think you got a good shot in anyone. It's amazing because I'm seeing so many great Canadian classic physique guys. It's like you guys have them all up there between Reagan and Chris Bumstead and yourself. And, you know, there's a whole host of them. Where are all these physique's coming from? We've never seen this in the history of Canadian bodybuilding. All of a sudden, everyone's coming out of the woodwork up there. You guys got something in the water or something? Yeah, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a year that's filled up with Canadian young. Yeah, we forgot to mention there was staying in Watson also coming in. There'll be a Mac, Moot, Mac, Moot, Mac, Moot, Mac, Moot, Moot. Montreal, here, that's also quite right coming here. In, yeah, Bumstead's sister go qualify the same time. She wanted to enjoy the category as well. That's right. So yeah, and this is this is physique. I mean, I, I'm kind of all this guy. And the league where it comes to, you know, those type of generation. And I mean, Chris was competing in national and it looks like it was just being failure away in the line of bodybuilders. Because it's just, you know, and I feel, I feel the way he was feeling before. Because we always hear the same comment. You're tall, you're lacking mass, you're not big enough, you're not hard enough. But you show up, but everybody's going to tell you, you have the nicest shape. Everybody won your shape, but you're missing mass and you're lacking our rug definition and all that. So you kind of, you know, staying at that stage. And for him, I think classic just open an enormous quantity of opportunity for him, just to explore in the years at the top of his game right now. All right. I'm going to ask your point, like, can you win the Olympian this year? If I can win the Olympian, I believe I can totally win the Olympian classical music that, yeah, this year, I'm going to say yes. Because, you know, confidence myself, I trust the people that I work with. But I mean, you know, it would be really for me a great, a great accomplishment and great surprise as well. If I win the Olympian for me, I'm not expecting the voter and winning. I'm expecting the voter and placing top five that's the goal right now. But that's as many objectives if I win the show will be just, uh, actually there. What now you're telling me why you can win show. Why are you going to beat, you know, the guys like Bumsted and Brianna and what's better about your physique? Tell me. Everybody compares me a lot to Bumsted, but I think in my book, I don't see Bumsted as much just as Brianna because Brianna and a lot of people on the estimates, uh, the rules and the pointers what we look at that when we look at classic physique. Bumsted is a very, uh, call structure, uh, telling, you also hold a lot of elegance, but he's a tall guy does good vacuum. It mimics me a lot of like, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger person on stage, you know, uh, type of thing. But Brianna, my book is a bit more dangerous. Brianna has more dense muscle definition legs we deeper as huge legs. That has a huge leg. If you're the student person in the definition, you know, uh, he's also a very natural type of guy on stage. You feel as low, you feel that you stare at the guy's got a kind of fun on stage. You know how to pose and I, I, I, I, I, I given a lot of props for that. And this is what I like. You can buy it over. So you might vote for me. I would say that I have more a bit more aesthetic look that Brianna, I also think that my body and the way my aesthetic is is preparing out to the way what it floods the striation or deeper than you see on Brianna as well. If I can just raise up a bit my leg game to matches insertion and the condition of legs, I think I can give them a good run from this money. Yeah. Well, you look great this past weekend. You got to be proud of yourself. You, you won the show. You earned the invite to the Olympia stage. What does it mean to you have to all these years of training, you know, and trying to, you know, be the best body, believe you can be. And now you're finally going to stand on that Olympia stage. Yeah. Well, I mean, now for me, it's just to bring all my egging to the middle of level. I'm going to try to do the best routine that I have it did. I'm going to try to show up there in the best condition. I'm going to push myself up to the max. So I'm going to get all the tools that I have. I could say around me and all the support also because winning a show, first I'm going to approach all the other opportunities, a lot of people approaching them. You need to catch up and you need to capitalize on these. And I mean, you need to be disciplined. This is something that I was lacking before. I've always been very easy for me competing, you know, routine. I never practice in my life. I always show up freestyle on stage. Some people be so impressed by that. But this is, I think, how if you're buddy, whether you say what I need when you like the full, we like to be on stage in your comfortable, just being on stage, puts a music pose. It's a part of us, you know. So I'll have fun. And I'm trying to put up the best show that I can, but I'll put some more hard into it more than ever yet. I'm glad you mentioned it because that was my next question. You appear to me to have such a genetic gifts. But sometimes, you know, you take them for granted. Do you think earlier in your career, maybe you didn't give 100% because you didn't really need to, you were beaten guys just on your genetic potential. And now that you see you're so close to that Olympia title, you're hungry or now, maybe you're working harder. Yeah, let me just let me tell you first what was buddy, I think, for me before when I started, buddy, the thing for me before competition was describing to the gym three months trial, three months diet, doing the show goodbye, sooner or later. That's what I was doing for the five years here, buddy, building that I was, I was training, dieting, three months prior, any show and start training at that moment. So for me, it was always very easy to tell, I had the national level. Then I started a little off season and then when I came pro, I've seen what, you know, the word professional means, means being, being disciplined, means working hard all year around, I mean that's your job and you have to represent it. So yes, now that I'm, I'm at the four year of the third year pro, now I'm going to Olympia, I have no choice to respect that and I have no choice to respect the game. And this is why either I qualify or not, if I play the way to up five off season, no off season, I'm going to take the all year and focus on the all year each day, each hour, each minute of each day to capitalize, to make sure I do whatever it needs to be done, to be the best on stage in the world. Yeah. Well, congratulations on the huge win and the Olympia qualification. It will be an interesting battle out there, adding another great name to the list. Anyone you want to thank out there? Of course, I mean, the most definitely Chris was a seat of spin, fantastic for me, especially the tempo. I was coming to see my room, every three hours, Chris, thank you all. I would be here with you. I also have my sponsors, Nitu Balex, fit menu that have been supporting me since day one. My journey here in La Valle Montréal, I planted Jim La Valle Montréal. Thank you all my supporters, people and Instagram, having a ton of love. Even more sense of back-sweet can. I'm just grateful for that in really humble towards everybody that's supporting me. Well, once again, congratulations. Well, for victory, you look great. I'm excited. I'll be out there in Vegas to get to see you up on that classic physique stage and we'll see how you battle out with the top guys in the class. I guess you got a couple weeks to kind of just chill. Are you going to take some time off before you start the Olympia prep? Are you going right into it? Well, I mean, it's a great coincidence. I'm here for a place. I'm in Fort Myers right now. So when we still go, oh, you are, Sunny. Yeah. Why did you come to my studio, lazy bastard? Oh, I mean, I know you got your boat. How did you do it in Fort Myers? You're in Fort Myers? I'm wearing Cape Coral right next to you two minutes away. Oh, gosh. Yeah, well, we didn't even fall. Certainly, if I was by after a certain, for sure. Yeah. What are you doing there? I'm in Fort Myers here for two, three days. I mean, I have a place here in Phiddlesticks, Country Club here. And so my goal is come after 10 plus, spent two, three days a year to go to Spawn and then Jordan though. I know. I know. Next year, you'll have to come down here. Or if you're in this area, we'll have to get you into the studio here. So we can get in life's in studio interview with Henry P.R. Who knew you were right down the block from us, right? In turn at world, that. There you go. Well, enjoy your little vacation and good luck on the Olympia Prep and we'll be rooting for you. Thank you, Dave. Thank you. All right, and that's going to take us to the end of another episode of Live With brought to you by Species Nutrition. Visit speciesutrition.com. I'm Dave Palombo. We'll see you next time.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Food Expo, there's 30 year in a row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love this show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning, I'm Dave Palombo, and today is Tuesday, August 25th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. The last week or so you haven't been able to watch, read or listen to anything news related without hearing about the ongoing saga with the US postal system. But since the news, and my mailman are both totally unreliable, I've been shifting my focus towards Cody Montgomery, because at least I know he can deliver. A few days ago, a video surface of Cody crushing a huge squat session where he knocked out a clean eight reps with 545 on the bar. For the most part, this has been the norm for Cody in the gym lately, and it seems like he's been in a really solid group for a while now. And as we've seen in the past, when he's locked and loaded, he has the potential to be as good as anyone in bodybuilding. For most people, taking a close second in one of the biggest pre-contests of the season could be considered a career highlight. But for someone who's wired like the vine Wilson, all second place means is that it's time to work twice as hard to make the next one a win. Despite putting together what might have been his best look of his career in Tampa a few weeks ago, the vinesman back in the lab, cooking up new ways to take his performance at the next level. According to reports, he's already put on a few pounds of quality weight. This is in the process of refining his posing, so he really highlights what he brings to the stage. I think people might have forgotten how good this guy was because he took off all the last year. But if he makes a few small adjustments, I could see him as a potential top-tenalmpia finisher this year depending on how things shake out. For some athletes, there's something that clicks between year one and year two, and then boom, before you know it, they're off to the races. And if you were looking for a dark course candidate to make that leap in men's physique this year, Thomas Cunz might be your number one choice, a source from inside team Cunz says that he's a little more than eight weeks out from his first contest of the season, and they believe that he's already light years ahead of worry was at this point last year. In the two times we saw him last season, he was good enough to crack the top-tenan pitsburg and Romania, which both had pretty solid line up across the board. So if the 2020 version really is light years ahead of worry was last year, the top five finish could easily be in the cards. Cody Robbins says one of the keys to formulating your outcomes is to be a specific as possible when you state your intentions. And at this point, I don't know if Charles Griffin has publicly stated what his intentions are, but I do know that his actions are pretty damn specific. Yesterday, he released a new training clip that showed him smashing a pair of 160 pound dumbbells for reps on the ink line and he made it look way too easy. Last year was a bit of a breakout season for Charles in the sense that he made it to his first Olympia and really established himself as one of the premier athletes in the open division. So as long as he keeps channeling that same energy, I believe that the second time around he can come back even better. And back does it at the end of another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Daypal Unbow Reminding You to Always Be True to Your Passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Alright guys, now I'm really infuriating because I did a rant the other day, probably so it, does anyone want to work anymore. And I pretty much outed my IT company that was installed my server and all my fiber lines here called ProTech. And I basically said, look guys, don't use them. They are very unprofessional. They don't get back to people. They're not, they don't back up their service day to day-to-day due. And they just didn't treat us well. And that was my opinion. And I really didn't do it in a very nasty way or anything. I just didn't in a very mad or faculty way. I tried to contact these guys. They tried to claim that we weren't clients and, of course, we were. So the owner of my who I kind of outed, I didn't want to even say his name. But he actually responded in the thread and I'll put the hook up his response. And he actually emailed me. I guess he wanted to make sure that I saw it. In the case, I didn't notice it in the comments he put up. Obviously, watches are, because I'm glad he does, because you know what? It sucks when you screw over someone who has a really big social media following, because then you get out. And he sent this letter to me to see him out to me. To my wife and I. And he wrote, according to the customer notes, your fiber was installed before 2015. Now ironically, he said that, he hasn't even noticed timeline. Because I didn't move to Florida until November 1st of 2016. I didn't get my fiber installed to February of 2017. So he's over two years off of when he actually installed my my fiber line here in my house. He also neglected the mention that we spent $6200 on the fiber line installation and the server set up and everything like that. And you know what? I had no problem paying it because I wanted a high quality job done and they did do a good job. My problem with them wasn't the work that they did. It was the fact that they didn't want to follow up and service the job that they did. They made it seem like we were some kind of like people walking it off the street. We hadn't spent the penny with them. And how dare we be upset with the fact that they didn't want to service our line after we spent $6200 with them. Not to mention, we spent more money with them on top of that because we've had computer service by them as well. He went on to say, little, little, little. We don't have a service agreement with you or your team, but we have attempted to work with you on several times over the years. I don't know what that means attempted to work with us either. You do it. You know, they didn't because they're too impossible to get them to do anything. You've had our team attempt on a lot multiple machines because your office staff quit. We just couldn't handle your quests, especially since you don't have an SLA agreement. What that means I don't know. All we do is want to hire them to come and do some work for us. Your team was finally denied service because this is this is the best one because day one on a rampage, I want to know rampage at the Cape and our Cape Coral location. This is really funny. The only reason I'm really doing this is because this is I find this hysterical. Our employee Dan W was in fact so frightened by Dave pounding on the stores front and back doors over and over. The Dan couldn't even finish his lunch because he was shaking scared by the event. All right, here's this time for it. So I brought him to keep him computer I dropped off and they said they were going to clean it up for us. We had some viruses on and there's something like that. And so they said, are you come by at noon or something like that and pick up your computer or we'll be ready by then. I said, I think I got there at 1230. So I get there. Now it's a 25 minute ride for my house to get over to this store. The store is locked. I've never seen a business that has business hours from whatever nine to five and they locked their door. Something what's going on. I'm like, I'm a half hour late. There's no one in the store. But they got their office hours. There's got to be so an in here and there obviously was. All right, so I'm not going on the front door. I'm calling my wife and like, I'm in a call the store. I'm like, no one's answering the door. I think they here. I got to see a car out front. She's like, go around the back and go around the back. I'm like, not going to. I'm just going to get a computer pick up my computer. Now, if there was actually someone at the store and he was actually in there eating lunch whenever the case, you're thinking could open up the door and say, hey, you know what? Give me a 20 minutes. I'll eat my lunch and I'll get you to computer. The thing was done obviously because I went back to I think two days later and got or something like that. The thing was done. They were in the store and they didn't open the door. Yeah, I think they claim I went on a rampage. Like, what was they doing? Like, we ate the door with like a hammer. The guy couldn't finish his lunch. I scared him so much. I would, that's the rampage. I would. I would. I would. The funny reason I'm laughing is I was talking to my wife and the phone. So how much of a rampage could I have gone on? She was listening to me. We were like, how we could get these people to open the door? I mean, I don't know if they're in there or not. I said, I, they got to be in there. They said to come by. I'm only like a couple minutes late. Who? She's like, I don't know what they do in there. I said, I don't know. Maybe the guy's in the bathroom or something like that. So I'm like, yo, it chews me. She was. So I traumatized this guy. I thought, I didn't, and put it this way. Maybe if I would have been 320 pounds, I could have seen getting a little scared. I'm hardly intimidated with it now. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. So, so sorry, but you're YouTube rant. Only reaffirmed our discovery years ago. I guess that I'm a fucking lunatic, right? If anyone knows, I'm the least violent person you'll ever meet. I don't think I've ever had a single fight in my whole life. All right, we understand you're upset, but your rant is unfounded and unjustified. By the way, we just bought out, and then they they go on to say something about there. They're wonderful. They bought out some business in the yard, which I really could care less about. So obviously, now they want to try to cover for the fact number one that they will not serve us our, that they're not servicing their own work that they did. They believed to be in before 2015, which actually was done in 2017, and they wanted to try to make it seem like the reason they don't want to get back to us is because I traumatized their work so much going to make your computer that they just they don't want to either, they're petrified of me because God is a bit, I'm a nutcase. And obviously, anyone watched the rant, I was hardly anything other than sarcastic than the rant. I hardly showed any signs of violence. I would tend to believe. So these are the people. Now you know why I don't make this stuff up. These people are crazy out there. There's a bunch of freaking lunatics out there who have businesses and they don't add a service people. It just confirms what I said for service. Who the heck shot their business in the middle of the day? Okay, if they tell somebody to come pick a computer up, they see the person outside coming to pick up the computer. They know that I have three kids at home. I don't have a lot of time. I ran out, drove 25 minutes each way to pick up a computer that they said was done. And rather than open the door and say, oh, guy, Dave, he has the computer. They kept the door locked and he was huddled in the room shaking in fear of me knocking on the door and it going around the back and talking on the door to see if anyone was there. This is what I'm talking about. The people that end on that saying it's all people because I got some really good people. I got a sprinkled guy that saw us and I got a plumber guy that saw us and we got a little nutrition guy that saw us. But I got some nut cases out there who, I don't know what kind of business they're running or, how they think that they're what they're doing is good customer service. And this confirms it. This guy posted in the comment section of the video. This lunacy. Ha ha ha ha. All right, if, you know, I don't know if you guys are finding this humor, so you might just think it's ridiculous and you might actually be annoyed by it if you are, I don't even listen to it. It doesn't matter. I need to rent and I need to release my depression because I don't want to go scaring people into being so petrified that they can't even eat their lunch or their dinner or their breakfast or maybe they have to go see a psychiatrist after I stopped by their shot because I'm so insane. Day to number within insane are ax muscle red.

In the morning is when cortisol levels are highest. That's just our natural circadian rhythms dictate that. That's why I was always a big believer of growth hormone in your injections in the morning. To try to counteract some of that catabolic effect of cortisol. Now, cortisol is important because when your blood sugar drops, there are two hormones that can raise blood sugar. Glucogone, which is produced by your pancreas, kind of does the opposite of insulin. It takes whatever glucose or glycogen storage in the muscles of the liver and it liberates it. It turns it into glucose, puts it into the blood sugar. A cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands, can raise blood sugar, but it does it by a different mechanism. It takes amino acids and usually in the liver a little bit in the kidneys and it converts it into glucose. That's known as gluconeogenesis. So it's actually making new glucose that was never around. Whereas glucogone takes existing stored glucose and liberates it so that they work by different mechanisms. So you don't want to have a zero cortisol because it's a safety net in your body. In other words, your liver is always monitoring and your pancreas for that matter. How much blood glucose is there when you're sleeping at night a lot of times, you know, your blood glucose can drop. That's when cortisol raises blood sugar while you're sleeping. That's why people who don't have good blood sugar control notice when they wake up in the morning that fasting blood sugars can be high. Because their bodies can't manage. Because think about it when you produce glucose into the bloodstream, the pancreas has to release insulin. So you can absorb that glucose. If your insulin production is not optimal for whatever reason you're taking growth hormone, your pancreas stress that, maybe it's a little burnt out, you might be watering on diabetes. You're not going to be able to have good blood sugar control. So to get back to the question, cortisol is important, but we don't want excessive amounts of it in the body.

All right, television on rxmuscle.com. This is as Dave better note as hashtag as Dave brought to you by species nutrition visit speciesnutrition.com. I'm your host of the Farouki Viz. Is your 30 minute question an answer show with Dave Plumbo all your questions on diet, training, supplementation, IFBV, pros, news, competitions, whatever's on your mind. It's all on the tables. You now throw today, pull on Bo Dave yesterday, you did a video. I don't know if to call it shocking news, but it was news. Maybe news that some had expected for quite some time that flex Lewis announcing that this Olympia will be his final 212 show. Rumors about of what his plans are going to be in 2020 going forward, but if you want to expand a little upon that for those who haven't seen the video yet. So last week I got a text message from one of the guys who emails me a lot and he's like says this is flexed Lewis's last Olympia. I said, where do you have this? I don't think he heard it from Ian Valier. I don't even know how it was. It was a weird like source like that. I don't know. I said, let me text flex. This flex and I will text each other on occasion. So I flexed some action. He had just texted me earlier that day at question. I said flex, is this your last year is doing the 212? And he's like, oh, rumours rumours don't believe everything you hear is like that. And I said, all right, I kind of dismissed it. And then a couple of days later he posted this on Instagram. So obviously he had known about it. I think he's just burnt out at this point. I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that he wants a quick body building. I think he's just like, you know what? If I win this year at 7 times, I won the Olympia. I can't gain any more weight. I love body building lifting. I'm still a young man. I want to put more size on, but I can't because I can't make the weight. You know, every year I come in and people criticize me because I'm too flat or I don't look the best I look and then two weeks later everyone says, oh, why don't you look like you look like this? No, no, the guys got to make a weight class. So I think what he he figures is he's got nothing left to prove in the 212 anymore. And I think he's going to, he's talking about taking 2 years like night to be until 2020. But I think we'll see him in 19. I think he can easily do an open show and possibly win it. Probably if he didn't want at the end of this year, probably could do it. But certainly by next year he could definitely do it. And I think we're going to see that. I'm glad he know it's exciting. He's the guy kind of guy that's not afraid to lay it on the line. He doesn't like to take the conservative route. He has nothing left to prove. If he never competed again, he has enough businesses to make enough money to support himself. So he doesn't really need that for that. If he's going to compete again, it's going to be because he wants to compete again. And onto his terms. And I think that that's a really good way to do it because that's the way that's the smart way to do it. He's lucky. He's the Olympia champ. He has the ability to do that and he's got money coming in from all his businesses. You know, I actually found out something else. I didn't really realize this because he was asking me about a bearded dragons, which are a type of reptile because he's known as the Welsh dragon. And I said, you really should get, I was giving him to try to get him. It's a snake breeding. I didn't know this. He used to breed birds. He was like 17 years old. Finches and parrachutes and parrots and homing pigeons. All kinds of racing pigeons. He said he was making more money breeding birds than he was from his contractions. He had later life as a body model, which is kind of ironic. So he's a kind of guy that could do it all. That's the time I think I relate well to him. We have the same kind of unusual obsessions that we get into. And I know he was breeding dogs for while he's still my buddy. So I think the flex is a great, great personality in our business. I think he's a good role model. And I think the fact that he's making a decision that this, you know, out of the clear blue sky is going to be good for the business and good for bodybuilding. So again, that video right now at rwsponsile.com and the RX also YouTube channel. Let's go to the questions. The first two questions from the Dave Plumbo experience after the first question. What do you think are the top three questions? Exercise is rather to build intercostals. Would you put, if you could put it in order, which would be the best first, do you think is something we should train? Intercostals are not the external beliefs that we think down here. They're right under your pack muscles. If you get really lean, I'm always leaving. You could see like this three little finger like muscles here that kind of sit across your ribs and they kind of connect the packs. It looks like they connect the packs to the abdominal cavity. And they look really cool when you're in shape. Doring the eight type of huge intercostals. If you remember back in the day when he went into that front last spread, they were just a pop right out. He was a big pull over guy. He used to use that old-nortal machine and do pull over for it. He was convinced that built huge, big lats and gave you better width. Whether that's sure, I don't know, but they certainly definitely work the intercostals up there without a doubt. A lot of people confuse serratus with intercostals. Intercostals kind of rib muscles. The serratus kind of the ones that kind of stick out there that's finger like muscles. The muscles that we're talking about are worked by definitely dumbbell pullovers, machine pullovers, anything we use in a stretch-down position. You're going to see that. Even if you do it like crunches with a rope, you're going to work those muscles to some degree. Should they be worked? I think if they're doing indirectly work through some of these exercises that I just mentioned, I think that's fine. They're not really going to add a tremendous amount of size, you buy it. They may add some detail to your physique. There's no reason to be massively training these things like that. It's its own muscle group. That's a little bit of overkill. Second question again from the Dave Pulombo experience app. Dave, how or what inlipolize for example type? There's a metabolite of olive oil called OEA that has some appetite-suppressing effects, which works pretty effectively. Irving Gia is an herb, also known as African mango, which doesn't curb appetite directly, but what it does is it makes you more sensitive to the hormone leptin. A lot of us have heard the term leptin. Leptin is released after you eat by the brain. It basically tells your body that you're not hungry anymore. It shuts off appetite. Ironically, in people who are very obese, they have the highest leptin levels, which doesn't make sense because you would think, well, if there's a lot of leptin, they shouldn't be hungry. Why are these people eating so much and getting so overweight? The problem is that they're not responding to the leptin. The leptin receptors are not very sensitive. Their body keeps cranking out more and more leptin and their body can't respond to it. What African mango does is it actually sensitizes the leptin receptor to leptin so that you body will shut down your appetite. Those are two ingredients that have an appetite curbing effect. It curbs appetite, but it doesn't make you not want to eat. That's another problem. I think some people, you don't want to not ever want to. I know people who diet, they can't eat, they feel nauseous. It doesn't do that. It shuts down your appetite when you don't eat. If you've eaten something, boom, your brain releases leptin. You respond to it. Appetite is curbed. Let's go to our Instagram questions. First one from Hoodman 521. Dave, why don't guys in girls try to achieve that freaking post show look on stage rather than the flat look? Most people prefer how they look three days after a show in the gym versus on stage. Full hydrated and vascular. It's a that much of a gamble. You know, I would go to the gym like a week after a show and I'd be like 15 pounds heavier. I'd be like 290 and people would be like, yeah, it's right. All the people who don't know anything about competing tell me that. Being blown up in a tank top in the gym and having veins everywhere is not going to win shows. It looks good in the gym. It's freaky. I'm sure to take pictures. It's like, well, this is cool. You put yourself up on stage like that with guys that are shrink wrapped, dry, hard and showing tons of detail. You're going to say that guy is about a week or two out from competition. You might say he looks good, but the people can say he's off. He's a little too full. He's not dry. He's not showing his my detail and graininess. That's there's a difference between a gym look and a stage look. Steve Weinberg once said to me, he goes, in a tank top he goes, you could be Mr. Olympia. He goes, you know, that was a compliment to me. But you know, when I took my shirt off, I didn't have the tiniest ways that it had the greatest tape or I just genetic it structurally. It wasn't that good. But in the gym, what a tank top. You don't see that. Jimmy Quinn too. In the gym, what a tank top. You threw away his Mr. Olympia, it was huge. And that's just life. I mean, and so you have to differentiate between the stage and the gym. There's two different looks and you have to, you can't try to duplicate what you look like in the gym with a pump and do that on stage. It doesn't translate. Good one here from stolen. At the top two, you might want to take a second before you answer it. They've won. Dave and your honest opinion. He's Kevin Lebroni only proved himself wrong with his comeback. Anyone who comes back at over the age of 50 is not wrong and can never be wrong. Make it only be a winner at that point because he came back. He brought a level of muscularity. A lot of people thought he couldn't get back. He raised his popularity through the roof. His followers were insane on social media. He got a generation who never heard of him to understand who he was. Appreciate his legacy. And get a chance to actually see him compete one more time even if he wasn't at his best. So no, I don't think it was a bad mood. Just like I don't think what Flex Wheeler did was a bad mood. Thank God nothing happened with his health and everything like that. He did everything safely. But you gave the fans a chance to see him one more time. Even if it wasn't the way you wanted to see him, at least you'll remember, oh, I've seen Flex Wheeler on stage. A lot of people never got a generation, our generation that's out here and right now that's competing really didn't get that chance to see them. So now they did. So I think those come back to a good for the sport. I don't think necessarily anyone really thought that they were going to, I mean, unsighted for me predicting the love running was going to win the Olympia. I don't think anyone else thought that they were going to do anything. So it added a little bit of excitement for the weekend. Golden physique outside of natural dioretics. How do you combat massive water retention in your ankles? Well, first of all, why are you getting massive water retention in the ankles number one? Now is it because you just got off a show, a contest, and you're rebounding water wise. If that's the case, it's a good idea to say on some dioretics to lose that water, whether they're be a die-side herbal diorics, whatever you want to use. If you're walking around in the offseason with crazy swollen ankles, that could be a problem. You might want to go get yourself checked out. Blood pressure might be too high. You might, your heart may not be pumping efficiently, or you just might be too overweight, which is something that happens as well. And the blood pools down in your legs and it can't get back to your heart. So it's not good. It's once in a while there'd be a little swollen if you get an F and airplane or you're on your feet all day as one thing. When you're walking around with crazy swollen, hitting a team all the time, that's not good. That Tracy life, I'm considering getting a colon hydrotherapy two weeks out, yes or no. Once got a colon, I was about two weeks after my show. I felt good for a day, but the problem was that it comes all back again. You can't do it right before a show because it's too irritating to your stomach lining, and something that I'm assuming it's your colon lining, and that could backfire on you. So my answer to that question is I probably wouldn't do it. If you took a fiber supplement, a high potency fiber supplement, like fiber lies, twice a day, you wouldn't need to do a colon because you're constantly cleansing your colon on a regular basis. And the longer you're on a fiber supplement, the less fecal retention you have at all the time. I can't tell you how many people don't empty their colon completely. They think they go to the bathroom on a regular basis. They think they're emptying themselves with their actually retaining a lot of fecal matter, because they just don't have enough fiber in their diet. So once again, try fiber, as I promise you once you try it, you won't ever stop using it, because it's going to be that good for you. Jay Hampo, Dave, I know you're a big advocate of taking time off the gym at least once a year or being on vacation, etc. But how would you deal with the negative psychological or physiological aspects of it, feeling that your body is like crap, you're games, etc. I have to admit, when I was competing, I could never take off two weeks from the gym. I don't, I think maybe once I did it when I had my guy in commas, he removed, but other than that, I just couldn't do it. I just, I like to gym, you know, so I maybe take three, four days off and then I would go back. And that's the one thing I probably regretted. I think if I would have taken more days off, given my body some rest after shows, I probably probably would have benefited to be more. I don't think it would have changed anything, maybe, but maybe it would have, who knows? So I think what you have to understand is that taking days off is not showing weakness, it's not setting you back if it's planned, okay? If you're just one of these guys every other week, you're missing five days in the gym, that's not good, obviously. But if you know you've trained pretty hard for a month or two in the row, three months in a row, pretty hard, and you think you feel like you need some time off, taking four or five days off in the gym or a week off in the gym is not going to set you back. If anything, you'll, you'll be bigger, you'll grow better, I guarantee it. I wish I had this knowledge when I was competing, because I know it would have benefited me tremendously. I always rationalize, well, I only trained one body part a day, and I take two days off a week, so I should be fine. But the truth in the matter is that even that's intense, even that's tough for your body to every single week recover from that. So at least once a year, it's probably a good idea to take three or four weeks off in the gym if you can do it, if you can handle it mentally, if not take a week or two off, at least. Like those genetics, why do people recommend taking really high dose of letro last few weeks of a prep, a friend did this, and had blood work showing no estrogen in his body at all, only other people to show numbers that were those who underwent chemo. Also high dose of proviron leading in their show does a work, so let's go with the first one about letro leading into a show. Here's the first deal with estrogen control. Your body is going to convert a certain amount of your testosterone that you're ingesting or injecting or producing naturally into estrogen and DHT. If you take an aromotace inhibitor like letrozole or aromotace or femara, or letrole that's femara, or aromotace, or aromotace, you're going to block the conversion of some of that testosterone into estrogen, which is good. If you take too much of an aromotace inhibitor, you'll inhibit all the conversion of testosterone and which case your estrogen levels will be so low that number one you won't have a sex drive. Number two, your antigen receptors lose their sensitivity. So you go flat usually and number three, you don't have a sex drive. I know I said it twice. That's a problem. No one wants to feel like that. It basically chemically casherates you. Not good and you don't look good on it. So once again, you want your estrogen low, but you want it on the normal side of low, not on the pathological order or the two low side. Once again, because your body won't respond, you need a little estrogen to sensitize those antigen receptors to sex drive, to muscle building, to all the other processes that are involved with antigen use in the body. And that's just the way it is. Doing too much of anything is no good. You gotta find balance. Barbarian B, Dave Wood Body Fat, would you let yourself go to in the offseason? What would you say is maximum you'd recommend? When I competed and I was trying to grow, I said to myself, let's see how much food it takes for you to get fat. If you hit that point, we start getting fat. We back down. In the course of my body, I never found the amount of food that it took me to get fat, which means I never got fat. So I don't know. I just basically couldn't eat any more food. But I would find another way to eat enough to grow. But at some point, I couldn't eat enough anymore. Because I kept saying, well, what if I ate more? What if I grew faster? Or I could eat anymore. There was no more food I could eat. I just couldn't physically put any more food down my throat. And that's the way it is now. To ask you for the average person, what's a body fat that's acceptable? Not acceptable. I would say, once your body fat is a guy, it starts creeping over 15%. You start to get sloppy. If you're over 20% your weight too high. I think that the ideal range to stay in is probably anywhere from, obviously, under 10 would be great. But the most people can't get under 10% by the time. For anywhere from 10 to 15%, 10 to 17% by the time, is the highest that would go. Everything or nothing training, trend below in, and it's a thanks on mental health, eye depression, intelligence, or ability to think straight. My question is, does trend cause issues with the brain? And if so, it can become that. You said trend below, right? Yes. The problem with trend below is that it's four times more an energetic than testosterone. That means it has four times an engine content. Andgredens of what makes you aggressive. They're what stimulate you. They would make you hold more glycogen in the muscle. They make you strong. You put four times that you naturally have on a gram for grab basis like a testosterone into your body. Now you're almost like an insane person. It's enhancing everything in your brain and making you move faster. It's making you metabolism go quicker. It's moving your GI track faster. That's why a lot of people get upset. Some makes it and die real from using trend. It makes your brain work faster. So you can't relax and sleep at night. But it makes you strong. It makes you retain more glycogen in the muscle. It makes you look good. So guys deal with it. But it does have a lot of side effects. And that's a problem. You got to realize that. And it's dose dependent. So recently, when I work with my guys, I've been actually having them use less trend alone. OK, I know the old or maybe the new way of thinking is, no testosterone just do tons of trend alone. That's not going to work. I'm telling you, you're going to wind up f***ing killing your girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever. You're going to get into a fight. You're going to break up. Whatever the case is, it's the ultimate relationship ender that's this drug. But it works. My advice to you is just to stand low dose. 50 milligrams three times a week. Or 50 milligrams every other day is more than enough. Muscle by Mona's day will you be at the Olympia this year. That's the 100,000 dollar question. I don't know. To be honest, I haven't thought about it yet. If we get a sponsor, I probably might make my trip out there, obviously. If we don't, I think I might just hang tight at the homestead, you know, with the kids. And everything like that. I really like the Olympia. It's probably the only weekend I really do enjoy going to a cusside for the Arnold. I'll think about it. I haven't got to the point where I actually have absolutely have to make a decision yet. But we'll see. It's going to be a good year to go, obviously. Phil, he'd go in for number eight and a lot of other, you know, classic physique taken off through the roof, the two 12, it's for exluisest last year. So, it certainly would be a nice year to go. But, you know, I might just call quits and take the whole year off and then start again 2019 back going to the some of the big shows. We'll see it up. And I won't say no yet. Good day. One ZWDV. I'm having issues with my right knee. I had surgery on a back in 2006, ACL, Manisk is whenever I'm doing heavy leg extensions, I'm feeling pain in the middle portion of the knee. Squats and leg press aren't bad only if I wrap my knees. Do you think wanting BPC won't 507 will be a good idea? Or should I get things checked out first? I mean, you could use the healing cap by its BPC 157, the TB 500 is good. Definitely if it's injury, you're going to heal. But the question is why are you getting irritation, why are you getting tendonitis or whatever, whatever, contravalasure, you know, whatever kind of information getting under that knee cap, why is it occurring? Usually it's biomechanical, meaning that the angle with your muscles are moving is some kind of rubbing going on. Now, if it's under the knee cap, it could be like a whole contravalasure that's the rubbing away of the cartilage under the knee cap. If your muscles are just misaligned a little bit or it's a leg press is a weird angle, you might just get beginning rubbing under the back. In which case, you might want to try to change the leg extension of a senior using, to change the angle a little bit. Usually I've seen this happen to people before. The classic sign that there's really not anything seriously wrong is that you can squat and leg press because you can change your position. Think about it. Like the extension, you're very locked into a certain position. With the squat, the deadlift, the leg press, the hack squat, you can kind of position your feet where you get a comfortable position so the knee cap sits in a nice place. You might just have a tracking problem with the knee cap which sits directly on top of the, or the patel that sits directly at the top of the femur is rotator or moved over an inch or two in which case you're getting rubbing. That's why when you wrap your knees, you're kind of wrapping your knee cap into the right position and then it feels good when you're training it. You might want to lay off leg extensions for a couple weeks to just do the stuff that doesn't hurt, let that heal up, see if that works. If not, you might have to then go to maybe get some ART done, active release techniques, maybe some massage in that area, kind of break up the scar tissue. Matt Tracy, I struggle keeping volume heading into a show. What do you think of maintaining oatmeal two weeks now prior to the show? I have it with a meal, one with stevia, small banana and one tablespoon of almond butter. I don't know if eating a bowl, you're following your full misproblem, you'll be honest with you. Firstly, you got to figure out why you're flat. You can be flat because you're an ID in a fat, it's just as easily as you can be flat if you're an ID in a car. So, I would try to replace the fat first, especially if you're on a CT or on a contest eye. Then if that doesn't work, then you can play with adding little small amounts of carbs throughout the day, increasing whatever you're eating, if you're eating any, to see if that will fill you out a little bit. But I wouldn't start doing crazy, knee-jerk stuff. Brent Setsko, any end is that a good idea to cut fiber lies last week's of contest prep or not. Now, that's what you need the most. Catch when people get constipated when they carve off and they take the water out. Now, you keep the fiber lies right up to the day before the show. The last dose of fiber lies should be that. It looks like if you had a Saturday morning show, you'll last dose would be Friday night. When you're bright before you start drinking, do a dose of fiber lies, so you keep everything moving through you. It's a great feeling when you don't have to ever stress that I'm going through the bathroom, you know you're going to go. Once I started using a silly, amazed five or supplement, and then I made my own eventually, that's when I never had stress anymore competing because I always knew my stomach would be flat. Interesting one here from the atomic beast. It's a question that we get in, I guess, different iterations. Why do you think most open-class competitors don't have deeply cut abs like classic and men's physique competitors. Jay had a very tight, had very tight abs, but besides, Rully, in the current lineup, why don't the others have blocky abs? I think the guys are just not dieting as hard because they want to come in. They're so worried about coming in big or they're in shape and then they're overcarving or maybe using insulin and they're blurring the definition on their abs. Because a lot of these guys have great rest of their bodies. They glutes or they hamstrings or shred it and then they have these kind of watery-looking abs. I think that's from the drugs they're taking. I really do. On point fitness trainers, your thoughts, Dave, on raw juicing. I started raw fruit and vegetable juicing a few days ago along with a healthy balanced diet. But what would it be optimal for longevity and health to juice daily or is it just not necessary? But juicing is good. There's no doubt about it. You can get some good nutrients. A lot of people who juice though use a lot of fruits. They use apples and carrots and other fruits. But carrots have a high sugar content. Those high sugar fruits and vegetables will add a lot of calories and a lot of unnecessary empty carbs to the effect of what you're doing. You're picking just green stuff that you just juice. Cubecombers, celery, some broth, living in a mountain rock, and maybe kale. You'll be fine. If you're using the juicers and excuse to make yourself a fruit smoothie, then you're probably just making things worse because you're putting a tremendous amount of sugar into your body. K-sime can el-dave. I hate to show more than all right. If creatinine is commonly increased due to extra muscle mass, meat and proteins and creatinine supplements, what kind of levels do you usually see in top-open competitors? What is the typical GFR you see from them? How do you approach their plan differently? Well, taking creatinine is not going to raise creatinine necessarily. A lot of these upper-level guys have high creatinine levels on blood work, which indicates that the kidneys are not filtering as well. It could be due to high blood pressure. It could be due to eating on tonne of protein. It could be due to breaking that enormous amount of muscle from the gym. So you can't just need your, say, this guy's a kidney failure. He's got high creatinine. No, he's probably just, you know, trusting his body out a little bit. And it's probably very, very reversible. And I've seen that happen many a time. People contact me because they panic. I send them a detox program through the reti-tox to take this. One of the ingredients and one of the supplements I recommend you take during the detox is kidney stuff. Stay on that for another three months after the two or three weeks detox that you do. Usually every single person I'd help to creatinine comes down from that. So just if you have a problem with creatinine, you can always, you know, shoot me an email and I'll be more than happy to give you some advice. D would, 20, I only have access to a diuretic, the flushes both potassium and sodium. Is it still okay to use a quarter tab the night before or should I stay away completely? Yeah, I think I think I, look, I don't like to use L-6 and Deminex because you're right. It does, this guy's right. It does the plea both potassium and sodium, whereas dies I only deplete sodium and it doesn't and it retains potassium. But sometimes you can't get, you know, and if you're only taking maybe one or two halves of a L-6, you know, of 20 milligrams, you know, maybe twice a day, you're not going to really cramp anyway. So, and you're not, even if you did, it wouldn't be because of potassium loss because you're not going to lose that much from taking a mild, I reticulate that. So, a little bit of L-6 is okay. If you start getting carried away and taking, you know, 40 milligrams, five times a day, you're going to wind up in the hospital. Couple more, this one from Howard Nine, what were the compounds you put Boston on when he put on the most size? He was mentioning in a recent random video along the lines of GRPH, IGF, etc. Well, Boston was, when he was a teenager, and he gained a lot of weight up to the time you were 21 years old. He was on the basics, he's on testosterone, and that compoies, you know, we would switch to testosterone, tremble on testosterone, and that got, he was doing some little bit of G-8, you know. He wasn't, he wasn't accessible by using anything until he got carried away and got to use it, and then he just took off on what's on doing cookie stuff. But initially he was doing the right thing, and he was looking good, and he was growing, and he was responding, and you know, I wish he was to put a state in that direction. But, you know, Boston does what he lost in what to do. Last question, this one from Mike Roddabe, what is your current training routine? You want to know when every team was this week? I got to the gym today. After I got my teeth cleaned, the dentist died. I snuffed over to the gym, and called him a man, and my friend said, can I go to the gym? Did you mind? She's like, fine. So I did my whole entire body, because I know there's no way she's going to let me go to Marvee, because usually I go Monday, and either Thursday or Monday and Friday. So I did everything. I did everybody party. I don't know how I did. I got all done today, or because I'm not lifting that heavy. And I'm done for the week. That's just the way it is. So I structure much differently nowadays. I don't do my job. But back in the day, I used to do what I told people. I used to do an A-day split. So over eight days, I would train six of those days. Two of those days would be, you know, I do a little extra calf work. But I like to have the extra time off to allow my body to recover properly. That is going to do for this episode of A-Stayve again brought to you by Species Nutrition Visit speciesnutrition.com for date, Lumbo, and our producer Tyler Shore. I'm Siti Furuki. We'll see you next week.

I'm Dave Palombo, founder of Species Nutrition. From my earliest body-building days, I believe in only putting the best in my body, and that lives on in the Species Nutrition line of products, I put my name and reputation on every bottle of Species Nutrition products. If you want to be your apps, you'll best join the evolution. Welcome back to another exciting episode of After Hour. I'm the Palombo, and I'm of course joined by John Romano. I think we try to start today's show, John and I for a second, so we can get a few words and edge-wise before the rest of the maniacs join us. It elevates our intellect. Or the appearance of it, you know. Now I want to talk about the little later in the show, Lewis Jurenell is going to be joining us, the Big Saxi. Big six. Who ran for mayor as we know out there in the ocean side a couple of months back, and he's been fighting City Hall, so to speak, because of keeping the gym open and all the regulations over there in California. Obviously you heard Quomo was just resigned, I don't know if you heard that. Thank God. And then we knew that was coming. So he's out. We'll talk about him. I'm sure he's balancing a lot of a few things to say about that. It's such a crazy political arena right now. A new study was done in South Korea, and I want to talk about this with Lewis when he comes on 76,000 people involved with a study their lifestyle and habits and their risk of contracting COVID, number one, having a problem in terms of sickness with COVID, and then of course death. And you'll find once we go over this study, well, don't put it up your title title, wait to Lewis comes on. But this is correct. I got correct you, which is 212,700,600. Yeah, yes. Korean adults aged plus or minus 20 years. I thought it was 76,000. No, 212 right here. Okay, right, you're right. They looked, I think they looked back in all those two. Yes. What's going on, guys? So we're celebrating Cuomo's resignation. I was just watching it. That's what they took. What a pathetic speech that was by him and his lawyer. What did they say? I didn't listen. And basically, basically, I hug everybody. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I'm really sorry. Just bullshit. Just if you could come up with the most bullshit excuse, that even wouldn't be. He's probably like, look, Trump admitted to grab in there. Pussies, I didn't do that. You know. No, you know what you're saying? He basically saying right with John said that he hogs when he kisses everybody. And he's saying that they're taking it out of contact basically. Like, I didn't mean it the way they're taking it. But there's 170 people. And now they're saying there's even more than just stuck his tongue in it throwing suck us finger up them. But that's it. You know, I'm with that. Yeah, right. That's how I read everyone. But here's the, there's some countries. That's, that's the, that's the one. Yes. And a fart burping it to fucking, right, yes. Yeah. That's in fucking can say that that's showing, wow, I really dug that meal, you know. Yeah. But they, but, are we on? We're on. We're on, we're on. Okay, so what do we start? No, but did the other thing is he's, he's a, he's got a lot of trouble. Because if they start, he's all the flexion he killed you know how many fucker people that guy killed thousands. Do Trump sent that boat? you know what I mean he said the boy set up you know the trepid all that he said and fucking nobody used it even a Jacob job at center nobody was using it because you know he was sticking everybody into old age on the church that he had is a you know nursery on he just want nursing on he just wanted fucking you know uh... to do things his own way you know he i think we wanted was he was hoping and it would initially was working he was becoming very popular with doing those those week does daily updates people wanted to hear the latest and greatest people loved him miserable news you know he think it i'm gonna run for president after this i'm gonna remember when the presidency from this you know well at one point they were talking about oh my god he should be the president yeah but he likes to play mob you know i mean play mafia his father i hate his father too you know i mean it's a new mario plomo yeah i mean it's a it's a joke but you know it's just a i i just get an issue some how come all of a sudden with the uh... a little sidebar here with the coveting how come who is your own what's up exactly how how could all of a sudden the covet's bed in a fucking what in the summer when summer's post to be like you know all everybody's vitamin d's up to fucking sons out and uh... and traditionally no virus uh... it's the usually drives in the summer you only drives how come it's driving now because they're because they're not accurate accurate numbers they're fudge in the numbers by attributing everything to covet everything yeah you know just like anything else you give a bunch of rats poison if it'll start killing them and any stops killing you know why could the rafting developing a mune is that that's that's that's another thing but the that reporting is what the main problem is because the reporting is what indicates the severity and the actions taken by people who have some authority the problem with the numbers is that they're all off their all wrong they're co-mingled the regular influences gone we we we we we we we i'm how that along with a moment of holding with the common cold and we weren't even trying when we cure that right and then and and but you can still get a flu shot a regular flu shot for something that's not even there anymore okay so you got that both of the combined the covid shot with the flu shot in here now coming up you'll be able to get it don't condone and he's right here to get a throne HIV shot and it's a dog joke it's every time a five-fucking friend used to get to flu shot and every he got to flu every year i don't believe it but when i was saying about the reporting Greg is it if you go to the hospital with a hang nail okay and you sum out and you go under surgery and you die from the hang nail surgery but you test positive for covid they will list your death as covid you're right now i heard that you have a heart attack and die and they tested you're causing death is covid not the heart attack any cause of death that has covid associated with the person whether they have it or test positive for it they listed cause of death is covid and that's absolutely wrong and here we are lockin down places, convaccines, mandatory some jobs you can't even have anymore without getting vaccinated and all of these numbers are fake plus i think the vaccine is creating that's another thing because creating a virus to communicate that's a bad thing well it's also causing the illness and it's going to also cause socialism here because once you start with that, let's get to our job you're a pamphlet you know what i mean let's get to our job yeah, more people have died on days one two and three after the covid shot and all other evaccines combined 45 that between 11 and 45 thousand depending on who you're listening let's let's look at a more positive aspect of this whole thing which and that's why i brought Lewis in because Lewis has been fighting city hall over there in uh out is Jim and California there for for over over a year now obviously and what what's the latest update there Lewis today are they unlocked out what what what's your status up there with the Jim i think he's gone i think we're lost here yeah nope that was a little bit of what you guys do but anyway it was he's here in me ranty yeah I couldn't take it but John don't you think though to summertime bro need summertime to comical to flu everything a you you why I don't think the virus is something kind of that's great that because of what i just explained that's not such a hot summer to be when staying inside Greg that's the problem that's why they're not here in the building it that's the important well this definitely is definitely a lot more cases here i know i understand John i agree with you i know that i know that you know if you throw a fart that's COVID i agree with you with that said the numbers are definitely skewed but but these people with this papers and a vaccine and all the sudden shit you know you know i i think you united or Delta think Delta they they don't if you don't get back said you can't work for Delta yeah i mean i got a lot of people the only people should be able to dictate i think the military i think if you're in the military you don't have you you have no right you really they shot they shoot you so close shit you got to be you can't even have a choice you're right that's the only place i think that is it's that you you have that's been going on since there's been no it's not you got your you you you signed that away you said that i let's i want to go over this study because you know what there's been a lot of you know the the first thing they seem to close in the gym as always whenever they want to walk things down which is and we've been saying you know since the beginning that obviously exercise is important about low-ish you back okay good sorry no it took a it took a turn turn your phone sideways and we get you you full view he can't say like this guy yeah yeah yeah all right so i was about to talk about this study lowest they did have a big sample size John of over 200,000 but 60, 76,000 people actually completed the questionnaire and everything like that and that's that's the important statistic and of those 76 people who completed the general health examination and went through everything they found that that the and these people all worked out you know these people who exercised there was only they found that there was a tremendous reduction in people who actually got the disease the severity of the disease when they got it and there was almost no death and he was like what like 45 death is something like that of 700 over 700,000 people excuse me 70,000 people sorry oh 76,000 people who fit who actually filled out the uh and went through all the uh the testing which they were able to conclude that you know people who exercise regularly have a much greater chance of number one resisting getting the illness number two recovering very quickly number three and I dying from it and so why they would close gyms now with this data at their disposal um you would think you'd have to be a freaking moron right and the Lewis you want to speak to this you would say they don't care about this dude I mean I said the one from the beginning that exercise was the best vaccine yeah that you could have it's the best way to stop it we've had over we've had over 200,000 people come through my gym week we log every single visitor from last May yeah and that one case has been attributed to our gym we've had someone who was a member of our gym that caught it at a party came to work down here for two days with it didn't spread it to anybody here wow so it the people here just how I haven't gotten it all year and I've been working at gym it you'd think this would be like you know deathcon one yeah yeah very close to everyone right man smerr like we just straight the whole north coast of California here whether the gym being open during a pandemic we the only gym opening in Southern California is crazy but yeah there's people it is this no other explanation for you just healthier look at 78 percent of the people that got put in the ICU either overweight or obese yeah right 78 percent of the people that got put in the ICU they're overweight beasts no one knows no like no like guy with six pack abs working out you know drinking you know green leaf shakes and stuff that's going in the hospital except bill films now there's always one exception you're gonna have people that may have you know other illnesses that we're not even aware of they feel full of Chad fucking COVID yeah yeah but you know what bill was a little overweight you know when he was you know going through this last winter so you know I don't think that's look this is about and the gyms are a prime example to support my my opinion this is the only thing this is about is the vaccine that's all this is about they want it vaccine the world many times over so we're gonna get we made that's why you got that's why you got not one shot but two now they're talking about a booster now you got variants that's gonna require three more vaccines and then then more is that the new variants come out this is the biggest scam in the entire world because there's seven billion people they want all of them vaccinated and this is what a way to fight a war I mean John this is money this is every jab every jab is dollar somebody's making money and the more people they scare and promote and get to get back and the fact that they closed what's first to close the gyms why it's the best place to be listen I don't believe it's just a divine seeing a push in a vaccine so to take it for us you have like proof of vaccine that paper it's a fucking democratic fucking thing in my opinion it's a whole thing on the other side of the track because you're shit yeah wait no money and power go together they're shit in their pants because they know that come fucking the mid-turns there's gonna be trouble a lot of the fucking republicans are free of a red wave all of a sudden now they say to you oh you get vaccinated you know we don't you know get vaccinated you get your freedom now you vaccinate they want to they want proof they want your papers and once you start with papers you need papers to vote right but they want you to go get papers to prove you vaccinated because once you go once you they get those papers it's gonna be like fucking that's how socialism starts show me a paper you can't do this show me a paper you're in New York there's certain restaurants you can't go to unless you show your paper you can't go to the gym now Greg there unless you have a vaccination do you know that's horrible to move these around you know I go to the gym I go to the gym you're vaccinated that's all that that that rigged oh I had no choice because my sister is really really sick and you know she's got stage 4 kids but she's had it before you're in and out of the hospital she said it's 20 20 hour surgery in June and she's got to have another surgery in two weeks here so I had to go I even made a video put on my Instagram I had they would not let me in that hospital to see my sister if I didn't so I'm sorry I'm not a I'm not a person it's for the vaccine but to see my sister and make sure to you know I could do what I got to do with the hospital man I got to do it and you said come to the the political practice if they told you do it you're kidding you're a Democrat you're a Democrat you fell victim to the demands that they're putting you know you have me by the ball everyone has a choice everyone my course not well it's when it comes to my family I came my family comes I'll take that job that's how they get I'm gonna get vaccinated they know that you know I tell everybody you don't understand if you don't you know I had to get a whole video I'm not for the vaccine but they had me by the balls I'm not gonna not I'm not gonna not see my sister my sister is you know very sick you know very you have no idea it's a whole lot of stuff but we could not we could not get into the hospital there demand was because my first one my sister's already been in a unit where even before they would say were COVID you had to wear like a fucking hazmat suit you had to wear the mask you had to wear you know who she has a very rare can so if you have all that equipment on why doesn't matter if you're vaccinated I'd tattooed I say that's what I say but they won't be able to see but see the vaccine is supposed to protect you from yeah the disease not there's no you know what it is right no they're trying to say that I could be a carrier you're still a carrier even though you have the vaccine that's what they found so the vaccine is relevant yeah I really get a relevant argument that what I'm saying is that they will if my sister gets any kind of like the slightest little thing she could you can still give a door even that being vaccinated I know I'm just telling you what they're telling me we're talking about the hypocrisy of these idiots they're telling people to get a vaccine that doesn't even prevent you from giving the disease to someone else I know I agree with and I notice people watching this right now about you do the fact yeah I did because of my family I had no choice either I don't go to see my sister what body the virus is not going to be that great what body will they won't get the vaccine because they want to go to the gym so you know I know people that they ran to get the vaccine when they found that they weren't going to be able to go to the gym I'm not going to mention names but I don't believe I don't believe I believe there are some people just people died from taking fucking you know a bad shot of something you know I mean all I know is my friends who's a fat fuck you know they he had a he has a defibrillator in his heart he has a fucking who he's got all kinds of shit you have no idea and he fucking took the goddamn you know the guy that she has gained fake did the game face yeah he he fucking he took the fucking Johnson and Johnson and nothing happened to him so I said if I get a take a vaccine that's where I'm going to take is if he fucking survived that shit and got no fucking you know I mean JJ yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no but you know what I'm saying I didn't I'm against this and I'm not for the vaccine but I had no choice either that I don't see my sister and I'm not going to go well fuck you I'm not going to see my sister that you know and I'm not going to do that you know what I mean I said well that's what it takes I'll take a bullet if it was to save our life you know what I mean well that's what I got to that's how I get to get everyone it's funny when they first came out they didn't have enough vaccines people were killing each other to get the vaccine now they have so many they don't want to do it I'm they're paying you they're giving you free fucking uh uh oil paper rolls if you go to the CBS you're here and you're gonna get a 100 they got a hundred dollar bribe and some cities to go get a back to the E do you look this psycho here this psycho I'm in the city everybody's wearing a mask it's fucking I don't wear a mask I don't fuck away the mask at all you ever you know how to go in the hospital you know when it goes to the hospital see or after we had a mask they make you wear the mask they give you the mask to wear and as soon as I come out in that fucking hospital the minute step out the door is fucking boom I get rid of it but everybody and he looked at you like like you're like fucking Satan you know because it's so they're so fucking liberal here it's it's sick you know what I mean I've had wars with people in it in fucking Walmart it's shit you know I chased that one fucking guy in Walmart who argue in Johnny I'll cause he's telling me my nose was out of the mask it's gonna just back when the outerwear gonna be a woman you know and my nose was out he's telling me plowing up you know you know you know you know you know you know I told them fuck you we were we had a big argument I chased them down the island you ran I'm just saying I can you know got to do what you got to do you imagine Greg chasing someone at the supermarket dude I was so loud you don't you I was I was trying to fuck bombs and everything it's for every I didn't shit yeah I was just a fucking 20-year-old fucking 20-year-old just chasing some guy I'm gonna be chasing you I'm gonna really hear an oil girlfriend should have lose it bro you really hear an oil you want to really hear an oil you should have heard you argument I had it might be gonna get I just I'm gonna tell you the whole fuck I know you remember it because I was buying uh light sauce right now two light sauce yeah and his black chick across for me in Walmart had a big big basket of them and uh they're good with the this is back when the virus first shit bullshit started and if fucking store managed he's done not the only kid to he get to that's the he's got to he's got to he's got to that's it you can only get two light sauce that's you know because they were rationing and it's because psychos of buying all the time and it black the black lady goes fuck that shit if I was white you wouldn't be doing this and all this other shit so I told her I am so sick of fucking hearing that I got to fucking light sauce you got to I think I told you that you told me I would have took the two lights on gave it to the woman yeah I remember you telling me you know what you should have done is you should have taken one of the light sauce and popped the cap off it get through a little bit lighter in one hand and it's sprayed the shit in a great way I should have just sprayed a I could just spray it or say look it kills germs that you dead I turn it in bro are you ever doing that yeah of course we're a soul but you know a lot of people a lot of people are buying up multiple of them reselling them though they weren't even hoarding it and reselling but because but it's white privilege you know she started that shit and I don't want to hear that we started having that big one I already told you that's the guy but then I got you know I don't want to hear that shit you know I mean she didn't I don't think she believed that she just wanted to get the light so that's all you know that's the point at me and shit like you know I don't want to hear that she just wanted the light so it was a good it was a can't excuse that but so Lewis what so what's you said you're the only gym open what how you keep in the world we were we were the only gym open never gyms open now I'm here for about three to five months last year we were like the only gym open in North County and how did you know what's the name of your gym Metro flex oh shit a Metro okay what what are you hoping is it oceans are yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so you're saying there you go okay yeah so you we just we just stayed we we just stayed open to call the you know took all the hits on the chin and we fought uh we fought the fines and the citations and we beat him oh you beat all those citations yeah we bought we had about 13 criminal charges did you try it all yourself no I don't I don't really kick I got a kick ass lawyer that's specialized in that catcher and she found every loophole you can find in the you know the reason we stayed open is because the people that wrote the executive order out here were not lawyers they were just they're just politicians so we actually said that uh we had a physical therapist right prescriptions preventative work out prescriptions for all of our 1500 members and that people were not working out inside they're doing physical therapy oh that's all I mean say well as the physical therapist with each person through the thing I said well the executive order is to say the physical therapist has to be present just that physical therapy is a good reason being side so we were allowed to be fully open with that tactic oh you are that's all I was like that was not really smart yeah I love it now what do you do in terms of just keeping open her you know beat nose loopholes was with what other kind of you know that was that was the biggest one and that another one they said if you had a uh the way they worded it they said no indoor training will be allowed but you have an outdoor training area then you could have indoor with modifications so that's very big so when they asked me like how are you gonna do or I'm like well my indoor modifications I I modified it with spray bottles I have signs to say X year don't stand here I put some blue tape on the ground and they're like well those are those are that's not the modifications we're talking about I mean again it's not in the order you got very clear that's not my fault I didn't write it haha these very slowly that's awesome so we we basically closed I we closed on this first two weeks obviously like everyone else didn't they made for like the month of April then we realized this BS and they didn't know plan to reopen California they had no idea what they're gonna do and gyms were like they were we were the only thing more dangerous in California than a gym was a basket and like they didn't listen it they're like my spit at concert was level 10 and level down was gyms and it was like I did shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot into the nine so yeah my spit is back along really good uh I heard big ladies apartment was number nine number eight you know it's funny those because you I've been fighting the good fighting and you know we had to have a couple times around the news and you do a lot of light and you can ran from mayor out there you know what what was the public consensus do you notice you have a lot more members than you gym now yeah we more than since we started we've tripled our membership here and yeah I'm still in the news I get they come on interview me pretty much every time there's a new thing like LA County is getting ready to do a vaccine passport to vaccine mandates or businesses yeah it's about two weeks away but it's coming and I think that whole thing is it's coming down the pipeline for a lot of blue states you know people in Florida and Texas obviously you guys really have to worry about that but uh there's a lot of other of us who you have to deal with that you know wait so I still wait a second please clarify is it are they talking about all business it or just government or just so yeah so a California the way it is right now if you're a health care worker if you are a government worker a government flea or state employee whatever you have to get a vaccine by I think it's September 15 if you don't have a vaccine then and you don't have an exemption you're fired and then they're still so now they're talking about wanting to enforce businesses so but business is letting people live without a vaccine and proving they have a vaccine the business can get fine the business ought to get arrested and that's what I'm talking about in just at this uh Los Angeles County Los Angeles all businesses you can't go to the grocery store without a vaccine because right so if it's the indoor business gotta show you papers like that that's what it's gonna happen yeah papers yeah we went to weeks to show me your papers like uh that's not so germany the Jews had a good day yeah but once you start to get it if vaccines used to be getting once he stole our papers you're gonna have to have to you realize how many people are gonna start selling fake uh back you mean you're going to be selling going to be selling you they probably said they're all right so what do you want me you know I'm sorry I've been offered him twice so far how much free oh oh because it cause it's because I'm I'm the advocate but I mean you know I'm sure they get a couple hundred bucks for him yeah yeah well didn't want to stop monitoring your car and where you go at your car and oh can you hear all this shit did you see the drone the drone with the cameras on it that meant measure how far ahead the way you are from each other and the facial recognition and if you're closer than six feet they can recognize who you are and send you a fine oh my god where's this we call for you how really yeah California has a gas tax where they're trying to pass it where your your tax on how many miles you drive and every car will have to have a sensor put in it and it turns how many miles and it's two cents a mile gas tax why and if you don't get the if you don't get the sensor put your car it's like an automatic find them like $400 for the year how much is it going to guess no I'm just gonna do something I hear it's about like four bucks oh frunk that's a lot yeah for it's four bucks yeah it's it's rape out here man but on the vaccines and the vaccines you're talking about the vaccines kind of everyone third dose fourth dose Canada if you follow the Canada right now Trudeau signed a deal of Pfizer over three years to bring in 33 million or 36 million doses of the fibers of vaccine each year there's only a 30 million people in Canada and he's got this man doses already three years planned out a contract delivered that many doses they're not planning on this just to go away they want this thing to be scheduled for a long term anything it's just Canada it has this plan yeah Biden's got this plan he's got three ways here baby this is I'm telling it's good to be a good one in my words this is all about the vaccine there's nothing else that matters it's a good one why why it's a good one give him a call we're giving you one every time every time somebody gets a shot somebody's getting paid these are not how much okay if they're free to you but somebody's paying for it big form has the biggest most powerful lobby in the entire country there are the ones who are constructing this so that there's many people as humanly possible can buy the vaccine or be compensated they can be compensated it's like a partnership between the government who gets to track everyone and then the vaccine people who make the money that's a part of people elected you know so it's like it's all it is that's only the money it's a election everything else is a conspiracy the only thing that you can follow is the money yeah and the money goes to the big pharma who spreads it around to their lobbyists who spread it around to the government officials and everybody so all of that comes down to how many vaccines can we cram down the public's throat because everyone is a dollar sign and that's all the vaccine is also a tool this whole COVID is a tool that's what they use to win the election it's vaccinated so they think it's a bad luck let me ask how many schools that raised the golden egg go let me ask those to let's say they make a mandate that you have to you get to check people's passport to get into your gym to see if the vaccine you're going to you're going to hear to that are you going to let anyone in no man I'm sorry that one of the news I think last Friday and I said you check my Instagram I put the video up no no that I've never had a mask mandate in my gym is optional I'm all about choice I'm not against being able to get the vaccine I'm all for it don't get it you know but it's about a choice I should not be forced upon someone and I'm not going to put a thing in my gym where I check your status or ask me questions we're big boys and big girls this is not a point of mandate but personal responsibility you know this is like a poll wash your hands don't come somewhere if you sick yeah you know don't play with your faces suck on your fingers and you know touch everything it's this is this is this is big boy big girl stop here this isn't rocket science yeah I could have back to when you were a kid when you were a kid if you had a brother or sister or neighbor sick you mother told you stay away from your brother he's not feeling like you're fingers out of your mouth you fuck you you you don't put healthy people you know in quarantine you quarantine sick people okay even in the that's how they got through the back in 1917 18 over there when you know with the Spanish food that's how they did it you quarantine the sick people you don't quarantine healthy people as a matter of fact that's how you get hurt immunity but they're using this to regain power yes to vaccine to make a money off the vaccine every shot they make money but this is they found the goose now that lays the golden egg that's you keep them in power to keep that getting vaccines to keep you know doing these things to you want to fucking make you pay a charge for fucking every mile you go on your car so eventually go to an electric car they want to do a wave of fucking gas they want to make it so expensive you can't afford it you say okay I give up I got to drive the fucking electric car you know what I'm saying and what it will be the it'll be the car that

couple years that was paradise yeah we just we just bought a house up on a hill you know this that which is one time over from ocean side and we kind of look out over the whole valley and it's we get the huge breeze and it's open our doors and windows up and just you're right through the house and it's great and it's a great and I don't know I'm not really supposed to say but you have a new addition coming right yeah yeah we have a baby Murphy baby Murphy's coming uh little girl congratulations you guys been trying it's awesome yeah it's been it's been a journey and we're just very very grateful to God and for everything he's given us and uh yeah so it's super I'm super excited I can't wait it's coming up and about to over be you know number of she'll be here so how old are you now I am forty I'll be forty seven but it's on you're like me you started late your late starter but you know it's better that way I'm telling you seriously so this is your first yeah it's our first yeah yeah yeah your first congratulations both yeah I know I'm we're super stoked to you know we're probably gonna head of home schooling arcade or bringing it to like a private academy just because all the BS is going on the schools out here it's horrible out here man the school is you know what I'm learning critical race theory and three years oh you can choose to be a boy or a girl if you want to you know 85 gender's and when they're five years old you want a sexual reassignment surgery we can do that we don't have to tell your parents so you got a trade you mean you got a trade off when you want to live in California you get the weather or the looted in the looted takes and you got to like balance that's right because well we got we got gabanuts and we got a recall that's been coming up the summer 15 Chroma was just resigned today yeah so and then we got you know if we get news about that's like the two coastal just tyranny what just Larry elders is running yeah I was just gonna ask you who I like Larry Elder who would you say is the leot who do you I like the loose I get Lewis Lewis here Adele for governor yeah basically you had to beat out he'd have to beat out Caitlyn Jenner in the primary good honestly what would you vote I who do you think's gonna win that you have a right now whoever whoever is the conservative with the highest high-ess power right now it's Larry Elder so if he's still in the lead that's why I'm looking for the one is in the best chance right now I could I could get a rock with crap all right it's gonna do a better job so I'm surprised Arnold they step back in and try to write it on Arnold fuck that fuck that Gavin do you ever wonder you know how does the guy like that Newsom get to have that much power money and and continually fuck up to the degree that he has and just stays there why are the people in California so complacent with this with this please got huge backing from when he was young he was supposed to yeah yeah but I ask Gavin these are he is Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi's nephew he comes he comes to Matt stock he's got a lot of money behind him the state legislator out here is like 85 Democrats like 12 Republicans so nothing to say legislature yeah it's it's it's up it's up seen and he has the one man role so once the state of emergency is putting a place he saw just cracking out these executive orders and some is executive orders more so crazy so the biggest one he passed was if you know if you catch COVID and you're an employee in order to in order to get a workman's cupcakes against your your boss you have to prove you got sick at work you know that they did something wrong do that he's not so he switched it now so if you're to play and you get sick at work you automatically get if you get sick anytime you get sick at home you automatically get a workman's cop plane against your employer and the employer has to prove they do everything right so all the businesses out here requiring everyone to wear masks limiting capacity because they do not want to get these workman cop suits when the worker is got so we try to get hey we open your business I can't because I get workman cop suits so get sick you know take masks off in your store I can't and we're about to get to sue workman's cop so that's what new some did he passed that he passed the rent more chorium so everyone out here there's renting a regular citizen is renting they don't pay their rent but all the commercial property owners still have to pay their mortgages to to the bank so that these mortgages people that on the buildings are going bankrupt and people are living for free still collecting their $4,000 unemployment checks wow terrible that's crazy so he stays in office because he's because of the handout basically he stays at office because people hear idiots in their democrats and they'll vote you know blue no matter who yeah a lot of the other public is out here you know they're they're proper the proper people they play by the rules you know we got to play by the rules guys now a lot of people are pissed off a lot of business owners that would have blue before are coming out and saying they'll never blow blue again because that's what closer businesses now right so there's a huge shift out here towards towards not blue you know people are looking for what we're voting right so they can get a guy like Larry elder who isn't really a political icon he's not like a Donald Trump where he's got a lot of people that dislike him he's someone that's kind of a likable guy you know he's black and we should big audience and it's someone that can really kind of bring people together where you can get elected and then he can start shifting things out here and everybody loves him I love Larry I'm here to tell you who's gonna take over for promo now in New York the lieutenant governor for now and then they're gonna have to have a little like yeah you know who the T.C. James wants that fucking position it's supposedly that was also a political shit don't get too shit about well she just wants power that's which she's bad well she's bad watch her get watch her fucking win governor next time this contest dates fucked up New York's really fucked this is fucked up this California we're both fucked when are you leaving right I can't leave yet I'd love to leave one day but that would give me him and Jimmy to bull are gonna have like an entomine you know next to Ryker's island and they're gonna they're gonna stay there you know like the movies are rock they're gonna set up yeah in the service missiles you know from there no there's a little island out there by Ryker's you know it's a little deserted like a rock and they're gonna go there and they're gonna put like sandbags you know like the resoul of the earth you know and there's a lot of that we're not gonna be there country yeah and fucking nobody's coming in and they're gonna have the Rajol and and sausage and peppers on Jimmy all the barbecue and you know they're gonna have drone delivery pizza Jimmy likes to bull and A sauce that when we go out beef you like the boy you like the bull and A yeah we're gonna get that shit on the rock over here oh make it just did this to J ever join us to have the game of join this to do he's training I actually had a big landing video but I'm not gonna plow save it for next time stay safe wait Gavin Gavin let's get your let's get your a view of the big landing Mr. G fuck you keep calling him Gavin it's Lewis yeah you go Gavin whatever he goes by Gavin I go by what a call the big sexy too much of a go to his head right now I want to fucking roll a joint just look at So what am I coming out Larry fighting somebody big landing but you haven't been following the big landing Mr. G the buckle oh I have not any good for him I guess I've been I've been wrapped up in California yeah I guess we've been running in this and having to try to keep his gym opening like all of the Mr. G and Lenny saga what a big nation having that Lewis is Jim seems like anything goes yeah we should find a loophole for it you know that would be awesome hey at least we got to talk about it one more fucking time there you go Lewis to set up a ring and his it is parking lot man they could fight right there actually we should have a bros versus pro bro bro bros versus pros protest yeah I have a few games just to get into door you gotta be able to say it three times fast well I like that Lewis I'm uh thank you for joining us today and of course keep the keep going with the good fight out there because yeah you're doing it right and hopefully everyone will flock to your gym because you're obviously doing the right thing out there and of course congratulations to you in Sabrina on the new baby coming soon and congratulations Lewis God bless you guys congratulations that's awesome keep us up with all the new data we have now showing that if you exercise in a regular basis no one has an excuse not to go to the gym so absolutely absolutely and you go that's what I'm gonna do yeah that's the best thing Gavin that baby you watch your life's gonna be like oh my god you want to be sleeping anymore Lewis let me tell you I don't think you're gonna sleep in my sick three hours a night what are you gonna take those three hours away from you I'm not gonna laugh believe me yes you got nothing coming Lewis you said it's a baby girl it's a little girl yeah it's a little baby girl don't bless her yeah yeah that's me great yeah that's me great yeah ready to get your heart broken next you ready to get a little brother next Miss Olympia yes getting keep it out of body all right guys hey thanks for having all guys you all right guys we're gonna wrap this up Lewis we'll see you to keep us updated and Greg stay out of the the vaccination halls all right no more vaccine field John go light a joint and I'll just wish everyone a Merry Christmas and happy new year we'll see you next time thank you love you guys man thank you guys bye bye

Welcome back to Muscle in the Morning. I'm Dave Follum, though, and today is Wednesday, August 15, 2018. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, it's that time of the week again. Welcome back to another jam packed edition of the World Famous Recap Wednesday, where we'll kick off today's show with a rare trip out to the Northwest for the inaugural Portland Pro Classic in the men's physique division. The Chicago Kid Jamal Ever came in and cleaned house on the way to picking up his first career win. The runner-up position went to veteran assassin Mark Sineen and rounding out the top three was Oregon's own, Dave Odom. Over on the bikini side emerging star Jessica Palmer finally napped her first win of the year by holding off a valiant second place effort from the fabulous Jordan Lee. And finishing up a surprisingly strong top three here with her Olympia tune up was the always dangerous Norman Austria. If you're one of those people who like their bikini action, just like they like their soccer, they ask paste heavy and with the touch of Brazilian and I'm sure your eyes were glued to what went down last weekend and sandpulled at the muscle contest Brazil pro bringing home the top honors was native Brazilian ESA Pasini who was absolutely brilliant here. Second place went to Swiss import Priscilla Lambacher who managed to serve the head of eventual third place finisher for not a sagging. The place went to Juliana Dante's and rounding out the top five was another native Brazilian Naira Schubert. If big border walls and good bodybuilding are your kind of thing, then last weekend San Antonio Texas was the place to be because once again another awesome addition of the San Antonio pro went down leading the way with his all-time best in classic physique was second year pro Jason Lo. It was a long day for the judges in men's physique but when the dust finally settled it was harbour heights Texas native, Lyndon Bond who managed to find himself as the last man standing and over on the master side of things to rel robits and got his first pro victory. San Antonio native Tiffany Mori brought home the hardware and figure over 40 and in master's bikini veteran, Harriet Davis set the tone to get her first win in the year and wrapping things up here in the open bikini with the best look of her career was the red hot Monica Ellis. Now that the Olympia is a little over a month away I can't even begin to tell you how many stupid halfway motivational quotes I see every time I scroll through my Instagram but I'll tell you what one person who's really been catching my eye lately has been women's physique stand out at their grace. The multi top five finisher looks like she's in rare form again and heading into this year's contest looking to hurt a few feelings of a few girls up there with top five ambitions. Nine times out of ten when you see her hit the Olympia stage she's up there firing on all cylinders and assuming she hits the mark again this time around she has a legitimate shot to be a top three contender before it's all said and done. You know how these emergency alert signals come blasting through your phone right before a big well somebody should start doing the same thing every time branding curry drops into update because this guy is about to wreck some serious stuff last weekend. Curry and his team dropped a handful of new updates that were flat out ridiculous. Especially a few of the shots we saw from a recent guest posing spot he did out in Hungary. I don't know what the heck they've been pumping through that water over there in Kuwait but it definitely seems to be working and if he's going to keep getting better over the next month or so I don't think a top five finish this year is entirely out of the question. And that does if yet another edition of Muscle in the morning. On day full on bo reminding you to always be true to your passions and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to Legendary Foods, muscle in the morning. On day polumbo and today is Thursday, June 24th, 2021, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. In case you missed it a few days ago, Hasan released a behind-the-scenes clip from his latest check-in. And I think it's safe to say that this is by far the best condition that he's had all year. We've talked a lot about a keen Williams being the favorite heading into this weekend, and rightfully so. What we're seeing from Hasan, however, might not be enough to put his name right there in the conversation, however. He's been knocking at the door all year long, but this look might be the one that finally gets him through. Now people say that you have to fight fire with fire. Well, embody building you have to fight size with size, and from the way it looks, William Morton is ready to go toe-to-toe with a keen and Hasan in the size department this weekend. On Monday, Williams team released their final pre-show updates less than 24 hours after touching down in the Bahamas, where he gave his fans a preview of what he's bringing in for his pro debut. Pound for pound, William might have more muscle than anyone else in the lineup. So the real key for him here will be to make sure he's on point from a conditioning standpoint. When you look at this lineup on paper outside of the top three, it feels like it's completely up for grabs, so it be checks the right boxes. A top five finish feels like a real possibility. And no people say that imitation is the best form of flattery, but here's a word to the wise. You might want to think twice before you think about trying to imitate what's he on Pearson's doing right now. Now that he's only four weeks out from defending his title at the Chicago Pro, one of the most dangerous men in the two 12 division is starting to kick things into overdrive. When you see how focused key on his bench rod is in tire prep, you can't help but think that he's got a huge chip on his shoulder that he's carrying around since last year. I don't think this is much about defending his title as it is about him trying to silence some of the noise he heard from all those internet experts out there who were so vocal with their criticism after he pulled out of the Olympia. So I guess in a sense this isn't really about defense, it's about redemption, which is why his mentality isn't something you can just adopt and imitate. It has to be lived and experienced and that's something only he can do right now. Even though we're only about 10 days away from the Orlando Europa Pro, we really haven't talked about it all that much yet. But when I monowilking lays down the gauntlet and says that she's prepared to go all in that qualifies as worthy of conversation are in. As far as her training is concerned, this might honestly be the hardest that we've ever seen her go during a prep at any point in your career. And in a few sneak peeks that she's given us, you can see that reflected in her physique when I bond is that her best she's one of the best athletes in figure beyond any shadow of it out. So if she makes a strong statement in Orlando, it'll go a long way towards setting the tone for the rest of the season. And that does it to yet another edition of Lusselin the Morning on Day of Above All Reminding News. I'll always be true to your patterns and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Head Concealer.

If watching someone sit on a hammer machine for five minutes between sets playing with their phone, pisses you off, you are definitely old school. OSBBC.com for the hardest training athletes. Hey, dude, guys, at Green? Oh, so what's your question? So, good, natural transition to the next topic and that is, Kai Green and Phil Heat. I mean, we seem to do at least with Kai Green. It's just a semi-annual event as far as whether or not he will. Well, not completely the Olympia last week. Last week he posted a progress picture where he said he was three hundred and seventeen pounds. And of course, you're going to spark that debate again, whether or not he is. Well, there's a new post I said, there's a new post today someone's just sent me. Phil, Kai writes, Phil, Kiver's Phil, Mark your calendars. So it looks like said that. Kai said that? Yep. I'm putting it up on the screen right now. You can't see it, but it's up there. I don't know. Well, I think are we going to say the more is this time. Market it got upset people starting this debate again. People are going to get upset. Fuck guys. Always saying this blah, blah, blah, blah. But I'd love to see Kai come back. But the thing that's going to upset people is you think it's especially the termation. They're not going to like it. But I think David, I mentioned it before. Kai should get his shape, do the Arnold, if he wins the Arnold, then invited to the Olympia. But he's been out for five years now. If he gets invited, there's going to be a lot of people upset who don't want him there. And then if he wins the Arnold and gets an invite, the people at the Arnold who are going to the Olympia are going to get pissed off. That he's going to the Olympia. And it's not a qualifying show. So even way people are going to hate Kai. Yeah, so just to clarify, it's the picture. So a video clip from the 2014 Olympia where obviously Kai and Phil went face to face. And yeah, war is coming. Hashtag Kai versus hashtag fill. Mark your calendar as a video has Kai and Phil yelling at each other at that 2014 Olympia press conference. So we've been here again. We've been at this junction before, right? If Kai has been to come back and whether or not he actually confirms, well, wait on official work. Who knows, that might not even be for the Olympia. I might be at another venue. But the hot dog eating contest. I want to break it. Why were all here on break and then use a breaking news that's like the 90s revisited me loss, Kamali, Melbourne and myself. We're all coming back next year. They're going to bring back the eye main show. The four of us are coming back breaking news. They heard of he first. Oh, I have to have one because seemingly every episode of Astate. Now, there's some iteration of, hey Dave, do you think Lee's coming back? Hey Dave, you think Lee's really listically coming back? Hey Dave, Lee Lee this Lee that. Where are we? Back on stage. Anytime within the next 18 months. Oh, well, slow. I'll come back when Kai comes back. I'm not this new era, the world we're in. I think it's fantastic. And yes, I am saying, I am coming back. You're probably seeing me back if not next year to year after, but you will address me as Lee A. As I should be doing the miscellaneous. Thank you very much. Prof, you trained, Janda. I'm going into the women's. Thank you. I know, I know some of the, the, the clitorisers might be bigger than my deep heart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, I'm sorry. Please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And that humility, Melanie Anthony will be shaving his, I mean, her beard and she'll be coming back to in the miscellaneous. Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no, I got to do the couples together. So, uh, devil is a laugh. I do it. Just do the, you're opinion it. Do we see Kai and Phil on the Olympia stage this year? I think we'll see Kai for sure. I doubt we're going to see Phil. I mean, look, uh, and if you have that competitive spirit, and I'm sure that the Calvin and Dave and Lee can confirm this. And let's say if we can close to be second at Olympia, few times, and in our heart, we feel like we could have won like Kai feels it. He has no injuries. He looks good. He set up for life, you know, he's situated, but that's fire must be still burning. And looking at the competition last few years, maybe he got that, uh, question mark, like, no, maybe I can come back and do the damage. And I think he can. So I absolutely think that Kai will be back. Phil, Arnold first, he's got to do the Arnold first. I tried. Well, okay, okay, okay, okay, first, I don't think that Arnold is qualified for 2000 tournament here. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, this would be irrelevant anyway. But, uh, and he showed forget, fuck the Arnold. Do any show before? Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, Kai. Okay, I mean, uh, I can. Kai has established himself as a runner up at Olympia a few times. He took a time off. That's he really need to prove anything, okay, earn a qualification now. This is why the LNC Olympia have that right to invite somebody that can bring the audience, that can bring excitement. And Kai is that for him to train for some other show, peak twice. And all the sudden, he will make no sense. I think Kai green earned the right to get not just in the station, but golden stamp in the station anytime you want to be at Olympia stage. This is, this is my thing. And in the 90s, back in the day, I don't know if you guys remember, Olympia winner qualifies forever. Top two. The second place was qualified for three years. Oh, really, I didn't know that. Yeah, that was back in the day. You know, so, okay, of course, it's a well over three years, but Kai green is Kai green. I mean, all of us want to see him back to make him, do what? Puerto Rico, not Puerto Rico, Portugal show or what is stampa show? And now, what for? No, I think you're right, but I have one second. Let me ask me a question. Would you give that same right or that same respect to victim Martinez? Oh, hell yes. And yes, listen, listen, over. But I'm here, let me tell you this in the, I just thought to imagine about this. I qualified for Olympia 10 years in the row, about a 2010 house, and I wasn't allowed to complete like medical clearance from my central accent, whatever. The end 2001, I had a shoulder surgery 2002, my knee blew up, and I said 2002, 2003, I wanted to maybe ask for special invitation, because, you know, many people are getting special invitation. So, say maybe 2003, I could. The fucking Sean said to me that he's going to ask for an invitation. So, I didn't ask for invitation, because Sean was going to get that invitation. And now, to first of all, this Martinez won that 2003, that champion's yellow great at that choking, you know, Bell me. So, now, you and I have promoters of the show, and all of us have promoters of the show. And we want to bring more audience, you know, to see the show and more excitement. And it is between Victor and Kai, who would you give a advantage of? We don't do a lot Victor, a lot of his music and everything. I think that Kai has established himself as a better competitor, more consistent at the top of Olympia. So, for that reason, you know, you can have a two invitations, I think that Kai would get seniority. I think we're also debating something that, again, has been debated over the last couple of years, and that's whether or not Kai quote unquote deserves a special invite. We had the same debate about big ramen last year. So, let's just have this conversation under the framework of less as the promoters would, extend a special invite, regardless of whether that's fair or unfair. But the question is, if we're going to see Kai actually come through and compete this year, and for that matter, Phil, Miller, I want to go back to you real quick. Why do you not think that we would see Phil this year? Well, why, okay, listen, and I have a great respect for Phil. He came scaled down version of Phil, he was not competitive, and then really it was questionable if he could have if he should have been a party chupan or chopan, I said, I know what is correct, he pronunciation. But the lesson, so he was slipping already to a fork. For a seven-time Eastern Olympia, just like, okay, Ronnie kept competing and keeps slipping and then Jay did the same thing, and keeps slipping. What good would that do to his career? If he believes he can win, of course, this and then he should come back. He's qualified he could. I just think that he lost that edge. You know, there was, we all talked about it. Dave, who came to Lee, everybody's going to have a great, he had that 3D, something extra, something special to you see him. Even though he was not the widest guy, he's so full, he created that, he loosened crazy arms, crazy back though, vice-insteaded moods, so he had that. He was gone. Even when he lost to Sean Rodney, and some people say, yeah, he was in shape, but he was slightly off. Well, slightly off takes the edge away from Phil. He no longer has a 3D world, I'm Mr. Olympia, you can touch him. So Sean Rodney, he's already now three guys being here with three to seven people. I can't see him coming back. I would love to see as a fan, I would love to see him coming back. And be at his best. I was actually in the interview before the Olympia, if you remember, I was predicted that he's going to come in the old-time best and win. Last year, but he didn't. Lee, pretty senior opinion, Kai Green, Phil Heat, but we see them on season here. If I was the betting man, I'd pick Kai over, feel like Phil's great and it's like, me or I said, he just lost that suddenly, and wherever, you know, physical enough, but the main thing you have to remember is in this sport at so much mental. And I think Kai Green still has that mentality where he can train and want to be the best Phil, like I said, maybe after losing and getting the lower placing, back and sometimes the mess with your mind. And if you, if your mind's not 100%, your body won't be 100%. And you had just seen when Phil came out last year before, Phil, when he walked out on stage, just a champ. He looked like the champion that staged presence like Arnold, your walk on stage, your join-to-one. And some guys, they might not have the best physique, but their stage presence and the positivity they give off, they can win, shows because you're just in awe of him and Phil seemed to be lacking that where when I see Kai, I think he's still as that eye to tiger mentality. And he can put it into his training any stage presence. And like I said, if you don't have it 100%, set up stairs, your body won't be 100% downstairs. And that's where it all comes from. That mind, if they get that mind muscle connection, you've got to have that wheel and stuff. And I just think Phil is somewhere along the way, this is just my opinion, it might not be even true, but I just feel like Phil's just slipped a little bit. And when you're at that level, like me, I said, if you're not 100%, 90%. 90% is still fantastic. But if you're just at one, two% off at that level, it shows big time. Melvin, from a view that you had of this Kai and Phil rivalry, obviously taking ahead in 2014. And then obviously seeing Phil go on to what he is accomplished. And just that specter of mystery with Kai, what would it mean to you to see them back on stage, perhaps on more time? I agree with all the guys. I believe that that would be a crazy battle. I believe that Kai definitely deserves a special end by it. Doesn't matter how people feel about your mad or whatever, but that guy is a different breed. That I see in Kai Green's body, I've competed against him. I've seen him. He hasn't lost the gas. He still has gas in his tank. So if he decides and gets that special end by it comes back, he can win. He's not a joke. He has that three-dimensional look. When he says he's 300 pounds, that boy is 300 pounds. I've seen the guy eat. He deserves it. He still has that fire and I agree with me, Llewish, but he says that when a person gets second and gets second again and then you leave and he's still in his mind, he didn't stop training. So it's still in his mind that's something that he still wants to attain. So I think he deserves an special end by it. It should matter. Give it to him. Because he will bring that entertainment value. People will kind of debilts spend money to see it. And that's that. It shouldn't be talking about it. Let's give him the end by it and see what happens. But Melville's go back to who point those made earlier on. I forget if it was Llewish or Milo's. But if you're a Kai Green, and obviously we talk about the entertainment value that he brings to the stage. And I think the only thing that bodybuilding, the bodybuilding fans really have sourd on him about is the fact that there has been the will he will he not expected that has gone on for the last seven years. But aside from that, I mean, the guy is universally beloved in the bodybuilding world and the unique aspect that he brings to the state. But in your opinion, if you're Kai Green, you're looking at the line-up order with the course of the last couple of years. Are you thinking years up realistically? You know what? I have a shot at one of that Mr. Olympia title. I'm going to, if they was me with my mentality, I'm getting that get it. Because there's a window of opportunity. And that window stays open for only so long. Once that window closes, they move on. Like Milo says said, when you wait too long, you have to know, I remember Milo's told me a long time ago. I don't know Milo's remembers this. And John had told me years before that. But Milo says something to me once he's like, you know what? He goes, you know, when you have the money, get it, when you can get it. You got to know when to say when. When Milo's is training me, you got to know, you know, when I don't forget what much what people tell him. You got to know when to say when, because if you leave, and then you come back, you'll get worse. And guys have tried it. You know, when we were coming through 2000, 2001, 2003, Sean, you know, he, I'm going to go have babies. He knew when to say when, because on that day at the minister of Olympia, me and Dexter was killing him. He knew if you come back, it's over with Kevin LeVron comes back. It's over with. Now, so somebody came back later. The time was past you after that window of opportunity. If you don't have the gas, you don't have the 100% man telling you, you're not training the same. You try to come back. The guys nowadays going to eat you up. I know when to say when I know when to sit down. Let me see. Kai still has it. So he should come back and get it before they closed the window on it. That's just my, you know, he's a friend of mine. So I'm, I would tell him that. Yeah, hey, man, get that money. You can win him and going against Romney. That's what that man, I would be a battle man. Whew, I like to see it because I know what Kai brings to the table along with entertainment. That boy got a body. He has a 3D look. He's full. You know, he has a with taper big legs, big cap. That boy got everything he needs to do it. Now, it's up to you if you smash the gas or not. I just want to throw my two cents in. Yeah. You know, I think it would be a great battle. I mean, as a fan, I'd love to see Randy first Kai and all the other guys. I don't want to discount the other guys too because I think they'll be up there as well. But I think Kai's window to win that Olympia was the year that Rodin was pulled from the Olympia because of the whole accusation and the arrest and Brandon Curry want. That was Kai's Olympia in my mind that he easily could have come in in one that show. Nothing, nothing away from Brandon but Kai's got the legs man and the wheels and I think that would have been his show. I think coming back now against Randy who's who's surging at this point and getting better. I think I think he's going to have a hard time beating him. Yeah, I might have had a hard time, but I think Kai, I don't know if he's still seeing Kai 100-100% with senior 99 but that Chris, for a while, I think even now, like Rami, how that never went for Rami's Mr Olympia, he's huge in that. But Rami had his best in Kai's best. Kai is more complete. He's got that 3D cartoon look. He just flows better whereas Rami's wide. He's got the big body parts. But when you're putting Kai and Rami side by side at their best, I'll give it to Kai because Kai just looks more complete. He's got that 3D look. That's taken up in a way from Rami. You're thinking of Kai greening my side and beating him. How long ago was that? Yeah, but he's in the new pictures, right? Yeah, but the new picture is pretty good. Yeah, looks quite competitive. Yeah, what's good? Kai the whole time he hasn't been competing. Kai hasn't stopped. Even though he hasn't been competing, you look at Kai the last five years off season. He still looks like he's a guy that has been competing. Yeah. It looks better than the guys who are competing. So Kai hasn't turned it down one bit at all. He's not working. He's been competing. So he's been away from the stage, but mentally he hasn't been away from the gym or anything else. He's still a bodybuilder for him. I agree with you that I agree with you Dave that Kai greening had that opportunity when Brandon won. Yeah, for sure. But for him as a competitor, he probably feels that he can beat Rami. And as Lee is saying, look at their pictures of their best. So they're both a mass monster. Kai has proven that he can get in the better condition. He has a thick muscle, but he has a stride as muscle. I remember back in a day when he does this back relax and then it lasts like Dorian, right, glutes, down the feathers on the quads. I mean, we all like these striations that you know, that are particularly dance muscle. Right. And the Kai has it. So Rami is wider. He can exploit that with maybe, but then it's going to still beat. You have to hit the diagonal of ice. So let's let's see the quality. So I think it's going to be a wonderful balance. I think that let's not fight against the better arms. Let's not forget that we almost Kai almost lost the center of the McMillan at the Arnold class again 14. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You see, but he's one of the posing around that's how he wanted it. No, but let's make something clear. You know, because even after the McMillan, McMillan, the McMillan, the McMillan, the McMillan, as his best could be Mr. Olympia. We all agree, right? So it's not like one man show, two men show. Back in the day, in the 90s, there was like 10 men show. I mean, Lee Priest would play 7 and Chris 8 and Ronnie 9 and I would be 10 in the whatever show. You know, it stopped 10, but then in Europe and Europe, there was Chris Toss. Lee would beat you know, guys ahead of him and and Chris and Tom. Because it was the tight show when he's the time guys, somebody has to be first, somebody has to be last. So, magically, Melan narrowly losing to Kai during the Mc's nothing. He just means that he is also great. And Kai looks at his chances and I think he likes his chances. That's why he's coming back. Come on, you know, Aaron Sligerman. You know, as soon as he's signing up, you don't think there was already a talk, amen. I think you look quite good, maybe you can do the Olympia. I'm sure there was some kind of a financial incentive in there. Yeah, you're right. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's wrap it up on this. No, we're going to go around the horn. Let's just say, right again, the picture that we saw last week with Kai at 317 pounds. And let's just say, Kai comes in on. All right. And let's just assume that you're looking at a top five-ish without Kai off of Romney, of Hottechupon, of William Bonnet, Rally Winkler, a King William, somewhere in that combination, we throw in like Ian Valier. If Kai competes, if Kai is on, Melvin will go to you first, where is he placing? And I mean, absolutely on. If Kai comes in absolutely on, he wins the restaurant on there. Lee, please. Oh, great. He comes in on his best ever. He wins because nobody else really is probably to close the second with that thing. It's been free. They look, but nobody else. They're just some people for our district and have that look where he just looked in orange shock and he has that look and if he's 100% on, call it Wings, King Kamali. First or second. Melvin, I'm adding in the politics aspect in there too. Who is this second? King, who is it up to? Don't do it, don't do it. Don't let me know. Get your life down. What? Clarence Bas and, uh, don't pretend. Don't do it. Look at Dave Lappa. You know exactly answer now. No, it's exactly who Clarence Bas is. I am on TV show. No, just for just some sort of answer. The question is, you know, honestly, it will come down to Kai and Rami. But as you guys were just talking right now, I'm sitting there thinking of myself, okay, but both of them are at their best. All you guys are saying, and I agree, it will be the battle in Kai. You're giving Kai the knot, but think of it this way too. I know this is we're trying to wrap this up. We'll do this quick. Front double bicep Kai. Front last spread. I would give it to Rami. Side chest, Rami. Side tricep. It's close. Back double bicep Kai. Back last spread. It's close. Most muscular. I would give it to Rami. So it's not as close as you guys. I mean, it's not as Kai is going to walk away. That's why Rami. Yeah. It's not you guys are not like that. They've got to stay in next to each other at their all-time best and like they said, you got with against compacted mass. So I mean, 3D. It's that they're 3D full. Cat. I don't think it would be an easy win, but I think if it's that judge, I think Kai might just get the knot. If it becomes there, it wouldn't be easy. That's for sure. Wouldn't be an easy walking the pot. No. It would be a great battle. Does Mr. Olivia get the knot though? How he always does if it's close though, you know? That's he's going to have to knock him off. Right. Nobody edges out the Mr. Olivia. Yes, the knocking off. Yeah. So I think Kai can knock him off. It's not going to be easy. It won't be a walk in the park because Rami is no joke at all whatsoever, but neither is Kai. And like I said, I've seen Kai have that 3D mentioned on mature, straighted muscle everywhere to where you I remember we were at in Australia. And like, you know, Milo said earlier, you can flip flop it changes. And we were back there and I tend to go do recon when I go, you know, because I get bored. So I go walk around people's room and get to get a picture and I walk around that curtain. And I see Kai over there by himself. I ran. He got big a said, man, you want to fight that boy. He's a witch. But he's going to go look at me. Man, that's to walk around that corner. He's so shit. I'm not. I guess you want to fight you. He's not. I think that that's going to get that knot from the fact that he comes in 100% off. And it's like, it's like they've said, dude, I look at that recent picture of Ruli. That recent picture of Ruli is legit and not touched up. Had it's really go at his best. He's right in there. He's right in there. He's right in there. Rob Ruli, you know, just about the point in King Olympia could have been his opportunity. Me, your perfect scenario of Kai being coming in. Oh, one word is he place. If he comes down, he wins. If he comes down, he wins. We don't do respect. I love the bigger enemy for many, many years. I was saying that's structured that with X frame. I mean, but then it comes this is silhouette. You know, then you turn the lights on and then you see the quality. More hardness, more dense, straighted beef is on on the kai. You know, this is how I see it. Yeah, I love Kamal is comparisons from Robis and Slicepeden all of a sudden. And you know, it would be great to see it when they go have to head. But you say side chest to Rami, yeah, side because that crazy hamstring lutes and all that stuff. But still upstairs, you have the crazy bison of a bargei and a thick chest and a straighted. I'm not sure who wins that one as well as side triceps. And then Kai is competitive in every single pose. Big Rami doesn't have a strational, most muscular pose. You know, he still left something. Crazy quads in separation, but not feathers like Kai has. And when he's and I'm sure that Kai's going to exploit that. I mean, he if I go against you, King or Ali or Madden, I'm not going to try to fight you in the poses that you know, you smoke me. But on the poses that I know, I can smoke you. I'm going to give it a shout. And I'm going to make sure that everybody saw it. You know, if it's nice, if it's abs, intercostals, whatever. And this is what Kai has experience. Even you have to say that Rami has experience, but not top two Olympia experience like Kai has. So I think if to ask your question, if he comes in his best shape, he wins. Even though the kind of overlooking how the chupan who is phenomenal and he could be in the mix. Because if he comes really improved, don't forget he was straight second from every judge in Saturday, you know, it's either show. So he was not even questionable. He was second better than Brandon and Phil Heath. And that was fresh off a 14 hour flight from. Yeah. Yes. So don't describe the person involved here. He is super dangerous. I mean, King King King, King King, that is that's more than me. Dave, let me take a zoom on this one. I know how this went from whether or not we believe Kai will compete to now essentially with Kai in a way. And the 2021 in Strelimbia in your opinion, Kai, the way you know him, the way you've seen his physique progress. What we saw last week in that progress picture if Kai is on worthy place of the 21 Olympia. I don't believe he's showing up. I just can't take the bait. I hope he proves me wrong. I really do. I can't take that fucking carrot. And answer the damn effort the question. You know what? Look, we're thinking about Kai Green at his best. That was a long time ago. I know he looks amazing in pictures. I'm sure he's going to be in great shape. Structurally as he's going to be as good. Well, that midsection be as taught as it was when he was competing at his best. I don't know. Rami to me is fresh, still looking. I think that I think there's other guys, Heidi Schuppen and Rami. I think, I mean, and um, excuse me, and really, that's very, very dangerous in that line of view too. I think Kai is going to have a tough time. And I think that, you know, he's got, you got to, you can't discount rust. There's rust still. He doesn't have a, he hasn't competed a very long time. There's always rust to shake off when you first get back on stage again. It's, it's, it's hard. It's a hard decision. I can't see. I, I would, Rami would have to be off to lose to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to Kai. I don't think Kai can beat Rami unless Rami is off a little bit. And that, that's how I feel. I think that you got to give them not to the Mr. Olympia. I think Rami is sitting in the driver seat right now. I think Kai missed his opportunity two years ago. But man, I would be so super excited to see Kai back on stage. And that's what it's all about. We talked about the sport. Does never need excitement anymore. Come on, I'll say it when we started. Kai coming back would inject the sport with a freaking adrenaline shot that we haven't seen for 15 years. I agree. It will be exciting. Fans, you let us know what you think comment below whether or not you think Kai would compete at the 2020 when Olympia and if so, becomes in on where you think he will play. So that's going to do for this episode of Iron Debate Special Thanks. Meowo Sarset, King Kamali, Leapree, Melvin Anthony, Tyler Shorten, we great job is always behind the boards Dave Plumbo. For everyone involved, I'm so deep for rookie. We'll see you next time. Thanks, guys. Great show.

Uh, Dave, that's how you... The biggest mistake I made was going into the office this morning. I got hit and a job by something. What? Why am I on the floor? Well, it's a Hungarian doing here. It's a... there's so many things. Why are you filming me? What is this? I don't know why I am. I should... I can't even get up. Uh, Dave... Hey, you shut the fuck up, man! Uh, Dave... He's got our support, you know, moving forward. Next year, it's going to be a lot better.

Oh, I'm back baby. That's right. New brand new series of cardio professionals To help motivate me hopefully and maybe you I got actually a lot of good feedback On the whole last set of cardio professionals Leading up to the branch for war in classic in my men's physique debut So of course now that I decided to do another show and continue on and Iron Mag Lab is a graciously Allow me to continue on with them representing their company providing me a supplements I'm continuing on with this whole journey with the new set of cardio professionals and And first I'm gonna talk a little bit about the continuing along with Iron Mag Labs and the decision to continue doing this and doing another show And then I'll talk a little bit about motivation or the lack thereof in my case So the decision to continue on was based upon the fact that I had such a good time Doing it doing the contest preparing up to the contest The dieting process the whole thing I really enjoyed it and I really had no regrets and You know even I didn't place in the top five which I would like to so I had a qualified I still had a great time and I really I really wasn't was kind of almost said it was all over now I also had such good feedback from people industry people People with their listen to the radio shows that watch the cardio professionals even even they've Plumbo gave me some props and if you know Dave it's about as hard to get a compliment out of Dave as it is Anybody I mean you almost Get a compliment from the wall easier than you get one from Dave Blumbo so for him to Be complimentary and even to endorse me continuing on Was just one of the signs that made me want to continue doing this so Now let's bring fast forward to right now This is the first day dieting again I'm a little under 240 pounds if you remember last time I was two 66 right around In the two sixties I think the first cardio professional does 250 or something I already started dieting So I'm starting considerably smaller In fat mass really I think the in reality I am More lean muscle tissue Then I did because I had such a good rebound after the context I'm really if you look back You go look at my face and everything from this cardio conventional number one of series two compared to number one of one And you'll see you know I'm nowhere near as holding the water fat and everything else that I was the last time around so With the goal the goal is to be five to ten pounds tighter So that's the keyword tighter not necessarily smaller and not trying to lose a bunch of muscle You know and really I talked to Ted at Dietcote who's helping me again this time video a phenomenal job advising me last time I listened to his diet and because I cut the calories faster than I would on my own in the carbs Because of Ted's advice I look the way that you guys saw that I looked So I mean Ted don't want to focus too much on the weight on the scale this time I think that I think maybe that would be that was my my focus more than anything More more so even than tads Now this time we're not gonna focus this silly in the scale we're gonna go warm looks The guidelines that I've been given was five to ten pounds less So That's what I'm gonna shoot for even though the numbers aren't necessarily important that really the goal To give you an idea of the look that we're looking for Is we want the seratus and obliques to have stuff going on Not just the ads my abs are always good they're good right now and If you looked my conditioning was fine If you looked at some of the top guys who went pro this year the difference between my condition in the Acidition was their seratus and obliques when they twist you saw a lot of stuff going on there In mine You saw some but it wasn't as dry or tight Is some of the top guys that are doing it so that's really the goal and hopefully obviously you can't pick and choose where the The five pounds comes out of but ideally That's where you'll see me tighter this time around Now Let's talk about motivation After the diet after my lab the contest I really could have continued on very easily right after that It wouldn't have been that difficult for me. I was like in the right frame of mind Now since then I told you I'm not much fatter just bigger Maybe holding a probably a 10 pounds of water which I'm assuming I'll drop Pretty quick from cutting out the carbs and stopping the junk food. I'm gonna be honest with you all I have been doing the opposite of what I was doing the tad and And kind of revered it back to my old Diet the typical geobac a diet which is McDonald's cakes pies Ice cream Dairy products Nobody building food whatsoever No lean meat no rice No vegetables nothing good which I can't say I'm proud of I haven't been doing the cardio like I thought I was gonna do Basically Other than the weight training Which has hasn't been a hundred percent there have been weekends or I missed completely three or four days I didn't train in a row because of shows being out of town etc So I haven't I haven't really stuck with things like I would like to have so now I'm doing kind of even I don't look like it I'm kind of going from Zero to 60 again like I did last time And mentally It's not as easy to go from zero to sixly Is it just stopping the food and start doing the cardio again? So I'm gonna wear a place I met the gym doing cardio and for the first time in a long long time I don't really want to be and I didn't really want to do the diet this morning I still had some donuts left I mean I was looking really hard at those donuts this morning It was the toughest it's been It's a cycle remember To avoid the donuts and make egg whites instead So I feel like it's gonna be challenging for the first few weeks until I develop a habit again of doing the right things You know So this is gonna be I'm gonna let you guys All like you know how this goes the challenge goes I've actually Getting back on the diet and doing the things I need to now that I'm in the gym doing the cardio it's not that bad But getting in here today was harder than it usually isn't staying on the diet hasn't been Hasn't been funded all so Hopefully the fun will come back into this You know I'm doing cardio pretty easy real it relatively easy I'm starting out Ted starting out with 70 minutes of cardio right off the bat Which is not uh not what I was hoping for or expecting so I've got a lot of cardio right off the bat. I'm starting with relatively low carbs You know we're doing a carb cycling diet like we did before I am having a cheat meal on Saturdays my chat my I do have one higher carb day But most of my carbs are around 150 grams a day So It's gonna be tough But I know that I can do it And my goal is He's in an already say Texas state which middle of October I'm looking at it about eight weeks to go to the show I don't think I'll have any problem getting down Assuming I you know mentally Focus in like I need to and then Hopefully I do what I need to do to qualify four weeks later will be national's in Miami And They give away three pro cards In my high class It sounds pretty crazy and you can talk about stuff like that But man it would be really cool If I could get a pro card I never imagined a million years that have I be pro cards or anything So I would love to be To be able to take that pro card on my wallet and show it to Dave Pulumball every once in a while when he yells at me into to show him Who's the IPP pro here not you buddy? I think they would almost just from material for the radio show to fuck with Dave It would almost just be worth it for that so fingers crossed I've been doing I need to do over here I want to give a big big thank you to Robert to Masjo Iron Mag Labs for believing in me Continuing sponsoring me Continuing allowing to me to be their national spokesperson For a great company that provides Supplements that really do work no bullshit.

Bye

Oh, I'm back, left.com. We got to back on the road to Professor Nolus and right here. Sorry, folks, you're confessing Nolus. So two parts, two of the cardio confessions. It's great. I got to the gym very late. It's around 9 o'clock right now in my time. I'm here in Houston, Texas. I'd like to get to the gym earlier than this, but it is what it is, and at least I'm here. Today wasn't as bad as yesterday, especially with the eating. I found some motivation and actually some of you all out there helped me find this motivation. I'll tell you how in just a second. But if it wasn't as bad a day, it's just thingly enough. It lost. Two pounds already. I'm sure it's fluid, of course. Between the 70 minutes of cardio and cutting out all the carbs. Actually yesterday, I wasn't able to eat all my meals. Ted has eaten seven meals, and he only got through five of them. I didn't do all my protein shake meals. I think my body, you know, I haven't even had protein tricks at all. Since I stopped my diet since I ended the last contest prep. So starting with, you know, I don't want to give away to me a Ted's tricks, but I'm eating a lot of protein powder right now. Nine scoops in some days. So I don't know, my body's not used to it. You know, it's upsetting my stomach a little bit. So yesterday only got five meals in the seven, and only 150 grams of carbs. So I dropped some fluid, I guess, and I can actually tell a difference. I guess because I'm so, I'm not that far from being in shape shape. So two pounds actually made a visible difference. And today was a pretty good day in the gym. I trained back today. I weighed so not pretty good. I felt good training. Now, I've been a yesterday. And today, I've been kind of experimenting with some new, pretty work out supplements. Unfortunately, I didn't know that I was going to have this one ingredient, but I really like the one three DMEA or DMEA. Yeah. This thing is like a short acting in Fedemy and of sorts. It's in one MR, Jack 3D. Other ones, and I got a lot of samples from people recently. It's said in me different ones of these, and I've been trying out. But when I took today, I didn't like much from back in the, I'm actually in the name. You know, I like the fact of it, but the taste is horrible. It's got a taste like if you're going to drink this every day or regularly. I don't think it's actually a good idea to take it every day. I've taken it the last two days, as I needed the motivation to get in the gym and train, but the day of the one was very against even caffeine. Anything like that, any stimulant. And the one three DMEA is extremely, you know, it kicks caffeine's ass. So since it's not really what he recommends, I really, it's not a lot of people recommend to use every day. I'm sure it raises quarters all levels, but if it's either that or don't come in and get a workout or get a bad workout, I definitely use, or prefer to do that. Especially somebody like me, who's not, I don't really have to be too cute worried about losing a little tiny bit of extra muscle. So I did use it again today, and I'm going to try to keep using it. Some other samples I have to find when I like. Ideally, I would just use it once or twice a week. We're not even that, but anyway, so things are going pretty good today. The diet's been pretty easy. I've been on the limit meals today, I've done four so far. Three left, I got one right when I leave here. But, you know, yesterday I talked about lack of motivation or being. Not as motivated as I was, well, that's kind of test-prep in the beginning. Like I said, it was a little better today. One of the reasons was because some of you guys out there set me some videos. And I was really excited with one of them. I thought it was really cool. And I did, I wanted to have three million views on YouTube. So I know some people had seen it, but I didn't think that many people had seen it. So, I mean, like percentage wise, if you watch this, these are people in our, it's muscle and on the boards, I just didn't know how many people had seen it. So I showed it to Peter I've run. Unfortunately, that's my body. He's already seen it. So he has seen it. So I'm figure maybe a lot of you have already seen it, but I'm so not thrown in here. Because when I watch it, I really, obviously, it really pumped me up. You know, it's like a high school coach talking to a high school football team to get them pumped up before again, but I got to tell you, it was pretty cool. And I appreciate Keith Thomas for sending that to me. He is a guy on the board. And that's his real name. So I won't give out his board name, because he doesn't want that to be given out. But thank you for sending this to me. I hope all you all enjoyed the video. If you're watching this while you're doing cardio, maybe we'll get you pumped up to keep doing it. Maybe go a little harder. I'll move it up a resistance level or in my case a cross ramp and resistance level, my little pre-core here. Anyway, here's the video. Let me know what you think of it. I'll be back in a minute. Today gentlemen, I've been on a coach, you're not a teacher with a real talent. But there's another one that you still don't want to do. That is a mental need to come to that question. Who am I? I am a champion. That's right. You don't remember how long you was getting. I would call for what is not become. If you see what I've given my pre-core, I will believe with other people's help. I will always endeavor to keep on respecting my team. I've trained my mind and my body will fall. Who am I? I'm a champion. I would know that back in my college, you might have spent your week. I will never surrender. Weakens will not be in my heart. I will go to my club and there's also a part of this world. It knows what it's training me. And I will try to explain from that. Who am I? I am a champion. I will crash, go off to the field of battle. And I will move and everything I can do. And I will beat my good bell and get him in the mind of all of us. Don't let Jeff there. I will fight by the way. I will grip the heart from my every step and even bring him on the ground. Because he can not stop him. Who am I? I am a champion. To my side I have promised. Come rest in the business and pick his death. Who is that who I am? Who is that who is here? Never will I let the fall. Never will I let the death. And I will never live in any life. Because our part does not know my heart. Who am I? I am a champion. No one will deny. No one will deny me. And no one will tell me who and what I am. It can be. But leave what's a fight world. It is broken by this new country. It is put me out of the moon. And it will carry me through this battle. Who am I? I am a champion. To defeat, retreat, those are not in my work. I don't understand those definitions. I don't understand what they go wrong. I don't understand what they say. I do understand this. I understand that I understand never surrender. No matter how bad they go. My heart, my mind will carry my body to my limits and be. Who am I? I understand this. The devil will be that devil. Not the world. Not that weak. But right now, right here. And do how to do your whole. Who am I? I understand this. It is put me out of the moon. I will not stop me from fighting because I will not find myself. I will not let my whole planet. I don't know what I am going to do. I will never go wrong. I don't have to give a everything like life. I do it by my mind. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. I understand this. Pretty cool, right? If you hadn't seen already, I'm sure you're glad you have seen it. You have seen already. Hopefully you watched it again. Got something out of it. If not, I guess you probably afforded it. I got one other one that everybody seen. If you haven't seen it, you definitely should have seen it. This is a very famous video in one of my favorite movies. I won't watch it anymore. There are so many times. I want to watch people that watch a movie once. If I really like it, I probably will never watch it again. I'm not somebody who watches movies over and over again. The fact that I've seen it braveheart, there's many times I have. I told you how much I liked it. You probably know. They've got sad parts. It's a long movie. If you watch it four or five times, maybe like me, five or six or seven times, you're pretty much done with it. But there's a scene in that. It's very famous. You should probably already know what I'm talking about. William Wallace is lined up his men because riding his horse. He's about to give this a little speech to pump up the men. Here it is. I'm in my countrymen. Here in the fire in security. You've come to fight a free man. And free man, you are. What will you do without freedom? Will you fight? You guess that? No. We will run. We will live. No. Fight in you may die. Run. And you'll live. At least a while. I'm dying in your beds. Many use from now. Would you be willing to train all the days from this day to that? But one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives. But they'll never take. Vote right on! Help! I'm protective! Help! I don't know what to quietly run. I don't know why. I don't put this sticker on. So I'm concerned YouTube won't let me use all that So it might be a short clip, but you get the gist right and you get the feel of it See how much YouTube will let's me put in there without copyright In friction and that's a problem that I've run into a few times. I got a few cardio confessional from the old one But I edited Got up there and everything. I was wondering why there are no views on the thing Turns out if you're Plaining music or any video if it's copyright Copyrighted you get like a little infringement notice and you have to edit it out and sometimes you if it doesn't make any sense if I edit out Some pieces are videos or songs out of the Cardio confessional with the whole thing and ends up not making sense. So I'm just warning you anyway That's it for today. Those are my thoughts This is a number two of two. This is two days in a row. I'm trying to overload you all with having one of these every day I don't know some people want more of them some people don't catch up with the other one So you know until all these Get seen you know, I might take a break for a few days. I am traveling this weekend I will be in Tampa Florida visiting my girlfriend Darial gains and We're going to see help for sister Move into her She's going to school college in Orlando so we're gonna help mom and her sister Move I don't know if I actually do be helping doing the moving, but we'll be up there Being supportive I guess. I don't really know whatever they need me to do. I'll do and I don't get a little extra cardio out of the whole thing But that should be interesting and I'll be eating on the road So I'll get a little practice of what's the come out of the nissime? That's my only trip till the Olympia four weeks from now before weeks from this weekend So I should make a lot of progress by then you guys see me at the Olympia.

Oh, our ex. On MagLebs.com. We got to back on the road to Professor Nolus and right here. Right here at the Cardi Yoke and Fess in the... For your professional episode number three season two. Anyway, you'll notice something that's different about this one from the other ones. I'm actually doing outside cardio, which I encourage people to do for a change. We're walking. It's not just me. Got Daryl Gaines here. Say hi. Hi. And we're going to talk about a few things. But first off, we're going to talk about the importance of a partner. A partner in the gym and a cardio buddy in this case. She also helped me. We did a legs today, which men's physique legs is... It's a different kind of leg training. She actually trained legs quite a bit harder than I did, right? I did. I trained her for legs. Yeah, I trained... No, you didn't push yourself. You're a partner and a push deal. Yes, that's where you're my partner. Don't make trusty partner. So, what we did, what I did, you know, people asked you still train legs and everybody knows I didn't have the best legs to begin with. So, what I did for legs this time, what I have been doing for legs, it's just been pretty basic. I've been doing leg extensions, lying leg curls, or standing leg curl in this case, and a squat. I've just been going to 315. I believe they're not even on my legs or not big. I'm pretty strong on them. So, I haven't been... I've only going to 315 lately, just really not that much. And, it'd be doing more calves, so the real... I don't... Obviously, you don't want anything too big, and it's funny. They don't want the men's physique guys to have like ginormous calves, which I would love, honestly, I would love to have. But, I'm in no danger of having gin calf, so my... No, I don't think you have to worry about that. So, I'm working on my calves, and that's my main priority, and then doing cardio, like we're doing here today. So, and she also needs calves, but her legs are good. Good, good, you want to show the booty? No, not the booty, the calves. Oh, do you want to show the calves? No, it's not good, not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Lots of work. Minor lean, all veins on them, but they're not good either. I don't want to show my mouth, they're not good. Don't do it. Okay. People don't want to see it. They probably don't have to show your booty. Anyway, so the importance of a training partner, I think it's actually pretty important. For me, I've been training lately alone. Now, my cardio buddy, that's really what I need, because it's not as important that I push the really heavy weights. I'm able to do that on my own, because I push myself to do the heavy weights. What I need is a cardio buddy, we do it on the cardio, you know, to heads got me doing 70 minutes of cardio as you know. Yes. And that's not experience. Yeah, you did more than 70 minutes. I had a body extirhandic of cardio. So more than anything, that's really what I've needed. And back at home in Houston, I'm in Tampa, by the way, in case you didn't realize this is not used. Is Jay Zamora, who you can, Zambear, I'm sorry, Zamora, I was called Jay Zambear, who is a well-known makeup artist here at the MPC and I at Phoebe, does all the top girls. And lately she's even done some men's physique guys. We think of that, you think I should get makeup done? A little lip gloss. You don't really think that. No, please don't. Yeah, I don't think so. I asked her about doing something with my hair, like putting some color in it. What did you say? No. No, absolutely not. So I'm not approved about it. So I have no options or limited. So no makeup for me, but she has done some guys in makeup. And she does a great job at the girls makeup. I'm not really sure if I can really say what would be good guys makeup. Because I haven't really seen that yet. Well, you know, I think that maybe, if I see it a little bit more, I can't really say for sure if I agree with it or not because I know actors and people who are on stage, you guys, they put on makeup and that's so, that looks so subtle when you're not up close. So it may actually work out. I think it's good makeup for the guys who are men's physique, but actually be at least noticeable when you say. Right. I think if you don't have the right type of person doing it. So Jay, you know, I'm sure she could fix the up to look pretty good on stage. Well, I don't know if I'll be needing her makeup services, but I do like her cardio body services. And it does help me. So, you know, if you are working on your own, you're trying to build muscle. I definitely encourage you to work out part and now if you're doing cardio, I strongly recommend it because you help each other to go to the gym and do it. Like, you know, I'll often call her a slacker or something like that. And then it'll probably like, wow, I'll do it then. And then, then, making me go and staying on the cardio machine as long as I need to. So, I do recommend that now. Let's talk a little bit what I'm doing in Tampa. I came to Tampa specifically to meet your mom and your mom's boyfriend and come to Tampa to help your sister move in. We're trying to really help her move in to college. Yeah, okay. I'm going to just stay here for a minute. What? Give it on. Oh, I want to hear how to stop. We're going to keep moving. People probably can even. Keep keeping your cardio. Got to keep moving. All right. No, because I don't want to. Okay. So, I came and helped your sister move in and met your mom and everything. How do you think it went? Good. My mom loves you. Yeah. I think the whole family loves you. What? You don't want to be close to the thing? I don't like it. I can't even tell what it looks like really because it's so sunny out here. So, I had a good time doing that and campus always fun. Yeah. I mean, we had a lot of fun last night. We got a bottle of wine and my family definitely liked you. I'll buy the picture at the end of the night. Yeah, with me holding, I'll have to throw that in there with me holding your mom up. Yeah. Your mom thought it was neat that I kept it to the top. Yeah, I'm not going to. It was pretty entertained by that. And I am. You're armed. So, let's see, what did I go? Did you want to talk about my diet a little bit? You helped me. Daryl has not just been a cardio buddy and workout buddy, but she's also helped me to stay on my diet. And you cooked all my food a week and I got to get you credit. I often make a burger. I cook potatoes. Yeah, packed everything up. Smack your hand when you tried to go for something. Yeah, I haven't perfect. I'll admit to Tadazari Coach. We haven't been perfect. My mom's been very good. I've been closer to pretty close to perfect. Yeah. Tadazari, I had some sushi on the way here on at the airport. And he didn't approve. No, no. But I'm going to do it. I'm still moving down and weight. My body weight is definitely below her. Although that's not worth focusing on. So, you know, this is really our Tampa update. Doing cardio outside.

All right folks this is cardio confession number four part two and I've got my little headphones at home for me to speak into so we're gonna hear a lot of background noise but I'm not gonna be the longest one I'm gonna do one tomorrow also in the morning before I leave town I am leaving town moving from Houston Texas to Tampa Bay Florida moving or to move together with my girlfriend Darial Gaines we ran a really nice house three bedrooms we got a pool and everything a huge yard with a dog it's like almost an acre maybe even a whole acre I'm very excited about moving but I'm also excited about the amount of progress I'm lately I am basically right now sitting at almost exactly my contest suite from last show and I've been doing what Jasmine's telling me I'm doing my cardio and dieting but if anything I've been eating less but I'm supposed to and that's because of the truth pain now we're not on anybody out there has had severe tooth pain before let me tell you it is totally all encompassing and debilitating you really can't do anything when your teeth are really really hurting like full bone pain it makes it difficult to drive to talk you can't sleep you certainly can't eat or drink any liquids would actually hurt my teeth works so I did give a gym and do what I needed to do but I didn't eat everything I was supposed to I had more egg whites than usual less meat than usual and as a result I really I mean I'm totally vibrate now I'm very lean I'm basically as I was with our last show but I'm six weeks out the goal we're tired I'm to see tad in Vegas and the goal for me in tad is to be in contest shape in the at the Olympia in Vegas so that you can see exactly how I look and then I can kind of coast because next two weeks I'll be in obviously Vegas for the Olympia then I'll be going straight from the Olympia in Vegas to days house Columbus house in New York where I'm going to work on some TD stuff kind of do whatever work we need to do and then I'm going right from there from New York airport straight to India to Mumbai or six days so it's gonna be busy and obviously I'm not going to be able to do 70 minutes of cardio every day and eat exactly right to be honest with you I don't think that I should I think I could really honestly probably lose another 20 pounds easily at this rate in the next six weeks because I'm almost losing a pound of day again and I'm way way less than I was losing a losing a pound of day when I was 260 so this isn't water I don't know what it is but today I was pretty strong a toothpane is gone I went to the dentist which was something that I had been putting on for years now I've learned my lesson three Rick Nails were necessary for some of you who's pretty much nervous or I'm gonna say I'm afraid of the dentist because that's not the dentist that I'm afraid of I just get anxiety when the people are all over me and putting stuff around their face so they gave me some Microsoft side and I took some Xanx and I played my music really loud I couldn't hear the drill I just zoned out and believe or not it wasn't that bad and in the process of it people will laugh you would expect no less for me I took a video so here's the video of what they're doing I was holding my iPhone out like this and that's how I was doing it so here it is I'll do that see I think of everything we actually have a lot of cool footage I'm gonna shoot a lot of stuff while me and Darryl are moving in and of course I have a big dog Rustyne and I'm gonna introduce my dog to her cat the match of the interest thing is Husky I don't know if you guys know there are no but Husky is one of the warnings you got when you get a Husky is they don't like cats or they like chase cats I know for the fact that Rustyne my Husky loves chase cats so we're gonna have to we've looked into this how to introduce them together properly for the most positive outcome so I will I'll definitely video that you should see a lot more cardio professionals to come because I'm gonna start doing a little more regularly and in a little more detail not I actually have somebody to hold the camera to do some stuff there you'll help me make these things a little more interesting so I'm gonna try to get one out tomorrow or at least before one tomorrow my last cardio session my last time in Houston and I'll do something for you guys I

All right, everybody. This is the tour of the new house in Tampa. I mean, Dariel moved in here a week ago and it's the first sunny day. So I'm going to give you a tour of the house. Keep in mind, it's pretty messy. I'm still moving in and this is my dog here. We're seeing, we're seeing say hello to everybody. This is the Ariel's cat, Doke. I believe they're not Doke and Rusty, but become friends. Come on, Rusty. All right, so this is one of the various empty rooms right now. It's just being inhabited by a cat toy or two. I don't know what we're going to do with this room. It could be technically like a formal dining room or something. I'm not sure. Obviously, I can't imagine we'll do that with it. I was thinking like this could be like the pool table room, because I can't imagine we would do another dining room table kind of deal here. So you got this may be the pool table room. And this I think may be the cardio room. I get two pieces of cardio equipment and then put the TV on the wall there. I'm not even sure. So this is the kitchen. It's a kitchen. I can see everybody wants to see what's in the fridge. Only diet food. Ted the diet coach would be happy. There is nothing exciting in here at all. All right, now keep in mind, like I said, just moving in so there's junk everywhere. But this is the living room. Some of the Ariel's trophies. Not, not any for me. Now over here is the living room area. Like I said, we're gonna this will be the where probably the dining room table will be. We have a great porch from the show you in a second. This was from Saturday night. Ted don't get upset from Saturday night. So that was the cheat night. I had a lot of cheat meal. Just a case you're wondering. Now, we have a guest bathroom here. guest bathroom. Some closet. It's not being used yet. Another, this will be a bedroom. A guest bedroom. Now over here is the study. Just only got my computer and the desk that we put to actually dairy up put it together to be on us with you. We're gonna share. I'm gonna get another TV stand from over for over here. And they have a lot of nice windows. I think you can see out the front yard here. They big yard, the backyard is tremendous. A lot of closet space. This is our bedroom. See? Light's in the room here. Anyway, work TVs. I haven't set this up yet. Work closet space. We got, this is really cool. The backyard, you've got a great view. The backyard. We'll see you in the little other bathroom. Now, I'm gonna show you the backyard. The backyard is pretty damn cool. We'll let the dog out here with us. So we're gonna steam, can check out the backyard too. Porners, the end, let's go. Come on, you go, go, go. I'm going too. You can see it doesn't want me to lock them out here. Come on, Rusty. Let's go. Now, this is all the fence stand. We can technically close this off. And you can close all these up and you can keep the air condition in here. And we don't do that. Or we haven't done it yet at least. Now, the backyard is big. I'm really big. Rusty has got a lot of room to play out here. As you can see, we have a very nice pool. It's all fence stand. A lot of pools and plurder are fence still like this. It's to prevent from all the leaves in the bugs. And used to, we never had anything like this. There wasn't all these pools, we're not covered. Actually, there weren't a whole lot of pools in Houston, period. As you can see, the backyard just goes on and on. Now, the fence area out there is also our backyard. And we have the basketball goal back there and everything. But this is fence to the dog. People who had the place where us had a dog too. So this is all fence toff. Now, if you want to go out here with dogs not allowed, because you could run up to the front yard, this is all our yard also back here. And since he's not on the leash, I'm not going to take you out there. But we got a basketball goal. If you wanted to play basketball, we got some chairs over here to sit. And that's pretty much the backyard. Pretty uncool, huh? So this is it. Lots of trees. Lots of place for breast deemed to play. And that is it.

In this Species Nutrition line of products, I put my name and reputation on every bottle of Species Nutrition products. If you want to be your absolute best, join the evolution. Welcome back to Live with brought to you by Species Nutrition. I'm Dave Palombo, and today's guest is our 2, 2021 IFB Chicago Pro Women's Physique, Pro Champion Pat Goslin. Thank you for joining us. Thank you, Dave. You're always from Montreal, Canada. We should have turned your phone side where we should have fixed up before. Just so we did it the long way. There we go. Okay. Now, I love when I interview people that are not on the map, so to speak. No one was anticipating that they were going to come in here and decisively win the show. To be honest with you, on Heavy Muscle Radio, I actually announced the wrong winner because the NPC News website had it wrong. I'm standing corrected, Pat, you are the champion. I want to give you your credit. You go to the Olympia in October. Tell us about the experience in Chicago. Well, first I'd like to thank you for having me this mistake. If it gives me the opportunity to interview with you. That's right. That's right. No question. That's the truth. That's the truth. That's the truth. That's the truth. No question. That's the truth. That's the truth. That's the truth. That's the truth. It's been very, very fast after the win. Everybody's just come back to me and it's just, I'm leaving the dream right now. So, yes. I tell people all the time and I say it over and over and over and over and some people listen some people don't condition in win shows and you came into this show. I could see it on your face. I could still see it on your face. Your face is sucked out. Your cheekbones are sticking out. I know you suffered to get into the condition that you brought to the stage and you re-rooted with a win here and that's the bottom line. No one expected you to come in this good. When you were dieting for this show, why did you pick Chicago? Well, I'm from Canada. It wasn't. At first I thought about doing Toronto Pro because I like to support the scene in Canada also and because in 2019 I placed seconds so I wanted to go there and get the win. But it got us prone and so I started prepping for the season, not specifically for one show but Chicago Pro I did, Tampa I did in 2019. So I knew they were super big lineups and I like big shows. I like the lineup. I don't want to go for an easy win. I'm not saying there is any easy win but I like the competition. And so Chicago and Tampa seems like a good way to go because it had two weeks in between the shows and it was easy. When I came into the US I didn't know when I would return after. I signed one from track to the time and it was Chicago then. I plan to do Tampa but not this time. You don't need to write. You got the win. Now, what an interesting fact that I didn't know prior to the show to the told me was that you never had one show prior to the show. That is an amateur. None is a pro. You turn pro with the 2016 North American you play second in your class. How did it feel to finally say, hey you got the win? Well you know what? It's my dream. Most competitor their dream is to go to the Olympia and I understand that in a respect that my dream was to win a show. So my dream is complete. I feel for field as a match. So moving forward, it's just like extra bonus floppy cherry on top. So I'm just super happy. I feel with this prep. I basically made my dream come true. It wasn't like you were placing tenth in London. You had a lot of second places in there. You were right there knocking on the door so to speak and you just didn't get the win. You picked a good show to get a pro win at because now you're not going to win. You're not going to be Olympia. You're going to be stepping on stage with some of the best of the best. How do you feel you'll stack up against some of those girls there? Well I think I have something. I mean I think every competitor has something special to bring. And I think I have a fairly good conditioning like you mentioned. So and I've worked on my proportion. I think I can bring my very best and we'll just see how it plays out you know with. All the best but I'm here for depends. I'm here for myself or my family. Everybody who supported me so I walk in as you know a winner already. It doesn't matter to the place and from yet all at all. And you know you did it right in 2016 when you turned pro you were 125 pounds on stage. I believe now you know 135 pounds now you came in to the Chicago pro at 145 which was a nice slow. You know adding of muscle to your body in the right proportion. And I think too many people try to add muscle to fast especially the women and they won't have it doesn't it doesn't look good it doesn't flow well on their bodies or they just come in and they're just batter or you know and you did it right. And I can see a steady progression when I went back and looked at some of your pictures of what you achieved from 16 all the way up to the present. I will pass them the compliment to all my coaches. Because I don't think I have anything to do with that. I think I've just had so many you put over mentors. I think I just was at the right right right place right time with the great people to really gun me into it. I mean you had stride a glutes. I mean you had everything that you needed to bring to the stage. And so you really left no stone on turn to go back to the old. The only thing you have control over is conditioning, presentation and tan and you now will breed those you know better than I've ever seen. And I'm looking at some of these comparison shots I guess at eight weeks out in 19 versus eight weeks out in 21 and man what a difference your body made man. What do you what do you can what do you attribute that to was it the training you were doing the diet you switched to I mean what why do you think you made such good improvements from 19 to 21. Well I think of course the coaching I'm coach by Shelby Starn is really really good at was what he's doing. I think because I've been with him for over three years now and working up season two with my coach and I always take on my diet. I mean if you see some fat on me it's omega tree. I mean I don't think I don't do sugar. I don't. So I might be fat but it's all good fat. So I think you know just really doing a good up season give it your best all the time and but yeah I think working smart is the key and consistency. Well everybody says the same thing they've you know that it's we're all the same. So the reason is that's the answer there's no special reason but sometimes you know people we'll discover things about themselves that they were doing wrong and then they'll correct it and we'll see a big difference from one year to the next and that's I was wondering that happened with you you're saying it's just was you consistently and we'll prove them I know I never do cards. I think I had maybe 400 grams of card for the entire prep. I think it's like a six month and I feel very good on the cards. So for me it wasn't a struggle so yes I mean it's always difficult to bring that kind of conditioning of course but I think you know since I feel good on no cards maybe less the struggles for me. Yeah I like I do a lot of no cards with women as well but I think that you guys respond really well to you at 14 years old so our picture led the Murray and that's really what inspired you to want to be a bodybuilder. Did your parents understand the bodybuilding or was that did everyone think you were crazy? I'm sorry I did you understand that question. When you were 14 and you saw that picture of Lenin Murray you told me about before the show and you decided hey I want to be a bodybuilder. Did your family understand about this so did they think you were like Hucu you know? No I think I always had great support for my family. They always you know said you are perfect right now you don't have to need anymore I need to add anymore but then I go my way I add 10 pounds and then they're like you are perfect right now so I was always perfect right on spot for them so they never kind of really now they look back and they're like wow what a progression but no I I'm blessed I have great great people around me. Alright well you're going to be on the Olympia stage in October now with the Yuko Shelby and hopefully we'll see a top six placing is I'm assuming that you're a goal correct? I think you know a good prediction. I think you have the tool set to do it and I think that you have the mental fortitude to do it what's the game plan at this point? Well with the feedback we add from the judges and it's pretty much always the same as for us peaking I'm always better on the night show than I am on the the pre judging so I think we're going to go and do it backwards and making sure that I bring you know the the crispy on the pre judging and keep getting better because I think I was I was looking better fuller on the on the night show and then then even the morning after was just even better so we we're just going to play with the time and clockwise. Yeah sometimes you know sometimes you hydration will flatten you out a little bit but you know what I always tell people because people always send me pictures the day after the show and they're like look how good I eat all night. I see you'll be having nothing to be nervous about you have no stretch of no anxiety you slept well last night. You know the game day is a different is a different beast because there's a lot of pressure on the day of the show there's a lot going on between tanning and getting up and eating and you know when you get to go home and just eat whatever you want wake up the next morning I mean that's not a good true representation of what you know went on the day before and you can never duplicate that there's no way you can be that relaxed you know when you get again on a pro shit a pro stage or the Olympia stage it doesn't happen so there's always got to be you know I guess some kind of compromise made is really what it amounts to. I like it I take all the information coming from you from your show from as Dave so yeah I'm taking notes there you go stupid I'm thinking notes sorry about the mix up on heavy muscle radio but you are the winner at the Chicago for Women's Music you go into the Olympia that's the luck. Thank you very much Dave. I appreciate you guys that's going to take us to the end of another episode of live with I'm Dave Alonba with Pat Goslin we'll see you next time.

Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Food Expo, there's 30 year in a row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry. It's a low-car capped hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love this show. This is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. I'm Dave Palombo, and today is Wednesday, August 26th, 2020, and let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Happy Humphrey, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to another jam packed edition of Recap Wednesday. Let's jump right into today's show, by taking you to look back at the action from last weekend's world clash pro championships. Where the big headline was, actually call it was sir, showing up and showing out on the way to earning her 20th career win. Second place went to an emerging star in Ashland Brown, who relegated a very good version of Reno Martinez, a third place. Jasmine Gonzalez put together another solid look here, and the judges rewarded her with a fourth place finish. And rounding out the top five was Romina Bassualdo, who looked like she was using this show as a test for whatever's next on her docking. Even the heart of Texas, we also had a big show down in the men's physique division, at the inaugural, Southeastern Texas pro, veteran Daniel Amons, put together the best performance of his career to earn a well deserved win, and an Olympia qualification in spectacular fashion. Ricky Rashad Watson was electric in his pro debut, and his second place effort here was more than enough to capture some people's attention. Third place went to veteran Arias Affea, who also is slowly starting to stack up enough points to earn himself in Olympia nod. Fourth place went to a good but not great version of Anthony Gilch's, and closing at the top five year was Charjo Graham. Any of you who've been saving up your airline miles for a trip to Chicago this summer to see the Chicago pro, now would be a good time to see if you can get a refund on those tickets, because the 2020 Chicago pro is officially moving to Atlanta. Last week, pro League officials announced that the Chicago pro was being moved to Atlanta due to the Illinois State mandated COVID restrictions. One of the really interesting things here is that the show is being held on October 15th through the 17th, which makes it the last chance for athletes to earn an Olympia qualification. With the automatic qualification window being compressed now, I think it sets us up to have a bunch of really deep shows between now and October. Since so many athletes are vying for so few spots, it should automatically boost the level of competition. Get your popcorn ready. These next few weeks are bout to get crazy. The last segment is actually the perfect segue into what we're going to talk about right now. Since there were limited opportunities to qualify for the Olympia between now in the final weekend of October 15th, it looks like the pro League officials are trying to do everything in their power to give athletes the opportunity to compete on the planet Hollywood stage in December. Late last week, they announced that they'd be opening up the qualification window at the Europa Championships in Alicante Spain, which will be held October 11th. For this event only, they're rewarding Olympia qualifications for the top three in the open and two 12 body building, men's physique, classic physique figure and bikini, and fitness women's physique and women's body building the top two in each division will receive an Olympia qualification. With so much on the line here, it almost sets the stage for this show to have a WWE battle royale feel to it. And I think for the fans in athletes, this show could end up being one of the most exciting events of the season. And that does it to yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on day, Pulumbo, reminding you to always be true to your passions. And make sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I said Bohe As he called you Yeah, that's why I'm sorry Yeah, he did come out and he He was very funny, he actually someone said to me And I replied to him Congratulations, you look I actually respond to him I said, Antoine, you look terrible last week And I told other people who were like Who's feathers were ruffled I said you were fighting for seventh and eighth And ninth last week Right And by my account My opinion, I thought he looked terrible And he was fighting for as low as ninth place 7th, 9th I didn't think he won that call out Even on the 7th, 9th So the reason I called him in Instagram bodybuild is because he showed up with that show Look in like a Big men And I think he would admit to that A fig men of what he looks like running into the show Yeah, well, and then I said, yeah You know, he thought he was very flat I think he just over depleted or whatever But I saw him Bringfully Briefly, this is how much I know about him I saw him briefly at M140 And I just looked And I thought Someone said this, Antoine And I looked over And I thought, God he looks thin And I just thought, okay, maybe he's not doing the show He looks like lean but Not muscular and like And then this year, this week he did a whole cove I mean incredible help And lead for everyone and smash the shows So when he did, he put up a very funny Instagram or something story And somebody He should attack me on it But someone else attacked me on it And I sent a message back and I said Well he doesn't realize that you have a good sense of humor But he's self-taught I mean Congratulations, you looked incredible I reiterate you looked terrible last week And then he said, laugh out like, you know, thanks Something like this and then I said And I still think you looked better And Instagram photos, then this big win So I mean it's a great Unbelievable transformation From Well you know that He's not a guy, he's a pretty authentic guy He's not like one of these like You know, the oxygen gym mirror guys So I just felt like, you know, he's really authentic Something must have gotten serious Everyone, I'm going to get him on the show He's coming on Wednesday So I'm going to interview him Find out exactly when on between New York And Cal and what what mistakes he made For the The New York Pro that he didn't make for the California Obviously How would the Antoine you think we saw in California Which was really in Vegas How would that have done on the New York Pro stage? Well I thought and I want to refund for the For the broadcast Anyone who watched the broadcast For the livestream, he said it was terrible He said it was bad to be there Same, it was like this The one you did before the Cal Pro I gave it to Dr. Inher than that Yeah, it was bad But But even looking at horrendous photos He would have been Well I'll break it down this way He'd pro, if and one Then he would have given and a run Because he's got more Cross-straided body than in At least in California or Vegas And they're both very wide and very tall I mean those are calling cards right? They can why So they would have compared You know If having In having one And you know probably one You know by most accounts do do To to overall size Antoine has With And In the Yorkie didn't have size But he had size Back You know with the show So I think you want to Yeah I think the Antoine has got to be The comeback story of The decade I mean this is a guy who is Now he was a teen People were talking about this kid He's being mr. Lempia You know you had that kind of potential And he had contracts and he had money coming in and he got into the vault with the wrong crowd. He was part of him too much. He got into drugs. By his own mission, he was living on the street. He was homeless. He had no money, nothing, no only one, anything to do with them. He hit rock bottom. He cleaned himself up. He made the comeback two years ago. You know, did well. Look good. But then last year was supposed to be the real homecoming. So the speaker he was going to start winning shows and everything in the story. By set, if you remember. So this year was really something that he had been really waiting a long time to get to because of that, you know, to never be tear muscle. I'm going to set you back because no doubt about that. So, you know, I'm sure New York, he was ahead of a lot of nerves going into it. He probably was, you know, maybe had contracts riding on the line. I don't know what we were going on. But obviously, maybe he overdid it a little bit. But he, you know, he redeemed himself. He definitely came back. And, you know, now we see why you see that. And that frame, like you said, he has, is definitely a blessed frame. And if he can keep progressing from what he's got there, this guy can go, you know, pretty far. I think he can go all the way. I don't know. What do you think? Well, you, it's funny that Dave, you said it because you forget half the stuff you say. But a couple of years ago, you thought, you said that same exact thing on the show you said, I think he wants all you can go all the way. I was like, really? Yeah, he's hard kid. I mean, where would a Antoine that we saw here, and I think he could still be a little fuller, you know, than what we saw in stage. But I mean, where do you think that that physique would place it in the one beer? I mean, I mean, I think he's a top 10 guy for sure. You know, the, the Olympia is so difficult right now to handicap because, because it's still far out. And we don't really technically know who's in it. Well, we kind of know we're starting to get more people in it. Did you see that picture that they missed your Olympia LLC put up a, a brand of carry out an oxygen gym there? No, but he looks like he's like 900 pounds. He told me he looked like a, he didn't see the picture. He said, I have to put up my glasses. He looks like he's 900. So Brandon, the Brandon Phil battle is going to be beyond epic because Phil has a chip on the shoulder and I don't mean that. Make it way. There's nothing wrong with having a chip on the shoulder. It's motivating factor. Brandon has more to prove than Phil has to prove. So it's Phil's chip literally versus Brandon's, you know, motivation. Yeah. I would teach him to prove. And sometimes the, the, you know, the, the underdog to be, and the need to prove yourself. We've, we've never seen a Mr. Olympia be underdog. Chris, then, having a chip on your shoulder. Yeah, we've never had to see Mr. Olympia be an underdog at a show. This is the first time that you have to call me the underdog to these fills the seven time to win the championship. Yeah. He's the underdog for sure. Yeah. Which is, which makes, which takes a lot of pressure off a brand and no, too. Don't you think? It's pressure on, but it takes pressure off because people almost expect to fill the win, but even though Brandon's Mr. Olympia, so now Brandon comes in and brings a ridiculous look to this stage and beats Phil. I mean, it completely validates him, right? His Mr. Olympia. It does. He needs validation, but it's a good ability to bring in absolutely ridiculous. I mean, Phil definitely has the ability to bring something ridiculous. And I think if you look at Brandon's progression, I mean, who's to say he doesn't take another 15% improvement this year or what? Yeah. You're right. He's told him he is still getting better. What about Sammy? Now, he talked to Sean Rodin this past week and what's going on with him is in the trial and everything like that. I don't know what's happening. I don't think it's got anything to do with trial. I think what, you know, the people who on the Mr. Olympia have to extend an invitation. Well, he doesn't have to get an invitation. He's Mr. Olympia, but obviously, you know, whatever stopped him from competing last year because of, you know, a political decision that they made, they could extend that. Or I don't understand his, when is his court case? How come that's going? President can pardon anyone at any time. Right. Maybe trouble pardoned. Yeah, Sean Rodin. You don't need a pardon. I've been found guilty. Nothing. Mr. A Olympia owner can press the gas as hard as he wants if he wants to at any time. That's right. You think they'll invite him or now? No. No. They would have all right. Yeah, you're probably right, especially since the marketing has started earlier. It's a shout out that would have been great to put Sean on the poster. And you know, David, you know what's going to be crazy about the show? To show you watch. It won't turn out to be a blockbuster in terms of people in the show. And we'll only get to see it on livestream. You don't see all things going to be an audience, though. I think it's going to be, I don't think it'll be an audience. You might be right. The way I mean, look at this past weekend where the caliper was held. I was going to have passed on. Can you imagine Mr. Olympia, they have to wear masks? Well, I thought they would have no audience at camp for New York. I was wondering about that. So maybe they'll have, I mean, they had a limited audience. They can't have an audience. They should move it to Florida. Evidently Florida has no problem with audiences. They move the, moving the masters. They move the master. They, they, they, those were limited audiences. You know what I mean? Oh, a limited audience is better than no audience. Yeah. I'm talking how many people in New York. They weren't many people at all. But you know, it's Chris had Vegas that Vegas convention center, whatever they're, where they're holding it there, plant a Hollywood. That theater there is pretty damn big. So I mean, you could even, you could probably get a lot of people in there, even if you're spacing every six seats. You know what I mean? So. Well, my understanding is that Vegas is, you have to ask, Jerry, a shot, mostly. Yeah. I can't believe that they haven't gone out of business with these hotels. I can't. Maybe you're not actually going to buy one of the smaller ones. Dave, I watch the restaurant squad of business in my comment, trickling. You know, like this guy, I give up this guy. I give up this guy. It's a bright climate Hollywood. This is my question. I will raise some money with our good friend over there. And we could get a surprise. I'm surprised how Christopher has a book on it. That's what tells her. I'm surprised. They only say Regis and in hell harbor. Yeah, no, I know they do that. But I'm going to get better than that. That's true. What about like, if they, if he bought the planet Hollywood, then we would have the Olympia right there. We'd have to be able to get press passes. Luckily, we have Dan's home. We can't, I know I can't get one of the competitors who I want to get in. But we actually all know it's all about. Well, if you're home, I'll tell you to make your own rules properly. Do about who goes, how many people are talking to inside for people? That's true. Someone we know who downloads in hotels. Right. All right. Let's look at the show. Max Charles verse Antoine Valliant on stage. Break it down for me. Break it down. This show is one on not strikes. It's one on lack of weaknesses. And Antoine does have a back double. And he has control over the back of the back double. And he has a back last break. And he has boots in hands. Those are the shortcomings of Max. I know Max under the lights below you away on the most muscular. Maybe side chasts front doubles for nominal front last. But at some point you have to turn from behind. And I just, I think that's where I call it a show of weaknesses. Max has weaknesses there. I know he doesn't want to hear it. You know, it's a little bit of a meal. It doesn't want to hear anything. The other context is last week's judging. You know, it's still the same thing. I think I called it an apples and oranges and bananas show. Everyone had different physique different heights. Totally different physique. This week was more like, was a much different lineup. So people just like last week have their own weaknesses. And when nobody's dominating, you move to the people with less weaknesses than what weaknesses. So I think that's where Max is not able to, you know, put away some of these shows that he looks like he can put away based on some of the poses. But those achilles healed his physique is, and he's improved them. Right? He always improved the glutes, hands, back. But Max has got like a Paul the Let's Syndrome. He can't really hit the back. You know, I mean, takes a while to get into the back double. Yeah, I shot a max right there with the Patrick Moore. Let's get shot at Max from last week. Very, very, you know, full delts. What meal is to the good job getting the guy in shape, you got, we got to give him a little meal. Let's kind of melt down last week about the placing. I think he got yelled at actually for having too much of a meltdown. Well, I mean, you know, that's why I say, like, listen, when you're judging a show, it's wonderful to come into a show and say, this guy's first second third for fifth. Everyone agrees. There's not much discrepancy, but when you don't have people clearly taking first second third for you get heated arguments like, you know, the lowest ones to say, his guys are best. I want to say my guys are best. So they're guys are best. And the fact of the matter is, you know, not one person is dominating the show. So you can't say they're the best. Everyone, no one's going to be happy except the one right. What? If you told me a long time ago, even when the guy I've never forget when someone want to show and we didn't think he won the show and like everyone in the audience was bad for like how did he win and Dave said, oh, you said it was like woman is ladies and oh, he's convinced now that he's better. I saw the best as his girlfriend will tell me he's the best as trading partner. Tell me the best too. He's happy to be all the time. There would be guys backstage asking me questions and taking notes and thinking I was going to destroy them and then they'd go out and say they beat me at the show. And then they would be like so humble and then by the next day they were already telling people, oh, it's not really like a little matter of what I'm going to do. I want to talk like question on every shot. So that's the way it goes. Exactly. There's nothing you can do about that. But let's take a look at MPCS and these pictures. Let's take a look at some of these pictures. And Antoine's likes there look good. And last week he didn't even have his likes looking good. Yeah. Let's see the back double on it. Antoine, how old are those? I got it. Let's have you critique that. Antoine back double. Very detailed. Very detailed. That's why he looked, I mean big legs with hamstrings and his back could use more thickness and the arms could be a little bit bigger or show a little bit bigger. I mean, the legs are phenomenal there. Could he be, is it a fullness issue in the back right now? So you think he could be even more part of that? It's not more part of the work. It was just a good look. It's good look. It's it's it's it's. You can't eat more and get a more size on that body. It's it's just he's more muscle. Yeah. I think we'll wait this year and now I wait more. Whatever. A bigger. It's amazing. It's arms look so good, right? Because you can't even tell the mice of B2R. I mean, really, it looks really good. Whoever did the surgery did a great job on it. Yeah. Maybe it's a little shorter, but it's really not. There's no, there's no, it's not taking anything away from them. For sure. Let's let's see if we could pull up a maxed Charles back. Back double. You're talking about? Well, he's got a back, got a back double, then max. Like I said, it takes max a while to get into the shot, which is subconsciously irritating when you're the judge. Well, I think, you know, max doesn't really have, I think, the glued hamstring development necessarily that Antoine has. He's got him, but I don't think it's his dominant of a pose. Yeah, I would agree with that. Thurdest. Yeah, I mean, just the back detail, it's, you know, he still needs more back detail. Boots and ham, it's a good there. You know, he looks good. For max, he likes, his legs really don't look that bad. Like, you know, usually they look glaringly smaller, but I think they definitely have more volume than they normally do. I'm sure Mielo used his, his, his, for giant set in some productivity. Right. Yeah. Max to get the geneticity. You know, you can do it. You could do all those things that Mielo does. He probably works on him really well too. No. Look, this is a good look for max. I think if Max can progress from here to the Olympia, I think that, and we'll probably see him again. I don't know if he has enough points to do the show yet. To qualify for the Olympia. I wouldn't be surprised if we see Max one more time in the Chicago club. What do you think? Maybe, he'll probably go. I mean, he likes to compete. He, you know, he likes to compete. Mielo's coaches and Mielo's loves to compete himself. So I mean, he's pretty much the same character. I think it's a great right. Mielo's is not going to come watch. Shut it down. He knows. He's been shut it down. It's so great. Did like every single show every year. Yeah. He's right. He's right. Nice. Mielo's did every show every year. Mm-hmm. And you're right. And look good at every single show. Look at him. Look at him. I don't think he ever looked bad. Yeah. Let's talk about on win third place. On win is, I told, you know, there's so many people Dave on the cusp of really going. He's a shot. He's struck really very good. I mean, you have to admit. I mean, when he's in shape, his physique looks good. I think a lot of times he tries to come into big. And because he does need more size. But when you come into big, you know, what happens is you lose the sharp. That's the train needs more size. I thought he looked gigantic. Yeah. You don't think I'm that in the legs, maybe. I'll look at the legs from behind and the biggest in the show. Mm-hmm. Look at the cows. He's got good glutes and he has your right. Let's pull that for a trick. Crazy like on the side. Yeah. That's a good good glutes. He's actually better from the back than he is from the front. He's very complete. You know, I helped him last year for this show. I remember, yeah. He's always doing this show. That's the cal pro is like his show. And he's actually since that show, the last couple of shows he's really improved a lot. I mean, I think he's probably gained. I bet he's up five pounds on the scale for four, five pounds, which I'm at frame looks tremendous. And his condition is as good as it was last year, if not better. You know. I think that I think that he's dangerous in any show at this look, this look. Because he's got, you know, I started off by saying, you know, these shows are boiled down to a lot of, you know, who's got the least amount of weaknesses? Right. Yes. The least amount of weaknesses. Let me get you in trouble here. Let me give you a quick answer. We always talk about who's the best Asian bodybuilder. You know, he'd a Yamagishi's name always comes up. Who's better on when or he'd a Yamagishi from your estimation? On when right now. All right. It's a bold statement. Merckhead. It's a very nice compliment. Because he'd a great bodybuilder. He looks like he's another Instagram guy. Good. I'm telling you, he's nothing. I'm just kidding. You just mad that he'd a beat, how is he a Raymond with the overall balance? Yeah. So it's always Jose. Yeah, I know. I'll talk for a minute. All right. Let's go to fourth place another one of your guys. And this lineup, Patrick Moore. We're very good. My, my, before I let you talk about it, my critique of Patrick was that alone, you know, he looks like Mr. Olympia. And then you put him next to people and you see his size is not, you know, quite up to snuff with some of these other guys. And he looks smaller in some of the poses. I thought he should have taken off the year a little bit more and grown, but you know, he obviously is placing top five and it'll be show so you really can't critique that. And in a negative way, but what you take as his coach on what he brought to the stage and what you think that you know, he should be doing moving forward. I thought he looked great. I think he's another, I think. I think honestly nine pounds on this frame. Nobody beats on him. I don't. And I mean nobody. That's a lot of muscle on that frame. Yeah, because it will look like a 18 pounds on that frame properly. Bye. And he's remarkably difficult to get by. And I see that because the judge, and I didn't ask a judge told me last week that he said, I wanted to have Patrick first and almost every shot. Mm. But, but as a pre-Jage and moron, I realized he was up against bigger guys. And he said to me, they weren't better, but they were bigger. Right. It's in the bodybuilding show. Yeah. As well as, you know, condition wise, his condition was spot on last week. So that's a judge telling you, some respect to guide. That's good. That's very good. Um, I mean, the same story, essentially. I'm going to, I got some exclusive, a C.D. I'll hotel video footage on the next. I can't see date. We read the trailer. It's very, let me get the folders off all the under his. Keep in mind, he looks better here because I put my, my iPhone 7 filter on it. It's a little bit fishy. I hold those. All right. Let's see how it looks. Yeah, this, this is, this is, he looks dynamite here, man. I'll do the sound effects. If I'm not, I'll hear the sound. No. I can't. We should be able to hear the sound. I hear it. I may be not hear it. You know, the bells and whistles are everything. They have a hamstring crazy from the side. Yeah. Because you're rounded in the shots. What's your side, Trice up? Late from the side is, you know, ETL. You get the magic window over there of light on them. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Alone. He's so dangerous. You know, that's the, that's the thing. He looks so deadly here. Yes. Let me tell you. I used to always say, I'd love to look like Tony Freeman. You know, if I had a pick up physique, you know, this, this physique wouldn't be a bad physique to walk around with, right? No, this is a physique you come into the hotel room and you say, shit. But the chose no. No, but I'm saying, I'd like to walk around with that physique. That's a nice looking physique. Yeah. So. Let me see if I could. I want to everyone will have his number on speed dial. They've all the girls in. I can put that. Yeah. I can put it right. You know, on you. And I can do it in three weeks. Exactly. Exactly. Well, catching looked at that. Really good. So what does he do next? He's shutting it down or. He shut it down and take the time to grow. Put some size on a man. Exactly. That's a. That's the. It's not going to be hard for him to put on that muscle. Once he has some time to do it, you know. What, you wouldn't, you wouldn't ship for the Arnold. I guess you would push his probably the next show. I'll tell like later in 2021. Yeah. Maybe later. I think it's going to move. I don't think you, I don't think you should do it. Like the Arnold this year. I don't think he's been, I don't think he can make enough improvements. But then again, he's a freak who knows. Maybe he can't. I'll eat my words. I'll get an email from him when he wins the Arnold. Yeah. I'm saying, you said I couldn't do it. You know. Well, he likes to challenge. Let's talk about Eddie Brockamante. So another one of your guys. I think fifth place. He has to be a real win for Eddie because I don't think anyone expected it. Although I did suggested in the preview that I did a show because I know Eddie's always dangerous and he's always in good shape. But I mean, just gnarly conditioning. Yeah. I mean, that's, let's face it. And he's got a big structure. That's what got him in that fifth position. Yeah. I mean, he has, he has, you know, very good condition. And he's very tall. I mean, he's tall and wide and things flow. You know what I mean? Things generally flow on his physique. Oh. And he's got wow. Yeah. He's got wow factor. He continues to improve. You know, the interesting thing, even though I couldn't see the call outs, I could hear them because I couldn't see up through that video. Right. He wasn't in the first call out. Oh, he wasn't really. And you know, they had him down to like, you know, way out. Like, but they moved him up. And yeah, I would agree with you. It's a win. You know, he's like, I just posted on my Instagram. Besides, filled with photos of him. I said, you know, he's been third, fourth, fifth and sixth in Pro Shows. And he's just, you know, he's close to. He's just close. He just needs like everyone else. Five pounds. You know what I mean? Five pounds in that frame. I mean, everyone will exactly get five pounds, right? Every single person who's in the top eight, I'll move on. So I sound like a broken record. But, you know, he's continued to. He's continued to improve since he turned pro. He's been overlooked in shows where he didn't place in the top five or six. You know, where he's was brought a great package. New up pro a couple years ago. But, yeah, I thought he looked very good here. I agree. Let's talk about a moment of Shabon. I was impressed with him. He's very good. Good. Shabon guy, but doesn't look short. Does he? He doesn't look short. Shorter. I guess, you know, he's short. Look at those, he's, he was a projection. What, where's he for? Yeah, a projection. I think the Egyptians got the lower quiet there. Those those lower kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, between him and, and we'll talk about the sum of stuff in a minute. You know, who else was a, was a, was a ranny? I mean, a, a, an assar. I don't know if an assar was a real, isn't an assar like Yugoslavia? No, it's mother's Egyptian. I've sure was Egyptian, I've been. The father, so the father, I think. Chris, I don't appreciate you being with lumping me with these, these moronic fishermen. I am, I'm, I'm a, I'm a much, I'm an intellectual. I speak, he's languages and, thank you, thank you. Thank you, the mass monsters for me here. Who's the other one? What's the, the staff from the Hammond, right? Maybe Hammond, the staff, uh, what's the, Mama, the staff had the wacky legs, too? Yeah, no, you'll have those lower tier drops. It's definitely genetic. This is definitely they all have good abs, a good line to babs to right, they have perfectly right about it. So he's good, I like it. I think, I, you know, I think you can make a case from probably being higher in this show. But if he was short, maybe that's, you know, his, his conditioning from behind could have been a little dry, but he looks pretty good. The good Sam's and everything. Yeah, oh, he's, well, he's complete his, what he is. Yeah. You know what I mean? Um, nothing's overwhelming. That doesn't mean he's small, but nothing is, it goes back to, again, it's a show of who has the least weakness is. The reason he fell in this six is because he really doesn't have any weaknesses. Right. Six in a good lineup, you know. What about this, this Joe Seaman guy from, he was, he was, he was like, I didn't even know he was. He was being beat up. Yeah, big part of level. He's from Canada. Great condition. Yeah, I think he shot well. I don't think anyone expected, he might be the darkest because no one knew who he was going into the show. He looked very good, even on, even on, and then completely blackout. I wonder why they have lighting problems. Maybe because they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they then you was just not good. You know, well, be good. Yeah. All right, let's, let's, let's. Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's get the shower model. We can't complain that they didn't have the best, you know, video lighting. No, you're right. I think I, I, I think, I've. I kept, I had to have to all these, these promoters that make make him just happen. Because they're doing it with nobody until they lose money. It's not cool, you know, if you take tim, out of the picture. Yeah. And you take Jake Woodhouse picture. This is what I've been, I mean, and Jake Wood with him. And Gary Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, but Gary wasn't doing a project. Okay, was, yeah, he did do it, it does the master's probably. Yeah, I don't know, you're saying the guys that are spending the money, who are losing money. I understand. This would have been a bust of a year. Yeah, there would have been no year. There would be a whole thing would have been canceled, like, well, these are the sports. Let's look at a haste on Mustafa. All right, give us the give us the timeline on this one, because, you know, it's amazing that a guy made it today. He looks okay here. It's pretty, I'll play the hotel stuff later, but let's show me, I mean, this look is two hours of way from the hospital. Was he in the hospital this morning? The morning of the show? It was for 48 hours, and then he was discharged at 9 and got on stage at 11. What the heck? So now go over what happened? What was he doing in the hospital? I could picture. Okay, I'm back to unfortunately New York. I got to Tampa, New York on Tuesday. And I just thought he was fatigue and stuff. You know, like, oh, maybe he's dying. You know, just typical freak contests. But as Tuesday went into Wednesday, you know, he told me he had really bad. He had a lot of issues, one with diarrhea. And then all of a sudden, like crazy hemorrhates to the point where, well, he couldn't. By Friday, he could barely speak. Well, the pain. So you knew that any more of the hemorrhates at this point? No, well, it was hemorrhates. It was bleeding. It was bad. Right. And Friday, I thought, okay, maybe you shouldn't do the show. And that was like, that was like, we couldn't even breach that because at that point, he was like, no way. It was like, it was impossible. And then by Saturday, you know, the flag, of course, was his presentation on Saturday. And that was mostly directly 100% attributed to, like, like he couldn't really flex. He was in too much pain, is what you're saying. Yeah. So after the show, I'm shocked. Okay, you know, I'm going to try to make it out to Vegas. You know, he stays in Tampa a few days. He has to Vegas the second. He got off the plane. They went directly to the hospital. He stayed there. The two days. It was a damaged pain. Now, what do they give you from pain and for that? Did they just like give you topical stuff? I think of you know, like, percussive, which obviously, it cost a pay to you. Yeah, they give you no products. No, what was he to per his food? I mean, what was he doing? I think I was just wasn't eating. They just I beat him, so that was it. Wow. And when you get, I don't even, how do you deflate someone who's on a live. You know, he was, he was deflated out of his mind from diarrhea. You know what I mean? Oh, so they didn't even matter. And I like saying, yeah. So, so you guys were playing like catch up. I mean, he, no, you sent me a video. I think I think, I, I, I honestly, I think it, like, like, at nine between nine and levity, like it doesn't doughnuts. Oh my gosh. I didn't have a napkin. After all that. Okay, well, he wasn't eating. Well, now, let me ask you this question. You sent me this video. Yeah. What was the video from what day was this video? I was first day before the, You were throwing. Before New York. All right, so let's play this video because this is, this is Chris, to a show in the hotel room. Okay. Guy, good evening. What did that just like, that's, that's, that's a, that's a Libby of damage everywhere. Oh, that, he looks like NASA else a body from behind, you know, with a better back. What is, you know, Chris, I hear them saying, You know, you know, crazy because I thought he looked crazy. Look at this. Not like much, much the pextrations. You know, how tall is he? You look short here, he's so big. Five, seven. He's got you, he's got you. He's got you. Oh, just 63 right there. Very good, very impressed. And the other interesting thing day with the hemorrhages, like Thursday is just, I mean, his body, he was so, with sweat at all times of the day because he had a fever from the, of, because he had a infection, right? You have a low-grade infection. Oh, yeah, a high-grade infection, turn out. You know, you know, anything like low-grade. So it was with systemic almost there. Yeah. So he would drink like, you know, a, a leader of water and sweat out, and a leader within two hours. Just drenched. Yeah. Now we, we know, were you against him competing at this show? No, no, because I just said, you know, he came all this way, you know, just he puts so much into this show. I mean, no one puts a lot into the show. Right. But he's like the other guys. I mean, I'm sure there's multiple people other than Hassan most staff, who's, show number one was postponed. Show number two was postponed. Show number three was canceled. Right. And in fact, when the New York curl was supposed to be on at six weeks out, I advise us to, you know, it's just too much work. You're not even in shape. I mean, you look decent, but it's going to be, it's, it's so much. And what if they don't have it? And he said, you know, I want to do it. Hmm. Well, where does he go from here now? Is he going to try to do another shower? Is he going home? I think he's got, he's still got, you know, take the harvest. He's, he's nowhere near on the woods with the ham-wide stuff. Obviously, you think he's going to need like some ways to surgery those things? That's usually what they do. They laser him off. I think he's got to, you know, you got to get him on some fiber-lies for us. He can't go home until, you got to put the instructions in, in Arabic though. His wife speaks very, very good. He may, he may get hungry on low carbs and eat the whole time. Yeah, too. Tell him, I'll send him some fiber-lies. Where's he staying? Where's he staying? He's staying in Vegas until he can get the strength to decide what he's leaving. It's a, what he's, people don't really have to mourn, fly back to Egypt. So he's got to be able to sit on that plane. And if you, you know, if you got hemorrhage, man, it's not funny. You don't have to tell funny thing. It's not funny. The flight, like the way they got to, the connections. They had like a nine hour layover in Turkey. Right. And then it was 40 hours to get from. Wow. That's like a Chrissosita flight. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's 40 hours to get back from Tampa. Yeah, because you got to go to Maine. Yeah. But it took him 40 hours, you know, like getting to get him from New York. That mess is up right there. We think of the sitting. When you don't know, you have hemorrhage, they get ready to blow up. It's got to be terrible. It's got to be terrible. I wouldn't wish that. I wouldn't wish like a bad case hemorrhage on anyone, you know. That's even my worst enemy. That's what they say. You've already sent a piece of pain in the ass. That's what it's like coming out. That's what it's like. That's what it's like. That's right. That's right. Hang in the shed. Oh, my God. Never ending. So Antoine Vallions going to the Olympia. It's going to be pretty excited. Look, I got it. The guy worked hard, you know, made it happen. It's got to be exciting for him. I would think. Oh, first time. First time is always the most exciting one, you know, because it's just, I met the Olympia. Every single person's ever met the Olympia. It gets crazy excited about their first Olympia. Yeah. I mean, he's been, I mean, they were grooming. This kid was supposed to go on the Olympia stage, you know. Like when he was the teenager, you know, they were saying he's going to be on the Olympia stage. So to finally make it there, you know. Sometimes when people get sidetracked like that, when they have so many problems in their life, a lot of times they never, they can never make that comeback. Yeah. He did it. He was able to pull it off. How many bodybuilders do we know who was supposed to make it to the Olympia? And then just the personal lives just exploded. Mm-hmm. Inpload it. And they didn't even qualify to become a pro or they made it. And then they only got the pro card. And that was it. They went down the tube. You know, with their. Well, I saw the Olympia guys put up a picture. So they had the meeting out there at the Olympia. Finally, they were able to go see the planet Hollywood venue. And that's from the left there that's Angelica Nebia. You know, works for Flex and the whole crew. A tamer, Algundi, obviously. And then there's Dan Salman in the middle. The Germanian Jake Wood and Tyler Manning. So that leads me to believe that they're making progress, right? Look, if it wasn't Jake Wood behind running these things and owning the Olympia, I would be nervous that the show would be canceled. I really don't think it would have happened. Do you think it would have happened if Pecker had the show? No way. They would have probably canceled it. Six months ago, they were to cancel it. There's that's the political thing to do, right? Well, I mean, it's business wise. But there's a decision wise. I mean, because they're not feeling this right. Well, that's the point. That's why I asked you. I said you got one that softball question is, is it different? You know, David Pecker would come out once he answered, I love body building. And Jake Wood loves body building. Right. So, I mean, you have to like totally be engulfed in it to say, you know, I only let the I'm having it no matter what. Yeah. You think black men calls up Jake Wood and like, Jake, it's a steep black man from Muscle and the Bellman. I got him just telling you, you're doing a great job. I don't know. What do you think? You tell us, you think he's jealous of the whole thing. Um, you know, it's weird because he could be a he could have been in the position to own it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll at least never would have allowed him to pay the money to buy it. I'm sure. But he would have done a good job with the two because he's, you know, he's passionate, genuinely passionate. Yeah. If a lease would have let him like, you know, uses money to do whatever he wanted with it. He would have made it great. Yeah. Yeah. Probably would have, he would have had like celebrity head judges himself. And calling up, you know, can we get, can we get, you know, I mean, get time and call me. I'm not on the panel. Yeah. I call him Kardashian and they are just for a judge one, the two, twelve. That's right. Judge Bikini, Kim Kardashian had judge. That there would be a move scene would do right? It would be a really, really, really, really. It would be a brilliant move, too. It would be brilliant. But how many people would be watching on her? She'd have her, she'd hold up her phone on Instagram. There'd be six million people watching the Olympia, you know. It's brilliant move. But it's not going to happen. Right. The office say he's got a, you know, one of Clark's Skype call with. He, he, he, he, he, he. Yeah, he'd be like, let's call the wellness division that Kardashian division. Much more market emotes. Hey, you know, the thing is. I'm talking to him. It would stick, right? Oh, it would be that definitely would. And the Ashley and division. We get rid of the wellness of Kardashian. You'd have like, they'd say, they'd have to call Pesburg and say, why do we have like. Fashionals 700, you know, entries per division. Yeah. The fashion. It's a good thing to visit. Right. There you go. They're making a fortune on that one. Don't doubt it all. So the next, what is the next big pro show is Chicago now? It's going to be taking place in Atlanta. Yeah, that's right. It's in Atlanta. I've improved it. And is that wings of strength as well? Yes. Yeah. That's some Gardner. So, see that. And is that the, and then they get the Alicante Spain one? Yep. In a month or so or the week before, I think it's week before Chicago. We were right around the same time. And what is the last, what did we got coming up after that Romania? Is that a call of fire? So, Alicante Spain is, is they're calling that the, Oh, they have it. Oh, they actually have an NPC European championships that's a, the given, the giving out three Qualification spots per division for the Alicante Spain one. And I think that's only because they don't have, they don't only have one show in Europe. You're shut down all the shows because I was helping, I know you probably helped a lot of European guys too. All this shows that there's nothing. So, everyone has to go to that Alicante Spain show. Yeah. Or the, I think they have one more in another country too, but it's not a, a pro show, but they won't let trap it. They won't let E cross over the borders and stuff like that there. I don't know if it's good or bad with the whole COVID thing. I have no idea. The Esco Romano, it's going to be COVID is going to be over with after the election. But these things, they think it's a whole bit, they got a cancel. Yeah, they've been going to call a lot. I think COVID is a black lives matter. You got a cancel. No, we'll, we'll racial issues anywhere. Yeah. As cops, I always beat up on pizza on him and his little. So, but, uh, it looks like that the, we're going to have like a really dizzy fall because, you know, think about it. Chris, we're going to have all these, um, we have the NPC masters, nationals. We have the, uh, the USA, which is going to have the USA masters as well. We're going to have the NPC nationals, the team universe. They're all going to be taking place like within six weeks if you show them. Think about all those pro qualifiers. If you can't get a pro card, they, you suck because if you're top five and any of those shows, as long as you hit all five of them, you should be able to get your pro card, right? Yeah. And, and, and the nationals gives top two in every way class of pro cards. So, I mean, you really, the top six people in every division. I mean, there's no excuse not to do all the shows unless you run out of money because, I mean, that's the only, that's, that's a limiting factor that. No, although those shows, that they're going to be outside or. I don't know. Well, no, I think in Florida, as long as everything's being held in Florida, you can hold the stuff inside. We don't care over here, in Florida. Well, you, well, you do it, but they don't. They don't. I do it, but they're, but the state doesn't. Obviously. Yeah. That's how you know if you actually a believer or not believer. Let's say. Would you take your kids to a Bible and show a game? No, I don't know what I'm going to say. But the, you know what the thing is, though. In the end, you know, eventually, you know, this is going to die down. It's going to, it's just going to go away. But in the end, you know, maybe Florida will come out, you know, financially better off than all these other things because they are having business here, some might, I mean, in a limited confession. Is Disney still up in Amanda? I don't think she can hear me. I think Disney still open. Keep it the crowds. They are like trickling in. People in here. They want to go to the press conference. Open up here, but there's no one has any business. I think that people like this is up here. I, what we order in. That's what that, that's, you know, like, there. You don't even get this. That's the way it's going to come out. We, we order out back. We order pizza. We order, you know. You don't have to leave the house. Yeah, you don't have to. Now they have this new service to Amanda was telling me where you can order your groceries. You go online and you can pick out your groceries, they deliver. I hate grocery shopping. I've been doing it myself because I, I'm like, I'm like the, the guy they send. You have like they always have the guy who test the rate. They have to canary's, they test the radiation. Yeah. Whenever it's like an, an, any kind of radiation, or when they were working the labs with radiation, they would have canaries there because the canaries of diverse if there's a radiation week. I'm there on the canary, the elderly area. So, uh, what you guys got a hurricane coming your way. Now I think we have heard it. I think we had a little bit of a tropical storm, a little bit of a tail end of that over here. I'll go to the water. I'll go to the water. Yeah. So it's the world is coming to an end. What can I tell you? It's 2020 was a rough year for the civilization. I think. Well, I was in town today. I was like, tumble weeks going downtown. Really? Even in the end, still, huh? Are things closed there? Things that things are either. Things that a lot of things are closed and people who are open have desperate look. This, you know what this nothing worse than a look of desperation. I go around, you know what I mean? I go to stores and I, you know what I'm in town. I look around and I go to restaurants and peek in. Because that's what I like to do. Sure. You see people with, like, sad, desperate, full faces. It's terrible. It is kind of sad, I think about it. I mean, because, uh, yeah, but yet still people don't want to work around. I still can't get a fence guy to put a fence up around. I can't get a fence guy to put a fence up around. Construction people still busy somehow. I actually, I actually got a guy to a game called, which is a little Decrously. Absolutely crazy. I get a fence call. I get one a few days. What do you call you? I'm afraid to even admit it. I'll tell you better. I'll tell you better. I'll tell you better. I can, I can, I can one up you. I can. So I have this place. I've bought it a long time ago, long time ago. And I bought this. It's a department building. And I have a real estate. I don't, but he don't know me, but he's my idol. It's like people know Arnold, right? You know, Arnold's my idol, but Arnold don't know who they are. So one day I get a call from this guy. Said, oh, yeah, I bought the building next to you. My name is Arnold Schwarzenegger. You know, he tells me his name. I said, I just do this. Of course. I know everything about you. I'm like, you're my idol. He says, I want to put a fence between my property and your property. Let's meet lunch. It's like Arnold's head. Let's go for lunch. Right. We're waiting at Weng. I know all his properties, David. It's sick. That's crazy. I'm like a stalker. And so he says, you know, what to put up a fence between my property and your property. And I'm taking this building and I'm just putting a board. And I'm just putting a board you know, it's kind of a junkie building. And then he says, which like, you know, how long we go half on the on the fence. It's almost what's in there. Right. What am I supposed to say? Yeah. Yeah. He's been boozelling you. He says me the bill for 15 grand. 30,000 for the fence. Just because you had. And how long is the fence? I haven't made a penny out yet. I've been struggling for two years. How long is it? How big is what's the distance? Nothing. Probably 100 yards. 100 yards. Why is the fence so expensive? When he put the wall. That's why he's my idol. Because when you go in, Dave, when you go in to see his apartments. Yeah. He take your breath. They're just apartments. He did build. He built like the wall. They want to build around Mexico. Yeah. And he's having me pay half a heart. Just like Mexican. Just for somebody. You should you got a fight. So so an elephant. Thank you for your part of the bill. That's what the problem. So I guess it drops right here. Because he brings it up. He'll say. I just show him. Hey, I'm on the same team as you. You know, that kind of thing. Yeah. So I'm looking for picture. Tell me what this is from without reading the. You can't read it. Which you can't say. Here we go. That's fuel. That's fuel. He's from the Colorado Pearl. I'm right. I'm going to spread it this stuff. Yeah. It's a great picture. I'm going to get shredded. It's a crazy shredded. You know what? He's he's. He looks different. Maybe it just seems younger. I don't know. Right? You get. You get. You know, me and you look different. How many years is 10 years ago? What can you just tell? I'm saying so as a shame. He's face just looks different. Yeah. He's engaged. Yeah. He's a really. He doesn't look. He doesn't look. He just looks different. You know what I mean? He doesn't have wrinkles on his face. Yeah. He's like. Broden. Broden doesn't really look. Actually, Broden looks no different. I think when he was first started. He's an ugly guy. When. When. When. When. He looks. He looks. It's unbelievable. Like. Like. Dexter. And. His body is. Just. But his face. You can see. He had. You can see the lines of the ages face. Nothing was bad or that, but I'm just saying. Broden has like. He could be like 30 years old. You know, he looks. He actually looks like a little kid actually in this phase. Yeah. Yeah. He does. He has a very young looking. Kist type face. Kip. I'm going to give you one more. Phil Heath. He told me where. What's show this one's from. So. That one I haven't seen. That was the 2000. That's the Lace. Official. Yeah. 2000. And. And. A has. He ended up third. Where we end up. 2008. I'm looking from. I see he actually put it up as like a little. It was like a little. If anyone guess this one. 2008. Only 61,000 people. I'm. I'm. The year it was the year he almost to make it a pre-judging. Yeah. I don't even know what year. I don't. Nine nine nine nine. That's 2009. You know what. What you're sure of. Um. I just know the look. But I know what you know a day. If you go back and look at that pre-judging. Um. He made the changes between pre-judging and finals that end on May. Between New York and Tampa. And I heard that he ate at the buffet like all day long. I don't know if that's true. But in pre-judging he was like. Yeah. Just like almost. Sshhh. Small. Not small. And for the night show which was a full day later he was like he looked like he gained. Fifteen pounds of I bet he did gain ten. And that's the picture right there. Hmm. If you go back and you look at 2009. Phil Heath pre-judging Olympia. And then go back and look at 2009. And then go back and look at the final. You'll say I didn't know Phil was so good that year. Right. And you wouldn't know because all the whoop-law was in the pre-judging. You know he was. What could be brings it. This year it's going to be. A lot of crying guys out there. It's for sure. Well you know what unfortunately we're going to get another we're going to get a press conference without. Because Phil's good in a press conference because he lets he blows a gasket. Yeah. He might be to he might have a different approach this year. Yeah. But I don't know. Maybe I'll be can you always blow a gasket. You know and if you want prone to blow a gasket it's like you know. All dogs don't have our new tracks. No. Maybe not. He looks pretty big. I'll give it as much. I'll show. I'll post up a picture to muffin health people's declarations of way they go. I have like 40 and a half. You can send them right now. He looks lean too. Yeah. Yeah. Looks big. Definitely looks big. He won't grant you an interview if he wins. No. He might. But whatever. I don't know. Who else is going to interview with? I mean, if you're Mr. Limpio you should you go interview with everyone. You know you mark your brand and that's really what. That's really what it is. They could know and interview with anyone because there was exclusive contracts. There're just there. There're just people who don't want to interview with certain people because they don't like. They're they're critiqued or they're physique. It was like when versus we do and I want to have to be together. I get an exclusive video on these athletes. Remember, I was working for black men during these times. It was driving me crazy, you know, with contracts and this person. And then he was, we had to like, patrol the internet because if God forbid these guys, you know, because they would forget and they would do an interview with like, body's only in that calm or something like that. And that'd be like, uh, victory. And that's supposed to be talking to the sky, you know, you're explosive fat. Like, I, I, I, I, I didn't have any conversations. I thought it was ridiculous. The whole episode of the league. But, you know, I was defending the, you know, the, you know, the label, so to speak. But it was, it was ludicrous to go up and freak out when someone would, you know, he, you know, he was, he would send the letter out with lawyer letters. And what a season just is or what he's got to probably the garbage and wipe their ass with it. And he would never follow up because he didn't want to spend the money on the follow up, you know. It's like the little sending out a letter like he's going to have a victory to want to spend the money. Yeah, I, at least he, why didn't even send that no one's even responding to these guys like laugh if he's letters. They know that you're not going to do anything about it. Yeah, I got to keep it on fire on case you never get to escalate. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I've brushed and filed. Can we get to the black man's file with all the, I love I, I probably have the biggest file there, right, right? Yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I got my, I got my files and biggest. It might even be big of a jays. Well, rose inちゃ after I was out there. Yeah, we could still write this. h – the, you know, timers going to be running the Olympia backstage. So, that's what's a problem. Yeah, but you know what, I think him and his brother must be going out of that mind. Because think about having to show as they normally hold every year, they have like a record. There's no one who holds more shows. They have like a ridiculous number. And they probably are only holding a fraction of fraction of what they normally hold. So that's, you know, for guys that work all the time, that's, you know, that they'll go crazy like that, you know, thinking about it. They probably have spent more time canceling venues and giving people back money and, you know, and talking to sponsors than they've ever done before. That's just not fun, you know, that's not a fun thing to do. Especially when you have a lot of negative messages, you know, you know, what's worse, the uncertainty of it all. Yeah. And it's what we're going to do. Might be able to have it hotel say, yeah, I think you can, you know, get back with us in two weeks, then everyone can. Hey, we haven't show. Well, possibly we might move the, you know, the Cal Pro to North Dakota and I don't want to show it to Vegas. The scary thing, Chris, is it could still go on into 2021? There's no guarantee that this is going to let up, you know, because there could be another wave of this stuff, you know, of COVID going on when we hit the cool of nuts, you know, what has changed at all? You're good in science. Well, these viruses sometimes run their course. In other words, you would think, well, there's some people haven't got you, so it should continue spreading. Well, sometimes they just die out. I mean, now they're not everyone gets the flu every single year, right? I mean, some people get it, some people don't get it. And that's it. And it runs its course and it's done. So we don't know if this COVID is, because this COVID seems pretty good evidence that it's a manufacturing virus. We don't know if it has a longer life or longer half life. We can't wait to people start getting the flu thinking they have COVID. Right. We're good. That's going to be crazy. I have to go for a colonoscopy and I have to get COVID tested on the Monday before, because I'm getting it done in a hospital. So I heard that I heard the procedures not so fine. I have to stick to stinking up your nose and like swab up in your like sinus cavity. No, it's worse. The nose, one, I'm a wake for so that might be worse. Maybe you should be the specialists for her son because you. Yeah. I'm going to send I'm going to send him on. I'm going to say five or King. Right. Right. Black for a call. We write the five. Roll 12 people wrapped around my head. Come to the five. But yeah, I get a send has signed some five. He's going to be at these going to be in Vegas for over a week. I'll send him a took a couple of times. I'll be happy. It'll definitely help him, you know, moving his bowels is going to help him a lot. Obviously, it's going to take some of the strain off of the the last exit, you know, out of his body, so to speak. But it, yeah, I feel bad for the guy. It's a very, very uncomfortable thing to have to go through. I know a lot of guys who had laser surgery, you know, to remove the the hemorrhates and they were like, it was a God sends. But I'm telling you, you could prevent yourself from getting hemorrhates. You've got to take a good quality for eye for something. There's not that many out there. I'm not trying to push my product, but I'm telling you talk to the guy, Assistant, you know, if you wanted to get my product works, you know, you got to take a look. You stand out with a, it was a disciple too. You know, maybe, so give it a shot, guys. If you have been trouble with hemorrhates or you have uncomfortableness down there, that this this sold really takes the burden off of that as well. And because it's, you don't have to strain. It's the strain, especially when you're that big too, you don't realize when you, when you wait 250, and you are all muscle and you strain, okay, this, the strain that you're putting on that area is way way more than it would if you're like like 150 pound aight, you know. So that's another thing that you have to consider. And plus, you're eating eight times a day, you know, it doesn't help you. So the area never gets a rest down. So once you get some kind of a hemorrhate that flies up, you're not giving in a break because you're always eating. So there's my little rant to the day.

Welcome back to legendary foods muscle in the morning. On day polumbto and today is Monday, July 19th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. There are too many universal truths in this world. But Monday, being international chest-day, is definitely one of them. And if you need motivation to celebrate your Monday and style, you're going to be one of the most impressive things in this video. Sean, training chest with the stand-alone goot, it looks like Sean's carrying around size. He was a few years ago when he was prepping for the Olympia. And that version of them ended up being one of the most impressive physics of the last decade. I don't know when or if we're going to see Sean on a bodybuilding stage again. But I do know this. The last time he competed, he won the Mr. Olympia. And if that's a level he can get back to, it means that him getting back into the mix would be a complete game changer for a lot of people. Right now we're somewhere in the neighborhood of being four weeks out from the Texas Pro. And if you're a Logan Franklin fan, you might want to get your tickets now while you still can. Because it looks like this man is about to put on a show. The updates had been coming out of Logan's camp over the last few weeks have really caught people's attention. So much so that someone actually asked me if I thought that Logan had the potential to be a top three finisher at the Olympia this year. In the two times that we've seen him competing classic physique, he's been absolutely lights out. And now that he's had another full offseason, the grow into the division, it should be fun to see what that translates to when he's up there competing at the highest level. I know people like to say that imitation is the best form of flattery. But if anyone out there is thinking of imitating Esapasini, they may want to go easy because trying to operate at that level is in parameters. Since the beginning of international lineups were released a few weeks ago, the former Olympia champ has been training like a complete savage. And she is starting to look more and more like he actually resorted down in a distribution two years ago. When Esa's at the top of her game, she can be damn near unbeatable. And if that's the Esa who shows up in Columbus locking up her second straight title is almost a short thing. Well, it looks like things just got real for all the athletes who are getting ready for the classic physique Olympia. Because as of last week, you're reigning at the fending two-time champ. Chris Bumstedt is officially back in terminated alone. According to Chris, he weighed 246 pounds at the start of his prep, which is the highest that his weight has ever been heading into a show. The back to basic approach that Chris took this off season has been well documented. And when you see how thick he is in these pictures, it really hammers home why he took that approach. And if he shows up denser than he was last year with that same level of conditioning, everyone else is just competing for second place. And that does it the yet another edition of Muscle in the Morning on Day Palombo reminding you to always be true to your passions and it should have followed us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I'm standing here with Chuck Zito. He just punched me in the nose. I'm bleeding a little bit, but Chuck, you're looking young every time I see it. I'm not saying it's just because I'm trying to get a buddy up. You do look great. Thank you, man. Thank you. You got all your half. A few more pounds. Oh, definitely I want all my hair. Unbelievable. My grandfamble. I was 28 years old, yet it's full head of hair. My father, 78, full head of hair. So my hair's not going away. Last time we spoke, you were supposed to do a little MMA fighting. What happened with that one? Well, I tried to do that when I was in my 50s. Now I'm 59 as a buddy. Are you 59? My first two days ago. Congratulations. Thank you. And maybe when I'm 60, maybe let me do it. I don't know. So what do you think I'm trying to tell me? I was too old, but I want to fight a guy at my age. So one day I'll happen. You never know. Today's young, we'll see what happens here. You might not try to really cut toys here. Maybe we could arrange that. Yeah, I think he's a greatest MMA fighter ever. Right? I mean, he's battled everyone. He's done it all, man. And what to look at him? Look at him. He's 44, I think. He still looks phenomenal. He probably could still trade. Did he have any intention of fighting? I think he still fights. He actually retired, but of course, he still trains. Look at him. He's phenomenal. That's right. But still on him and everybody's all. He's following your footsteps. He's all mine. Yeah. Now you looked at the jackets when you came in and you saw the very familiar. That's pretty wild, man. Especially to read on a white. That's your colors. That you used to be. Yeah. You made a good point. You know, I said, I copy this from a son's anarchy. And you said, they copied you guys. How did they copy you guys? Me. I'm the one and only guy who coined a phrase front line nine. And they were not your first nine. Like you have first five. Right. I copy them, but I actually copied five knuckles. That's right. I got hit with the first five knuckles. What happened? How come they didn't ever bring you on as a consultant on that show? I figured you'd be the perfect guy. They actually have two Hells Angels from Oakland that consultants on a show. Lee and D.L. It was a David LaBrava show. But I had a big, when it first came out, I had a lawsuit against them. Because I went in 2004, gave them my life, my script, my everything. But you did. And then he said, they passed, they didn't want to do a motorcycle series. And then the next thing he knew, they were working on a motorcycle series. But I was so young for the last two years. I lost some re-judgment. And then I appealed it. And then Kurt Sutter, who was the creator, writer, producer, star, showrunner. If me have them, the husband of Katie Sigot, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. And look at her. She's a big fan of hers. Amazing because her girl came from our marid with children. You know, can you believe that? To the crazy bike girl. And she does look the part. She does. She fits well. She's amazing actress. By like her. And me and Kurt Sutter buried the hatchet. And we put everything behind us. And I decided to drop the lawsuit. And now I'm working on the fifth season of a sons of Anagheon. Oh, you're going to be on? I'm going to be on a man. You're going to start it, too? Yeah. So they got the right guy. Basically, he'll say in goes, if you can't beat him, join him. So I might as well join him. You should have been on it from the very beginning. You're authentic. Can you or an act? Thank you very much. I said that. But is the show, I mean, you've watched it, obviously. Yes. Is it very accurate, according to the way the bike or gangs were? Oh, look. They have a couple of health angels who consultants on it. A lot of it's accurate. They do a great job. The whole cast is, I think, phenomenal. I can't wait to work with Kurt Sutter. I'm going to the rest of the cast, but we're going to make a more authentic. That's what we learned. So, and they go, let me be me. Where are my boots and where are my everything? They can stop you from being you. You're always you, with everything part you playing on me, man. But I'm looking forward to doing the FF season. In fact, they just signed three more seasons. They did. I'm happy to hear that. They would be around for a while. So I'm looking forward to working, starting on May. And of course, it goes on FX in September. And just looking forward to kicking butt on it. Congratulations, Chuck. Thank you, Barry. It's always good to play this season. Thank you very much. Likewise. Chuck Lido. I like the colors, dude. You do? You endorse it? The red and white, though, what? Very, very, I'm paying homage to you. It's not even very close. It's the same exactal letters, the bone letters, everything. Pay homage to you. I won't wear these out. I only wear them to bodybuilders. What I could say is, you're lucky. I'm not in the club no more. Now the blood's running down my face a little more. Chuck, thanks man. Oh, pleasure. Thank you for having me.

We launched the tasty pastry with the low carb hot tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. Welcome back to legendary foods, muscle in the morning. On day polo and today is Thursday, September 30th, 2021. Let's find out what's going on in the world of bodybuilding and fitness. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back and happy Thursday. There are a few big storylines from last weekend that we haven't covered on the show yet. So we're going to try to make up for some of that now by starting with William Bonac, as you know, William didn't compete at the Arnold last weekend because travel restrictions prevented him from leaving the country. And as of the time we recorded this show, the situation still hasn't been resolved, which leaves his status with the Olympia way up in the air. And here's the thing, there were a ton of international athletes competing across all these divisions. So the idea that travel restrictions could have a major impact on the outcome next weekend, is still a very real possibility. And even though we all hope that it doesn't come to that, the reality of the situation is that we still don't know because things are, well, they are unpredictable. And I'm sure you've heard by now that Whitney Jones with the other notable absence from the Arnold last weekend, except it wasn't due to travel restrictions. It was because of a failed COVID test. Now as far as I know, Whitney's health is fine, and she should be good to go in the Olympia. That being said, I do think this is also worth paying attention to, because there's a good chance that we could have one or even multiple athletes not being able to compete Olympia weekend due to positive COVID tests. But again, just like with the travel restrictions, there's no way to predict or prevent any athlete from testing positive or even having to pull out because they were in close contact with someone. We haven't talked about it much this year, but the specter of COVID is still definitely lingering over the sports world. So all we can do is hope that it isn't part of the storylines next weekend, because Olympia weekend is supposed to be a culminating moment when we all come together and celebrate this thing that we all love. Not a time to sit around and lament what could have been under different circumstances. Even if you're not a big movie person, I think most people agree that sequels are hardly ever as good as the original. Except for Godfather. But every once in a while, there is a rare occasion when the sequel is actually better than the original. And the reason I bring this up is because the stuff that we've been hearing about Randy, since he landed here in the US, leads you to believe that this year's sequel is going to be way better than last year's original, which is pretty hard to do considering he essentially went in there and leveled the field and not even won the calendar year later. We're talking about this again. Last season he finally became the version of Randy that we all been waiting to see for the last four or five years. So this year's sequel really is good or much better than the original. That means that we're about to see an all-time box office smash when he takes the stage. Next weekend. And finally, I'm sad to say that we're ending the show today by wishing a melancholy trails to golden era icon, the brown bomber, Leon Brown, who passed away on Friday, September 24th, throughout the course of his whole fame career. Leon was considered to be one of the true trailblazers in bodybuilding. He became the first bodybuilder to be featured in Sports Illustrated in 1972. He was a member of the cast of the original pumping iron and his head to head battles with other golden era icons like Arnold, Sergio Oliva, Franco Colombo and Frank Zayner the stuff of legend. Leon Brown was truly one of a kind and the impact of his loss is one that is felt throughout the entire bodybuilding community. I want to send my deepest condolences out to Leon's family and his friends as they celebrate his life and more in his loss. Rest in peace, my good friend.

This is Dave Palombo with RXMuscle.com. I'm here at the 2011 IFBB North American Championships. Here with our bikini, overall champion, Crystal Matthews and new IFBB bikini pro congratulations. Thank you. It's amazing and really excited. So... They only had four classes here where there's normally they have six at the national shows. That make it more difficult and shed a lot more girls in each class. I mean, I just kind of throws me off. I'm such a creature of routine. So it was a little interesting at first. I normally in the tallest class. Yeah, always in the tallest class. They get us to change the light bulbs and the places. I have my boots on, which you're a little... They can be two inches tall as I don't feel short next year. Yeah, we're pretty even. You should learn those to my fiance. I thought you. Five-nine. Okay, that's your favorite word about the same. I talked to me a little bit about your journey here because I'm sure it was not an easy one. Well, I've placed second twice now at national shows and so coming so close it just makes you really hungry for it. Is that at all your shows? How many national shows have you done? Come in, complete. I did two, 2010 and this is my third one this year. So I placed second at junior USA in Houston in over 2010 and I placed second just in Charleston. And what about the times before that? What were your places? It was very off. I placed seventh in Atlanta and then I placed ninth in Jersey. Okay. So did that was such a battle? You make a good point now. I want to ask you a question beyond. What's worse coming in seventh or second? Seven. I just for me definitely. Well, the seventh wasn't hard. The ninth place was hard. What about the second the second time? Oh. I made a joke. I said if I could second this time I'm giving it back now I'm just kidding. No, it's always an honor because I know that every girl I'm up on the stage with has worked their butt off and you know everything plays a role. Let's go none of their lives. Genetics, everything. And so I don't ever expect my best to definitely be better than everyone else's best. Tonight it was because not only did you win your class and your broke out you won the overall here too against some pretty good girls. There are great girls here and I'm just very flattered and just still in a little bit of shock. Sorry if I'm mumbling a little bit but now I definitely am just excited to be a part of the best of the best. It's interesting because a lot of the bikini girls that have turned pro this year went immediately and jumped into pro competition. I don't even know if there is any pro competition so you're going to be hitting any after the Olympic? You know I'm definitely going to look into it. My main goal this year was to get my pro card. I'm going to Jamaica and October so we'll see you. This is just a good attitude. It's interesting but it's doable. Anyone who wants to know what you want to do? My best friends and my fiance. You're going to ruin the vacation if you're dieting. You know that right? Yeah I know I know but yeah I've learned to have fun and diet. It's been interesting but it's doable. Anyone who want to go to the park? Anyone you want to thank out there? Oh yeah absolutely. Best in New Carlin she's been with me since the beginning when I was a stick figure in 2009. I worked really hard to put my son on. And then of course my fiance, he's my trainer, his name is Cody Wood and Chair Creek Athletic Club and snap fitness. Those are my second, third home so. Our bikini overall champion in the new IFVB pro here in Cleveland Ohio.

Day Palombo with another RX muscle rant. Today's topic unfortunately is going to be the truth hurts. And you know, I think in today's bodybuilding world, a lot of people don't want to come to grips with what reality is. And sometimes you know when you tell too much truth or you say too many things that are too close to home in certain people, they get their panties in a wide, they get upset, they get defensive and they see it as a personal attack on them. And you know, unfortunately here on this show, I try to you know, reveal the truth to people, the way I see it. And obviously, you know, to help people not number one waste money, number two, you know, avoid learning things that are not true. And number three come to grips with reality. And sometimes reality hurts, you know, as the old movie, I think I was in that movie, reality bites, but that's really what it amounts to. I a couple weeks ago did a video about a product in Nick Trigilly, sales called, was a hyaluronic acid based, water based, injectable product that he sells on his website. And you know, I don't, I have no problem with people, you know, trying to make money to themselves. But he was, you know, portraying it is this, you know, great product that's going to enhance muscle size and shape and all these great things. And, you know, the bottom line is that there was no science behind the project. And there's no science behind the product itself. And hyaluronic acid put inside a muscle, doesn't do anything. It's the components of connective tissue, or exercise should say, Sonofiul fluid in the joint. And injecting that into a muscle is not going to do anything. Now, they do use gel based hyaluronic acid as fillers in the face, you know, to fill out little hollow as women get older, or as the collagen breaks down. But putting a version of that, which is not even the gel, because the gel would be way too expensive to ever use on a large scale, but taking a water down version, which is what it is, it's a water based hyaluronic, it's basically water with a little hyaluronic acid mixed into it. And putting it into a muscle is not going to enhance your muscles. Nick can get upset only once at what I said, and I'm sorry, you're upset, because I actually like Nick, I think you're a good guy. But the bottom line is that it's your product is not doing anything other than maybe causing a little bit of irritation in the muscle. And that truth might hurt, but it's true. And I didn't do it to maliciously malign you. I did it because I think people should know what they're spending their money on before they go out there in waste, because we only have a limited amount of money to spend on products and supplements and whatnot. And you can try to say, well, I sell a ton of it, that's not telling me and that's not confirming that the product is a good product. It just means that you're a good salesman. Also saying that guys on the Olympia stage use it, okay, all of a sudden doesn't confirm anything, because guys on the Olympia stage will use anything. Just like when I was competing, I would have tried anything that I thought would have done any good for my body or maybe not. And I'm sure a lot of the things I did try back in the day probably didn't do anything. So I'm here as a guy who's going to analyze the science of what's going on and tell you what the reality is. And unfortunately, reality sucks in this case. So Nick got hurt. He said, I'm a butt hurt. He was butt hurt basically by the fact that I did this video. And once again, maybe I should have told him up and told him that I was going to do it. That maybe since we are friends or we're trying to friends, I guess. He now went on a personal assault twice on his channel against me as a coach, which is kind of ridiculous. I've been coaching people for 25 years. My track record speaks for itself. I don't need to give my resume. I have somebody pro-card that I've helped people get that I can't even remember anymore. I've worked with pretty much everyone in the industry. Even the guys that don't work with I've answered questions for down the road if they have had any health issues or just general questions. So I kind of consider myself an expert at this point. And his assault on me was that I give the same diet and same plants every single person, which is not true. Because I work with men, women, and I work with competitors, non-competitors. The bottom line is that a coach and I've said this before, I hate to repeat myself. But a coach is not the program you give someone. The program you give someone is the starting point. The leading of coach is how you modify the diet, how you modify the supplements and drug cycles that you give people. So they pick themselves and they achieve their best conditioning. And that's really what a coach is. And that's what a good coach is. Creating a unique flavor for every single person that you give them is not a good coach. Because the initial program you give them is not a static thing. It doesn't stay that way. It changes. If I have a person who has a very fast metabolism, they're going to get more food added to that program. If I have a person who has a slow metabolism, they're going to lose food. Diet rotations change. So say that I give the same program to every single person is absolutely completely not telling the whole story. And that's not true. If I have a guy who's 200% in the 200% of the pound range and is looking to diet down for a competition, how many different versions of the program you're going to be doing? Are there Nick? Okay. You don't give someone a program that's not as good because you want them to think that they're having something special. That's not how being a coach works. Okay. There's certain templates that work for different populations of people in certain realms of what they're doing proposition wise, whether it be figure bikini, body building, you know. And that's what you use as a coach. You have the formula that you go to and you make it work. And then you modify it. If I have a person sending me updates every two or three days for 16 weeks and I'm making changes almost every single time. That initial program they got is not the same initial program that everyone else has because gets what it changes. That's what being a coach is all about. And you know with another great thing he tried to throw at me is that I charge so much money. The bottom line is I'm probably the cheapest coach on the market and the reason I do that is because I don't do this for to make a living. I love coaching people because that's a passion memory. So I make it very affordable so that people can afford to work with me and get the benefits of my knowledge. And I think that that is something that I offer to the industry as opposed to people who do this for a living who are trying to charge $35,000 or $3,000 or $3,000 or whatever they charge for a contest prep. I charge $1500 for an entire year. I charge $800 for a contest pr

Photato Let's take a look at the picture. Let's see if it's possible to take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture.

Who would have guessed it? And look who we got next to us. Mr. Cutler himself in the flesh. Good man. I would have talked about this for a minute since we had the video about the women. Yeah, right. I wanted to always train with Sam, but I'm not a guy that would ever ask. I mean, is that weird that I said I want to train with you? Or it's, I think it's probably mutual. Cross-generation. Either way, what do you think it's a chest? Just stay. It's your day, man. So we talked a little bit about the chest. You know, it's one of my weaker body parts in the beginning. And I always, you know, I had really dominant shoulders. So I had to learn how to really contract and really squeeze it. And the one thing I always try to preach is like, it's not always about the weight. And I think I told you that, I even about your body weight, right? So it's about really just, you know, getting the feel of the movements. Mind a muscle connection. I know it's harder for some of the new guys to understand that. By the way, you like you said you learn. That was like a series of your Reak-a-moment. I mean, the basement gym, mirror, incline bench. Once set, I was pushing my hands. And then the next one, like, it actually clicks. My chest was working. But I'm even trying to work on that today. Yeah. So we, almost like, you press from the bottom up to really to watch your chest rise. Right? So some people, they don't have the mass there. But I mean, you have the chest development now. So I think you can actually watch, you know, visually, the muscle actually contract now. Like, you can see it in my shirt, you know, rise. You know, there was some kind of clip. I remember you saying something where when you press, you took your gym. I do, and you can feel. And you know what's funny? When honey trained me, because I worked with Chris Asido who taught me as a teenager. And then honey took over training and was like, don't talk to your chin. Keep your chest out. But for some reason that it's a comfort level for me to talk to chin. So when we talk about wrong and right moves, I don't know if there are wrong and right. It's everyone is individual what they do. It's like your work sure doesn't work. It does. And like for some guys, I mean, I mean, I can see somebody where flat bench, ricks their shoulders. I mean, I see this all the time and I'm referencing the same guy every time. It'll tell me all, my shoulders are erect. I can't bench. And he's loading two plates on the bench. Oh, as he's saying that. It's like, maybe six or something. I haven't machined yourself in that's not tweaking it. But let's get some warm it up done. Okay, move number one. The more things change, the more they stay the same. So just like with hers, thinking, and playing hammer first. What do you, what kind of jumps do you go? I do. I start with two plates and then I'll go to three and that's about my limit. But you tell me what you're going to go. But I usually warm up with two. Yeah, that's a side. That's very cool. Some people start with one, but you have a care of these two plates are different. No, they're all the same. That's about you. I've got a little more OCD there. I just keep the seat really low on these. So I like a lower seat rather than a higher seat. That makes sense. Yeah, I got you. I'm going to jump in there. You can have the same machine doing more decline or incline. Maybe just scoot the seat up and down. Let me guess. 12 repetitions. How did you guess? This might be a little more actually. Yeah, it's still warming up. So I'll do two sets like this and then I'll usually go into the working sets. At least three working sets. So this is more of a feel set. Just getting a getting a blood in there. Yeah, I ended up, uh, I don't know if I end up doing feeler sets. Like, I'll do. I hate warm. I hate the term warm up because you went to 150 degrees in Vegas. I'm still a warm, right? I think I almost say feeler reps. Like, I might do like, if I already warmed up with the cables, I might do like three and then say, okay, I can handle tokens. Everything feels good. Let's move on. So you don't really care, okay? Yeah. But it's like, I got an easy way for me to do. But I get a grip position because I like a little like CRU going wider. I'm basically in the middle of that handle. Gotcha. The whole thing is chest out, right? We talked about, yep, there you go. Contraction boom, how's that feel good? Yep. That seat a good height or is it? That's right. See, like, like you said, you can kind of scoot your body down to. You have to create that art, right? Yeah. Me, like me sitting like this. I, what? That's a reverse a year. You are straight like this lean forward like hunches. That's definitely changed. All right, we're going to do one set of this way again. There you go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That'll be fours about the limit. That'll be heavy enough, but not so heavy. I'm going to rip something. It's like Dorian H, shit, bro. Uh, they're working set will be more like 15 or something. But like, easy to do it. It's almost like I want to conserve energy. It's not what I'm trying to think. He's like, so how many? Oh, no, guy, bro. How many are all out? Usually it's about seven. Sometimes six. Like if I did a, so if you do four plates, what do you how many sets are you thinking with the four plates? That'd be two. Or if after that first set, I might have to drop into three in the 25. But it's rare I do four sets on one machine. No, you didn't come out. You didn't sense no pretty light for me to be honest, bro. But I just don't usually go that heavy, right? Like pushes. I, uh, I just had that yesterday with legs. I'm doing leg press. I'm like, I feel really good right now. My knees feel good. But a week ago, they were feeling a little tender. So it's like, okay, rather than just immediately go all out. I don't know where. Let's just back off. Yeah, of course. So that's, that's you have to have that instinctive attitude. Never been hurt when I felt off. Because if I felt off, that was the signal to say back off. It's always when I got a lesson to your body, bro. Yeah, it's like every time I feel the best, I'm like, oh, I should push it two levels further than normal. And then I'm like in the, in the danger zone. Good. Good mum. want long work how many we call 80 sequo 1700 34 sometimes I try not to count. It's better because you're just listening to what if you got a number in your mind, you know, you hit 10. 10. It's like, oh, I did it. You know, that's why I always like you made that joke about the 12 reps. I just use as a common number. I tried not to do more than 12 if that makes sense. I hate to 12 is always my like a range of enough weight that's too light. I mean, come on. Oh yeah, for your sets. It's probably two minutes, minute and a half. If I'm feeling antsy, maybe a minute like triceps or no, and like a side ladders, that could be a minute. Because I'm not going to heavy. So yeah, 30 pounds and burning. But something like this, I really have you one. Probably two or three minutes. Enough time to just feel my heart get back to normal. I'm not huffing. And I feel like I can do the same weight for at least 80% each of that seed set. But I mean, sometimes if I felt like that was heavier than expected, I'd drop this to three in a 25. How do I feel? Oh, I got one more. But yeah, probably just, I mean, I'd probably do the two sets here and then block. Like I'll do three sometimes. But if you think it's enough, like you said, you said you're feeling good with it. Because it's like I want to do enough, but there's no point in doing too much. So I'm trying to find that line. Yes. Let's go. A little peak. A little peak. A little peak. Good. Come on. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's probably too heavy. Not with the assisted reps. That was eight. But it's just a little bit of this. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard not to utilize it because I'm like fighting mine. You know what happens? This is what happens when you start to struggle. So we talk about that, right? That's where the weight, remember when you were talking about the tricep press downs? Yeah. That's, you know, I'm trying to find it, but it's, it's like it's easy on the first three. It was okay. This weight is moving. But yeah, it's hard to find. That's what I learned training with people unless I never really had training partners. But when I did, it always helps to get through that little peak, right? To keep once you start bringing the triceps in the shoulders, how much you've been offending when that one area, right? Well, would you finish all your pressing first? No, I go. Sometimes I, what I would I always talk about and not to say that I followed this to extreme pump stretch, pump stretch. That's kind of how I guided. So if I, now I kind of do like some sort of fly, open up more tissue, more blood flow, since I already got some blood in there. Dress those fibers, get some more, and then pump. But you take it to what you're doing, what your normal range is. Well, I'll follow some of that. But you a, more cable flyer, we can do a cable fly. I'm trying to think, uh, I mean, it was a cable. Okay. We can find one. Yep. Have any of you like this handle? That one? No, that. I was by the say, through the fat grips applied to the cables too. I'd probably grab the thinnest one. This probably can be some floating around here somewhere. Are you doing a single army? You're going to do both. I was thinking, both. Huh? Yeah, both arms. You want to go low? You want to go high? Maybe, uh, what do you like? 17. You got, you see the 17 or yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's the right. Sometimes I feel like, okay, I just did an incline upper chest movement. Now, I might just make this more of a decline fly. And then I'll go back and forth. There's like a back, I might do lats, and then traps, and then lats, like, altering between pull-outs and rows. Similarly, just. Same thing, chest out. You know what's crazy is that? You know, when I do videos and I talk about the movements, sometimes it's hard for me to explain because I think we talked about this, you just do it, right? So it's sometimes it, you don't think about it because this is the way you learned. Yeah, like, some, uh, so when you try to explain to your viewers, sometimes it's a little difficult because, like, you know, there's certain body positions, every, like, I just didn't like this. I've done it like this like this. I want to see how you're going to do this one. So as I said, this is kind of like the same as the style, irresistently. Because usually, I just stand right in the middle, but I think I've been cutting my stretched position short because if I'm right here holding the weight, it doesn't give me your is my right. I can hold this forever because all the forces just go through my bones. Yeah. If I take a few steps forward, it's pulling my chest back. You'd you notice when I step forward? Yeah. So maybe the irres still that from you when you guys worked out. I don't think we, I don't know if we did chest. Yeah, I don't remember. Yeah. So we didn't let you kind of know that. Maybe we did, we did shoulders, I think actually. Good stretch, good. Yep. So your whole focus is shoulders, you know, keep the shoulders out of it. So keep that chest high and forward and that's what you're doing, bro. You're hitting it just right. Yeah. I probably end up just doing one more of these and then, do you want to open weight? No, I was just happy. I probably want to go on and have you in that. This next life's going to lighter. Oh, yeah, come on. Burn them out, last couple. Let's go. 70 right, you were 80 last time. Yeah, 70 meters. Do you, uh, you're looking yell back? Like you're not, you're really in a set. No, because I never trained with a partner. Yeah, that's, it was when I was working out there was he yelled it was hers is yelling. I'm so well, I'm wrong. And all the, it's like, dude, Sam, what the? Errs is yelling at you, dude, I said, you're not saying anything. It's like, I think subconsciously, I almost want the set to speak for itself. Well, you know what it is here yelling at yourself inside. Right, because this man, I watched a lot of your stuff and like you said, you're in this place by yourself, who's yelling at you? Who's motivating you? How hard you work when the room is empty because of a lot of empty rooms when you're training, right? I, I mean, I feel like so many guys in introduction is like a football weight room or wrestling room. And those video, like the energies insane, 30 dudes screaming at you. I feel like it's got to be hard to go from that to just you. Dude, I trained at home for years. I built the home jam and I trained when I won my pro card in 96. So I built the home gym with 2000 feet. I had all the best equipment and I literally trained at home. So when people say, I, you unmotivated to train at your home or train where there's no atmosphere. I, I wouldn't even, you, if you asked me what the music was, I have no idea. I never heard the music ever in the gym because people like, man, the music sucks in here. I'm like, what music? I didn't hear it. All I was, I just had tunnel vision. When you listen to my videos, I was so locked in. All I thought about was what I went through my head a hundred times. I knew exactly when I went in the gym and what I was going to do. That's it. I, uh, I'll usually have the headphones going. But it's, I get, I see some guys talk about like the music's a crutch. I feel like, well, what if I don't have my music? It's cool to go to the, like, when you're on the way to the jam and you got the music blared up, which you're not doing, because you're talking on the way to the gym right by it. So, for the, I like it on a sec. Mid set, I need to go on turn my like it, put the headset on and you go, right? I mean, but in between you just breathe. That's it now. Yeah. All right, that's a good burn. Yeah, I like, uh, I like that. So, you can, you same weight. But just by changing it from a fly to a little press, you can do a few acts. Let me ask you this, though. So, you went from, you started at 80. So, is this a common weight at your gym that you usually use? Yeah. So, there's this, this is a few different from the one you normally use. What else? Well, let me think about it. Do you think, is this one heavier? Yeah. It's, I feel like depending on what gym you're trying at summer heavier than others, right? It's got to be close. 80, it's close. Gems is not the same 80 at other gyms, right? I always said it goes in Venice has a lighter weight. Yeah, yeah, it is the two here. Now what do you think? I'd probably go back to some sort of press. Yeah. How, where's the, what kind of not let's one? In Iraq. Should go back to. Color, make the gym know. Yeah, it's a little different. With your place. Yeah. Because I'm like, what do you think? And the weight in black is so sormtrooper. Yeah. But, you know, not a list or that selectorized piece. This is good. So, if you want, this is pretty decent on math. That's like, no, probably would be pretty good after. Let me, this one's pretty decent because you have some different, here's some different handles here, you know? Yeah. Let me do a feel here, see. It's like, because sometimes they get a lot of front delts, even if I'm like, really, see how it feels. This handles pretty good too for that. Very different. Oh, yeah, that's something. So you're going to get a lot of the upper chest on this. Yes, come in. Is this a further enough back for you? It's one quick turn about. That's this week's about it. Okay, let's, I'll start the so let's put a plate on. I, I have two good for this. You think so? Yeah. I think you, you'll do more, but. Close that higher grips a little heavier. Oh, much leverage. Is about constant tension. You see how this feels, it might still be a little light for you. Let's see. Oh, I'll feel this for over 10. Nice and secluded back here. Yeah. Okay, yeah, you're right. Right, right? Yeah. Okay. Now, this is for within the realm of normalcy. Now, fast forward a few months. When instead of a hundred, 50 grams of carbs a day, I mean, like 800, is that an average usually 800 carbs? Well, that'd be like, get deep into a book. You have a hear about my thousand carb pre-contest diet days? That's, that's specifically. Yeah. How long is that for you? I dieted. I dieted. Dude, I first Arnold victory 10 weeks, thousand carbs a day. Then your whole job becomes eating. Yeah. No cardio, double session training. Back in my era, it was training twice a day. I was on a two-day kick because I had just read something or watch something where it was like, okay, your muscle, your window of muscle protein synthesis is 48 hours. So, I heard that a stuck with it. I said, okay, if it's 48 hours, I should hit a muscle, rest a day, hit it again. It's now it's been 48 hours. Okay. So, I had a limb day and a torso day. So, limb day, I do legs in the morning, arms and night. Torso Dad, you're back in the morning, just a night. Okay. I did it for like three months. I think I don't even, like, I was bulky in quotes. Like I was just eating. Yeah. When I'm hungry. So, like, it sounded like a shrunk, but it does burn a lot more calories. Definitely, definitely more active. Yeah. So, I did, like, if I did legs together, I'd do hamstrings in the morning, five hours later, do quads. I think. And then I would do, like, I did, I split arm training then. So, I did like chest in the morning and biceps at night. And then I would do shoulders and triceps. So, I would do the split that way. I get curious about splitting up legs because if I, if I'm bulking up and I get a quite only day, yeah, like so much energy. But then it's where do I put hamstrings? Well, a lot of people put hamstrings with triceps or the arm. Yeah, but a lot of people do it that way, which, to me, is awkward, but it works for a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah, I might be good. But you first of me first. Yeah. Let's hit it. All right, let's go now. Better right. Yeah. Good. Screage. Good. Do some part, so let's grow. Come on. Then you know, okay. That was good. I want to see. A 25 might have been okay. Was it heavier than what you thought? I want to try this. That might have been little lighter than what I thought actually. But we got a few extra minutes of rest talking about legs. Or, well, an extra minute. I might just do a drop set for the next one. Ah. You know what the crazy thing is, though, is that my age still no pain. No shoulder pain, no elbow pain, no knee pain. I'm trying to get better at that. My rate of injury has decreased drastically because of why I think it's because of all the feedback up here and everybody say, you're going to wait to fucking heavy. And it's like, sometimes I'm just doing it like I said 12 with three plates. And like that's pretty reasonable weight. And I'll still get it. But just from here, everybody like, it creeps in your mind enough where you hear it and you're like, okay, might be on a something here. Back off a little warm up a little more. Like with just, I can't really, I can pinpoint the last time I had a crunchy shoulder because of all that cable stuff. Like, how did your chest feel right now? Oh, can pump. Yeah. So with this weight, what do you want to go with? Oh, I'm going to have the same. No, that's one more plate, but it'll be a drop set. So you want to do a full plate? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, full plate. And then we'll drop it after I fail with this. So after seven probably, that's the guess that's eating beat it. Take your time now. Paste yourself. I had to say that because, you know, okay, let's go. Come on. Come on. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Thank you. I'd easy work now. No. Yeah. It's impressive. That's a good good. Subjectively. I feel like just one set of flies would be enough to finish my break. Okay, I was always, I always talk about, um, they get, I trained a failure. I was a crazy volume trainer. 20 sets per body part, including biceps triceps. But I never trained to failure. If I told you in my career, I very rarely ever went to failure. If ever, you won't find many videos of me online training to failure. Yeah. I, uh, I don't know who I remember seeing this clip of, um, I think it's just Korean guy or something. It's in legs, trunks, like absolutely, you know, 10 reps sets, totally had like five left. So I do think about that. It's like, everyone is different with what I think you have to choose one. So if you're going to do crazy volume, you can't train to absolutely like this. But if you're going to train to failure, you can't do the crazy volume, right? So yeah, it's like, it's like an area under the curve. If you do 10 sets, you do six sets, they have to be extra intense. So you're reaching this average threshold. But if you back off a little and you do more that workload, but you train a lot like hers when I train with hers, a lot of the, a lot of the sets were to failure like that. And I never prefer doing necessarily drop sets as much, although I did, don't get me wrong. But remember, I didn't have a training partner a lot of the time. So I don't know how you're handling your drop sets now if you're training by yourself and the gym. You still do, you get off the and change yourself. Well, I do use of your drops. That's with the with cable stacks. Okay. It's just a quick little easier, right? Yeah. But I think that pectical, right? You want to try this one? Yeah. I like these. So what's nice about this piece is this is the platform goes up and down. So, you know, no matter what your height is, the platforms there. So I usually prefer this because it's different piece. I didn't really, I didn't have this in my heyday. Yeah. So you notice, I'll still kind of keep my head up, right? And squeeze that chest. I'm not so concerned about a little bit of shoulder hunching on something this decline is your front delts just don't get much activation at all. Like they're working to raise your arms upward. So sometimes when I do these decline flies, I end up cramming it a little more than maybe I would like to. Oh, a little after you. Yeah, always says that. He said that a whole time on me. I'm going to go a little heavier. I never overestimate. Oh, shit. Jared Feather right there. Are you signing the wall? I don't know. It looks like these are all I have to be be pros. Maybe we'll see this for later. Of the mystically. Yeah. What about these? It's. Water now. Yeah, I think there'll be a work in sa Good now. You're that now outer lower right? Good. Yeah, I think that's bad enough. I think seven sets has been my number the last few months. One, we're back in 2002. I didn't count. We're good set as well as no matter what I'm doing. I'm repin' numbers. You think posing room or whatever you want. Here you can do anywhere. Let's see how it works. You should ask him, you know. I love to hear what I've learned about Sam today more than anything is that it's very instinctive. He's just taken it by whatever roles. Every day is going to be different. You may think that you're going to have to feel a certain way or feel a movement. Some of those days, I can't tell you how many times I drove through the gym. Got to gym training for Olympia. This isn't the day. Can I turn around left? Yeah. Do you ever have those days? It's rare. I think I'm setting myself up for success in a way. I think even the days where I feel like shit, I reroute it and I'm like, okay, it's good that it's hard. It's good. It's sleep less. Totally stupid. Totally should have just, but there's a certain value in having the ability to do that. I think you can look at two guys where they say, okay, I'm a little under-recovered. I should probably take a rest day today and they stay home. That's one. Like he's saying objectively, it's better if I stay home recover and come back tomorrow and train harder. But the same situation could be. I don't feel like it. Let's do a rest day. Like that guy wouldn't even want to go. So it's like, I almost think it's better when guys take it too far and then they back off. Do you have a day off? I'm probably going to have to add some. I'm feeling, I train seven days right now. But not when I was trained to focus, I found like three on one off, two on one off schedule. I actually followed that routine, which is odd, but five total days in the week, but three straight, train two more days and take a day off. I think I'm starting to feel the need to reduce my quad volume or reduce the quad intensity. And it's like, when I'm bulking up, my legs end up being the biggest, or I can see they're like making faster developments. It's slow no matter what, but I can still notice it with heavier pressing stuff. I'm doing a lot more leg press, but if I do three good sets of leg press, two sets of smiths, squatter something like my leg just still sore that next leg. Yeah. I might have to back off quad-wise and same thing diving down. Like if I do two, like even just two weeks ago, I did like three leg days in a row, like in the routine where heavy leg press, heavy leg press, that fourth came around, like, can do that. I shouldn't even do quad-zone. I can still feel them like I'm accruing too much fatigue. So I mean, you take food out of the equation. Not eating so many carbs, everything. Yeah. Might have to back off a little. But not into a rest day. I don't like the idea of taking it unless you know you need it. It's like the guy saying, well, 20 minutes of cardio is actually better than an hour. But he would never do that hour. The guy who tried it and said, okay, this is too much. He's got a different value system. I'll see a lot of power list of guys almost making fun of younger dudes. Like new to the gym and they're saying, I don't squawk as it's not optimal. The fatigue to stimulus ratio, it's not there. But the kids never squawked. Yeah. It's different for the guy who squatted 600 to say that. Because he has a deeper understanding of it. Like there's a difference between like lifting knowledge and like lifting wisdom almost. So I think I've been on the return from going too much too heavy, too frequently. It's easing back to I think more options. As well remember, if you're going into some sort of a deeper prep with low carbs, you're going to uncharted territory that you've never been in before. Exactly right. It's like it wouldn't make any sense to do everything exactly the same if my food has rapidly halved from what it used to be. Well, it's a, you know, it's fine. Some lighting or pumps are deflating. It's okay. It's okay. It's just complete. And the plan is, this would be about 10 weeks out or so. So you tell me what's jumping out at you. Oh, start holding those. It's why you know what we'd practice? Yeah. 10. Contitan. The post-lifter. And you know, and then every pose, right? And yeah, so I'm going to move. I feel like I'm in. That's going to condition you. The way I've been doing is I always have an extra squeeze. Yep. Because I'm aiming for your conditions. Your conditions decent decent decent. Okay. Good. I mean, you're not in any kind of, oh, my gosh, like in 10 weeks out, but yeah, you need to definitely, you know, start turning it up a little bit, you know. If the show is in 10, if it's a 10 week, you know what I mean? You're the a lean. Just getting some sort of a sequence. I mean, the body looks good. I mean, backs, the backs are your best body, aren't right? Yeah, do that little so you can see the, yeah. Yeah, that's great. Good. So you're going to check the biceps good to you, to the bicelli. There you go. See that's what you're going to have to see. So when you do this, you're going to have to learn to breathe into it. Really, because of some round after round, they're going to, they're going to torture you depending on how close it is. You know, obviously, you don't want to make it. That's why conditioning factor. You have enough mass. It's what's shown off. But you know, it's about conditioning. Like you can, you have the ability, like you have the fibers, like the shoulders and the side. You see all the striations. You know, this, make sure this is, you know what I mean? Just get that crazy, really, like, remember, your abs and all the poses, especially, they have to be, yes, like see all this when you hit it. But you shouldn't have to work. Breathe. Breathe. Yeah, you're right. Right. So this is where you have to start conditioning, opposing now, because posing every day is going to give you that conditioning. So I know you're going to, but you've got to start holding these poses longer than what they can't just showing off for the camera and the fans, right? So it's just, you got to have this is where you can come in. You know, your, your, your pose, like you have what is it front, last thread for the rest of your body, right? Side, chest and back double, right? Yeah. So though you, I mean, you don't have as many as a, as a real body building, but remember, it, the legs going to be in there, all that. That means to be everything. combination of tightness. Yes. And that midsection due to this classic, that tight midsection, right? That's one thing. If you ever look at a lot of my stuff due to my midsection, I always had crazy midsection, I always flat because I practice holding it in, right? And just really, you almost have this, we talk about all the time, you're sucked to your spine. Because when you sucked to your spine right there, you just look at that dude. It's going to bring in all those intercostals, everything. And it's going to make your upper torso look bigger, right? Hosing is going to be your biggest key to your success. And that means practice because it looks like we love the training, the posing some other fucker. Yeah. The posing practice is definitely subpar compared to that. So instead of going through, you've got to just, like, so I would go through the quarter turns three times each time, 10, I would do that three times, three times. So that's seven poses, right? We have seven or eight. Like, I mean, we have abs and thighs. We have, you know, side tries up which you guys don't have, which I hope they open up. Keep you guys more opportunity to do that, you know? They don't have side tries up. Do they have side? No, right? They do it. You guys are all going to do it in your posing routine. I think you should do all the poses because you have the physique to do what I mean, do this, everything, right? What they have abs and thighs? For a while, I thought it was like kind of, what's your signature? What is your signature on your clothing? Oh, that's, I think it's something along these lines. Yeah, I know. The clothing's just the last one. Oh, okay. But a lot of the, a lot of the username, like profile. Yeah, that's why I thought there's some, okay. When you're sitting on the arm, twisting back because he's got such a low-lapse. Yeah, yeah, I do that. I'm sorry, I'm not. I mean, you could do a lot, bro. Just open this stuff up, you know? I mean, just, yeah, once you're conditioned to, I mean, because you're going to, they're going to ask you your favorite posing, favorite, um, favorite, um, favorite class. Yeah, right, yeah. And that's, uh, I feel like that's almost half, maybe think about who's next to you. It's like, if the guy's next to you. Well, I mean, like, what's bomb said's the very right one. He does that. He always says that because it's like he's so wide, you know? And I feel like you have, you ever, the width. I thought he did something like this. Yeah, yeah, he does this in like, uh, like the suction. Right. Yeah, he said to it. Let's see, yeah, what else? Yeah, I mean, dude, you're just, when you get home, bro, it's time to rock and roll. You're not traveling much now, right? I would, it's pretty much nothing. But you're not doing any cardio now. Cardi a session. Hey, you're not doing any cardio now. I'm like, cardio every morning 30 minutes. Okay. Yeah. That's okay. I thought you were doing nothing. I was not ready for that. That's pretty good for just training and whatever. Yeah. Now, there's cardio. Your back is lean. Like, yeah, I was, I was surprised myself. I went after the last back day when I saw my reflection. Yeah, with all the, what do you call that? Your erector is your real strength. Yeah. See, yeah, that's what's going to be. Yeah, it's up for me. But you know what it is now? It's just getting in the rhythm. So it's like more consistency to your program. Yeah. And you can, you know, dial right into your, all this is ready. Just, you guys, all you gotta tighten up is just the midsection. And obviously the backs there, you know, but it's crazy. Because your midsection's, your lower, his lower backs leaner than his midsection is. Yeah. Yeah. Dickens. You know, like, you know, we don't get this shit till the very end. Like, it's always, I held it here, you know? Yeah. And I was always leaning in my midsection, but your, your shit right now is, got it back where you can, you can see it. You can see it. You can see it. Look at it, bro. Yeah, I mean, look at that. It's better than something I saw. Yeah. If you just pull one. Right. Is that what he was seeing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be that. Yeah. Sounds like I know tips from a, I mean, look at, look at the, like, let's get the crazy backs. Yeah. It's a, oh, the starting point. Yeah. I know, but he's not, he's been going, but I'm saying is like, hey, get on, like, this is your, this is your now you go home and it's like, right, more sequence, you know, because this is a countdown, bro. It's that you get to six weeks down, like you're in the zone. That's, there's no world at that point, you know, you're practicing, practicing, practicing, practicing at that point. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Those poses, posing, posing, posing, you know, you're in charge of the posing. Take them through the rounds. Like I said, three rounds. Three rounds of, uh, three rounds of, uh, three rounds of. Back and it's hold. And then, in that way, you can, when you, when you see this, and you can do, like, the positioning, okay, does it look better here? Does it look better with a little, you know, because as a condition comes and more is going to show you're going to be able to show the serratus and all that, right? The packs that's going to be more striations here. Obviously, you've got the crazy striations in the shoulders. So sometimes, you know, you might want to show that off, like, you know, in different poses like the Arnold poses good to, you can look good on all those poses. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look at how full your chest is. I mean, see the midsection, see when you, all this gets tightened up, roll, like, see all this. That's, that's going to be, well, you got, uh, you're training abs. Yeah, sometimes. I'm going to, I'll add it in. I just did it after cardio, like two days ago, like eight sets. Yeah. Do you have a crunch? Yeah. So I'll add it that more. Yeah. I got to have you text me some kind of, uh, little routine list. Oh, they're every new girl. Whatever you need, man. Yeah. Well, do your time training it with the best. You're not. You're not. You have a whole, uh, you're going to motivate a lot of people. So I'm happy to know that there's going to be a stage at the end of this, you know, so No, Chris. It's always been the plan. But like, why? Yeah, but no, no one, do you know, it was a big question. Well, I wouldn't do, right? I mean, if you did you know, but for today, even after this, it's talked about it. But never, like, yes, I do. Even after this, it'll still be well. Okay. You know, who, you know, every promoter in the US is going to be looking for him to come to the show. I'm pleased to know. Yeah. We're a little longer. Yeah. He's not going to wait that long. He's got things to do. I know, I know where his mind is going. It's, I'm not saying. Yeah. Well, just said to see what happens is that anybody can talk to talk. Yeah. Show off. See what kind of result he can actually make happen. Yeah, this is a, I hopefully people comment on their thoughts on that. It was a highlight of our front of month. It's a good question. Keep crushing. Okay. You look great. Oh, appreciate it. Bring a home man. Just wait for it. We'll see some more updates. This time passes. We might first time blow up to 20 years. And all that was like when you when I've, do that, I died it out. I've been that light since I was 16. It's old, you know. Well, sweet. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to go back to go back to making sure we don't over eat and get a cardiovascular going. Get a cardiovascular today. I did this morning. I do faster in the morning. Yeah. I do it more from my mind than I do for my body. But you know, I get a, so I get a little gym at the apartment. Mm. Sometimes I don't even like, I'd rather go to the real one. But then I'm like, okay, I'm wasting 40 minutes drive in here. Sometimes it's a mental thing. You know, it's I always talk about the meditation that we get from training and cardio. And sometimes those rides. We talk it on the way to the cardio. Okay. So you didn't learn in meditation now. Well, sometimes it'll, it'll depend. Like if I wasn't going to record that workout, yeah. I might just record the cardio. They hate it though. They, a full video only talk about cardio. But you got to hear it. You know, that's, that's never going to end. Good man. Yeah. Well, it's going to be tough. Yeah.

Alright, so I was under the impression the sweating is might add to the contrast, but honestly, it makes it a little more subtle. Depending on what you're going for, either a plus or minus, but little updates on the back end of everything else that's been going on. We get the merch fucking moving. Let's all cut through a couple of sort of b-roll shots. Or we ended up making it. Kind of a short sleeve looking gray kind of stone washed. They've all got a similar little kind of stylized, like last spread sort of logo. And then over the back, everything's got some kind of something in like a pressed silicone. But I'm kind of jumping the gun, man. You know, this isn't just like a fucking overnight thing. I guess it's kind of a lot of extra planning. I wasn't really expecting. You know, you think it's just like, alright, let's go to, let's go to a printifying, make some kind of random. Like, no, there's a lot more back end stuff at work. But assuming all's gone well, this shit is life. And we got the same, sooo like, dot com and everything. Yesterday, in the in Mark, we all, we went to, we went to American Barbell. We were sitting there for like four hours getting all the product shots of us doing like some sets. And a lot of this. So a lot of like, I could, you know, just standard kind of standard kind of shit. But let's see if you can, so cutting over the shoulders. Because obviously, I'm diving down right now. Literally, 100% of what I fucking stand for right now. So if you're not, you know, if you're not trying to trim down, guess what? You're not at a freaking luck because couple of the widths, some of the cutting shirts, get a kind of a grayish. I don't know, okay, far away with this sort of lighting. But a grayish, more of a light red. Maybe. If you're on the bulk, you're not freaking worry. You have got you covered, right? And not only do I think the silicone is just kind of extra cool. But you do have the added benefit of, it's a little bit of extra grip on some kind of the, any kind of press that you're doing. But don't, don't worry, I'm not going to turn every video into like a freaking Sam kind of merch add. But what's really cool about the way, because like, this is cool. Like honestly, when me and Mark actually got all these final versions in and everything, like we're fucking extra hyped. Because I mean, we've been working on this for months, not like not just the design stuff, but it takes a while to get these sort of things moving. So seeing an actually in person, ready to go, I was getting this real excited. But the cool part is, now I can do whatever, you know? Because it's, you know, it's not like we've partnered with some kind of random whatever. Like, this is just all us. Like we got a little design team who's helping me sort of, like if I want bits on this to look like this and like I love the way that this shirts specifically feels like not, I mean, not feels to wear, but like the bagginess and the sleeves and everything else. So it's gotten to the point now where like I can kind of think of something, get down and description, and then we can just jump straight to making, you know? And that's extra cool for me because, I mean, it's not like any other, because I've been totally quiet about it. Like all the comments where you guys talk about, like Sam, when are you going to release this or when are you going to partner with these guys to do? I have one to talk about it, you know? Because it's like a knock on a wood situation. You know, I want to kind of get it moving first. But there I'll be more to come here for sure. And I want to hear your feedback, you know? Because I've said this about the videos before. I'm not just making them for fun. I make these because you guys like them. Like if I, if in the beginning when I was posting these, I don't think I would have kept doing it for this long unless I got the, you know, unless I built this kind of like perception which is absolutely fucking same. Like today is Thanksgiving. The video is, you know, it's the next day, but I, like when I look back, it's just absolutely insane how crazy these last two and a half years have been. Because it's like, you know, it's a, I'll talk to some guys that haven't seen before and it's like, get whole world for Sam totally flips freaking upside down. But, oh yeah. So just a black kind of grayish hoodie or not, grayish shorts leave shirt. Little on the baggie rent, most of this stuff is just true to size. Like this is a 3 XL. And like it's, it's like a little bit draped but nothing too crazy. Yeah. Black shirts just got pumped over the back. We were trying to, we were trying to figure out some way to do like a, like a sweat activated thing where it's like, once you were drenched, all those letters would be revealed, but it's nothing came to that. Maybe that's for like a version too, but yeah, for, for this little silicone looking starter line, there will be more to come on. Extra excited about it. So I'll splice a, yeah, I should have already spliced them up some of the website stuff, but the last part is just a, was the plain ass sullacudi. And they've all got a little, they've all got a little Sam on here. Oh, I didn't even talk about it. They, we had a little extra holographic reminder onto the tag of all these things. You can't see it now, but in a close up, yeah, what does that say? So I get to go home. We can cut to cuts of the drive to back and I'll slap one of these things on and put it through its paces and get it just as drenched if not more drenched than this. So, we'll, we'll update for ya. Well, I'll see you in the car. Yes, that's, that's an, that's an important work going on for the last couple of weeks, but it's cool. I'm glad that's finally actually moving. Now the tricky part is over. I guess just have fucking fun, but, you know, so if we, we maybe come up with a little back and forth in the comments about what to get going next, nothing too crazy, nothing too wild, but if we're gonna branch out, one, I'll be the same, they won't be the same, just, you know, rubber letters kind of stuff. There's a lot of room to play around, but, play over tonight with back, pull down, rose, pull over, same as normal. I mean, you're really not the craziest thing in the world, but this gym does have one machine, which I'm a little extra excited for. And that's the sort of like hammer strength. I'd say, I think they call it a low, they might call it like a high row, but what I like about it is I can sit here and really get a deep, lat stretch in the front. And as I do the movement, the handles like sort of range of motion path leads, not just like straight towards you, but almost in front of you downward. So it's like pulled out at the top and then it pulls into more of a row. So it basically ends up suddenly squeezed the, squeezed the F, squeezed the frick out of my, out of my entire back from lats to even upper traps if I really kind of try to pull my elbows together and keep my shoulders up a little bit. Usually I try to make it a bit more lat-focused, but that's kind of the cable finisher that I've been doing for a little while, you know, where I go, put like a bench on an incline cable to extra lengthy handles. I kind of do that same sort of thing where it's like a lat-focused stretch and then leaning back in and more of a complete back-activating squeeze. Now, usually I like that cable version as the finisher, but for whatever reason this machine version, I usually like to start with it. So I apart from the fact that, you know, I know I'm going to be pulled out of the rows and pull over his stuff. I think I want to try to change it up and not only do the fact that lifting in different ways is going to give you different kind of stimulus and, you know, it's just going to be better all around, but it's just better for you as a fucking lifter. You know, okay, so you'll get more experience, just more experience period. You know, with different movements and how this feels after this, like benching on a Smith machine feels completely different if you've just done three sets of like cable work flies or cable presses beforehand and now you're pretty exhausted. So it's almost like you can't even just look at a workout as simply an exercise by exercise basis. Like a lift that's comprised of pull-downs, rows and pull-overs can feel extremely different depending on the order that you do them as well as like if you do heavy sets of this, more lighter squeezing sets of this, maybe some stretch focus like partial rep. Like there's a lot of different variables to it. And what I think is extra cool is it's easy to play around, you know, it's not because as long as your intensity is there, it's really hard to go wrong. Like you'd have to actively be doing something a little bit weird and off to really set yourself down the wrong path of any sort of specific muscle part, muscle, muscle group lift. So with back, I mean, you can throw a dude on just a seated row and pull down and if he wouldn't not switch attachments every so often, his back is going to be sweet. And then if you gave a guy like the fancies gym in the world with every different pull-down machine angle and strength curve and you had him go extra hard, he might get a bit more variability out of that training. But not so much that like, you know, in a year, the beginner might even really see it difference, you know, and I just mean to say that as a beginner lifter and I don't want to see that like a negative connotation sort of way. But for somebody who's very prone to new games, I think it's a better way to say it, then, the actual like exercise choices per se, it's not a, it shouldn't take the foreground of what you should be focusing on. Going hard, really pushing past the in the comfortability of like exerting yourself, that should be goal number one, baining wise, tandem with, you know, maintain reasonable form if you're, if you're benching, you know, ease into it, don't just drop 185 on your face, like little things like that. But that sort of, that should go with that same, you know, but, you know, so that's a plan for time. I want to try to change it up, but keep the intensity, the energy and everything else in between the same as normal. So, you know, I say that now, if I do end up doing a back day, which I've kind of done before, if I feel like it's just the best move for tonight, what could you do? I mean, that's just what's going to happen. But I am going to try to change it up, so all, probably specifically look for things and exercise orders or like maybe, maybe some super sets that I haven't done at least super recently. But, like that's, that's all there is to say, the preface it, let's just get started. All right, I don't typically start with this machine, and now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever started with this machine, or even, I don't think I've even fucking used it before. It's kind of a multi-grip sort of row, but with the orientation that I'm going to do today, I'm thinking, underhand at that lowest setting, and this is lighter than I could potentially like move around, but heavy enough that I want to go or I can still get a really good squeeze. So, I want to make this a bit more of a controlled set, no throwing it around, full second hole, like, yeah, yeah, and then burn out that fascia. And the very next set, I might do a little heavier and be a little more British, but I think this would be good start, and let's start that I don't normally do, so I think I changed it up goal as well. That's where this next one. A little heavier and a little quicker, and then just go from there. Oh, yeah, let's do one more. Goal-de-lux style right between those two weights, and then move on. Yeah, this is definitely a starting haven't started with at least for a while. Oh, okay. I think mid to upper back has just been wrecked, I was gonna smack some lats with a basic approach. I guess one does. Classic pull down will do well. Now, this first set, I'm gonna make a little heftier throw this shit around. Like, I'm still gonna squeeze at the bottom of course, but this would just be a heavier set. And then next one, I'm gonna draw the weight by half and do a real squeezing focus kind of thing. But I do think that an even balance of some heavier quicker reps and some slower squeezing once, usually slower and lighter, but not always. I think it's a good way to go bad. Oh, yeah, okay. Holy crap. Yeah, that was good. Like, I was a petite insect, but that actually might have been a little too heavy. Let's drop it to, well, from 26 to 180, make this next one more slow squeezing focus. Then go from there. Already, probably about halfway, guys. Doesn't take too much. Plus, I'm extra carb duck from Thanksgiving today, so I think that helps the energy levels. Ooh. One more like that. And then let's move on to that half pull down, half room machine behind me. There's Mark. He's got some legs tonight, so not a tandem lift, but he's getting left for it. Faster, faster whip debats after 11 souhan of stuff. No. No. No. No. No. Yeah. Holy crap. Let's see that pull over thing. A rope pull down thing. And obviously, if it's a good set, I think that's it. That can see on that. Wow. No point even saying it. And we won't see him probably just a set or two. Two plates felt like a little, well, like a little little. Four would be too much. I think three might be the sweet spot. And there's potential for this become a drop set, but I got to finish the first portion first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. No. No. No. No. Oh. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh yeah. Yeah, I lied. No need to start bringing drops out there. Just that straightener's good. That's it. Let's go fucking pose them, man. That was a quick one. But still, about as much volume as I was aiming for. Three rows, three pole downs. Seven sets. If they're good, I think you may not need too many more. But let's go find some lighting. And now we're back to the fucking beginning, except much later into the day. So if one little note, if this audio is like totally scuffed, the music in here is like crazy loud. So I probably had to do some kind of like fucking noise, reducer, sort of whatever. But let's see how we're looking, pumps. It's the root of the damn pump cover. Oh yeah. I would say living up to the silicon dead damper. But let's actually get some real data. Sorry. So this is with an extra 800 calories worth of a re-thed. I did end up eating a bit more than I intended to during the Thanksgiving dinner. But that's all right. I'm not saying for all the time, but for this sort of instance specifically for me, it just kind of casts as a little bit of a re-feed, which I just about two months in nearly. I was probably due for it. So one day is not going to kill you. Obviously. It's when you start like, oh, re-feed Monday. Re-feed Tuesday. Re-feed Friday. It's, you know, there's a limit to where you're actually using it for an intended purpose. Versus, you're just not even, you're not even sticking to your deficit anymore. So it should be a touch extra carved up. So this post then might be a little freaky of the normal. No. All right. Then same shift in the back. Ooh. Now that is a Christmas tree if I've ever fucking seen when I ran. And we're on tracks at some cool shit now. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. All right. Well, back more than fucking complete. Holy shit. Let's do one more then. Then we get ready to get ready to get ready to get ready. Okay. There we go. Now we can find that screen. What do you think? Pumps? Yeah. This is. So look at this. Like lower back. Look at all those extra fucking lions. All right. Jesus. And I'm like, like, I'm soft. Not relatively to like everybody else, but like, there's a lot of pinchable fluff in here. So next month, month after. This is a good fucking nuts. The house lights. Very good. Crazy. For us. Post. Thanks give it a meal. After the first set of super heavy leg. Like, like, press. I was like, oh, so we finished dinner. We basically came right over here. Honestly, that first set of rows of those two, pretty uncomfortable. I had like, at a bunch of extra fucking turkey. I will say this though. That was probably our best Thanksgiving turkey ever cooked. I'm talking dry, salt brine, butterflide in the oven. Popfully new to do it. But let's get in your dough. Let's take this. Let's just roll it up again. All right, won't. There's. Let's get out of here. Yeah, that was quite the freaking back day indeed. A little quicker, a little higher paste. And I could definitely tell him, I kind of exer. I want to say an exercise. But energy level, like set by shit. Now, y'all, it's not reflective. You know, like, that work at us feeling pretty, pretty well. Intergest. And really, just because I was well fed. You know, so back onto my 20 something hundred calorie limit tomorrow. And then I am good. So I want to be surprised if the next couple days will be at a new low of a 230-30-8 or so, 230-8 morning weight. Empty stomach empty everything. And then just keep going from there. Back, especially I'm excited for it to see Git leaner because chest, extra veins, extra fibers. Obviously fucking cool. Right. Same thing with triceps and legs, hamstring separation, abs, shoulder striations. Okay, I'm getting excited about all that. But back specifically has some key features, which are extra cool. Right. That kind of Christmas tree of your directors tying into your lat insertions, which you can like physically see the fibers of in that little triangular sort of shape kind of thing. And then just veins across the board. You know, top to bottom side, side to side everywhere else. So I was, yeah. All right. I walked to the cover to get some shit last night. And I could see way more of quad veins than normal. Just walking around like nothing. So, yeah, we are definitely getting somewhere. If you're curious about when this dieting phase is going to end, yeah. Not soon. You know, I'm leaner. But I'm not lean enough. In the sense that I'm not as lean as I want to get during this dieting phase. No absolute freaking chance. But playing with tonight meal wise, I might have some leftover turkey. It's approaching, every list, that's it. I think I already had like maybe upwards of 250, 300 grams of carbs, 100 something of fats. And then I met 230 approaching. I did an, you know, slam an ton of the, a ton of turkey. So, yeah, not really too much food left to eat, which I don't want to go to bed right after work and I'm not eating anything. You know, I do want to eat some kind of something or other. But, yeah, just nothing too crazy. So, that's where I think it's just a little bit left to over turkey. We get for me. Take on my vitamins. Make sure I drink it. So make sure water and then pass out. I'm sure I'm going to sleep like a baby. I'm not even sure how long I might have. It might do me good not even setting a alarm. Just to make sure I really get a full, just make sure I get the full sort of recovery effective, having had a refie day today. You know, because if I just say it a bunch of extra food, if I don't get a good nice rest, then, you know, sure I had some extra calories that day. But I probably didn't make as good of a use of it as I could have. If I match that with, you know, being properly hydrated and more than well-rested. Because it's, it all just plays into each other. It's kind of a synergistic style. It's like you get a, it's like you're trying to climb a ladder, build a tower on three legs, right? You die at your hydration and your sleep. You know, if you're drinking more than enough fucking water and you're eating more than enough food, but you're not getting enough sleep. The things just kind of fucking topple over. You know, and you can get all the sleep you want in the fucking world. But if you don't eat enough food and stay hydrated, then you're training it kind of stuff or two. So it's, um, it's to the point where all three of those things need to be in balance. And when they are, everything else improves. You know, when I'm eating in a reasonable, like a pretty consistent style timing, it makes my circadian rhythm a bit better. And all I'm even, that is just like I fall asleep at the same time. I wake up at the same time, even like right before my alarm is about to go off, because I'm like, that feels like normal to me. And then, you know, makes my meal timings easier. And it definitely makes the training easier when you get a good night's rest. I mean, trying to lift off of jack for sleep, not cool. It's just no fucking fun. And that's, that really is as simple as I can put it. And obviously it's less effective. If you're working out with that proper recovery, you're really just, what's, uh, your palinera coming back, which usually is a good thing. But in this context, you know, you're patting up, but you're not getting anywhere. So, as, uh, she was about to say, so as much as you could say, like, oh, it's just not optimal, like, subjectively, trying to have a good lift when your sleep is off and your hydration is off. And you didn't eat your meals, and it's just, it's just not as fun, you know. And that's, that's one thing that I really hold a lot of value in is, I want to set up everything outside of my training, so that when I do come to the gym, and I am ready to really push myself and exert, and everything else that I get to enjoy, because that's the fun part. If that wasn't fun, too, I probably wouldn't have been doing it for damn nearly six years straight or so. So, I like it enough to say, okay, I want to be a bit more controlled with the things and the way that I spend my time outside of the gym, so that when I am in the gym, I can spend that time extra well, and really re-ball the fucking benefits I can't from it. But it's not even just a question of, okay, this is optimal for my lift and for my muscular progress, I'm going to want you do this. Like, it really is, it just feels better. And if you feel better, you're going to go harder, if you go harder, you're going to get better results, if you get better results, you're going to feel pretty good about it, and you know, just keep spinning up from there. But that's implying that you've got a routine that's at least reasonably in tune enough, to put yourself into a state of progress. Unfortunately, there's a lot of lifters out there where you've been working after two or three years. Your main gaining rate has suddenly ceased, and then it's, you know, the same dude this year that you were last year, him and I knew, but like these guys, they do the same workouts of the same intensity with the same weights, and they expect different results. It's just not going to work. So that's why, you know, certainly not a hater of main gaining. And hit your protein goals, eat enough food that you're hungry for, and work out for probably like two years or so, even up into like three years, if you're working out hard, that's going to work, and you're going to keep growing. But eventually, you're going to reach a point where that's not enough, and you're going to have to leverage your calorie intake, change it up your cardio, really tuning in your training to make sure that you're actually stimulating growth and not just like getting a bit of a pump and then, you know, leap. So, as time progresses, you gotta be a bit smarter with it. And that's just the nature of everything, man. You know, it's sort of like the, you wouldn't say, in the verse, you'd say, exponential relationship of all sorts of shit. The faster you're going, the more resistance you're going to feel, and it's at an increasing rate. So, the more gains you get, the harder it is to make more. But on your side of things, the more gains you get, the smarter of a lift or that you are, the more experience you have, and ideally, if you're paying attention to some of these videos talking about like macros and calories and training intensity, I mean, just like videos from anybody, then you should have the knowledge based too to be able to say, okay, let's implement some changes. So, let's try some new shit. Let's do this for a couple of weeks. See what happens. And then, you know, it's simply an if-that, right? If the training that you're doing is, or if you decide to, you know, start up in your intensity, you're meant to, you're really tracking your progressive overload, you're making sure you're moving up your lift by five pounds a week, or certain rep numbers a week, then you notice some gains, keep going, right? But if you just keep doing the same shit, and then you get the exact same results that you had before, then, you know, look back, could you have made much more use out of the last six months or three months, or however long, if the answer is yes, and you've got that sort of itching the back of your mind, and really do want to walk into this. I want to get serious. Then the answer should be clear, you know, it's not for anybody else to tell you, you simply would probably feel better after, you know? But that's, you can't force it, right? You can't force somebody to go hard, and you kind of have to do it for themselves, which is kind of the, it's a cool part. But it also makes it a bit of a barrier to entry, because you have to now say, okay, nobody's going to make me do this. Nobody's forcing me to do this, I said to failure, I got to make myself do it, and it's hard. And this gym is empty, nobody's watching me, maybe I should just go easy, right? I will admit there is definitely some trickiness to it. But I don't have to explain the benefits of, I should, I don't have to explain the benefits of working out here. I think we get the just. So, playing for, playing for tomorrow, gets some kind of crazy ass arm day somewhere, not exactly sure where, but I can tell you this, much of veins will be involved. Vaines will be involved, not to what degree is to be seen, but they will most certainly be involved. So, I think it's all together. I'll see you tomorrow.

Alright, we are in good to go. So tonight's lift is gonna be legs, legs at none other than the planet fitness because it's past six o'clock and all the other gyms that I like nearby close early on the weekend, which is not a massive fan of you know, I don't like that. Really I fucking, well, I like it, you know, unhealthy way, but I like it's 24 hour gym. But then when it's 24 hour, like I don't have an incentive to go early, so I end up like lifting it really bad hours and like my sleep schedule gets thrown off as I run. So I don't know. Wish gyms just all, wish all gyms could stay open until they get in midnight, you know, when that be nice. But make do. So seven o'clock now closes at nine more than enough time to destroy quads and hamstrings. Wringstrings first, done a hamstring curls. Honestly, it's pretty much it. You know, probably laying, seated. One thing that I will do if every machine is taken or if I don't have access is I'll take a bench up to a cable, like a cable stack, put it on like a low setting and then use that little ankle attachment. Right, that girl's are using for like glue exercises or I've been seeing this a lot guys using it. Well, okay, anybody, anybody using it for like side laterals where you strap on to wrist. Damn it, fuck it. If it makes you feel your side down more than you're on fucking track. But yeah, you can take that strap around your ankle and then do seated curls right by pulling the cable towards yourself. For a while, when I was only lifting it the home gym, like he COVID hours, you know, you get you understand the drill. There's not really much you can do for hamstrings in a home gym unless you have a dedicated fucking, you know, hamstring curl, which then you hardly have a home gym. You just have a gym that happens to be at your home. So what I would end up doing is I would just strap some elastic bands to like the corner of the rack and your single leg leg curls like that, probably not the most ideal. But better, you know, you have to make the width which you have available. So whatever, see the hamstring curl, length hamstring curl, quads, fucking, really probably just going to fucking spam like extensions. I think I might drop my volume this cut. I think I'm going to decrease the volume. Well, I'm, oh, oops. I was getting, I was turning towards the Y, and I'm like, I'm going to fucking play the fitness. You know, but I'm thinking about dropping the volume from 11 sets to 8. Because you got to think my goal for the most part is, you know, to lift as intensely as possible. Enough such that I trigger some either muscle protein synthesis in a bulking context or maintain the muscle that I've built in a diet of context. I've referenced this before. Like imagine a bell curve of the effectiveness of different amounts of volume for your single workout for a single body part. So let's say chest, like if you do zero sets, you get zero gains. Obviously it's pretty simple. If you do one set hard after you know proper warm up of course, you'll probably get a little bit of something maybe. But I don't think a monster chest can be built with, you know, one set twice a week. I think if you need more damage than that. So two little more than one, three little more than two, I'm inclined to believe. And then I think around probably like nineish, maybe, you know, nine a little more or the less. Around there is probably the sweet spot in terms of, you know, the amount of volume you do per lift for body part. Good scene of somewhere in between, probably I would say just as a wide margin. Maybe six and 13 hard sets, a lot of weight, squeeze and burn and get in pumps. Around there I think that's where you're going to trigger as much growth or muscle maintenance as possible without doing any excess fatigue. So I think I'm going to pondered lower in the volume. I'll see how it feels. But one thing maybe I'll just try to play it by ear a little bit more. Because let's say I get fully pumped at around, I don't know, eight sets. Should I keep going? I don't know, maybe not. You know, I've heard a lot of, I've heard some talk of pretty legit like, dude's way bigger than me who kind of have adopted that training style. So I'm not going to go full on Mike Mensert to set the week, but maybe I think I'll just call it once I'm fully pumped. If that's earlier than 11, but man that'll be alright. The last thing I want to do is just, you know, do the same shit I've always done. I want to try new shit, try to get new results. Now in a diet and context, I said this in the last video too. The training isn't going to really change the results that much. Right, right now, since I'm just trying to lose body fat and maintain muscle, there's no workout that I can do in a calorie deficit, which is like going to make my fucking triceps blow up. Even if I did the perfect tricep workout for the next like three months or two-ish months while I'm cutting, it's not really going to change anything because the dieting phase is just a break from the muscular progress phase, which I, you know, sort of focus on during a bulk. But if you're in a muscle maintenance and you're just like hitting your protein, eating as much food as you're hungry for, and then lifting, I mean, I did that for the first like three years, then you're good, man. You're freaking good. But, well, that was kind of a trash burn out, but that was a dude and a charger. I wish he would have drifted that corner. That would have actually been kind of cool. But let's go to the planet fitness god damn, let's get started. So the plan was hamstrings and fucking quads, but I didn't do hamstrings for like a week and a half, and then hitting them super hard last like the I'm still feeling them. So, typically I would say it's probably in your best interest not to do a muscle if it's still sore. But then again, sometimes I just do it anyway, it's because so, it's a user-based judgment. But if you think like some days, so I have usually arms after back, so let's say for whatever reason on that back day, I happen to get a ton of bicep activation. Usually I try not to do that because I use straps, and I try to keep my arms completely out of the equation. But some machines and like some angles of rows, it will, yeah, I'm just taking a second to get going, I just slammed it while I'm the car. But yeah, some back movements I just end up like really working my biceps to the point that the next day when I'm going to hit them with arms, like they're still sore. So really, you know, no point to hit a muscle if it's in a compromise state. So for me, I mean, if you're thinking about like an on the top of the rest days before I actually start legs, if you rested, when you ate your food, you know, and let's say you did push pull legs, next day, like in the three days push pull legs, and then now it's hypothetically either a rest day or a pull day. I mean, am I hitting if your chest isn't sore and you try to sit on sore, I say hit it again. Now if you need another day's rest, and then you want to hit it the next day, that's fine too. Honestly, I think if I took like one rest day a week, I'd probably still be the same size of the end now, but I don't really think I'd be much bigger. So the rest days, in my opinion, are kind of just, you know, prescribed as necessary. So let's, let's get to what we're actually doing, just quad. So I'm going to start off with single leg extensions, I mean, moderate weight, but it's really I'm just trying to fucking, you know, burn the Love out loud, shake that up! I actually know if I could two more of those. Alright, so that's five such a single leg leg extensions done. I will admit my leg day intensity is definitely a little bit less for the most part on a cut versus on a bolt. Just because I'm really trying to maintain my muscle. Obviously I'm still going to hard, so good. It's still going to go hard. I guess what I really mean is the weights lighter. So legs for me ends up being a bit more squeezing reps rather than the fucking tons of weight. Because I mean I'm just looking at anybody else, and especially when I'm not even a buck ton of food, I can tell my knees get a bit more tender on a cut. So I'm a little bit more, I guess I say careful. But plan now, I'm already feeling pretty pumped just from the single legs. I think I'm going to do as many sets of double leg extensions, supersetted into six squats. I'll do as many of those as I can until I feel like I'm fully pumped, and now it can be done. I'll add the cardio tomorrow. This is kind of a lackluster lift for you to watch. I can definitely tell you guys probably chest and chest the most arms and back are tied for second, and then you don't like legs as much to be expected. Oh, fine. Alright, couple more of these. Oh, shit. So when we'll execution tip with these CC squats is I'm not imagining pushing that way. Like in my mind, I'm not sending signals to my glutes to my quads, like push down. Really, as I'm doing it, I'm just trying to tell my quads just straight now. So I don't feel like I'm pushing the floor, and I'm just feeling like I'm trying to kick it out from underneath me, that makes sense. I think one more than we can check the quad pump. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Alright, let's go check the quad pump. They're fucking, they're feeling pretty stiff. Alright, exposure slightly down. Let's see what kind of pump we're working with after, you know, only eight sets of leg extensions, including a little bit of a drop set, but, you know, nothing insane. Like it's not in terms of weight. I mean, those leg extensions were clearly doing some damage though. Quads are fucking, the quads are going to come in for free keys all hell, especially once I'm like really lean. You know, I'm pretty lean now, but there's way more detail to be revealed. Let's say, oh, but I mean, it's not looking bad now. Oh my god, nice. You can get some fucking veins coming out already. Let's see a little bit of a breath hole making pop out of your crazy. Oh, dude, actually holy shit. Oh, each, only crazy to come to. It's like day something with the cut, so this is bad ass. Which, nice. Well, nothing else to discuss. Let's move on to whatever end up making the rest of this video. I know it'll be a cart talk, but there may be some extras. I'm not sure, but let's get in the fucking car. Quads, get freaking pumped. As predicted though, that was not a surprise. So I will say this. It's not so hard to have a, well, for me, I would say, it's a lot harder for me to have a workout that I would say was like a bad lift when I'm, when I'm dieting. Just because, you know, the pumps aren't as, like, insane as when, you know, I'm totally full of carbs from fucking, you know, whatever source I can get my hands on. So, you know, even if I had like a sub-part pump, honestly, it's too an extent. I'm like, hey, fuck it. Sometimes the pumps there sometimes it's not. Still lifted the weights, still stimulated the muscle. And, I mean, once you start getting cut, you're going to bad pump looks pretty freaky. You still get the veins coming out and everything. Now, I'm not trying to say that as, like, so I'm not going to really go that hard. That's not what I'm trying to say. But, you know, some days, like, you're doing triceps and they're just not filling up with blood. It's quickly as usual, or maybe you're doing chest and like, you're just not getting that tight pump. That you should be, you know, that skin tight pressure towards the end of your left. You're not going to cut. You're really just trying to stimulate the muscle. And, you know, hit some weights, maintain strength. You get the idea. So, blah, blah, blah. I mean, that's what we fucking did for Guadalman. Pumped. I'll probably get back into some pressing. I am kind of chilling out on it for a little while. Because I've been sort of jumping into heavy squats. I'm not going to do that heavy when I do do them. But, like, you know, reasonable weight. I'm kind of chilling out on them just because my ad doctors have been flaring up on me. I got the, honestly, I should have done some fucking ad doctors. Now, throw them in the routine. We'll throw them into the routine. It's good for you. Very good stabilizer. That's the, that's the machine where you close your legs together. Not the one where you spread them apart. If you're doing you're using that one. I just think it's a waste of effort, man. Like, as a guy, man, it's not you want big ass hamstrings and quads. Well, I think you need a bigger butt. You know, I'm sure if you're like, if you're a fan of power lifters, then maybe you've kind of got that indoctrinated into your mind. Because I think a lot of power lifters might do some direct glue work. Just because it may transfer a little bit to some squat strength. But, you're never going to catch me doing dedicated glutes. Come on. Let's be fucking real. So, what, what else is going on? School? You know, I fucking, I'm just like, you man, I go to class. Do you want to take notes? I got to do homework, dude. I, um, I was lifting last night. Or, did I lift it in the daytime yesterday? I don't really remember. But I got a canvas notification to like finish my syllabus agreement. And it's already given me flashbacks to like, you know, I've been, I'd have a lift at like 11 and then I get a notification like, Oh, your homework is doing one hour and then I'm just like, fuck, you get the drill. You get the freaking drill. So, that'll take up a little chuck of time, chuck of effort. But I am glad that right now I'm dieting. Well, obviously you're dieting all the time as a bodybuilder if you're trying to like, you know, eat first specific performance metric. Be it strength and size gain or, you know, fat loss. But let's say, um, let me say cutting instead. I'm glad that I'm cutting during the semester just because I have more fucking free time. Like when I'm bulking, that's a considerable amount of effort and, like, pre, what's the word I'm trying to think of? Uh, pre, pre, well, it takes a lot of fucking time because you got a get food. You had to always be fucking eaten food. I'm not complaining because I do it because I want to. I want to gain some fucking muscle. But it definitely takes more effort for me to bulk up than it's us to cut down. Because for the most part, I think I'm pretty good when it comes to the, you know, mental fortitude and being able to not just scarf down, sweet, if that doesn't, you know, a line of my goals. Right now, I'm trying to fucking lose body fat dude. You're not going to catch me having like a 4,000 calorie cheat day. Unless maybe it's like a dedicated refieze for some, for some reason. Honestly, I've never really messed with refieze or anything. But, I mean, I had fucking, I didn't eat a fucking ton of food earlier today. So, I had a fucking clandag bar. 200, um, actually how many calories was it? I think it was 13 grams of fat and about 40, no, 13 grams of fat and how many grams of carbs? Fuck. I can't remember. Whatever, it was, however many calories it was, you know, that just goes into my fucking stupid simple macrotrecker where my basic diet plan is by the end of the day spread out relatively evenly. I want to hit 250 grams of protein, about 50 grams of fat, and 260 grams of carbs. Now, let's say, you know, an extra 25 grams of fat. That means I'll just try to eat a little bit less carbs or vice versa. But, uh, you, you get the idea. So, fuck man, if I just ate like, you know, sweets and, you know, my eggs and meats or whatever, as long as it still fit in those macros, I would still be losing body fat, right? To, uh, when it comes to the energy inside a food, it doesn't matter if it's a fucking glazed. Actually, my, you know, my favorite is the strawberry jelly filled donut. But it doesn't matter if it's a fucking sweet treat, or if it's some rice with olive oil, or whatever kind of whatever dressing you want. So, you get the idea. Your body's like, oh, we got some fucking carbs in the system. Oh, we got some fats in the system. Now, I'm not going to say that all of those are going to have result in the same shit. I mean, you know, clearly I'm not a massive advocate of, like, eating the most, like, conventionally healthy food that's available. But, I mean, I'm not going to, I do the only thing that I really look at for is, like, I try to eat trans fats. Like, why I see some of the trans fats in a stay away. That's, because that's like legit bad for you. But, you know, you get what I'm trying to say. If it fits your macros, you're good. You're freaking good. But, with that mentality, it's not really the most conducive with being able to stick to a diet plan. Yeah, I took the wrong turn. I'm going to do a loop around. Because let's say I were to eat a big ass breakfast waffles pancakes. Uh, was bacon, whatever. And that breakfast was 2200 calories. Hypothetically, if I only ate 300 more calories for the rest of the day, then by the end of it, I'd be at that 2500 calorie limit. And if I didn't eat anything else, then in terms of weight change, that day would still be one that would make progress because I ate less than my maintenance calories. But, for one thing, I mean, you want to, I definitely want to spread my protein out throughout the day. You don't just want to eat your whole fucking meal at once. You know, some people are into that with like the one meal a day, 25, 23 hours fast. I don't mess with that. And it learned form, done with topic. But I want to eat my protein throughout the day. And let's say I did have that big meal. It's going to be fucking harder for me to make it to the rest of the night without, you know, my stomach rumbling and want me to eat some more fucking food. So that's why I want to dieting. My food choices are extremely different than they are when I'm bulking. Because I'm trying to eat foods that are going to fill me up, but not fill me up with too many calories. Right? I mean, fucking egg white omelets with like chop spinach mixed up. I'll throw a little bit of cheese on there, but really you got to get some fat free cheese. That shit is insane. The macron, it's just fucking protein is badass. Now, the quality of the protein, I would say, is probably, it's probably arguable. So I do typically, if I eat a food where the protein is like not a complete source, like breads or, you know, if you look at a slice of bread, it says like what, 4 grams of protein. It's not a fucking complete protein. Usually, honestly, for me, the most part, I just don't even count it. I only count dedicated protein sources like animal products, meat, fish, dairy. But, you know, don't take that as a vice, you know, dude, over the fucking one. When you track calories. But, yeah, I mean, fucking lean AF, it's 97% beef, strain off all the fat, fill it up with like four servings of sweet, maybe, raise, no sugar added, barbecue sauce. And then scooping out some of that onto some keto buns that only have like two grams of carbs each, a little bit of fat as well, but he get the idea. Dude, I'm eating foods where at the end of it, I can say, well, I feel pretty fucking full, but I only knocks down, you know, 500 calories. So, I'll get into detail and do some of these little, little, little dieting, low calorie dense meals in like the, I'll do a full day of eating for the cut pretty soon. To give you guys a little bit more insight into what I'm talking about. But, I mean, fuck it, dude, until then, I'm just going to keep on doing what we're fucking doing. Oh, yeah, shit. So, today I got, I went to Best Buy, I got a fancy pants camera. I'm going to play around with that tomorrow. So, I'll see if that ends up working out. Because I tell you what I do fucking like. The fact that, I mean, I just record everything on the phone, edit it on the phone, upload it from the phone. But, you know, we're getting, you know, these videos are getting a couple of views. I'm sure some of you would appreciate a bit of a quality upgrade. And also, then I'll be a little looking at my pump checks and like four cants, so it's an 80, that's pretty badass. So, I'll play around with that tomorrow. But, if I think it ends up just being like a fucking hassle, then we'll keep it as is. But, I'm leaning towards thinking that it's going to work out pretty good. Because I can still take the files straight to the phone. Now we're talking about some behind the scenes, shit. So, keep an eye out for, well, if you just watch the next video after this one, maybe you'll be blown away by the cinematography that I bring to, oh yeah, and it's going to be a chest day. That's going to be freaky. But, yeah, if it's, so, if it ends up not being ideal for my particular situation, I'll just fuck more turn that shit. No matter what happens, though, any kind of just any sort of outside circumstance or situation, the pumps are going to keep on coming. I can freaking guarantee it. So, I will catch you next time, God damn it. I'll expose your down to a freaky level. Let's see what we're working with. So, 30 minutes to the sea to bike, I actually gave you a little bit of a demonstration. You know, there's, I mean, there's fucking nothing to see. I sit down, put it to quick start. Personally, I don't see the point in doing like intervals. Or if the cardiomychine says, like, oh, fat burning mode, that's nothing. That's just having to be more difficult for like maybe a minute and then you back off a minute. I say, just do the quick start simple mode, turn up the difficulty to something you can manage to pedal at a decent rate. And, you know, what I've always done is I do it at a difficulty, like, it's level 10 on that one. And these numbers are totally mumbo jumbo, but I do it such that it reads off as burning 10 calories a minute. So, I found that across even different sorts of brands of pedal, see the bikes. That's about right. You know, I feel like I get sweaty the same amount. And I start sweating at the same period. I guess that's dependent on temperature and how well hydrated you are, but whatever. Getting in there and doing it even if it's a little easier one day, a little harder the other day, because you use different bikes. You know, that's a problem that you guys probably don't even have. Because you don't even fucking do your cardio. But it's, I think it's about 1230 right now in a Sunday. So, I get to go home and chill. Eat some eat a couple of meals before I go to just tonight. So, let's do a little bit of an unpumped post check. I should have brought a different shirt. I can already tell this one's going to be fucking uncomfortable to put back on once it's cold. Whatever. I got damped. There we go. So, I'm going to get a scale on my way home as well. Because I've got to add my morning weight to the beginning of these videos. We can keep track. So, one thing I kind of like in terms of like being lean is I'll actually start to get some fucking ab shit going on. There's like a couple of veins creeping out up here. It's towards my belly button. I can kind of already see one right up here. Whoa. And then, it'll only get frakyer from here. It's great. A little bit of a fraky front relaxed. I should be able to hit a nasty vacuum. I haven't eaten anything today. You know, I woke up at like 11 and I drank a fucking... Somebody who was telling me it's better to take your vitamins in the fucking morning. So, that's what I did. I'm going to start taking it in the morning and get a day. Because he was saying like, be 12 messes with your sleep. So, I do it at the end of time anyway. Maybe I'll sleep better if I take it in the morning. Let's hit a fraky vacuum. Blow all the air out of your stomach and just try to just pull it in. Really, I mean apart from saying those like key phrases, it can't really be taught. You just have to do it and try it out for yourself. And that alone gets fucking frakyers the week's pass. That is badass. Now I guess I didn't do it front last bread. Same thing. Front last bread vacuum side chest. Kind of do a vacuum to slum up the waist. Honestly, just sucking your waist in all the times. They'll make you look cool. All right. Well, we already did the cart talk. I don't think we need two cart talks in one, but the video for tomorrow. Because technically, I'm recording this the day that I uploaded. It's a cardio portion because the lift was yesterday. That's usually, well, that's pretty much my routine. I record the video at night. And then when I do the 30 minutes of cardio, that's when I edit the video. So, I'm doing two birds with one stone. Now, if you're not fucking posting a workout video every day, then you've got your hands free to do whatever the fuck you want when you do cardio. You can watch a fucking movie. You can play some classroom or yeah. I know you're probably laughing when you saw that little overlay. I was pretty funny. You just sit. Like there was not that required. It's so little effort compared to an actual weight training workout that it's comical. The results you get based on, you know, how difficult it is. I guess the difficulty just comes in becoming consistent with it. So, family, that's, you're making me think that it's harder to do cardio than it is to like, rep three plates on bench based on the statistics of my non-third party double blind YouTube study from that one post. But we're done, man. So watch out for, I do want some opinions. So, I got a fucking camera and I'm going to record tonight's chest day with it. So, you tell me if it's, if it's a notable quality upgrade and if you want me to keep it or just stick with the phone. I'm still going to edit it on the phone. I can just take the files directly to it. But, you just keep an eye on it. I'll be, I'm curious. Either way, the pump is going to look fucking freaky. I think we already know that. But, I'll fucking see you next time.

There we go. Yeah, finally back to the, uh, finally back to the baby grocery card camera. But I've been saying this a couple times and half the reason why there hasn't been a full-day eating or a, um, or like a grocery trip haul. She's not much to friggin' see, you know? It's like, I feel like my grocery trips are so sparse now, because if I get a couple pounds of ground beef, a few tubs of egg whites, a couple of protein shakes, not like for the majority, but, yeah, sometimes it's, uh, to help it to all. It's like, I'm actually getting groceries at the rate of a normal dude, you know? I'm not sitting here coming in for like a restock every week. Like I would when I'm trying to bulk up. So, dining down a little bit more sparse, a little bit just because I mean, think about it. If he eat less food, he got a by-less food, come to the grocery store a little bit less, you know? But step one on the agenda is a little bit of a protein restock, right? Because it's cool as it is to talk about the carb-dup effect of being really full and everything else. Nothing's going to replace the protein. That's simply a staple, bulking up or cutting down, right? If I'm trying to, you know, I don't even know. Well, just that. If I'm trying to bulk up or I'm trying to cut down, my protein intake isn't going to change much. You know, I'm still either going to be doing too well, not even either. I'm still going to be eating 250 grams of protein from dedicated protein sources. You know, be it's ground beef, eggs, chicken, sometimes canned. Little bit of sardine action. There's a, in terms of the micro-nutrient density, that's up there with like, you know, straight sort of liver supplements. The problem is they're really fatty, you know, a full tin of sardine. Even if you really kind of squeeze the fat out of it, like with a paper towel, I mean, you're still talking about like 20 grams of fat per container, which I'm eating like 70 per day. So if I even eat one little pack of sardines that puts me at damn near a third my intake, and if I do two, then I'm already halfway gone. And that's where it can start to screw you, right? Eating foods that are sneaky with the amount of different sort of macros that they have in them can sometimes start to add up. And if you're not crazy, anal about making sure that you don't overshoot either one of them, you know, once you've already started tracking everything, then, you know, before you know it, it's six o'clock at night, and you look at your little progress bar, fats over eaten by 10 grams, carbs over eaten by five grams, you know, shit. And then if you want to stick to your calorie deficit, you've got to eat nothing, it just doesn't happen, you know. So that's where with my dieting approaches, I'm always trying to make sure I'm on a rate that's conducive with whatever I'm aiming for. So if I'm trying to eat only 2,200 calories for the whole day, halfway throughout the day, I want to be at 1100 or less so that I can at least eat something before I go to bed. Because if I don't, then the odds that I'm just going to get up start snacking, grabbing whatever the hell's in the pantry, it increases exponentially. And that's even me, like I'm pretty much locked in with the diet, but if I set myself up for failure, then the likelihood of failure begins to increase, you know, and that doesn't change for anybody. But like I said, let's, uh, let's go find some protein. Primarily, stakes first, I'm thinking, actually, I've got a little bit of a detour added. For a second, I thought I was headed straight to the red meat, but no, I think let's get some, let's get some lunch meat in here. Now the quality of the lunch meat, you know, turkey, you whatever, it's, it's to be debated. Obviously, it's not the same as something straight off the bone, like if you get a big, like full-on Costco turkey breast, where it's like five pounds of straight bird vacuum sealed. But I don't mind some of the, some of the deli turkey, and historically, it hasn't minded me either. So it's, uh, it's always been a little bit of staple in my diving phases to hit a low calorie turkey sandwich every now and again, ingredients primarily being, which I guess we'll see in a minute, low carb bread, some kind of lean turkey meat. That's it's about right. In certain, the terrible studies about the nitrates of a deli of a deli turkey, it's a works fine for me. But either way, two packs of those will be a good start. Let's grab a low carb bun to match them. And that should have been right over here. This whole store has kind of been reworked. I don't, I don't know where half this stuff isn't anymore, so give me a minute to find it. All right, bread location, I've got no idea what I'm looking for. So I guess that'll be next up. So until then, small pit stop by the beef. So what I'm really aiming for is top rounds. Big cut lean, which I guess that's really all I'm looking for. Big cut and lean. So, top round bonus. Perfect. Powder so each, suv style, exactly what I'm looking for. So let's keep looking. And only a few steps ahead of that. Ground beef. I've historically, I've cooked about one pack of these at a time. Even half the pound saved the other half in like a little tougher wear. But then it's every time you eat it, you're like in between every meal. Like I eat ground beef twice and then I got to cook it again. So I've streamlined that process, taking a little bit of a note from the, ooh. So a little anecdote here. All right, what are we looking at there? You know, you tell me, 92% whereas right here, 96% lean. So this is what I really want. And of course, once you strain these, most of that fat is going to come off anyway. So it's not like you're really screwed either way, but it does help for this stuff to be leaner in the beginning. Because then it's, you know, it's saving me from really having to pour off like bulls that a time. But that was one, two, three, four. Five pounds. I've just been thrown that into a big pot. Low, little bit of a stir every couple of minutes. And before you know, the whole thing's browned over. In terms of the fat straining process, be careful because it's kind of freaking when you're holding like five pounds of ground beef and a pot. Squishing it up against the lid of even like the small as a gap over a bowl just inverting the whole thing. I mean, I've had a couple of times where I've totally just spilled it completely. I don't even like to think about it, right? Knock on grocery cart. But let's, let's move on just one more notch to another little treat. I can't help myself with grab. I got a big craft single. And it's, I mean, I'm only getting one. So that shows you a little bit about how frequently I'm eating these. But it's just kind of just sort of adds a little something extra to everything. You know, if I get a whole tub of our whole bowl of like egg whites, if I melt a little slice of this cheese in there, it just tastes a little better. Same thing with the ground beef, same thing with sometimes on a turkey sandwich is just like a little boost and in terms of calories, you know, it's not adding too much. Each slice of these, three grams of fat, one and a half grams of carbs and it says three grams of protein. Usually I count it because, you know, even though you think all it's so processed, it still is a dairy product. It's not like that protein got completely destroyed in the process of going from milk to this craft single. But, I mean, well, let's just take a look here. I mean, first ingredient cheddar cheese. It's probably not your best protein. All right, but it's still protein on the less, and it will be tracked in my daily caloric values. So that's actually almost it for the protein. I got one more stop, and I think you could probably guess what it's going to be. So if you guessed egg whites, you win. You were freaking correct. And for the longest time, for whatever reason, I thought it was better to sit in individually separate every egg yolk from every egg white. Like, something about in my mind that made sense to me. Totally stupid. Your waist and egg yolks, your waist and time, your causing a mess, it's just foolish. So instead, I end up getting a bunch of the individually contained egg white tubs. And these come in 10s or no, 20 serving sizes. So you could get a really big tub that has 100 grams of protein worth of egg whites. But unlike the ground beef, I'm not so prone to meal prep to be egg whites. There's just really no benefit because, I mean, eggs in the fridge for a while and doesn't really sound right. So by getting just one of these tubs at once, in your flip-around, and you look at these nutrition facts, which everybody should be getting extremely used to and involved with on the regular. Then you'll notice 10 servings of container, 5 grams of protein per serving. I got 50 grams of quality protein right here. You know, a little bit lacking in the micro-duty micro-nutrient department because it's just straight up protein. But it certainly fills that criteria. So now I got a full card of every protein source. I'm really looking into. So now I got a couple of that with basically just all the sides. Because every meal has one thing in common and that's the protein part of it. Some of them are only dedicated protein meals. Tonight, when I go home, actually, I should probably grab an extra one of these egg white tubs because I'm just going to have some of this immediately once I unpack all this stuff. And that'll be it. You know, I might put some like some low sugar barbecue sauce on it. I'm not such a huge fan of just the straight salt and pepper on the egg whites. It just doesn't really do it for me. And then, you know, I might seem a little weird. But I'll throw freaking anything in the egg whites. It's just a blank slate. So I'll do teriyaki sauce, I'll throw like mustard on it there. It's just, you know, it sounds a little bit funky, a little bit fucking weird. But if you want to get extra lean and basically look freaky, you have to do some freaky shit. I've been on record saying that a couple of times already. But eggs, ground beef, steak, turkey, cheese. Yeah. Let's track down some of that low-car bread next. I've actually changed my mind. I've only been really doing the low-car bread. So now I think I want to go a little bit more. Well, I don't know what I was going to say. But get some of the low-car tortillas and the benefit of these, same thing. Right. And this is what I'm looking for when it comes to any like low-carb. If you ever look at something, you see like a keto bread, keto flour. It's not like inherently just zero calories. Nothing is. You know, you'd be eating some kind of weird synthetic like something to get food, to get something that's like food with no calories. Just doesn't work. But what you can do is you can manipulate the fiber. So underneath of every carbohydrate value, which right there, it says 19 grams is a separate value, which says dietary fiber. And this specifically, the insoluble portion is what I'm looking for. So 19 grams of total carbohydrates. That's 80 calories of carbs in each one of these. That's a lot. For me to have three of these is going to put me at 60 grams of carbs. That's like almost a protein half for my entire day. It's just not going to work. So that dietary fiber, which it doesn't say here, but is insoluble. That doesn't count. Like if it counts barely, like 0.1%. Because the whole point of the dietary fiber is, it's just, it's the word. It's like glucose chains or whatever. But it's like how you can't eat hay. Your stomach isn't processed or isn't built to be able to process that down. That's the same thing with dietary fiber. Like sure, it's made up of the actual components of what carbs are, but you can't actually get the energy from them. So even though it's 19 grams of carbs, total are really, I'm only getting those two, which usually I kind of round up to three or so just to be safe. But at two grams of carbs each, three and a half grams of fat and six of protein, which I usually just count because it's still calories. This is a much better alternative. So the point where I think I'll get three of these, but it's going to look nice. All right, I'm actually glad I waited to do this grocery trip because I really had to restock everything. So this is, I mean, this is what I'm eating right now in this diet. So what I'm looking for in the condiment aisle is a few staples. So a little bit more of the complicated side, but I guess since this right here, let's jump into it. Light mayonnaise. This, I wouldn't say has been a life saver, but it's definitely a creature comfort. So 35 grams, which, oh no, 15 grams. So a teaspoon, you could say a dollop, three and a half grams of fats. A negligible protein, zero, one gram of carb, which you still have to count. That does not just disappear because it was only one gram. And, you know, for me to put one serving this onto the turkey sandwich, it's certainly adds to my fucking enjoyment of it, and it only costs me three and a half grams of fat. So, topping number one obtained. Secondly, I'm going to look for some ketchup, and that's a little bit more so for the ground beef, but I'm not only looking for any damn ketchup on the shelf. Yeah, this is the kicker right there. No sugar added. And that's not zero sugar, and maybe I should be looking for a zero sugar, but this is, I don't know, I guess I'm just a hinds fan or something, but every 16 grams, zero fat, zero protein, one gram of carb. So for me, you know, if I get a bowl of ground beef, it's not always the most appetizing thing in the world. A couple of squirts of the low calorie ketchup weighed out, of course. And when I say weighed out, I mean, I just put my bowl of ground beef onto a scale, zero it out, and then add ketchup as desired, and the scale will read how many grams. So, you know, if I do a big squirt onto it, 32 grams, the scale reads, then that tells me, I actually have a view tell me, right? I had 32 grams of ketchup. How many calories is that? Zero carbs? I don't know, zero fat, zero protein, one gram of carbs per 16 grams. That's two grams of carbs right there, which I know it seems silly, because for you to even like, you won't even notice if somebody slips a gram of carbs into your pocket. Like it seems like nothing, but throughout the day, it adds up, and it's right here. Like it's in these little sneaky parts, the sauces and the condiments and everything else, things you won't really think about. Like you could have a bowl full of chicken breast and rice, and you're like, yeah, I'm doubting down right now, I'm going hard, I mean, chicken and rice. But then, let's say you do a big ass squirt of mayo chup. Whatever that hell this is. So, let's say you do 60 grams of mayo chup. Doesn't seem like that much, it feels like a normal amount of sauce, but, you know, 58 grams, right? What's that going to add up to? The M.30 grams of fats, eight of carbs. That's 300 calories, just of sauce. I'm having meals right now that are 300 calories total, which would come from just a little, like, thoughtless amounts of little things like this. So, as like, you know, aim-lin-like OCD about it, as it seems, it really is important to track all this stuff, you know? I feel like you, like if you want to get into it, you almost have to go all the way, because if you don't, then you're not actually getting reap the benefits, right? Like, if you get the macro tracker and you've got a food scale and you're you're, you know, you're half tracking, you're only going to get half the results. And with the dieting, it's, it just doesn't work like that. You know, if you diet half as hard as you should, you're not going to get as lean as you should, or half as lean as you want to be, you're just not going to be getting lean, because it's, uh, oh, man. It's almost as like you're in a class where the minimum grade requirement is a 90. You can't get a freaking 80, you can't do it 70% of the time, then the other 30% of the time you got a slack off, like you got to be on this shit. And I know it sucks, like I'm not trying to say that counting all these calories or easing and everything else, but if you can start to do it for long enough, and by long enough, I only mean weeks, then you should start to see noticeable results. And once you see those, then you have validation, oh shit, what I've been doing is been working. I'm down three pounds in the last three weeks, and I've been tracking on my calories. God, damn it, Sam was freaking right. Maybe I should start doing my cardio as well, you know, something along those lines. Your results may vary, of course, but that's on a main event for. So low fat mannays, low sugar, catch up. The nice thing about the mustard is it's starting to feel calories. It's freaking nothing in here, but some vinegar and a ground up mustard seed. But one more thing I'm looking in here for, primarily for the turkey sandwich aspect of things, is some relish. Or some pickle, don't know, let's just go take a look. So I'm sure you can kind of imagine what some of these meals already look like. Maybe some eggs with some toasted tortillas on the side, ground beef with some ketchup mustard, mayonnaise, and relish all makes together. And then if I put that onto one of those tortillas, I basically have sort of like a rolled-up burger. It's not the same, but it's pretty damn close. There's no pickles in here. Well, let me go find some damn pickles and then we can cut to whatever I look for next. I guess that's actually yet. I don't really mean anything else. And Norch should I. Frankly, I'm, oh well, I actually is that true. Sometimes instead of like, you know, some kind of random energy drink in the morning, I don't mind using a, using like a cold brew concentrate, with like some just stevia kind of sweetener and kind of starting off with a coffee instead. It's actually like grab some of that, some concentration, two grams of carbs, the damn. So any of this like just legit zero, three, uh, cheese. What about us guy? Yeah, well. Yeah, actually this is about right. Let me start with this. Eight. Yeah, it's about right. Yeah. Just gonna go to random cold brew, sort of thing. But that's just for a little bit of a morning routine. I mean, if I, if I only want to stick to caffeine, I just grab a caffeine capsule. I like the like the vitamin cap, cabinet, but it's sometimes just kind of nice and drink something like that sort of gets me extra excited about the but that's it, man. Grand beef, steak, eggs, little bit of cheese, but just kind of for kicks, really. And then some of those low carb, uh, low carb tortillas in the turkey. It wasn't kidding, man. You know, no cinnamon toast crunch, no, uh, no crispy cream, which I didn't even run into any today. Honestly, probably a good thing. Okay, actually, I lied. One more little stop here just because I'm right there. I do not mind the can chicken. Every time I say that I get can chicken, some of you guys dog on me, it's already cooked. It's moist. And it's 50 grams of protein per container. That's exactly what I want. So, actually, I'm gonna get a couple of these tints. And if you're really smart about it, you don't even get a bowl. All you do is crack the top, drain it at a condiment. That's desired into the can of itself. At the end of it, you throw the whole thing away. So, I guess I lied. The ground beef, lean steak, some deli turkey, some can chicken, some low carb tortillas, whole bunch of egg whites, low sugar, ketchup, low fat mayonnaise, mustard, and then a little cold brew, constant trait, just for a little cold cup of Joe in the friggin morning before cardio. Which cardio has taken a bump. I'm, uh, I'm gonna step it up, man, get that, get really locks in for this last portion. And what I mean by that is now I gotta get extra lean. So, cardio is no longer 30 minutes, so just sitting down on the, uh, on the bike. I want to add a little more. I need an extended period of time that I'm gonna be elevating my heart rate. And if I do an hour cardio, it's just too much. And by an hour cardio, I mean, an hour on the bike. Uh, geez. Crispy cream spotted right ahead of me. I don't even want to look at it. Let's turn down the soil. But for me to do an hour on the bike, it just ends up thrashing my, my quads. It's like, any shit. The pickles I want to. Okay, well, let's pause that train of thought here and grab some pickle chips. Oh yeah, there we go. Dill, perfect. So that's the last item. Some pickles for you sandwiches. Uh, but yeah, so an hour on the bike, it just doesn't really compute for me. It's like I'm just working my legs too much. And that's an argument I've seen against the cardio bike is it's all quads, which it is. And for 30 minutes, it's not so bad. But break and pass that 30 minute mark. It starts, I start to feel it. You know, so instead, I'm doing 30 minutes on the bike followed by 30 minutes on the treadmill. And the treadmill, that's the easy part. Honestly, the treadmill is kind of chill. Like all I'm doing in the treadmill is fucking sitting around and having a little walk playing on my phone or watching yellowstone, which I'm damn near almost finished with, which I'm not sure what I should watch next because they kind of set the bar pretty high. I like that chill. But the 30 minutes on the treadmill, three miles an hour, mild, incline, nothing wild. And I just remember something else I'm going to get to. So now, I'm headed over there. But that's the cardio routine. And then calorie wise, I'm floating at 250 grams of carbs. No, no, 250 grams of protein, 70 ish of fats and about, I think I've been at about 150 grams of carbs. But I'm going to start to have to drop that down. And while I'm here, which I just discovered the bread aisle, which used to be the diet soda, let's grab a loaf of loaf of bread. And we got one more little point to compare the two. But that's the plan. So calorie is going to drop the carbs a little bit, probably closer to maybe even a hundred range, you know, see what happens. Believe the fats that maybe, I'm like trim the fats down a little too, one like 60. And the protein is going to stay right where it is. But one more thing, just because I like them. And I wouldn't recommend you eat a ton of these so they can kind of mess with your stomach, it's such. But some carbs, smart buns as well. So look at these numbers here. Per bun. So 21 grams of carbs, but 18 grams of fiber. So really three grams of carbs. So I'm looking at per bun. One and a half grams of fat. Three. Three grams of carbs. Six grams of protein. That's good. I like that. The value per bun is within reason that's going in the cart. Now if I had to reach around to any other normal version, let's grab just this random ballpark burger buns. Look at these numbers. Not so good. Honestly, the fats, whoa, two grams of fat. That's actually less. All right, four grams of protein. That's actually less. Okay. Maybe I should get this one out. Yeah. What is that last number? Say right there, huh? 28 grams of carbs. What do I get to eat? Two of these per day? That's just not going to work. So that is not being thrown in the cart. Why is that carbs, smart version is? And taste-wise, honestly, not the biggest difference in the freaking world. Now my next stop would be to the diet, soda aisle, to get a couple of two liters of whatever. But I've already got like six two liters of diet sprites in my cupboard. So I'm kind of stocked there. I'm going to run through my own supply first before I start branching out to anything else. But that's it. Protein, heavy, carb and fats depleted slowly combined with consistent cardio. Before you know, you're going to have a name six pack. Like it's 2006 again. David, back when you were the lineman, or back when you were that receiver. I guess they're a receiver would be more likely to be diced. But either way, that's all I got man. And even just sitting here because I came here straight from legs. I'm fucking hungry. So I better I better not pass by any treat to my way to check out. So I will keep you updated. Of course, with how this dieting phase goes. Two thirty to be broken. It's going to take a couple of weeks. But that's kind of the plan there. So I'll see you then.

Yeah, that's coming to pick us up. We're headed to do a we're headed to an arm day We got three goals for this excursion. I Want to find a Las Vegas hoodie a Tank top and then go get an arm pump So that should be done in that order so that's a That's way for one of these elevators to show up and then Fight some shit There it is. That's what we're looking for Check this shit out I don't know if we need this specifically What up, um, there's even one for you to fill up Do you get your What's cool over here? It's a little small man. I mean you're about to start bulking up. I'd go for the seven That's a three Nice Go one hand two done go one and two done. Thank you But he's got chest. I got arms so Yeah, Mark got some Smith I got some rope Not the full stack, but close. I need to go too crazy Is honestly a lightish rope set is a good working set That also serves as a really good warm-up like I I guess bulking up is a little different you almost feel a little more like bulletproofed and ready to get into it But I feel so much better doing a light squeezing movement first for tries and then doing something a bit more tension heavy It'll have to focus, but make it shit happen You Yeah Oh, we got you. I'm actually up to go a little lighter, 82 in a set of 87. But one more of those. I think I'll do two of everything. Two sets of this, then move on to a different handler. Maybe I did machine if there's one here. Some shit like that. Joa .. I Didn't want it. armed Oh yeah okay Oh, all right. The next set will be heavier, but I'm not sure exactly what it'll be. Yeah, let me think about it. Any different? Let's just make this a straight bar set, a little more rapid. Right, Feve, heavy set, I want to do a light one. And forever, slow, squeezing one. I don't even maybe a quicker, pumpers sort of one. But this will be a little heavier, little quicker, and hopefully, I know I'm going to be more pumped at the end of it. But you're more of these. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more, though, set. Yeah. Yeah. You. You. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. It's for channels, but do the same shit here overhead bent over, though. Yeah. Yeah. With the overhead stuff, I like when this is a little more bent. I don't like overhead with a straight bar, kind of wrenches my wrists. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more, though, set. And try, sir. Nearly done. Maybe just one more, something, a rather. And that would be good. Very stretch focus with these. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. This will be it for tries. Five reps on one. Five and the other. Five and the other. And actually even thirty two pounds is a little too heavy, all the through twenty seven and a half. So the point of these, that's more of public try, steps up as much as possible. These five reps on one side. Five on the other alternating style sets. Because it's like you're doing a rest pause, but it doesn't stop. So the five reps that I do this side is rest for the other. And then vice versa. So instead of going from like fresh to. To teams in one smooth motion. It's like five reps, make me more fatigued. I get five reps or rest. Five reps with teag. Rest with teag. It's just different. Like I'm not going to say I'm suddenly hitting my my a nuclear fibers in a fast twitching. It's just different. I feel more pumped and fatigue at the end of it. And for the most part, that's like 90% of what I'm aiming for in terms of my explanation, right? If somebody's doing something and it's working, you target the muscle, you're feeling it afterwards. And you're getting more pumped. On top of that, it should probably work. You know, is that a hundred percent the most optimal thing in the world? I think movement is as optimal as intense as you make it, right? You can do a perfect set of preachers with awesome form. But if you push it to 60%, it's a team and it's jack. So I think the effort should come before the, Yeah, you can go and I'm saying let me hit the ship. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was solid. Let's, uh, Let's get some classic curls. Started as moving number one. Let's do the 50s in a similar style as the single one pushed out. But really just rest. So 10 reps, racket. Shake round a few seconds. Do another, that's money is possible. Set it down for a second. Shake him out. And then do one more finisher. finisher. So kind of a double rest-pause. And again, I mean, there's got to be some kind of explanation as to like, it's inherent value in terms of its stimulus. But, I mean, for my perspective, it's okay, this is hard. This is going to wreck my biceps in a good way. Let's do it. If I get my rocky four-centric song plan, there we go. And these week quick, not super slow. Oh my god. Yeah, that was good. I think one more just like that. And obviously, intensity-wise, that's more than normal. I'm going to have cut in my biceps volume down a touch if the sets are a little closer to that level. But, I just breathe in, run it back. I think this would be a single rest-pause. Let's do something. I don't think about it. This is a good machine. Hight number six is my sweet spot. Let's just make this a heavy one. Honestly, after those two sets of kind of the super, I don't know what I'm saying. The rest-pause by style. And then for one of the reasons I buy a zither is feeling they're cooking extra quick. Maybe, because we're kind of walking around a lot last night after we did the whole like, watch the power slap thing and talk to everybody. One of my biceps are feeling more fatigue. Well, either way, their closer to fully pumped than triceps were two sets in. So, not need to overcook them. But, let's make these set hard. Wester fully pumped. That's all I'm aiming for. We're fine some lighting and pose down. I do a couple sets of lateral raises to just first shoulder. Oh my gosh. Oh yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay. Yeah. I think that's good. Let's go find some lighting. I guess that's not true. I had my position before just, you know, only like twice. I did a pump and set of side laterals. That was all. Let's see how arms are looking. Morning weight unknown. Frankly, because I'm going to scale with me in a very travel. But, yeah, the only tank state we could find it that little at the bananas, the world's largest gift shop or whatever. There were mediums or no. Now, this is a large but yeah, large is a little tight on me now. But these are fun. I'll try to remember. Let's see how a couple of these classic ones are looking. I'm trying to smudge my arm up against myself and like make it look extra big. Oh, you're happy. I'm sure I'm going to wake up five pounds later. Two mornings from now, because tomorrow we're going to be flying back into a whole time delay sort of thing. So I think that's going to be a rest day kind of replant already just because legs after like eight sort of cumulative hours of like travel. I think it'll just be better to end up doing that the day afterwards. No, cardio is warm morning. That's happened no matter what, but yeah, I think rest days you have a place. No, I'm not anti-rest day. But alright, arms done pump to ship. I smell like smoke kind of chemically because these shirts are unwashed. But either way, let's get out of here. Let's go eat something and jump to whatever the hell with your next.

There we go. All right, the time is now 913. This is meal number one. Excluding the energy drink and the black coffee with a bunch of sweeteners that I had before the cardio. Obviously, negative calories. But one little carton of egg whites, straight into a little pot, a pretty substantial handful of just kind of chopped salad mix, thrown in low heat. Give it a stir every once in a while. Way out, 56 grams of fat-free mozzarella cheese. Pour that into this bowl, wait for the eggs to get almost fully cooked, add the cheese, melt everything together. Pour it all back in the bowl, and then weigh out two servings of low sugar barbecues. 64 grams, 8 grams of carbs total. So that puts this meal at 66 grams of protein because 50 from the eggs, 60 from that fat-free mozzarella cheese. Because it's more of a weight-isolate kind of concoction where they peel off the fats in the carbs. And that's what they leave to kind of leave the cheesy body of it. We know actually, for the added amount of the barbecues, that's carbs. There we go. Okay, so 334 calories. And this is going to be pretty filling. I got a way to cool down a touch because I don't want to burn my tongue. Then the few meals that I do get to eat, I want to be able to freaking enjoy. But I'm feeding it for this right now. I am hungry. Because after an hour cardio and a trip to court had a court day today, not judicial, I had my first feeding ticket. And I couldn't figure out how to pay it online. So I actually had to show up. But I'm ready to eat this along with a liter of water with one electrolyte tub mixed in. So I'll make this a little quicker. Usually every time I do a full-avening, I sit here and talk for like 20 minutes. Well, just do a quick few minutes for each meal. But this is going to be a perfect breakfast. This will be rather filling. And then I'm going to try my best not to come back to the pantry until it's time for the next meal around probably new niche, maybe even way to one. And then have something probably very similar to this. But at this rate, at 330 calorie meal, which is going to make me feel pretty full. This is what I like to see. So I'll see you for me on number two. Okay, some time has passed. Maybe not as much as I would have liked. But I could tell I was getting a little hungry for something. So this is six point like three-ish ounces of ground turkey. I'm going to hold a big bowl of like what was at one to five pounds of ground turkey. Strange. Cook just ready to scoop out meat mixed with, I don't know, how much broccoli a pretty substantial amount. Like there's more broccoli in here than there is turkey for sure. And I'm going to count the broccoli is about 10 or so grams of carbs. Because it definitely has some caloric value. Like just because it's a vegetable, you can't just write that off as nothing. Some all count that as just about 10-ish, I think. And that's kind of just by eye. But it's going to be tricky to overdo it with the vegetables in terms of my carb intake. And then some salt, minute and a half in the microwave. And this broccoli was already pre-steemed. I just made a bunch of batch head the same thing, sitting in like a pre-prept, little 10 in the fridge. And then another 64 grams of the low sugar barbecue sauce. So another 18 grams of carbs. So for the day, that is going to put me at what once this meal is eaten. 106 grams of protein. Two grams of fat, very minimal in the fat intake so far. What is a good thing for me? Honestly, the lower these bars are as the day progresses, the easier it's going to be for me to actually stick to my numbers. And then 31 grams of fat. So if you look in this distribution, if it'll, you see, that's pretty good. So I woke up at 5. Now I'm going to 6 when I'm talking about, I'm going to go to bed around 9. So if it's about new niche now, then that puts me at about, what maybe. 40% of the day done, almost halfway, not halfway. But like a little less. So I've got about 2,000ish calories to work with. And for it being 1130 right now, after I've eaten this to be at 560 calories consumed, that's pretty good. Because that still leaves me about 1,500 for the rest of the day. Where I get myself in trouble is if I have a big breakfast or just like, you know, whatever, and it's noon or it's 1 o'clock or whatever. And I've already eaten like 1,500 calories out of my, a lot of, let's just say 2,000. I don't know what the exact number is. I'm kind of just hitting these like carb fat protein values. But if I'm already at like 80% of my calories eaten, and it's, you know, only 4 o'clock in the afternoon, what is the likelihood that I'm just going to, you know, force myself to go to bed hungry. And I guess if you get that dog in you, then yeah, deal with it. But that's where I think 90% of cheating on people's diets actually happens. It's not midday. He don't just have a lunch splurge where you decide to screw it. I'm done. Let's just eat 4,000 calories right now. It's like later in night. Okay, it's 6 o'clock. It's eight o'clock. I've already eaten all my food for the day. Like the dude's stomach is starts growling. Uh-huh. You know, I got a couple of protein bars in the pantry. Maybe I'll just have some of those. You know, each two of them. All right. Well, you know, maybe maybe I'll just have like some frozen blueberries or something. Or just like just anything. And then if you catch yourself eating something out of the pantry without sitting down, you immediately eat it through the wrapper away and you grab something again. You're in the danger zone, right? You're in the red. Whether you're just going to keep grubbing and overshoot your calorie, you know, limit for the day. It's pretty high. So I'm trying my best to avoid getting into that position at all by trying to leave some calories for later at night. Because if it's 9 o'clock and I get to have a big bowl of like ground beef, broccoli, fat free cheese all mixed together kind of in like just like a melty sort of way or whatever. With some sugar free barbecue sauce on top. I mean, that's going to be a pretty filling meal. And I'll be able to go to bed saying, oh, I'm not even that hungry. Awesome. But if the last meal of the day ends up being like, okay, I've got room for four ounces of ground beef and like, you know, one cup of broccoli. Not awesome. You know, so I'm kind of orienting my whole day's intake into making sure that the last meal of the day pretty close to when I go to bed is big enough that I can feel full and say, okay, I'm tired. I just want to go to bed and I don't have to even have the thought of like, oh man, I'm hungry. Oh, I should get up and eat something. Like to prevent that situation from even happening, I think is the real trick. At least for me, you know, if you don't mind like basically eating nothing all day, then I guess dieting is easy for you. But for me, it's a little trickier. So I'm going to sit here, grub on this and then I've got a lift and probably yeah, probably go in like two hours or something for back. So you just have to see it in and I'm not a, does it, does it, does it can? There's a full day of eating. If all I do is talk about the food and I don't just sit here and do like a full on muck bang. That's maybe how about we save the muck bang video for day one of the next bulk and we'll just make it a, we'll make it three hours long if just no commentary eating. But either way, let's move on to what I would imagine to be the postwork out meal later. Okay, some substantial time has passed. Weighted probably two hours, ish after that most recent meal went did back, didn't know our cardio, came back. And then now I present you with this. Eight ounces of ground turkey, 99% lean, 40 grams of fat-free mozzarella cheese, 90 grams of the low sugar barbecue sauce, which adds up to 12 grams of carbs. And then seven grams of carbs worth of broccoli and cauliflower, microwave together in a like a little instant steam bag. So a little bit of a theme, but it really just freaking works, you know. Like I've got, I've got a bunch of like the like the low carb like keto friendly like protein bars and stuff sitting in the in the in the pantry door or like some of like some of the protein cookies and stuff, you know, 14 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, 20 grams of protein. And like as a treat, those are nice because they you can really balance them in. Like I haven't really had that many fats today so far. Literally eight grams of fat. I get a pretty hefty meal after this. And actually another one. So I've got room for a little kind of like a treat like that. But most of these meals, this is really just kind of what fills me up, but doesn't take a whole lot of calories, you know. So this is about 60 grams of protein, 20 of carbs and then like five of fats or like three of fats, like a tiny, little bit of the lipids or whatever. And this is going to fill me up pretty well. To the point where I don't really feel like I'm going to need to eat something for probably another hour and a half or something. So I actually get a really big postwork on meal, which is exactly what I'm aiming for. Now all of this could be meal prepped together. Like I mean, I basically prepped the turkey here and cooked five pounds of once leave it in a separate way. The broccoli could do the same. Sometimes I'll make a couple of those bags and then leave them in the fridge. But if I'm going to reheat it anyway, I may as well just leave the individual freezer bags in the freezer and then make them kind of on demand like this. But you know, I'm hitting my protein goal because I need reasonable sources of protein that are lean. I'm talking egg whites, lean steaks, lean ground beef, lean ground turkey, egg whites. These are basically my bread and butter of my protein sources. I mean, I'll throw in a, there's just not a huge place for any protein shakes in a dieting phase like this, like a deficit dieting phase. Unless I just don't have anything else around and it's like all I got to eat because it's not very filling. Like the amount of fullness I'm going to get from the 60 grams of protein from this bowl of turkey compared to even like a 100 gram of protein shake. It's like this. I mean, the shake is going to feel like nothing. It's going to feel like I just drink something, you know? So eating just plain basic foods, spice them up a little bit with a fat free calorie, calorie smart options. It really just ends up working. And then I'm extra spoiled because I get to be around the kitchen pretty much like throughout the entire day. Like I've got access. So I don't have to really prep any of this and save it for later. But if I did, then all I would do is like sit and then make basically this times five times six times ten or whatever, leave them in Tupperware and just leave those in the fridge. And if I know I'm going to be gone for like more than three hours from like a source of food that is like diet friendly, then I want to bring those along. But as a postwork out meal, I can already tell my freaking mouth is watering for this. So I'm going to show it here. Delete this is now to slow as possible, but I'm going to try not to starve it down just so I get to enjoy it for a little bit longer. And then what are the next meal ends up being? It's going to have a little treating vault. You're like a protein Oreo cookie or something or I don't know because I've got a lot of room. Like a look at the macro tracker. 1,068 calories consumed and I've got like 30 grams of carbs, 30 grams of fat in 60 grams of protein left. There's a lot that I can do with that. So I'm going to say here enjoy this and then I catch you for whatever meal number four ends up being in the day. So this is it. And I'm not going to eat all of this at once. This bowl of 150 grams of frozen mixed berries with three packs or three containers of sugar-free jello. This is going back in the freezer. I'm going to save this for a little bit from now as sort of my dessert of the day. Net total 15 grams of carbs. So I guess you can say this is the last real meal. Literally just a repeat of before with a carton of egg whites, 50 grams of protein worth, three servings of fat-free mozzarella cheese, melt it all together with some chopped salad, vegetables and whatnot with two servings of low sugar barbecue sauce as a bit of a toper. So this combined with a little like a low carb kind of protein bar. Again, this is more so just as a snack because I like it and the macros fit well. I'm even forth from the day. And then my vitamins. I've been a I've been getting real fancy with it. I actually pack in these like you know two weeks in advance. So I don't have to sit there dilly dilling at the vitamin cabinet every night. So all of that combined including five slices of keto white bread toast, totaling five grams of fat in 10 grams of carbs each, puts me cumulatively at 128 grams of carbs, 25 grams of fat, and 280 grams of protein, and 1857 calories for the whole day. Now that might sound a little low and it definitely is but I've kind of just been ramping it down. I mean the first month is dieting phase. I was doing like 3500 and then getting into that second month or the second uh or I guess he's like the fifth week, the sixth week or so. I was like you know, 2800 and then dipped it down to 23 and then sort of I've been floating around 22, 2100 or so. But I can tell I'm kind of getting plateaued around that 233, 234 mark. So combined with avocado, what else is there to change? I'm not going to sit and do five hours cardio. So decreasing the calorie intake is going to widen this disparity of calories burned and calories consumed. So all this together with an unbuttered set of toast for this eggs, which will pair pretty nicely, especially with the cheese and the barbecue sauce. That's it. So this is kind of where I'm aiming at. Little low in the fats with 25 grams, but that's really just because the carbs went over. I was really aiming for 100 grams of carbs. But yeah man, now the ton of food and very plain meals. Not really much room for any sort of treats, but that's just the nature of it. Right? If you want to get a little bit leaner, you're going to have to sacrifice no treats. But if you do a hard core dieting phase, certainly so reasonable dieting phase for a period, then guess what's over the horizon? Bulk summer 2025 is going to be treats galore. So I can wait for those later, and I can save my appetite with just all these kind of more plain, simple filling meals for now. These will continue to tie me over. But little inside into the dieting, what not? So I'm going to finish this. Oh man, I was better say it, and then watch another episode of Squid Game. No idea why the only made seven episodes for that season, but what do you want to do? So either way after this, I'm going straight to bed. Well, I'm going to play my phone for a minute, finish those berries, and then I'm going to bed. And then I'll see you for a freaky arm day tomorrow.

Oh, it's wrong. Yeah, we made it. A little bit of a lengthy day of travel, but when you get a DM from power slap, right? And I was gonna say if you want to come watch, which, uh, I don't know which one this is. This is power slap six. I don't know. It's like fresh. Plus, trip to Vegas, but it's fucking nuts. So we just landed rental car acquired, and then this is, uh, this is the first stop pre-hotel I gotta get soon. You gotta get some pre-in in and out. Luckily enough, you can order it, uh, what do they call it? That's a wrap. Uh, I don't know, let us, let us wrap. We're both actually, are you dining right now? Yeah, I love it. Well, I'm deep into it. I'm trying, uh, I was feeding them for snacks the whole time we were sitting at the plane. It was like five or so hours. I had a couple of marks, pretzels, and like a little Oreo cookie that the, uh, like, Stewart is what's hanging out. And like, that was probably the hungry set of her been on the plane. Usually I get a bunch of like beef jerky or whatever, but so far I'm at 2300 calories. So, you know, I want to eat another 150 grams protein in me for today. That's actually gonna put me over the cusp into about two, eight. But that's okay. Because actually today is gonna, I think we're gonna make today a little bit of a two-day type action. Because I did back earlier, but Mark has only, uh, he's done nothing. He came straight from school, so I think we're gonna make a quick bit stop. What, uh, what do you got? I got a quick chest of triads, chest of iron, I probably said shoulders. If that's the plan, I'll just throw some shoulders in. But first, let's get some grab on our systems. Crazy cool looking, but I've never been cut off so many times. This quickly trying to merge one downside of the strip, I guess. And you got the stature liberty, though. Is that the real one? All right, man. There we go. All right, the guy taking the orders was, you can have a, kind of, a little lat mat. Wait, I didn't really get it. Yeah, I'm gonna stop doing my gals. What the hell is it, wait, bet it? A little lat mat there, right? But if the guy taking the orders is really out there, so it's, I don't want to actually clip him, but total, we get a full, uh, full little box of six double animal style. I don't know what I'm saying, protein style, sort of patties. No mayonnaise, ketchup mustard, onion pickle. And I don't think I've ever been hungry here. Is an absolute description. How I freaking be all right now. Let's break it. I think the last time I had any time was when it went to California. Yeah, nice school. Last time you had any time. I thought you had any time. Yeah. Yeah, that was back. That was before any training, it was like one fifty five or something. Oh, I go. You know what I'm saying? Five guys in the lettuce, a few days ago. This is better. I think the five guys might have been better. This is good. Not bad. It has that for a description. And then maybe it's, and maybe somebody else is a friend of that. Who's a sack? Well, a plan now. Finish these. Check in. And then go get some shit move it. So that's a, let's just jump to that part. Okay, so we made a little bit of a, a little bit of an executive decision last night. Which was kind of made on accident as soon as I laid down. I was completely not getting sleep. I, I was in my full clothes and I was like, you know, it's a, but swap ass. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be a planning. But now so as soon as we got back to the, for the hotel, I fell asleep with my clothes on. It's not like crazy, but we are just a cardio. I'm working with it. I'm working with it. Even back workout is working with the trial. A little camera guy style for the later we're got today. So that quick stuff. I have a meal number one. Would you get some sort of, some sort of an outlet? I'm let steak eggs. Yeah. So you slide it, say, think egg white on the veggies. I should have asked. I'm going to use like late butter. A little better. Yeah. That and a table and steak, which, you had a restaurant that might be really big. But I feel like the eye-opper, totally going to sting you with it. And it's getting a little bit stem. So not so carb heavy. I guess 10 beats, meal number two, meal number one was like a bit crunch bar, which is, it's 12 bullshit. It's not even like a healthy, it may's all be even chocolate bar. That one is still 250 calories. But I gotta be mindful. Evench. I'm saying the same story again. But we're on the fucking plane. I was feeding her something. But we dealt with the clue today. I just gotta click one day one in the trunk. But we're going to get into some, not shenanigans. But we're going to run out of the place tonight. So we'll try to record some of that for a bit more.

Alright, little bit later in the shrieking evening. Six o'clock, but feels about right. I kind of wanted to wait a little while because I had a big bowl of kind of a ground beef, mixed with fat free cheese, mixed with barbecue sauce, plus some low-car buns, two of those accounting for the fiber kind of different than anything else of those calories. But I kind of felt heavy in my stomach. I don't really love lifting when I feel like kind of like, no, I don't think bloated is really the right word because it's not like I was full of gas raining. It just kind of had a really full stomach. So it's not as fun to train like that. So I pushed the lift back a little bit later. And now I feel ready to freaking go. So our cardio complete in the morning. I'm going to have another hour after this. Let's not think about that. Let's think about the back workout with the touch of shoulders. Hey, you're focused there. So, I'll play it for back. Going to a bit of a simpler gym. So nothing too wild. I'm talking pull-outs, rows, pull-overs, potentially some pull-ups supersetted into some seated rows on the cable stack. And then that will probably be it. It really doesn't take much. And then shoulders, I think I'll kind of splice the two together. For me, with the shoulder workout, like I'm not going to, these aren't in same failure sets. I'm just trying to get a rear delt inside the pump. So probably in between each set of rows, I'll jump over to the dumbbells and do like 15 sets of lateral raises. Or 15 reps of lateral raises, bend over, do a few more sets of rear delt focused lateral raises. Oh, they go from there. So, I'm currently unstimulated. I've got the pre-workouts in front next to me. So I think that's only going to say. Well, short and sweet. How about we just jump straight to the action with a first set being? Typically, I'm always doing like some kind of single-on pull-over or pull-downs. Usually I save the pull-ups for a little bit later if I do them at all. So I've warmed up a little bit in the cables. They'll kind of fresh. Let's start with the pull-ups. I have my body weight and so a lot easier now. It's a little trickier doing these at 270. Set with a, let's just start with a reasonably tempoed set. You've got to get on my tip to it. It's just strapping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can't. Oh, my God, I said. Yeah, that's you one more. Probably two sets per movement. Can't have a approach, I'm thinking. Yeah, that's pretty hard. Okay. Oh, my God, I said. Let's do something more upper back focus next. Why does she grip straight bar rows? Perfect. No. No. Oh, okay. One more. So I forgot some freaking mention. It's day one hundred. Day one hundred of dieting. Yippee. Yeah, how about, how about we save the celebration for the end. All right, this is, is one more lift. One more step. It was worth aiming, but we're not there yet. There's still some time to a. There's still some words to be done. So, how about we save the special for. Once this is all over, right, nothing to wild today. Oh. That's why I don't wait like seated rows like this. It's started with the weight down. Let's just pull over. Oh. That's why I don't wait like seated rows like this. It's started with the weight down. Let's just pull over. Sing along, of course. Sing along. Five reps on either side. Standing. Yeah, yes. And maybe three feet away. And then I'm really trying to feel my lower. Lats. Like, if my lat ties all the way down to right here, I want to feel every fiber that at the bottom. So in the spirit of that squeeze, no need to go that heavy. Six easy actually perfect. So, left side first. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. One more. So, a lot of raises. And then let's get ready for what I know. Like, ish. Pulldowns will be the lat-focused portion of this finisher. And then, as I've repeated pretty healthy many times, this sort of seeded row situation will be afterward. Whoa. It's, uh, it's been tremendous in the working order. But a nice little alternation of pull-downs, lat-focused, to more mid-back kind of trap-focused squeezing. Never done me wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've paused out. Holy crap, I'm feeling the freaking deficit now. Oh my gosh. All right. Good set. All the added of those two sets of lateral raises. But I can still feel a bit of a residual shoulder pump. I mean, they already jump in out of the freaking sweater. Well, let's, uh, let's do it through the shirt. Pump check and see what we're working with. Yeah. There's some width in there for sure. Let's get a real deep dive though. Oh goodness. Very different from the beginning. Let me see if I can remember to splice in the back lat spread from 100 days ago. Yeah. It looks quite different now. Very, uh, which is very good thing, of course. But let's run through something. There we go. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never had some freaking shot right there. Oh, oh, yeah. It's freaking hard to hold a pose after a full on freaking left. But let's, uh, yeah, a little bit of shoulders things starting to poachrude. Maybe we'll breath hold a really jump on that. Oh, oh, man. Yeah. I mean, just standing here in a pretty relaxed, well, relaxed. Certainly feeling like a nutcase. But there's a few extra steps to go. I believe this was. That is for sure. Oh, my goodness. But sweet back pump. A little bit of shoulder action. And then note insane. Try substrations or veins. Yep. But we're getting there day by freaking day. So for you, we can go to the car and get back to the happen for me. I'm going to camp out right freaking there for the next 60 minutes. So better than I'm at freaking ace up. All right. I'm totally going to forget to crop it in and post. Remember this? I mean, tell me it's going to burn us down. So it makes the holy crap. Yeah, so that was back in freaking October. Yeah, we go right there. Yeah, that was a while ago. Holy shhh. Holy moly. No, I know how to freaking bulk. That's for sure. But one thing that is, it's kind of been grinding my gears a little bit. And half of me thinks that these comments are like trolling. But, you know, half of me knows maybe they're not. And those comments are the ones where it's like, Sam, and I'm just trying to, you know, put some emphasis on it. But they're like, Sam, why would you strain the fat off the ground beef? That's healthy fat. Sam, why would you eat egg? And why would you eat egg whites and not the egg yolks? And get those healthy fats, man, from your mega threes. And, you know, I think it, you got to remember healthy foods, which is barely even an accurate description. Honestly, we have such a weird, like, obsession with categorizing foods. This is healthy. This is not, but whatever. That does not mean that it's conducive with fat loss. You know, I would completely stop losing weight right now. If I started eating three and a half thousand calories a day of chicken rice broccoli. No sauce, no nothing. If I was eating 400 grams of rice per day, and evenly sized, like chicken rice broccoli meals, which you would think holy crap, Sam's really locked in, he's not eating any, he's not eating any treats. All he's eating is chicken broccoli rice. Oh, he's serious now. I'd start gaining weight and start bulking up because the amount of calories that I'd be eating it's just too much. So the battle that I'm facing is every day. My body burns this much energy. Now, I sort of up that by adding all this extra cardio and the workout, but that just kind of counts as the day. So every day I burn this much. I can't eat more than this. I have to stay under because if I don't, no more body fat. There are no more body fat burning. I guess I really mean there would be the same amount of body fat, right? So what I'm trying to say there is, regardless of what those calories were, even if it was straight, crispy cream and protein shake, mixed with ice cream or whatever, if it was under that calorie limit, then that's what I'm really aiming for. Now, of course, that's an exaggeration I would never do that because it wouldn't work. Treats do not make you feel full. There's almost no way that I could ever eat 1,500 calories in a day or 2,000 calories in a day of pure treats. Because every time I would eat something, it would immediately spike my blood sugar. They're all my appetite off, you know, out of whack out the wasoo and then I'd be hungry again. It just doesn't work. So that's why all these meals have been plain. They're not plain, but low carb, low, I mean, basically nothing for sugar. Apart from like, I'll do some yogurt with some frozen fruit and a little bit of like sugar-free maple syrup. That ends up being a pretty good treat for me. Cost and only 160 calories, which is really nice. But it just doesn't, like, treats don't fill you up. Whereas if I've got a bowl of a full bag or like two bags of a mix salad, I add eight ounces of ground beef. I add 150 grams of G-heans, sugar-free barbecue sauce, which adds up to like, you know, 12 inch grams of carbs. And then some factory cheese, makes the whole thing together. I got a huge bowl of food in front of me. And only costs 500 calories right? It might only be like 40, not even 40, like 30 grams of carbs. Maybe 10 of fat if that, because of how much I'm strain in the ground beef. And then like 50 of protein. That's a big meal. So that's what I'm really aiming for. Calorie-efficient food. Because I want to feel full. That is the primary driver or the primary, like, vector that I'm trying to use to make me not come back to the kitchen for seconds. But I got a counter that with, okay. I'd feel pretty full if I had four spicy chicken sandwiches from Wendy's. And that would be my entire calorie intake in one sitting. So that's not going to work. So I'm going to eat foods that make me feel full. But don't completely blow my calorie budget out of the water. So especially for this degree, yeah, that means really strain off all the excess fats on the barbecue, or from the ground beef. I mean, it's no egg yolks. Except for sometimes I'll do like a soft boiled egg and kind of throw that over top of the ground beef. But those five grams of fat from that egg yolk, I got a counter. I got a track of that is not just a negligible amount. And you really, I mean, at this point getting this lean. I got to be straight. Or at least I've got to, you know, make sure I have a solid accounting of all the calories that are coming in and out. Because I know it sucks, and I'm not trying to say it's easy. But you really do have to be on it with a hundred percent of the foods that you're eating. In terms of your calorie tracking, if you want to make consistent body recomp sort of changes. And I mean, that's with the calorie counting approach. I mean, there's all the Atkins and Keto and I don't know carb. And none of that appeals to me. That doesn't make any sense. I know the calorie value of proteins, fats and carbs, the amounts of the proteins that I need for my build, the amount of fats and carbs and that sort of ratio. So I want to play around with it. I mean, I mean, control there. But, you know, if I don't count the five grams of carbs that were in the barbeque sauce that I add on the eggs. Or if I don't count the three grams of fat that I used because I put some avocado oil into the pot or the pan before I could be eggs. Or if I don't count, you know, this is out of the other. It'll start to add up really quickly because What's five grams of fat in ten grams of carbs? Nothing. That could be like one bite of something. That could be, uh, well, let me just, let me try to think of an example here. I'll just, I'll just go there and go out in front of me. Well, whatever. And extra hundred calories can be consumed like that. Like it's nothing. You won't even notice. Having an extra hundred calories on a meal, frankly, you're sort of like overall fullness. If it was like a 400 calorie meal, you probably wouldn't even know the difference. Now, if you add a hundred calories up five times throughout the day that you're eating, not even including a random little snacking or, you know, maybe you take a sip of some whatever out of the fridge, just every so often, you know, you ought to really need to track it. Before you know it, you might have tracked 80% of the food that you ate, but you completely missed 600 calories. A 600 calorie gap or discrepancy in your calorie intake. I mean, you're not going to be able to make up for it. And I feel like that's why so many people try to get into calorie counting and they track their weight. And, you know, they get in the scale every morning, okay. 180, 180, 180, or 250, 250, 250, 250. Oh, I'm counting everything. Why isn't this working? I, and then it's always a deflection, which is pretty classic psychology. You know, it's just not my fault as something else. So it's, well, I've got a slum metabolism, man. I'm a freaking hard game, you know, where as in reality, if you actually have a solid accounting of all the calories and the macros and everything else that you are really eating, then the numbers would start to explain your situation. Okay, I'm 240 pounds. I'm probably like 180 lean. All right. Well, I work out every day. I don't do any cardio. I should. I've been telling myself I should. Sam keeps telling me that I should. I'm not listening. I don't know myself in this guy. But, all right, I'm counting everything. Oh, well, I, I thought I was eating 2000 calories a day, but really, I'm eating 2,800. Huh. I guess that kind of makes sense. All right. Looked up my maintenance calories and it said 2800 was my maintenance. Okay. Well, if I keep eating the maintenance, I'm just going to keep maintaining my weight. I got to clearly drop those calories down. You know, and it's not fun to say that because, frankly, I mean, dieting is hard. You're literally fighting against your body's instinct, telling you to eat more food because you're hungry. You know, you basically have three things that you're hard-wired to do. All right. Sleep, eat, drink, and then I'm quoting myself from Wallygo. But there's one more. All right. And we, I think we all know which one this is. But to try to fight against one of those, especially one that's like pretty dang important for your survival, your hunger. It's hard. It's definitely not easy. But, all right, you got a human brain, or the freaking smartest thing there is on this planet. Potentially this whole freaking universe, right, depending on how much of a conspiracy theorist that you are. So, it's not the hardest problem in the world. You know, it's definitely not rocket science. But, it's a bit trickier than just writing down on paper, eat less food. There's certainly some room for new ones there. So, all that's to say is, from my perspective, at least, I find it's the easiest to go about the problem of dieting, bulking up or cutting down by breaking it down into the basic fundamentals of, okay? If I want to gain weight, I've got to eat enough food to gain weight. And if I want to get leaner, then I've got to, you know, only eat so much food on my body. It's forced to use its internal energy reserves. My body fat has energy to make up for that calorie deficit. And really, there's no two ways of batter with that. Calories in calories out is a pretty dang freaking strong ass law. You know, you're not fighting thermodynamics here. Of course, there's little tips and tricks in the cardio and the meal timing, everything else. But, if at the end of the day, you're eating too much, you're never going to make the fat loss gains or even four. Or advice versus obviously, I'm going to be a bit more diet centered now that I'm cutting down. But, if you keep telling yourself you're going to seriously bulk up, but the scale isn't changing. What does that mean, right? You're just not eating enough food. So you've got to find a way to match that for your schedule. Right? I mean, this, for my, how I've got about it, the working at is very personal. Like, I want my diet, my approach to everything to be form-fitted to me. So, you know, I've got to take their responsibility to try to figure all that stuff out, make and mistakes and try to learn from them in a just over time. And now I've got to the point where I've got a pretty reasonable grasp of how to modulate everything to do with my build. Right? Size, leanness, bulkness, whatever else. So, it's not a question of if, like, once you get a good grasp of the rules of the game that you're playing, what it comes to the dieting, the training, then no longer becomes an if I can achieve whatever I want to do. Or if I can get there, if I can get this lean, if I can reach this bodyweight. It's simply a gain plan which doesn't have to be looked at as an om. And I wonder if it's just, alright, how long is going to take for me to do this? Because the mystery is gone, right? I mean, the magician to a kid is like, I mean, it's straight up magic, right? But once you know the tricks, you know, once you understand how it's executed and how it's done, you could learn it yourself. Now it's going to take some time and some practice and some effort and some adjustment, everything else. But it can be done. Now, if you can get yourself into that mindset, get that dog and you and thug it out with the cardio, repeat on the daily for months on end. I mean, you can make some pretty serious changes in a pretty reasonable amount of time. But, you know, the more kind of locked in you've got to be, more locked in you got to be. And that's the hard part, right? So that's on you. And it's out of my hands. I can tell you all this hype motivation, whatever else, work out every day to your cardio. But you can't, you can tell a lifter to download a macro tracker app. You can't force them to enter those numbers. That's where it's on you. I think that's a good ender. You know, leave you with that. So tomorrow, I've got a, what I hope to be in Saint-Leafriky, Vaney, striated and just freaking badass arm day with, actually with nothing more. I talk with cardio. That's basically it. And then I think I'm due for a rest day, especially before legs. So I think the day after tomorrow, I'll take a day and just do the cardio, save legs for the day after. Maybe. We'll see. But that's how I got day 100 complete. There's not going to be a hundred more. Or pass the half way mark, don't worry. So if anybody who's been waiting for the next bulking phase, it'll come. It'll come in time. But not yet. And I'm freaking, yeah, I got some stuff to do first. So until then, I'll see you for our us.

Okay, I'm at war. I am at freaking war. Now, with a man or a country, but with a simple phenomenon of, well, I guess you could say, the body fat on my body that I'm trying to get off. But that might be the entity that's sort of putting up a fight. Oh, what I'm really feeling is the freaking hunger. I got a few weapons of my disposal. The cardio bike? That's helping me. The macro tracker app, I get on my phone. That's a pretty strong one as well. And kind of just dug into that, right, dealing. There's no way to get around it if you want to get leaner. That means you're going to be kind of hungry. You can make it easier in yourself by eating whole plain foods, low sugars so you don't only mess up your blood sugar and spike your insulin for no reason which is just going to make you hungry again 30 minutes freaking later. Now in a bulking context, I have a very different perception. Obviously, I'm not so concerned. It's sugar intake. Right, right? I should have leveraged it in terms of sort of pre-workout or post-workout kind of recovery. But right now, not so much, right now, not so much. So really, I just had one reasonably big kind of pre-workout meal. It was like a lunch about two and a half hours ago or so. And now I am ready for arms. That meal consisted of 50 grams of protein worth of egg whites mixed with, like a just sort of a chopped vegetable kind of salad pack. I throw all that into a little pot and put it on low heat and said the whole thing kind of cooks up together. And I got a couple of comments like the same way. You would cook, you know, cooked salad with eggs, what the hell? It's not that bad. It's frankly, it's pretty good. With two servings of fat-free mozzarella cheese mixed in at the end of the cooking process, once it's fully melted, some low sugar barbecue sauce, salsa, salt pepper, frankly freaking perfect. And then that was paired with a little bit later. Kind of, I guess you could say, separate meal more of a snack, maybe. A bowl of one container of some kind of Greek yogurt, strawberry, low fat. So two low fat low carbs, two grams of fat, four grams of carbs, 12 grams of protein, about 10 grams of carbs worth of frozen fruit. As well as some low sugar maple syrup, it's really kind of make it a bit of sweet treat. That's sweet calorie, smart treat, that is. I think the whole thing only ended up being about 100 something calories, which for a big bowl like that, that's pretty good deal. I feel pretty well fed, at least given the calories that I'm working with for the whole day. So I'm ready for arms, I'm ready for some try. A blue ratio. I'm going to buy some decimation to be finished off with a cheeky little 60 minutes on the seated bike. Nothing recovered by me, just the kind of regular one. So I think that's all I really get to say. And by just, I'm going to just jump straight to the action. I can tell, uh, sometimes the pre-gim talk is a little, I'm running out of things to say, just a touch. I think I'm really feeling the deficit before I get the pre-work out of the flon, through my veins. And the pump is actually finally complete. But no more jetting. Let's just get straight to arms. I've got a game plan. Two sets of a tricep movement. Two sets of a bicep movement. Two sets of a tricep movement. Back and forth. Back and forth. And maybe a tri-by super set has the finisher. And my logic there is the pump fleets, man. The pump is fleeting, especially, you know, actually let me just pull the real number. I'm not exactly sure how many. But I haven't had, you know, the old school typical 800 grams of carbs. 60 grams of carbs. Well, I want to say as soon as I get my triceps fully pumped, if I did a full bicep lift by the post down, tricep. We're a little bit depleted. So this might just be a little bit of a preference thing. But if I can finish an arm post down, I don't have to be fully pumped. Now, if I'm bolting it's a little different because, you know, you need to get going to do it. But let's start with some rope. Light, not the full stack. 67.5. Good squeeze. And then you go. Yeah. Just... Yeah. Yeah drank. sweating Let's grab some dumb balsh. Good boy! Yeah. Duh. Two more bowls of cake. Ok. Let's do some machine dips next. I think that'll be a good next phase. Oh, well, I had a lot of it's taken. Let's do something though. Not sure what. He's done. Let's go nuts. In a reasonable fashion course. Now you got some dears. You're not supposed to edit. It just won't work together. The other is my partner. Oh crap. Lightish, 25 and a 10. That's super good. Very control. I would not want to do nasty reps here. Just asking for freaking trouble. yes. 10. One more. We've my strength and durability is taking a hit today. Like these are good sets to finish. They're hitting the quick. I'm going to do some classic easy bar push dance next. Let's do some classic easy bar push dance next. Let's stack plus a 25 or such inside. Straight set nothing fancy. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I had to do these. All I feel the need for is one more set of eyes. Let's decide that. Let's do some classic easy bar push dance next. Let's do some classic easy bar push dance next. Let's do some classic easy bar push dance next. Here's the plan. One more set of these push dance. Let's do some classic easy bar push dance next.

This is actually two days from the last lift two days from that last arm day. Yesterday was a rest day and this was, you know, now the day after I'm gonna try and do it legs first. So usually I've been doing cardio session A, wait for some time to pass, lift cardio session B, but with legs I don't really want to wait until after I've done an hour of cardio and not really scarf down a ton of calories. So I did this a couple of, I don't know how many days ago I think it was back, I did it back day earlier in the morning rather than waiting for later into there. So mind the yawning, but that's the approach for this morning. So pre-work I'd not yet consumed, but I'll say that for a little bit closer to the actual ETA to the gym. It's just so it's really kicking in when I'm starting quads and then that's pretty much it. Some walking cardio after, no, no seated bike right after legs. The seated bike is a little bit too quiet heavy in terms of like stimulus and kind of fatigue. But the treadmill, not particularly, well I guess you can say tiresome, but not particularly soreness inducing, which is what I'm aiming for right? I don't need the cardio, it's a V, the tricky part and I want that to be getting more chill. So I do not anticipate that being too tricky to finish because I get episode one of season two of severance to watch. And I know that's like a 45-minute show. So I'll probably try to line it up such that I watch maybe 15 minutes or random BS, be it Instagram or Eels or just like a YouTube video or something and then get that show started a little cardio tip. If you can really get engaged and kind of locked into whatever show or like game your plan on your phone while you're doing it, time does seem to pass faster. I'd say there's most certainly an entertainment effect which offsets the boredom. Typically you're so here, typically associated with low intensity steady state cardio. But in terms of the left it's going to be pretty standard. Sissy squads, leg extensions, maybe some machine leg press superset it with some leg extensions as a pre-exhaust. And then hamstrings, hamstring curls and some Smith-Arty-Eels. Truly other is too it. Maybe a little bit lower on the volume side of things but that's not specifically intentional. I'm just trying to do as many sets as necessary to feel fully fatigued and fully pups, writing my hamps and quads. So if I get that sort of sensation of like completion after four sets of hamstrings and only like five sets of quads, then that'll be the end of it. Because that's all I really need right now. I'm trying to stimulate the muscle, maintain it and peel off that outer fat layer to reveal extra cut striations and veins which are currently being hidden, currently being subdued. And they want out. And I'm talking all the veins and spider webby wood bark striations. They want to be revealed. They want to be seen and they want to be put in the spotlight. So it's have to meet a get rid of this sort of soft blubber layer on the outside and be the be the messenger to deliver those muscular, well, it details. Not that I really think about it that deeply. It's just kind of the funny way to say it. But I think that's all I got to say. I'm going to get myself amptops as a music become caffeinated and let's say, well, for me it's going to be more like 15 minutes. But for you, I'm so happy to hear you. Adductors have been sufficiently warmed up which even though it's not like a massive part, it definitely comes into play. So if I warm them up first, this feels way better. And I'm curving my ego a little bit because instead of doing 200 pounds we're just a full stack. 170 felt a little hefty. So I think it's sweet spots around the middle. No. No my god ohahah Ah, let's算 towards 70, one more. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Let's do some audio sound. I might come back here. But that'll be after... I forgot my straps. That's okay. 80 pando riels... Perfect. Now... Okay. Oh... Ah... Ah... I don't need it. Oh... Back to a curl. I don't need it. Oh... Back to a curl. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay. Yeah... Let's get to quite a start. Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay... I think that's my time. First I'm a Sissy Squad super set. No... Light squeezing double-like light extensions... 10 repsish... Then some body widths... Sissy Squad's... Sissy Squad's... Alright... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Now... Okay... Let's go pose that. Alright... Legs complete... And almost exactly the amount of volume that I had predicted... Except... It was that five sets of both... Either way... Legs are pumped. Now they're not skin splitting pumped like a full, you know... 1000 gram a car a bulk day. But give my current circumstances. I feel pretty good. So let's just see if there's a visual reflection... That matches the sort of the inflated canis feeling. Yep... There you are. Alright... Shoulda weren't shorter shorts now that I... Not actually here but when you have a thick one. And I still work. Ooh... So give a little extra zoom in... Quad only. Yeah, there we go. No... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... They certainly feel pretty freaking cut up. Yeah... That's a pretty good amount of quadra freaking hamstring separation too. And the ham's are as freaking... As they would be un pumped. Kind of cause when you have a hamstring pump... They sort of just... You know... Combine... Individive a blob just for the flationary effect of being pumped up. But... We are definitely on track to freaking something. So for you... Let's get in the car... Head back to the crib. But for me... I am not leaving yet. I've got an hour-long... Mill session. I can tell you one thing... If TikTok gets banned for real... And this isn't all just you know... Rain and Mass talk like it always is... That looks kind of suck. I've got a lot of hype... Edits that I've got saves on the TikTok like one piece and everything else. It's getting me going. I've deleted it off my home train. So I don't use it passively. Like I have at least relegated myself to just... Instagram reels. Which I think is at least a little bit better than bounce in between two... Apps worth of doing scrolling. But... Yeah... During the cardio. If you've got like 30, 30 seconds... Like hype one piece or hype a backier... That can tighten there any other kind of like... You know, a little badass freaking edit. It's a pretty good way to pass the time. I mean, it gets me going for real. So that's how I spent the last 10 minutes on the treadmill. The first 40... 45 issues show. Hmm... Oh... Including five of just a YouTube video. First... That was spent watching the first episode of the... Relatus to season of severance. Very good show. Very freaking good. I'm glad that it just released every episode at once. You know, as much as I may have liked it in the moment... I would have just... I probably would have just watched a whole thing today. And then I'd be freaking screwed at a lot. So... I'm... I'm strongly considering starting to watch last. But I'm kind of in... Like, season three of suits. I just got a... It is ordered that you just got lit up mug on Amazon. Because I just saw that clip, which I thought was pretty funny. But it's like... Six more seasons of the same... You know, this data, the other Harvey Spector, Lewis, whatever. I don't know if I could do it. It's a little too much. I'm... I'm... Spectering myself out. So I think I might... You... Well... Hmm... Hmm... Whatever. I'm sorry, but I'll be honest. I'm gonna start today off freaking nice and girly. It was kind of cool getting to watch the sunrise during the cardio, though. Not something most people get to see. I... I'm kind of... Like, usually I think of myself as a cardio-efficient auto. Right? Because I got the 30 minutes on the regular. Which is definitely more than most people. But I'm up there in like the top... Something percentile in terms of... Clock to hours of cardio, of at least the last like... Month-ish. I think it's been... I can go back and check the pictures, but I think it's been just about a month. That I've been doing the two hours of cardio per day. Phew! That's a lot, man. It's a freaking lot. But... I mean... I'm not trying to dog you on you. I'm sure you probably spend more than two hours just... Playing on your phone anyway. I know I do. So it's not like I'm really adding anything to the schedule. I'm just kind of turning one mindless task... Sitting around playing on my phone, which is not even a task. Into... Now a little bit of a multi-sask in the situation, right? And of course it takes some effort. I'm not using the cardio. It's not like completely zero... You know, 100% easy, whatever. But it's not really the hardest thing in the world. The hardest thing isn't even actually doing it. It's just going to do it. Because once you've already made a trip to the gym to do your cardio... I mean the success rate of that mission has now increased dramatically. I mean I'd say the success rate of guys where they just say to themselves... Alright, I better maybe have to drive to the gym later if you cardio. Or tomorrow morning and we need to cardio. Yeah, tomorrow morning I'll do it. The success rate of that thought... Pretty low. I think it's definitely sub-25% in kind of thinking that a lot of people think that to themselves. And then the time comes and they say, ask, screw. But the percentage that do make it to the car and actually do head over to the gym. They get their shoes on, they get their headphones, they get their phone, they get their... They're energy drinks sitting right next to them or whatever. By then the success rate is at least 80% you know. So it's not really an issue of maintaining the momentum of actually going. It's just getting that momentum started. Because even if I feel like total trash, even if I'm tired, I'm sleepy, it takes me a second before I even walk into the gym to do a workout because I'm like... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Which sometimes I definitely do feel. I mean, not every one of these cardio sessions goes by extremely easily. Especially the morning ones. Like I think it was maybe two or three morning cardio sessions ago. It took me a minute to really get up and get my shoes on. You know, maybe not as serious as like the David Goggins scenario where he's like... I don't want to put my motherfucking shoes on. I don't want to get up and run out there, man. You know, however he says it, not that serious of course. But definitely took a second, right? But I know that I want to do my cardio, or I guess really. I know that I want the results that doing my cardio is going to give me. So if that's the case, then it's simply a balance of, you know, a balance of desires. And my desire for those gains, or at least the progress that the cardio is going to give me, is just strong enough that at outweighs my desire to go back to bed, put my blanket back on and say, I'm going to sleep. Even though that would be all, it would feel so nice. You know, it feels so good. It just cozy back up and dead. Don't worry, it's so warm in here. Nothing cool, or at least nothing worthwhile happens when you're cozy up onto the covers and you're scrolling in screen rails. Nobody ever did anything cool like that. Now it's a nice to come back to. And frankly, going out and doing your cardio or lifting and having a good workout, just having a good day in general, if you know you killed it, at least in some degree, then when you come back and you do get to chill, it's even more enjoyed. Because you kind of earned it in a sense, you know. So, all I'm trying to say there, get you free because you're a shot of this here. So, I am sure that I'm going to take a nap after my post-workout meal of some cubed top-round steak, as well as probably some frozen mixed berries in a little bowl on the side, with some yogurt. And then the real battle begins because for me to do all this cardio and to work out, even when I'm feeling a little extra weak and a little thorgic, that's not really the challenging part. Like that's, I'm enough of a gym-rat where that's like, that's just a given. You know, that's regular daily activities I'm working on. It's the calorie restriction, that's the variable that's taking the most effort on my end. But not rocket sites, not freaking rocket sites. Simply making sure that I don't exceed my limits. And then with the extra free time and I have to eat so much food and prep everything you just sit here with the full stomach. I'm getting clean. I got a straight-in-a-malfe as a bit more, I'm getting some junk and old boxes and stuff, but I got a shelf to put up as well. Yeah, I should probably do that today too. So, plan for the rest of the day, do a little bit of house cleaning, clean up all my dishes and the same can everything else feed the cats. They, yeah, crap, they don't have breakfast yet. It's not a clock, they're probably freaking. Well, this is about their breakfast time, but I know that they're feeding for it for sure. So, then it's all that. Go back to the apartment gym later tonight. Do another hour cardio, probably a combination of seated bike and the treadmill. And then just keep going from there, right? Goodness. Every day, a little bit leaner than the day before, that's kind of my current state right now. And it's not the most noticeable, you know, jumps in leanness from a day by day basis. Really, it's negligible. I don't wake up one day, you know, pounds upon pounds or percentages upon percentages leaner than it was the day prior. But, over the course of a month, pretty drastic changes. I mean, look at a go back to even just scrolling through the thumbnails, like look at the last day, there's the last days of the Bolton phase, to like halfway through this kind of dining phase. To now, I mean, it's only been like three and a half months. Or, it's not even that. It's barely, it's not even been three and a half months. Yeah, it's only been three months and like, well, now yeah, it's about three and a half months. But, it's pretty drastic. So, even though it's slow, it is steady. And steady is smooth and smooth as fast, so really, it's gone by pretty fast. But, oh, that's to say, if you're in a deficit currently, or if you're getting yourself amped up to start a deficit, then you're kind of like on the crap, I don't know if I'm going to really pull the trigger on this thing, man. You know, it's winter time. I want to be Bolkin, that, pick one. The worst decision you could make is in decision in terms of if you want to bulk up or cut down. Because too many lifters I feel are just plateaued and trapped in a state of maintenance. You know, they're just staying the same size, the same strength, the same everything. And it's like, if you're coming to the gym every day anyway, you only have to add a little bit more effort to tip the scales into some vector of progress, be it bulking up the more cutting down. So, slip a coin, hedge your bulk tails, you cut and odds are, once that coin is actually in the air, you're going to know which one you really want to do because you're going to get lean towards, lean towards whichever one you actually have a sub, sub-conscious preference for. But whichever one you do, if you can stick to it for long enough and adjust accordingly, depending on what scale reads, and I can guarantee at the end of it, you'll at least be able to say, alright, I may substitute it rather than just basically fast forwarding the next three months, and being in these X-AIMs watches that you work. That's the worst thing you could do is just become stagnantly trained. That's why I really like the bulk enough you can down because I'm always headed towards a specific goal, and it's very tangible and direct. Like, I know I want to lean right now, and I know in a few months I'm going to want to get bigger and bulkier. So, it's, I get kind of the best of both worlds you've learned back and forth. But I think that's all I got to say. I ain't ready to eat something, take a, take a mid-ish. Well, I don't know. Sometimes if I take a nap when I'm dieting, then it's hard for me to sleep at night, and I end up being a little more restless. But either way, I know I'm going to feel my legs tomorrow. So I think that's all I got to say. I will see you for what I hope to be a rather freaking chess day tomorrow.

Maybe I should have uh... maybe I should have gone back and called this leaner by the day instead of winter shred of thundered. Maybe save a little reference title for the next diving phase. But focusing on here and now I've got two goals, at least two um... you know, overarching goals for this excursion. Number one, get a chest bump. Number two, finish my cardio afterward. This is the uh... this is the first session of the day. I am... I've kind of been like in doing the lift with the cardio first. Like you know, have breakfast of course, don't do a fasted, weight-based workout. I probably wouldn't recommend that. And then doing cardio on its own, or doing the cardio only session later at night. Because it's like... well, I'm waiting for you know. The day is gonna be hard enough just making sure I don't, you know, over grub. So the longer I can be, actually, you know, use my hands, do something. It makes a little easier to stick to this freaking deficit. But yeah, nothing too crazy in terms of heft. I'm not talking three plates, Smith, I'm not talking four plate barbell. I'm talking cables, machine press, and a variety of flies. Maybe even some pectic. There is certainly room for some pectic action as well. I'll have to think about it. But we'll just have to see here. So it shouldn't take too long either. When we frankly, the rate at which I'm gonna get fully kind of pumped and fatigued. It's a lot quicker when you're not, you know, rolling around with a million grams of carbs, fats, and proteins on the daily. So I can tell but it's kind of a hit like set five or six, like... The workout's over. And it's not in an arbitrary sense of like I hit a certain set number or workout or whatever. It's really just, I need a certain level of kind of fatigue and activation and workload that I know I've reached. And then that's my cue to say, alright, I've stimulated my chest as much as I can. No point to do anymore. And bulking up or cutting down, that's still the approach. So I'll still do as many hard sets as I can do. What do we need in five thousand calories a day? And usually I end up doing more sets more reps, more weights because I've got more energy in my disposal. And be it so full of food, never think else. But the approach is the same. As many hard sets as I can do until I feel like I'm fully fatigued, fully pumped. And essentially I'll be able to say, looking back over the whole workout. I did it. That was good. Some stimulative work has been completed. Now it's a good chill. Or in this case, now I get to go do my extra cardio. Which, yeah, you did your cardio today, right, too? Yeah, I know you did. You would, you'd never lie to me. That's for sure. But I think nothing else to discuss. This is going to make it just a happy. Let's start off like bent over, can of, well, a little bit of lower chest focus. But I'm not only feeling my lower pecks because when I bend over, I mean, it turns into more of like a, in front of body fly. But it is going to be slow controlled with a good squeeze. And I do some pumpish like partial reps at the end. But I think this will be a perfect start for today. It's just enough. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, crap. One more. None of them. No. No. No. Yeah. No, yeah. Oh, one more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Let's pick up our ass. Those were perfect. We're hoping sets though. Not too heavy. Just heavy enough. Straight machine pressed. Yeah. Do. One more. Yeah. Okay. There's not much left. But let's go back to the tour that I'm sure. I think I've got super self style idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. One more. No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more. No. Not one more thing to go. This one would be a little different. I'm going to pre-exhaust the peck deck. Then finish with some bento bar cable flies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh. That hit me the harder than expected. Let's find some lighting. We're done with chest at least. So that did not take too freaking long. Three sets of light squeezing cable flies followed by two sets of machine chest press followed by one set of cable chest press and then a fly base super set. Seven sets. That's pretty much what I'm freaking aim at for. So let's just see what kind of pump resulted. If you don't want to turn it to the right. It's an important challenge for the day for 50. But on the low side, but I'd rather be low than high because now I guess you go home and have a pretty substantial size post workout meal. It really sucks for me to have to limit the calories later in the day. It's much easier for me to just kind of, you know, weight to open the fludgits. stomach and it is to try to go bad hungry. It's creepy to that down just to touch and we go. Now we're working on something. Tip You the I told you real good about Click yell Don't ask its god food. Shownong Saturday The Allığını Well, all that to say, I feel pumped. The amount of skin or like, you know, it's a lot of I can grab onto is getting pretty close to the lowest that's ever been to form me on my front side. Size for sure. I mean, that's a pretty decent amount of abdominal, whatever. But there's still room to lean out, do not worry. So that's kind of the plan for the next couple of weeks. So, so you can jump right on to it. That's good to have some cardio on. Bifched dead. That was a good one. It was a reasonable freaking chest day if I have ever seen one. And for being flat, low carb, that's still felt like a pretty bloodful, low-end skin stretch and pump. Of course, not as crazy as, you know, a 275 pound bulked pump, but it's just different. Right? Not better or worse. Being extra lean versus being extra bulked, just kind of with a certain set of pros and cons, that's for free, sure. But given that I've been nice and strict with my calorie of take so far, I get my very large postwork at meal. So I get really good nuts. At least in terms of not having to feel like I'm scraping around the bottom of the barrel. So a plan is I'm thinking, well, I definitely got to finish off the cubed stakes that got sitting in a little Tupperware that'll make up about 40 grams of protein. So that free cheese, barbecue sauce, sugar-free of course. And then I'll just have to see. I don't just have to see. All these meals are really protein-focused. I mean, I'm never eating anything where the primary macro nutrient is more than the protein. Even just now, I stepped at the Venetian Greengrass, a little pack of beef jerky. I'm not because I'm trying to jump start my metabolic window, my amino acid. But you can't just get that hungry for it. So that adds up to two grams. That's four grams of carbs, and of six grams of carbs, 13 grams of protein. And every time I grab something, every time I'm eating anything, every time I'm having a little snack or rule, a little whatever, it's got to be tracked. It's got to be accounted for. And the reason why I'm going to say to be so strict like that is because if you're not, these numbers fall through the cracks, and the scale will reflect that. Not only that, because sometimes the scale isn't always an indication of your fat loss and your progress, especially as beginner lifter, like re-comping. If you've never worked out before, and you start doing a real, like pretty stringent consistent work at routine, you're going to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time, to an extent. Now that's not like a perpetual state, of course, but it's something that's taken into consideration. So the scale isn't always an indicator of your progress. That's where it's looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing, okay, how am I looking visually? Can someone as being another sort of important vector to watch your progress from? But yeah, I don't think I've ever looked at myself in the mirror, unpumped with this many quad veins before, which is pretty cool for me to be able to say. So I'll get a, got about another two-ish months of being able to joy be in this lean, and then the floodgates will open. But I don't even want to think about that. That'll be for, it'll be for far into the distant future as far as I'm concerned. So playing for the rest of the night, and at this video, post it because I'm on a, I'm not on like a one-day delay. If you're watching this the day, post it at the night, I just did this work out like an hour ago. So tomorrow's video will be a little bit of a follow along to the cardio in the morning to get back on my regular sort of upload style schedule. But we not much else to say. I was talking with some of the guys in there, how about they're getting ready to start spamming some TikTok, trying to get some, and I had some TikToks, some Instagram reels, get the fitness going. I was trying to give them some inspiration, first and little, a little quotes to say. Like imagine if a imagine if a gym had a battle pass that you could actually get it, unlock achievements with, I'm sure we'd see a very different, populous, at least in terms of the younger, can't look characters. But this would be the last time I reference this for at least a couple of days and I'll try to get too repetitive. But with the cardio, man, I know you've got hours spent on your phone doing jack. You know, even if you're not doing jack and you're actually doing some kind of whatever like researching, I say researching, I go and down at you to rabbit hole. It doesn't matter what it could be. Coupling that with some cardio-based activity, not the hardest thing in the world. I'd really freaking recommend it. I just, I just ordered a little stepper, or not a treadmill, a step like a walk, mill on Amazon is a good 50% off thing, so it was like 110 bucks. A little scrappy and I'm getting close to the, to the recommended weight limit of it, but I'm going to see how that works later for tonight. Because I mean, all I need to do is three miles an hour for the hour. So if that, if that works, that will be a little bit of a boost for my routine. Because even though I've got the apartment gym that's close by, it's still a trip to go somewhere to do the cardio. So if you're going to have the cardio equipment at your house, like right there, separate room. I mean, as soon as you wake up, slam an energy, drink, slam a coffee, whatever your thing is. If you're trying to be a little more cost efficient, it gets caffeine capsules. Four cents for 200 milligrams of caffeine compared to like the two bucks that you might be spending on an energy drink. That's a, that's a little Gary V style caffeine hack there. But that's my, that's my sort of idea. So if I've got the treadmill right there, that I can get my ass onto it without even really being fully awake yet. And then those first 10 minutes are really go by like nothing because I won't even, uh, let's still be in the process of waking up. But all that's to say is more cardio, less calories, more leanness. It's hard to argue with that logic, that's for sure, good sure. But tomorrow's going to be a wide back day. Hope we can see some new veins, striations and everything else. But I'm actually looking at back pumps as I get leaner, not as cool as looking at back on pumps. And the reason I say that is because like with a full on back pump, the details of like my lower back in my Christmas tree and the lat tiny and all the fibers, they kind of get lost once they, you know, my back really gets pumped up because the act of pumping up a muscle like that. I mean, sometimes it almost takes away detail. Now it depends on the muscle. A chest pump versus chest un-pumped. I am a pig chest pump every time. But it was something like back in even quad sometimes at hamstrings for sure. And it triceps the little. It's like as they get pumped up all the detail and you know potential feathering and things like that. They start to kind of get lost. So something I consider. I'm really looking forward to the arm day after tomorrow's back day in terms of seeing how my back is looking like lower back, striations, everything else because back double by with an arm pump. That's where it's at. That is where it's at for free, good sure. I think that's all you gotta say. Highly successful chest day with an hour cardio. 30 minutes on like a little bit of a seated kind of elliptical looking thing. And then 30 minutes on a seated bike. Sometimes doing a full hour on one piece of equipment gets a little bit repetitive. So changing up like that is at least it makes it a little bit more interesting because instead of sitting in one place for an hour, that will always sit still for 30 minutes. And then, you know, calm me crazy. But I think this is my it's definitely my fifth. It might even be my seventh time re-watching breaking bad. And I tell you something. I'm not gonna say it gets better every time, but it definitely does not get freaking worse. You know that's uh if you're curious about my thoughts there, I'd say breaking bad is pretty much an ester show. You know, I've still got to watch the wires, they're gonna watch Game of Thrones, they're gonna watch Lost, still got to watch walking dead, still I'm all sorts of stuff. But breaking bad is up there. It's uh and I would say that's pretty uncontested take for sure. But that's uh that's what's gonna be keeping me company for the rest of these hours of cardio, at least until I finish it and then I've got to pick something else. But I think that's all I have man. So I will see you for a back date tomorrow.

There we go. I'm beginning to suspect that an hour of cardio post workout immediately on the regular hour including the hour of cardio in the morning might be a bit too much. I'm starting to think that I might be creeping myself into over fatigious. And I'm sure someone is going to say, you got damn my talent. Telling you that the whole time. You might be right. But there's a certain value I feel in terms of basically every angle of working out where you know, there is like, okay, this is what everybody says to do. But then there's the knowledge of, okay, I've actually tried this. I've gone through the process of doing this and these were the results that I got. And then adjusting from there. Because what is a study, right? What is a work at a study? It's simply having a couple of guys, you know, more than a couple, but having a handful of whoever, you some shit and then analyzing the results. Why would you not approach your own training with the same mentality of trying things out for yourself, seeing what happens, and then adjusting from there? Because then this isn't a random control group where you need all sorts of different, you know, variables, whatever to come up with a random, like it's an actual, you know, amount of data, which you now can apply to your own training because it's your thing, right? So as far as I'm concerned with all the work and out, the guys who really make it, the guys who, I don't mean make it, the guys who really learn how to kill it are the ones who just adjust their training based on, like, okay, I think this is going to work. I'm going to try this for a few months. I'm going to look at my results and objectively say, All right, have I made progress or have I not? Have I been actually dieting and getting leaner or have I, you know, been having a few too many handfuls of cheese, it's every day, like little things like that. So that's where I think there's a real value when it comes to just straight up, trying new stuff and seeing what happens. But yeah, I think I might tone it back on the cardio just to touch. Because I'm trying to balance two things, you know, like higher energy expenditure every day, right? Burning more calories, doing more cardio with lower calorie intake, right? Bless food. And there's kind of a sweet spot because you don't want to completely starve yourself and then just do no cardio. Like I see a lot of comments like that, where it's, why would I do more cardio if I could just eat less food, right? And there is some value of the argument, but like what are you supposed to do? Each 1500 calories, you know, like totally starve yourself. But then on the other side of things, you're never going to be doing six hours of cardio, right? So somewhere is a little bit of a sweet spot, which depending on the guy, I mean, you might just have to freak it find out. But the hour in the morning, I don't think that's the problem. I think I'm going to go back to my 30 minutes post workout and then no cardio post legs. I definitely think that that might be adding to some of my, you know, some of my perceived exertion, because after a leg damage, a full on hour cardio definitely hits reasonably freaking hard. That is, it's undeniable. But playing for right now, with back, go nuts. I'm talking pull downs, I'm talking rose, I'm talking pullovers, and then everything in between in a couple of different ways. And by the time it's all over, I can guarantee I will have some veins creep in a cross, the side of me creep in a cross at the top to the bottom of me, lower back, your rectors, everything else fancy like that. Assuming I can find some cool lighting, and then 30 minutes on the seat of bike instead of a full on hour, come back home, have some more, have the last half pound of steak that I cooked in the, I'm a table top oven, 400 degrees for just about, I think, 25 minutes, maybe 30 minutes. I'm not really sure the time because I cooked it with, I just put a meat thermometer in one of them, and I left it until it was at, well, I wanted to catch it at 127, but I just played it like following a little bit too long, pull them out when the inside is at about 130. So a little bit more done than I would have liked, but it's still pretty good. And even with no sear, that's kind of the way to do it. I've been such a suvi fan for a while, obviously, the tenderness was there. I think I've been away some time, plus with all the frigging microplastic talks. It might not be the best idea to friggin' boil all these meats and steaks, anything else in the ziplocks, go a little bit more simple with just the convection-based cooking. But I think that's all I gotta say. Before the top of the next hour, I am ready to have a freaky back pump check. So let's just stop talking about it and go make it happen. Let's get straight to business. A heavy, fast, ish, hard set of pull downs. Nothing fancy, no five-second eccentric, what I'm really trying to maximize is my effort on this one. And later down the line of this lift, I'll have some slower, more controlled sets. One more, that was sad. Oh, minimum. And don't be afraid to do a hard set, man. Like that was good. I consider that good stimulation. One more, as a drop set though. All right, let's row something. Good luck starters. Five more to be in too much. Let's see four for this section. That's a good set though. Let's see what we have to do. The seat of rows over there. Oh, that was good. No need for a drop set. Let's do kind of a typical back finisher, which hopefully he already know what it is, but without me saying it. So we can pose down. This is a good back day. Pumped and a jazz. This is right. There are slightly different normal with sort of an easy bar instead of my normal two long de-handles. But this will work too. So I want a big, large stretch up here. And then a good mid-trap full back squeeze at the bottom as I lean back into the flex position. This flex position. Back complete. That's why it's a mere space, God dang it. All right. And with that, back is freaking complete. So let's get a little through the shirt, last sprint, get a little teaser of what we're working with. And then jump straight to the main course. That's a width. That means some freaking width for sure. So let's see how I really like it. I'd post some of the posing routine and stuff, but I kind of wanted to be a little bit of a surprise. So I'm not really going to knock it off a spoiler. Apart from these sort of, you know, more pump check looking chat to here. But we are definitely working with something. Maybe make sure I'm right in the center. Oh yeah. Oh my goodness. Yeah. All this freaking cardio is adding up. This is definitely the most interesting. My lower back has ever looked. Let me get a little bit more right in the line right here. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, see? I can hold a pose, especially a last sprint. I mean, I could sit here for freaking ever. The tricky ones are why I got to sit here in the front. And I really want to keep my waist in control. You know, because even if I'm taking the breath, I don't want my abs to get deflexed. You know what I'm saying there. But let's, let's run through a few more and get rid of the roll. No, I get it. Oh yeah. Oh, that'll be good. So plan for you. Let's jump to the car. Plan for me. Pop a squat on the cardio bike. And only 30 minutes. I feel like I'm taking an easy on myself. But I have said this before. So I'm kind of quoting myself here. I'd rather go too far than not far enough. And I think I, I'd like that sentiment with basically all the training, you know, because I think we're all pretty much well freaking aware. The harder you go, the more results that you will freaking get, right? The more cardio you do, odds are the better your cardio is going to get. The leaner you'll be able to get if you're trying to die it down. The harder that you train, the more effective the training you see on the B, the better results you're going to get. The structure you can do with your diet. And I don't even mean strict in the sense of like no treats. I mean even just strict in terms of like tracking everything and getting a grasp of like what kind of role dieting even has to play. In terms of returning, it's like they're the only reward that you get from taking it easy is the fact that in the moment it's easier. Right? I mean how much easier would it be for me to sit around and do every set that I just did in this workout at half that intensity? Or even like 30% net intensity. And it happens. Like it really pains me to say it and it really hurts for me to see it. But I see junk volume freaking every day, you know? And I'm not, not everybody has to be a freaking like bodybuilder, Jim Rath freak. Obviously not. But if you want results and then you basically just catch yourself slack enough and don't do anything about it, then it kind of sounds like you don't really want those results, you know? And I think that's such a silly and like classic phrase. Like I hate when people say it sounds so pretentious. Here's their go. You don't want to bad enough. But on a real context, like not, I'm trying that to be as meat-headish and lunkish as possible. It's like, the groundwork of gains as complicated as people make it. It's really as simple as diet, training, recovery. So if you can get these three in line or at least up your percentage of like effort and efficacy in a way, I'll have each of them even by a little. And by that I just mean like get a few hours more sleep on average. Drink a few more gallons of water on average, right? Just have a jug of like a freaking get a red zero or something. That still counts as water, man. That's going to add to your fluid and take for sure, as much as people are going to dog on the the sucralose and the ascertain, right? That's whatever floats your boat. And it's like, with the training too, it really turns me off when guys are having such huge back and forth like this. Back and forth like video arguments of reps and reserve and different training styles. You know the training style, it's going to be the best results. The one that you go the hardest with. So like the logic of like, oh should I leave four reps in reserve or should I do five reps in reserve? Or should I do high reps or low reps or high intensity and low frequency or high volume or like dude? I'm not going to say it doesn't matter, but you can take two guys and give them completely different workouts for three months. You give one guy this training routine, give the other guy this training routine. Let's say this has like doubled the volume of sets, but every set is like five reps in reserve. So the overall like workload is even. You know who's going to make the freaking most results? The dude who just trained the hardest and like wanted it the most and wanted to like, exert his will onto every set more powerfully than the other guy. And I know it's like it gets into the cheesiness and kind of a corny like the cornball factor motivation when guys are, you know, doing all the self help like motivation like, oh, do self accountable. But there's a reason why it's corny and cheesy. It's because it gets said so much because it's true. I mean, cliches are cliches because they've got a ton of freaking value so much so that they get over said and repeated to a blivower. You know, so all that's to say is I went stress it so much as like, okay, should I do a 10 second mezzo repy centric triple drop set or, I think you can pick a weight, go hard, get amped up to some attack and trying to opening theme songs, get a pump and go home, man, you know, and then improve your training slowly from there. But I can tell I'm getting into a little bit of a rant. I bet I'm trying to distract myself from doing my cardio. No, no more talking. Let me quit distract him. I'm only going to the bike. I, yeah. So I was about to say that was the quickest 30 minutes of cardio in my freaking life because I've been used to the 60. But also, kind of laughing on this, looking at the comments from the cardio video that I posted yesterday. So I took a rest day two days ago before legs. So the day of the last leg day video, I just recorded that and then posted it on the same day. Usually all this stuff suddenly go one day to leg. So to get back on track of like lift, record it, post it the next day. I recorded the cardio this morning and I didn't say check. I recorded was me sitting on the bike for the hour, pedaling, and then that was it. A little ASMR style. It's kind of funny. But now what you're going to do is get back to the crib. Not spill it, which is something to consider. If you're in the, I don't know if there's a specific name for it. Let's just say the mid, the kind of northeast side of things. It's getting snowy. Rather freaking snowy. We're just cool for me. I like this snow. I'm not talking door and he eats, trudging through it for an hour to get to the dungeon gym, of course. But it makes it nice. If it's going to be cold, I want it to be like scenic, we cold. You know what I'm saying? But style of back day, style of back pump. And I've got a full stomach full of food too. Yeah, I think I might do the arm day tomorrow with the morning cardio. So do arms and cardio early. Just to kind of get a glimpse of a empty stomach kind of post down. Because it really is something to take into consideration. Like not only is your weight going to be different later on of the day, but your midsection too, man. I mean, if you need a good chunk of food, even if it's lower calorie, you still get some food, your stomach. So something to consider, if you want to take some sort of posing shots, maybe in the morning, fast and post cardio with a little bit of extra kind of cardio-conduced pump. That might be your best bet. But either way, back you can come along nicely, waste tapering down, and more vein, and some kind of sensations and little separations are just coming slowly, but freaking, surely. So now all you gotta do is go home and chill. It needs a food, not over-eat, of course, which is definitely easier, set than done, and then that'll be it. So I'm getting excited for tomorrow's arm day. I'm definitely going to do it a superset style. Try-sipset biceps, try-sipset biceps, so I finish arms with a complete arm pump, which I'm kind of most concerned with right now, because when I'm bulking up, many crazy amount of food, I mean, I'm pumped for a while. If I finish my chest day and then drive home for 20 minutes, I'm still kind of pumped, at least like reasonably, from that whole period of time, because of full, you know, full of carbs and glycogen and everything else, freaking, circle plasm, but died it down, and those glycogen stores are a little bit lower, a little bit more depleted and flat. I could be fully pumped, and then 15 minutes of chat and goes by, what happened? Where'd all my blood go? And maybe not that seriously, but something to take in consideration, and even just in general, sometimes I feel kind of bad when I'm working out with some guys that I'm buddies with, because I've got a habit of chatting when I'm dead. When my lift is complete, I do not mind hanging out, kind of bouncing around, falling, falling, whoever doing their lift, chatting with them, between their sets. A little hypocritical, because I don't really like that. When I'm working out, I want to be working out, and kind of just chatting on my own pace. But, yeah, trying out to get caught. Because if you're mid-chast, you know, let's say your foreset's deep, you got another three or four heart sets left, and then, you know, somebody grabs you, and they're really, they're really holding onto you, like not letting you sort of escape. You've taken your few steps backward, your hand is on the machine, you're about to use, sometimes you just got to start the set, man. You know, it's as tricky as in my sound, just a, you know, quick little put up pin in it. All right, let me have my set, and I want to hear more, and get back to it. Because I mean, five minutes, when it comes to rest periods, like, like, how bounce around? You know, some days I'll have a little quicker pace lift. Like, today it was definitely a little faster pace, especially on the sets that were on the same machine. Like, between those sets of hold-outs, maybe a minute, a minute, a half or so, and then a little longer when I have to move, pick a new machine, loads of new weights, but five minutes, you know, it depends on your state, of course, because obviously, when I'm bolted up doing like squats or leg press, I'm in the set for a few minutes. Like, five minutes to reoxygenate, and can't let get myself back together to do another one. That's a bit more normal, right? But regular kind of sets, you know, your regular working sets, nothing too, like dramatic, you know, central nervous system, destroying like squats or leg press or anything like that. Then I probably wouldn't want to exceed more than kind of two and a half. Just because, not for any arbitrary kind of reason, but by the time I've caught my breath, I can tell that whatever muscle I just hit is ready for another hard set. That's usually my cue to hit another, you know, some guys like having a timer, I see some dudes, they got their phone out, it's like, okay, set is over, lap the time, okay, 45 seconds. Do another one. Which is totally cool. I mean, if that's your approach and you give yourself like a minute rest, and then you're doing a set right then, as long as you still take that set to failure, like, I mean, you're cool. Whatever constraints you give yourself for the workout, like, okay, I want to do one minute rest periods, a little bit faster pace workout. Let's go. Okay, I want to give myself one like two and a half minutes, really try to, you know, up the intensity of each set, let myself recover a little bit more, between, that's kind of the main differentiator between, like, a higher volume, and like, a higher intensity, quote unquote, workout, could potentially just be the rest periods, but as long as you're overall effort is there, then you're good, you know, if you can leave the gym or during your post-down, you can tell just by like, you're subjective feeling of whatever you just worked, like, okay, I pushed it, I'm pumped. I know I pushed it. And I didn't leave that much in the tank. You're golden. Nine out of ten times, if you can say you pushed it, even if some of your preparation was off, even if you didn't get as much sleep as you may wanted, you were potentially a little underfed, under hydrated. If each lift for the most part, right, above on average, you know you actually pushed it, then things are just going to start to fall into place, you know? Like, as much value as there is, and really trying to optimize your routines and everything else, who's going to get better results? The guy who just kills it on the regular, or the guy who's a little bit more lackluster, but he's, you know, doing the most scientifically studied and, you know, currently optimize routine that there ever was, but not going as hard. And I don't mean to say that those two situations can't overlap, right? Obviously, just train really hard, and use the most up to date science. You know, some guys really love to optimize it like that, and keep up with all the newest literature and everything else, and there's no dog and all that. That's what gets them excited, because you want to work on optimize your routine, improving it, and you want to do it in such a way that it's interesting for you. And fun. Yes, I'm in complete freaking agreement, you know? Like, working out if you can't have fun with it, and you can't feel like you're working at it, because you want to, and it feels like a chore, what are the odds you're going to keep doing it, you know? There is no necessity of working out, at least none that really is going to force you to do it, like a regular kind of chore, you know? Like, unless you're in high school, when your mom's doing your laundry for you, if you're doing it on your own, you've got to do your laundry, you've got to do your dishes, you've got to keep everything reasonably clean, and those are the chores you have to do, right? If you want to keep yourself in a reasonable kind of living environment, you know? But there's no force that makes you work out. Now, later on down the line, you're probably going to regret it if you didn't have a work to everything, and everybody's been there. But in the moment, there is no driving force apart from your own desire to go to the gym of work out, to make you do it. You know, we don't have like a social credit score based thing, where you get extra points for exercise, or hours, clock, of cardio. Now, do I think that would be a good idea? Potentially so, more certainly, but that's not even getting any kind of social, or fitness credit score kind of kind of, kind of talks now. But it really is the situation where it's like, if you can have fun with what you're doing, you're going to go harder. So, whether you want to work out a little more gruntish, keep it basic, curls, barbell, cable, everything else, like, you know, don't over-complicated with all sorts of fancy kind of sets, and just focus on your overall, Brent, you know, horse cock and Eric Boog and Hagen style, effort, bad freaking ass, or if you want to approach things a little bit more methodically and be able to explain the reason and why you're doing every set in a very particular kind of fancy pants, sort of way, and still, kill it, then you're going. But the killing at portion, that's ubiquitous. It's kind of the equalizer of all routines and approaches to physical training, you know, because there really is no getting around the harder you go, the better you'll do. And that's with anything. So, next time you're next time you're dogging on somebody for doing a set where it's maybe not your exact company, but see, you're a, you know, you're a more ego-lifterish kind of, you know, hard, heavy, whatever, and you're watching a guy do a, like a slow, eccentric set of something. Do not look at that and think, oh, that's a stupid, that's a stupid style of set of rules. Because if the guy kills it and goes to legit failure, and you can tell, and that's a bad set. And vice versa, you know, if you're a little bit more, you know, you can't end up shirt tucked in with a bow tie, kind of young, young, young style with your training. And you watch a dude do a little bit of swinging, you know, potentially body language style set of, like, easy bar curls, but same situation. I think the guy's actually killing it. He's going to failure. He's got his body helping him with some assisted reps at the end. Even if the set is a little bit more nasty, and not exactly your forte, if the effort is there, there's nothing to dog on. It's simply a, you know, a disagreement of approach. But the guys who go to the hardest, the most consistently. And guess what, they're going to be the biggest, or they're going to be the least, or they're going to be whatever vector progress that we're aiming for, because overall, time, times, effort, equals, gains. Now, you know, time, consistent time, right, lifting on the regular. But, I'm getting out there, you go hard, and if you ever catch yourself slack, and give yourself sort of proverbial slap on the wrist, and think, what the, what the frick man, what the frick are you doing, come on, get real. And then, that is probably a good time for a F-bomb, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to reduce those. I definitely try to reduce the F-bombs. But, I think that's all I gotta say. I can tell I'm running low on blood sugar, not in a dangerous kind of way, but maybe just a little bit of a brain foggy, just kind of way, so, time to get a meal in me, shower off, go to bed, fall on a sleep to a true crime documentary. I love, I've been going through those, like freaking, well, you go and say it. So, either way, I'll see for arms tomorrow.

Alright, I've got two descriptors for this lift with some post-lift cardio, or at least the day that it's being done on, and it is bright and freaking cold. I'm talking a nice cool six degrees, not Celsius either. I'm talking, I'm talking freedom units, Fahrenheit. So usually the glasses during the video, I can't feel like a chump, but I got to be able to see here. It's getting hit with those UV rays a little too hard. But, plan for arms, a little bit more of a simple lift, because this is a little more of a simple gym. Cables, dumbbells, not so many of uh, not so many of the works with like, dip machines or anything fancy like that, but it's mean really. If you give me a cable set up and adjustable one where I can actually move the handle up and down, a reasonably or even just like a normal weighted stack, I mean, I'm basically set, you know, like I wouldn't want only that sort of equipment of my disposal, like forever, you know, like a freaking, uh, preacher bench, I do want to kind of bounce around there. But, anytime I've had like a hotel gym lift or anything like that, where all I had access to was some cables, even just a basic de-handle. I first single arm push downs and single arm curls. I mean, it's pretty much perfect because that's really all you're picking arms you're doing. You know, I mean, obviously I want to get an overhead stretch on my tricep regular style loading with a, you know, like a normal push down, some kind of spreading kind of work with like a rope, dipping action. Like all those are definitely hitting your triceps in different ways for sure. But, I mean, biceps, I would say they're way simpler here to here with load, of course. So, of course, you can buy a different portions and, you know, have more of a stretch focus lift with like a preacher or more of a squeeze focus set with like a cable curl. But for the most part, I mean, you're really just going through that motion with load and that's on your bicep. No, so you're trying to set me up. No, because it can't really tell the difference on like muscle fiber by fiber basis of like holy crap. This guy's hitting me with a preacher curl. He's freaking shocking the muscle here. I've never felt this kind of stimulation before, you know, not so much, right? So what I'm getting at is not to say, don't change it up. Don't do different movements. But, I apologize. This is the first sort of excursion of the day. But if all you've got access to is some simple ship, it doesn't mean that your gains are now limited, man. I mean, I had, I've gone through, I don't know about years at a time, but like, you know, month long, stints back at home, especially kind of right around 2020 COVID sort of era, whatever, when everything was closed and all those working out with was set of dumbbells. I had a rack in the basement with weights in an adjustable bench. So definitely better than most, I think in terms of the home gym, stock,ness, which I was definitely spoiled with. But the cable just an overhead thing where you tie weights to the bottom and sort of work it like this. And I mean, those were some of my best freaking lifts, not to say they're, you know, magically better than the ones I do now. But they were just good. I hit the muscles I was taking my nap, stimulated growth, got to poke, have to try to keep the pre-work out. And then the lighting was actually kind of freaky down there too because I put these sort of LEDs strip lights, like all in a row, right in the middle. So I wanted to say I got to go back there for, you know, parents home, gym style lift for next arm day. If anything, just for the stout just sick. But as long as your curl and hard and you're pushing down hard and you've finished your day with a good arm pump, I tell you in the brain, man. You didn't. So that's where I'm more concerned with how hard are the sets that you're doing, rather than what exact sets are you doing. You know, kind of repeating myself here. But if someone were to, you know, point somebody out who was lifting and ask me to critique what they were doing. Unless they were doing something like blatantly funky and weird, like, are really kind of Arnold press into side lateral, whatever. Like if they were just doing basic stuff, then my sort of number one kind of factor that I'm looking at to, you know, sort of judge like, all right, is this guy killing it? Or is he, you know, probably not doing as much as he should? It's not like the exact perfect, you know, form and execution of the set. It's how hard is he going? Now, of course, there's a limit to how funky you're doing with your form. You know, I'm talking, especially in any kind of compound lifts, like swaths, bench, things where you really loading up here sort of whole system. Obviously, your form's going to play a big part of just your safety. But with, you know, curls and push-ups and things like that being a little funkier for the sake of maximizing your intensity, I'm totally cool with it. But obviously, that's within reason, you know. And this is coming from me where if you look back at the tricep days or the arm days, like a year and a half ago, especially on triceps, my execution of these sets are very different. And it's not for no reason, like, you know, people told me to do it like this and now I do. It's especially with like the rope. Like, if you find a clip of me doing rope extension, it's more than a year and a half ago versus the way I'm going to do it today, night and freaking dead. To the point where like, if you had, um, if you had just like a CGI model of like my anatomy doing the sets, you probably won't even think it was the same freaking dude because of how much I was just totally missing out of the stretch position and not holding the squeeze as much. No, I felt like I was going hard. But that's a perfect example of an instance where me working on my form, I feel like, has improved my tricep training pretty substantial. But no more chat, let's just get this pre-workout consumed and get this actual workout for people to be gone, starting with a set of probably real push downs if you like, yes, yes. All right, so it's slightly unspoken about, uh, benefit of dieting this hard is a weaker. I don't know I'm moving around as much weights. That's not a problem. All that means is I don't have to spend as long warming up because I'm doing, doing 80 pound of rope extensions. Like my triceps, my whole 10 nins and everything else from, you know, bulking up their use to lifting in much more, like physically I could load, I don't know how much weight. But all that's to say is like when I'm bulking up, I'm going to work my way up the whole stack, you know, five reps, give it a second, five more, give it a second, five more until I'm up to my working weight. But now, working weight just isn't that high, same thing with the curls, but I'm still going to little half here on the curl. So I did some, I did some warmups over there, 30s for a few, 40s for a few, and then ready for some 45s. So this time today's going to be tricep bicep supersets. So, you know, I don't need to rush and like completely sprint from the rope to the preacher, but I'm going to rest in between once the two sets are complete. So this first kind of pairing, light squeezing tricep, and I really want to kind of feel it the whole time. Because sometimes I'm going to say it's okay to do a nasty set. Like yesterday's back day, when I started with heavy lap pull downs, like it's not like I was throwing the weight around too hard, but I was definitely doing quicker reps. So I wasn't feeling that sort of slow, kind of burn, sort of squeeze kind of a teag, that I'm going to feel right now with this slower set, same kind of approach with the with the preacher. But this will be the first pairing. I'll probably do maybe, I'll just have to see. If this clicks, like if for whatever reason, this rope followed by those single-inpreacher curls just feels absolutely perfect, and I can tell I'm going to be completely pumped at the end of it. I can see myself just going back and forth between two movements for all six or seven sets that I end up doing. But I'm not like locked into that idea, right? I'm just saying I'm open to it. So after the first two, I'll probably know if I want to move on to something else or just keep these going. But no more chatin, let's get some attack on tight and opening songs playing and give myself hands up. Aw, these, Okay. It's I first with these. Hey shelters. Oh. No. No. No. Yeah. No. No. Oh. Oh. Oh. ooh nah nah nah nah nah Yeah, my left biceps the little head of the game. So I'll do the right one first and then match the reps and the left. But this feels good. Let's repeat this a couple more times. I might go one notch heavier on the rope, but yeah, I think we're going to sit here for minimum two more. I'll just go from there. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Oh. Let's just keep doing these. I picked a good, I picked a good little pair of Swiss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No! No! No! No! No! No! Alright. I think I might have actually called it. I'm just going to, not just to these two movements today. These are really clicking. So, what is what? Three? Probably two, three more of these. I mean, pomp-wise? Or definitely attract to something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If this next set is good, I think that's going to be Aussie wrote only a five set arm day pump. Which... Don't forget, this is not a bulking building new tissue workout with, you know, a million-frican-excess-calories. This is me getting the solid pump. Good muscular stimulation on what I would call reasonably substantial deficit. You know, so it's definitely something to take into account in terms of what your workouts are kind of like. Because obviously, if I was eating 5,000 calories, I'd be curled a bit heavier, pushing a bit heavier, and probably doing a bit more sets because it has more muscular endurance. But one more? Spine some lighting, and it will help them to see the mic. Who? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Yeah. Arms are freaking dumb. So only 5 working sets really doesn't take too freaking much, at least, you know, given the circumstances. So let's just see how it will look at it. Honestly, this is definitely up there in terms of overall kind of quality of pump. As any of my freaking recent lifts have been, which is pretty cool for me. Especially again, and this is like an early lift. I don't really eat too many calories today anyway. But let's, let's get right in the line, like, yeah, yeah. Now that's extra cool right here. Honestly, that's like, I don't think I've ever seen how much brachialis separation on myself before. Yeah, all the crap. This diet is freaking working. Oh, geez. Oh, man. And then a little side tries to, for the road. I can barely reach around to grab my opposite freaking hand. Yeah, we go. We're getting somewhere. We are most certainly getting somewhere. But I think that's all she wrote for arms. So now I get to, well, okay, I'm not leaving yet. Let's get a most muscular out of here. Okay. Whoa, man. Dude, deficit plus pumped plus a breath holdy flex. I've been making myself lightheaded. I get to be careful. If you've ever done that before, you know the feeling, because you're kind of, whoa. And I guess if I actually didn't freaking pass out, I'd have to leave it in. I wouldn't just, you know, clip it so I'm going to try my best. Not to do that. But for you, let's see what in the car? For me, I'm going to camp out. Right there. I'm going to be staring at that screen for the next half hour. But I'll see you in the camera. All right. So I get this question every so often. Enough where I think it warrants a little bit of a deeper explanation on my end. And it's, you know, it's kind of just as basic as what am I doing all this for? What's the point of all this working out? Where's the point of all this bulk and up and cutting down? And everything else is like, is it purely because you want to be a competitive bodybuilder? Is it because you want to, and I mean, yeah, like that's going to be cool. But it's kind of just as simple as I like it. You know, I mean, this is my thing. I can work on it pretty consistently. I mean, actually, like, very consistently on the daily getting into twice daily. Now with the cardiovascular session, the workout session. And it's like progressing at a man, you know. That's like asking the bird-wise flies. Man, it's just what he's made to do. So the whole process, they're just getting bigger, walking around like it. I just like the whole thing. That's the cool part, you know. So that's what's getting the extra excited about once this dieting phase is over. Because I'm not really, you know, it's not like I'm not making progress right now. I'm like getting a leaner that is definitely a vector of progress for sure. But it's the building up of size that I really like. Like the dieting phase almost feels like a break from the bulk as it were. You know, in the pursuit of size, there's in the necessity to sometimes set up camp and kind of reset your system as it were. Which is kind of what the dieting phases are. Like in terms of overall kind of like stress on my whole system, the dieting phase is chill. I mean, I'm not as inflamed as I am as when I pull a food and you know, really kind of tackle on size and kind of constantly putting myself into a state of growth. Like all the extra cardio too. I mean, this is a much more relaxed state. Even though I'd feel a little more of the tharject from, you know, doing all the cardio and being in a deficit. Like this is definitely kind of a break from all the stresses of actual like, you know, muscle gaining. And then eventually, I'll reach a point where I can say, alright. This is big enough. I'm at a size that I like. I want to float around here for the next however long. And then, you know, go from there and stay at a baseline level of leanness for, you know, however long. I like. And that's in the distant freakin future, you know, because there's, I'll see all sorts of comments now. I mean, I forever, right? It's like, why would you want to bulk up if you're just going to have to cut down later? And it's, I mean, it's just a nature of trying to get this big, you know, and over time, it is a gradual game because I really don't think main gaming is something you can do indefinitely. I think main gaming is sick in the beginning. Like as a beginner, lifter, you do not need a bulk. You do not need like a hardcore 7,000 calorie. Not man. Each approach team. How many pounds you weigh is how many grams you should eat? Literally only do that as your macro tracking in the beginning before you really start to lock into it. And then just lift, you know, your body will regulate your calorie intake by eating when you're hungry. And then you're going to gain muscle for quite a while. I'm talking months on end, right? Beginner gains are the best because all you got to do is lift, hit your protein, and you're good. Now over time, it gets a bit more complicated than you really get a kind of dial again. But at the beginning, the only macro I'd say you really need to be counting is that protein side of things. Now, if the beginning of your lifting journey is a fat loss, you know, transformation, then that's a little bit different, right? You get a, you know, maybe try to limit yourself a little bit, potentially add in some extra cardio compared to the next guy. But still simple enough at the beginning. But over time, I do think there's a limit to that main gaining sort of stimulus because, I mean, it's happened everybody. There's a, I'd say there's a pretty substantial percentage of lifters out there, where they've been at a main gaining effort level. And what I mean by that is like, they still work out hard consistently. But they're not eating a ton of food outside of, you know, what they regularly kind of consume, like they're not really kind of leverage their diet towards, you know, more progress. And it's like they go to the gym every day. They get their pre-work out, they get their creatine, they get their whatever they're eating. Probably maybe even doing their cardio too. But if you're not fueling your system enough to give yourself that extra surplus of energy to build new muscle tissue, then you're kind of leaving games on a table for not that much extra work. So when I'm getting out there is, I really think there's a massive sort of, pool of untapped muscle, which could be built purely by a little bit of extra effort outside the gym. The problem is it's not as fun, right? Working on, working on, you know, working out outside of the gym is sometimes a little trickier for people because it's outside of the gym, you know, it's like that's your regular life. And then you get your gym life where you're actually in the gym, doing your workout. But there's a lot of gains to be had there. So if you can leverage your diet and combine it with some consistency on that diet, you know, if you're trying to bulk up, make sure you actually do hit your 3500 calorie per day goal. Or if you're trying to cut down, save yourself, save yourself the trouble of having to say crap. This diet was a bust and don't have too many insane off the wall 5000 calorie cheat days. You could have some, just not that you can't have a ton. You know, you can have like maybe one or two a month. But, you know, it's just a delayed gratification type situation, you know? So the guy who can lock into a diet for three months is going to have the results that lock into that diet, and it's kind of as simple as that, right? It takes what it takes. So if you can increase some cardio, decrease your calories, keep working out like normal, guess what? You're going to get lean. I can guarantee and freaking teet. So all that's left for you to do is download that macro tracker app and get to it. But for me, I got a throw away a bunch of cardboard boxes and we got piled up on a highway office. I have some ground beef. I actually know have some, make some ground turkey. And that's some ground beef with some lettuce with some fat free cheese with some low sugar barbecue sauce. And then I could see taking an app. I could force see taking an ice-posed workout in app. So I think that's not like I got the same in. Day at 105 under the books. I can't remember. Day 102 something. We're getting closer to the end than we are to the beginning. We're past the halfway point now. So I will see you for legs tomorrow. I'm going to get a good night's freaking rest.

Alright, it's 2. And now not 2 in the morning it's actually, it's actually 7 o'clock. It's 2 freaking degrees. I'd say something, that's 2 cold for me. I'm, uh, I gotta start actually really bundling up or running down the steps, starting the car, then going back and on my pre-workout stuff ready. So I get into it, it's already kind of pre-heated a little bit, because I'm talking like numb fingers, and I'm only a bit in here for like three freaking minutes. But certainly non-optical that cannot be overcome simply, uh, simply a discomfort style situation. But plan for tonight's leg day. I think I'm gonna go a little easier on hamstrings. I might get hamstrings a little bit of a break today, because I'm doing a lot of seated bike right, and that definitely gives me a little bit more hamstring activation that I might have guessed. And maybe it's just something that I did, but like I can tell today just kind of based on a flexing sort of feeling situation. My hamstrings feel a little more tender than my quads. They're not sore by anything. It's like I'm not walking around my quads, my anise. But definitely a little bit more tender than completely perfectly well rested. So my my today a little more quiet focused, which is not a problem for me. His element really aimin' for is a full on leg pump. Overall kind of leg stimulation, some ad dr. work, some calf work, make sure everything's still flowing, and just trying to hold onto as much beef as possible underneath. As I peel off the, uh, the adipose, fat tissue layer on the outskirts. Yeah, I did, um, so sometimes in the morning when I go to my cardio and the, um, at the apartment gym, I'll just walk, so I'll kind of double up with like a long johns kind of layer, then sweatpants, t-shirt with it sweatshirt. So I really just get extra kind of drenched afterwards, but it was, uh, obviously nothing like the clips of, um, of Ronnie Coleman when he's walking around of those yellow tights, where you can see, I mean, even as well, look like these get the legs of a horse with his veins kind of all over his quads and everything else. But I was getting my own little hint to that because I could sort of see a couple of quad veins through the, uh, the long johns kind of tights between me feel pretty cool. But hopefully we get a little bit more of that now, and even just walking around, I've kind of just got quad veins now, but it's nothing compared to where they're fully pop. So I'm sure it's going to be a pretty large discrepancy in terms of veinyx, you know, vein, of viability in about maybe an hour or so from now, it's really not going to take too long, because I'm not doing any crazy heavy squats or crazy heavy leg press. Mainly leg extensions is my primary quad movement right now. Kind of similar to triceps, how I'm doing a lot more like lighter, squeezing kind of sets, because I may even for stimulation, you know, not complete kind of bulking annihilation, which is a, you get a little bit more of a buffer in terms of your recovery ability, you know. But all that's to say is I can guarantee that within about 60 minutes from once I'm parked and walking my buddy into the gym, I'm going to have a reasonably freaky quad pump, and then I am going to be ready for a good night's rest tonight. I think the house started to organize my little office space. I've still got a couple of extra boxes of like shelves and stuff I got to undo, so, yeah, probably not gonna do that tonight, I'll probably save that for, but we see it every tomorrow. But as a wait for the candy in the kidney, let's just get ready for this like that. Let's just jump straight to business. So I can't doubt on the ad-doctor machine a little bit. Nothing crazy, just like five or six sets of like eight reps of the stack. And I don't mean to start like the flex, like just kind of a basic wait, don't hook yourself, but I like doing that pre-handstrings, just kind of feels a little better, but let's start off like half a stack here, and really squeeze the top of these. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who? You want to die? Very reminiscent of twice every extensions with a good hold on top. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Oh, yeah. Who? One more thing. And then I've got a plan for how I wanted to change it up. Same machine, different execution. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh. Let's change up the style. Some single-linked alternate work instead of double-light. So same basic style, but now five reps on the left, five on the right, just alternate, until hamstring destruction. And very light. This is less weight than what I was just doing double-light combined on the 40 counts. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I think one more though, some metal be in for hamstrings. I do not mind keeping this lift simple, given all a million before it's stimulation, and it's a big, much lower. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

I think I might have lied. I am not a huge fan of the cold. This is good to be a little bit too much. I usually am one to say I am a little bit more indiscriminate with the weather. But one freaking degree, zero actually no. This is negative degrees. Celsius, I don't really know the exact number. But yeah, this is too much. This is a little bit too freaking cold. I think I draw the line where I am going to have to start wearing two jackets and two layers of pants minimum before not even a walkin' outside but just getting into the freaking car. Oh my goodness. But within the next 15 minutes but it's time to get to the gym. I will have warmed up. The heaters will have done their jobs and I will have again to drink the pre. And some kind of caffeine, amplification, hype and really just freaking concentrated pumpability improved so by the time I actually get there I will be perfectly warm for this chest day. Which I wanted to be first. Usually I am one to say cardio in the morning, lift in the evening. But dieting down I am certainly a little bit of a lift first and then cardio in the right now I have still got a post lift cardio. Like after this chest day is done I will do my 30 on the seated bike but that is not really too tricky. Honestly the cardio post workout feels easier than the cardio on its own. Oh, look at this. Because it is like I have already built up some momentum of having already broken the sweat. It will pre workout. It just feels like a matter of course that pop a squat on the bike and have a little bit of cardio activity. But in terms of what this chest day is going to look like, nothing wild, cable work, a lot of squeezing, a lot of very controlled, methodically executed reps. Since there is definitely something to kind of a faster pace just straight up hard set heavy weights to failure really leveraging the amount of tension that your chest is feeling. But right now it is not what I am aiming for. I need a few things out of this chest. I need a pump. I need a reasonable amount of weight exposure. Like I don't need to bench 4 plates on Smith. My 3 is definitely my limit right now in terms of his heavies I could probably go as well as not pushing myself into the danger zone of pulling anything which if I trained in more of a powerlifting manner I would have a different take. Like obviously if somebody does wonder if max is all the time they are used to it. That is kind of the training style that they are used to. It is when you are doing more bodybuilding weight based workouts of the regular and then out of nowhere you go for that 1 grip max and you hurt yourself not going for a good. So that is part of the reason why you are never going to see a same solic 1 grip max out squat bench deadlift. For one it doesn't give me any gains and also the risk to reward ratio is simply not in my favor you know what I am saying. So that is where I am under the impression there. I am of the opinion that the 10 rep max should be given much more respect than height because going for 10 rep weight max is pretty much perfect. Is you break new ground. You do something you have never done before. You have the gentlemanly hidden a new personal record and that set is stimulated towards giving you more goals in the future. Like anytime anybody ever goes for a wonder of max of bench it is just not really like you don't get anything out of it. It is simply a test of where you are out of that current moment. Whereas trying to do a weight you have never done before for those 10 reps let's say even if you hit 9 and you are not fucking okay no way. That is still a good set that is going to be gains and do some. I mean doing one rep max is apart from the like the central nervous system training of exerting your system that hard you don't really get much out of it. I mean most of the strength that even the power of the sugar is building. It is not from their one rep max outs like a 95 or like a 100% full on max day. It is from all the slightly higher volume work the 5x5 or the 3x3 is the 532 or whatever. That is what I am more interested in. It is cool as it is looking at myself all extra lean now. I guess you could say the leanness is almost like the competition side of things about building as a one rep max would be for a power lifter. It is cool as it is now. This is a new ground. I have always been this big. I am not breaking into any new muscular range of realms. I have already built this muscle up all I am doing is simply revealing it. It is not like just looking at the end results shouldn't get you as excited I feel as how excited you should be about what actually gets you towards that end or so. What I am trying to get out and kind of around about way here is as crazy as a big set is if you can get amped up by really pushing it on regular volume based work. Every time you have a crazy working set that gets you excited. That is a much better situation to be in because then you are getting all these dopamine releases and hype kind of adrenaline. From what is actually going to give you the results that you want. As much hype as you know whatever is the risk to actually craft you to get an adventure PR. It is like what did you really do? You showed how much you could do this current moment but it is not really working up towards anything over time. That is kind of my thought process on the manner. So I don't mind if I end up doing 30 pound cable flies for a set of 20 because all I am aiming for is chest stimulation blood flow and a freaky, viny, grainy. Any other kind of weird around to that pump at the end of it. 30 minutes of cardio to finish before coming home for some kind of protein heavy lunch. I went classic this morning of having a hankering for just a buttered bagel. So at the cost of 40 grams of carbs, 10 grams of fats. Still weighting anything out of course. I get to go a little classic with breakfast rather than the eggs and salad cheese mix that have been doing. So not all meals have to look like that but anytime I break away into more kind of conventional just food usually it comes to the cost of all right that was a pretty decent hit towards my calorie count for the day. I gotta take that with no count. At least I got my bagel hankering out of my system. Now I can tell I'm just freaking rambling. How about I thought we just get in there and get this just a started? Let's start a little heftier. An exactness predicted three plates is the limit. Then keep that out of mind I'll smell criay from it. Yeah. Yeah. Probably just one more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Let's get some people working. Oh, crap. Three plates is not supposed to feel like that. Let's see some bent overflies. Not super slow. A little more brutish. And then probably either the next day or the one after. Well, look very different in terms of its execution. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more just like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. It's a good lighting. There we go. All the good lighting spots are taken by yoga classes. Don't think I'll get a freaking pose down. That's kidding. This is a cool spot in here too. But three sets of pretty heavy incline Smith. I'm kind of surprised I could even still throw that way around and have it feel so good. But surprised in a good way. Right. Didn't overdo it. I think that was just about the limit of good, hard, heavy stimulation without creeping into the range of potential injury. That is, that's the side of the spectrum. I want to stay as far as possible away from like as much as my goal is every lift. Go hard. Get a crazy pump. Equally valuable to those two if not maybe even more important. Don't hurt myself. Because that's just taken maybe not even two. I could say even upwards of like three steps back compared to tweaking your stuff or pulling something. Me and just sucks. And that's something which unfortunately I've had a learn from experience. But still learned either way. So let's see how we're looking at. This is with a reasonably empty stomach. Nothing like a real depleted completely like, well, I think I said another exact word, a perfect depleted. But. Holy crap. Even just sitting there holding the flex like that. It's making me lightheaded. All right. Well, chest pumped shoulders are even feeling pretty freaking angular. And this is with no shoulder pump whatsoever. Just the residual shoulder activation that comes with like doing pressing and flies. So. Honestly, that's probably the craziest part of this right here. Even with a chest pump. My shoulders are still kind of maybe not totally dominating, but they're definitely. They're definitely good with their ad. So as I get leaner and excited to see. I touch more shoulder striations, but even just the current state of things. I am feeling pretty good about that. Whoa, let me get one more of those. Oh, my God. All right. So for you, let's get in the car. But for me, I have got 30 minutes on. Not sure if I want to do the seated bike or the seated elliptical. I guess I'll tell you which one I picked. I think I forgot the scale of just how freaking cold it is right now. Didn't everybody. I didn't even realize it's freaking snowing and Florida as well. Oh, my goodness. So you guys know what I'm talking about. Yeah, being cold, not the most fun thing in the world. But that was good lift. I ended up doing the peddler kind of. It's like, I mean, really it's like the seated bike in the elliptical. Somehow had a mutated kind of bit of offspring, Xenomorph style, because you're seated. Like, I'm not standing on the elliptical like foot pads, but I'm still getting a little bit of like that paneling action. Either way, that's just, you know, me saying that I liked it. So 30 minutes there, I'll have another 30 on the seated bike later tonight, which I kind of, yeah, I sort of like this lift early and then cardio in the evening kind of approach. Because I'll get to the point where I'm kind of just like ready to do something, because I'm so used to the late night lifts anyway. So, I mean, by the time it's like five o'clock or six or so, I'm eating some food. I'm going to set it around a little bit. I'm kind of just going to have a little bit of an itch to get something going. So, plus I'm going to be playing on my phone anyway. The 30 minutes of cardio, not the trickiest thing in the freaking world. Let's say you're one. But it's too soon to really tell how I'm adjusting to back and off on the cardio a little bit. Because I think the two hours a day was a little much. So, I'll see over the course of the next few just how. Just how things change. But still getting steadily in leaner. I even just like laying down in bed. I can see way more quad veins just all over the place. And we're definitely on track to something which, you know, forget man. This is a freaking long game. You know, there is no kind of instant whatever. I, I want to be too repetitive. But one workout, one day of dieting, one day of locking in. It doesn't add up to much, right? It's really just a drop in the bucket. You know, but if you've ever dealt with a leak. Those drops add up and before you know it, dude. Your gym has a big ass nasty five kelom. Low's bucket of rain and whatever they came from the ceiling. And somebody's got to deal with it. Not me, of course. I was just the one lifted there. But I mean it happens, right? So, I see it today. I mean, it's, it's, I meant to ask this guy just because I was kind of curious. But, I don't know how to, I don't want to like invade space, whatever. But, if you go to the same gym for long enough, you see the same people. And if you're at least like a little receptive to your environment. These changes are noticeable. I mean, I've seen this same dude on the, I know the elliptical that he likes because he's on it all the time. He is substantially leaner than a couple of years ago. And I mean, like probably two-ish or three. Like the guy looks like he's down 60 pounds. Yeah, that's the only one that really kind of pops in the mind right now. But I don't even know the dude. You know, I, I see him come to the gym a lot. I never talk. And he has made some pretty substantial gains in terms of, I guess he can say, losses, right, and fat losses. And people notice that even if they're not right, and you'll be a bit of a circle or so. But it takes a while, you know. Everybody would love the end result of, Yeah, I wouldn't mind being 20 pounds a layer. Or I wouldn't mind getting, you know, usually people don't think of it like that and they'd say things like, I wish I could lose my love handles or I could feel you know, I could fit into a certain size jeans. Like I used to. Like that's usually kind of people's measurements of like fitness progress. But, you know, any version of that, which fits, you know, whoever sort of thought process everybody would hit that button, you know. If I could lose an extra 50 pounds instantly, me being like somebody who's got an extra 50 pounds of loose odds are, I'd say, I'd say, I'd say, I'd say, I'd say pretty dang close to 100% of people. At least up in the 90s are going to say, they, holy crap, a 180 again. Nice. But, you know, if you, if you add the terms and conditions into that equation and you say, I mean, you can lose a hundred pounds this year. And that's not unfathomable. That's definitely like you're locked in. But a hundred pounds in here has been done. I mean, I get to see a lot in all my, like I see a lot of tagged posts on Instagram, and guys show off pictures of their cardio and like, this was me last year. This is me this year. Like frankly, that's a lot more impressive to me than just like, you know, a couple of pounds of muscle gain. Because anybody can gain some muscle, you know. Just by adding working out to your routine, you're going to start to beef up a little bit. But there is no getting around blocking in if you're trying to get leaner. So what I'm, but what I was kind of getting that was a hundred pounds in a year. Dude, everybody would hit the button to say, I want to lose a hundred pounds right now. Boom, no strength attached. But as soon as you add those conditions of right, man, you can lose a hundred pounds. In the a hundred pounds leaner. All right, you can be back to a Spray 190, like you were back in 2004, or whatever. But you had to do 30 minutes of cardio every day. You got to watch your diet. You got to only eat so much food because you have to stay in the calorie deficit so that you burn off, you know, whatever percentage of body fat every day, which, hundred pounds, one year, that's about point. Point two something pounds per day. Let me only think about that. Hundred pounds. Three hundred sixty five days. Uh, sure, sure, sure. Don't see if I can try to figure this out. Well, either way, about a third-ish, maybe a little more of a pound per day of body fat. And, you know, you're not really going to see those results until a year from that. And you got to be locked in the whole time. Now, that's where reality kicks in. And, you know, the percentage change is going to drop from that hundred percent or 90 percent who would totally take it, no strength to touch. And as soon as you add those extra caveats of all right, you've actually got to do some shit to make that happen. Ooh, wow. Partio? Come on, man. I don't want to be sitting around sweating. That's freaking hard. And that's where the value comes, right? I mean, anything cool that anybody does ever usually has a pretty substantial amount of time and effort done on the back end before, you know, the cool part actually gets shown off. All right. There's nothing flashy about 30 minutes of cardio every day. Especially when you're tired, it's cold now. That being the car is freaking freezing. I'm fogging up the windows just by breathing. You know, the lifts at least are pretty hyped because you can get excited about it. You know, it's really going hard. I mean, there's like this just hyped to the working out of the cardio. And not the most fun thing ever. You know, the flash factors pretty low. It's kind of close to almost a chore level, at least, you know, on average. If I'm really getting into it, I got my music playing. If for whatever reason, I'm extra hyped. You know, I can pretty, I can be pretty amped up for my 30 minutes on the bike. Sometimes I'll do like some extra minutes of like higher intensity. If I've got a good song playing or something. But for the most part, it's, I'd say 90% of the time, the tricky part is really just sitting there doing, you know, which, I mean, yes, not the most fun thing in the world. I would never go on record and say that it is. Even less so is the dieting side of things. The calorie restriction. And usually it's not even just calorie restriction. I mean, it's treat restriction, man. Look, I think I'm definitely above average. On the sweet tooth meter compared to most as well. Right? So I get the challenge of having to back off. And you're really fighting your basic urges for the most part. I mean, you're hard-wired to say, Ooh, I like how that tastes, I better eat some of that. I mean, you're going against evolution by trying to tell your body, like, hey man, come on. No crumble that I do. No cadence, no crispy cream, no skittles. It's, I'm in thinking about the skittles a little bit. You know, that will be a nice treat for later. But like, yeah, that's even harder than the cardio I would say. Because it's all the time. You kind of have to be thinking about it pretty consistently to be able to like, you know, hold yourself back and they go, right? And it probably shouldn't have that today, you know? And if you're counting your calories, I mean, you can add treats and two, but then you got to pay for it. Because if you have a huge breakfast, and you want to, you know, you actually stay on track with not overreating for that day, then you get a back off for dinner, you know? Or if you have a huge dinner or whatever, or if you totally go off the rails, you just do a few days of a serious, like, just, you're eating anything in sight, then you're setting yourself back progress wise. So, you know, you got to really get back on track before you even start burning fat again. Like, there's a lot of downsides. And by downsides, I just mean costs. Effort before you get the actual valuable reward afterwards. But the fact that not a lot of people will really go through that effort is why it's cool when you make it happen. When somebody posts a picture that they lost a hundred pounds in a year, that is bad at. And there should be no angle in which you could take any value away from that. Because that shit was hard. And then you're getting around it. So, whether your goal is lose 30 pounds or 20 pounds or 10 pounds, or even just start counting your calories at all by doing so. And just try to remember, it's going to take a little while. But just because things take a little while doesn't mean you shouldn't go after. And if anything, that's going to be a little bit of a sort of fire on a knee to you to make you say, okay. This is going to take a while. The sooner I start the better, you know, the classic sort of phrase of like the best time to plan to tree would have been a hundred years ago. The second best time is right and freaking now. Because then you can at least kind of get ahead of the game on. But apart from that, you gotta just find a way to get yourself amped up. Like as much value as there is in me, you know, saying whatever, like get yourself in the zone. It's like, you know, you don't need a third person motivating force to get you going. Anything that anybody really does hard, they do it because they want to do it. So, get yourself in tune with what your goals are. And like, really just as simply as thinking, okay, what would be cool for me to do? Like this is, this is you talking now. Like, yeah, it would be pretty cool to get a 225 bench for 10. It would be pretty cool to actually see myself lean. I haven't really seen my abs for a while. It'd be cool if I could run a four-minute mile or just anything. Of course, if I'm talking about something, it's going to be fitness-related. But I mean, it could really just be anything. What do you think would be cool to do? And then how much time a day can you spend getting yourself closer to whatever that end of the goal is? And as long as you can work at it consistently, you know, sure, it might not feel like a lot. If you just scoop at a little bit of dirt at a time. But before you know it, as months pass as years passed, you had a big ass freaking hole, and then a big ass pilot dirt right next to you. You know, it's like, I'm talking prison break style. And a couple scratches of concrete off the wall with your little, you know, she-of-spoon day by day might not seem like a lot. But before you know it, you're freaking broken out. Freemand. Now, I'm really getting some random ass analogies there. But if you've gotten the hype from that, then that's what I made before. So my plan, go home. Cookin' oven steak probably, I think, well, I get the meat thermometer, so I'll just cook it until it hits 125 internal. At 400, it should take about 20, 25 minutes or so, ish. Probably closer to 25. Maybe some, yeah, I think I'll go for three packs of cauliflower broccoli on the side, just so I really have a good, like, volume of foods, so I feel full. And then you ready for cardio later? So, one day leaner, one more day under the books, or under the belt, I mean. So, oh, guys. And I'll see if there's a back-action tomorrow.

Alright, I just had a very serious moment about 40 minutes ago. Before I got ready for the gym, before I get the bag packed, though, the great make sure I had the SD card, the battery charge, and my straps, and my pre- and my gallon of freaking half gallon of power is zero. Frankly, orange is a mile's ahead of any other flavor away, but it's not even close. But I was in a position of weakness. I'm looking at the pantry, okay? I've had 1,600 calories so far. It's a good chunk. I got a couple of the low-calorie carb hack protein bars, because it's treats. It's pretty good. Honestly, I mean, it's got all the extra fiber and the aliolo's and the sugar alcohol's and stuff. It really is a lower calorie alternative. A little tricky on your stomach, though, because all of those like sugar alternatives and the sugar alcohols and things like that. They can totally mess with your gut. Like if I ate all of my calories coming from those, like each one's like 190, 140, 50 calories, whatever. If I had all 2,000 calories or all whatever number of amenforves for the day of those meal replacement protein bars with all the extra random stuff in there, it would totally, I would feel like totally mess up my stomach. And I think I'm pretty resilient when it comes to being able to tolerate kind of funky foods like that. So even if you're a little, so if you're a little more kind of normal, then might not be the best sort of treat for you. But I mean, the kitchen, walking around, you know, just me and doing about, grab two of them. Right, grab two of them straight out of the cupboard, hold them for a moment, put them down on my desk, come up at the chatdown. And I think to myself, okay, am I really even hungry? Am I really actually hungry for food right now? Or am I just kind of bored and I'm letting my boredom kind of motivate me to, you know, munch on something just because I don't have anything else going on at the moment. And guess what? Guess what happened to those two little bars? They got put freaking back on the shelf. And that's hard to do. That is not an easy freaking thing to do, you know, as silly as I might be making the sound like picking up some kind of snack like that. Hold it, it's in your hands now. I mean, you're holding the murder weapon. You haven't used it yet, but you're thinking about it. And then putting it back, dude, plus I mean, nobody's there to watch you. That's a, that is a small victory when it comes to dieting. So if you've ever been in that situation, you know, I feel like it's cool, you know. And I know that seems so silly, especially to anybody that doesn't really get it with a dieting. Like for me to say that, and something like, who, what? For cares, you know, but if you've ever gotten into calorie tracking, the value of saving those 300 calories for later on down the line, right? And fighting the urge to just, you know, chat on something for no other reason that you just might be feeling a little bored. You know, frankly, I think boredom is often confused with hunger, at least in people's minds, like that, like, you know, physical mental confusion, I'm just talking like, and let's check the cover to see what's in the fridge. Let's see what's in the pantry, can you meet? Like, it's just, I mean, it's not even human nature, it's simply like the nature of being alive as an organism, you know, scanned around for any kind of grubby and get your hands up. And that's like your primary objective. So to fight against it, definitely a little trick here. But that's a little swarrow victory for me. And now, you're time to have a bigger one by having a solid ass back day. I'm talking pull down, I'm talking rows, I'm talking pullovers, and then some kind of combination in between of some sort of kind of pullover combined with a sort of row as a finisher. So that my entire pump back is, I think that's basically so many entire pack is pumped. So my entire back is pumped up to the post now. And then I get to camp out on some kind of, uh, probably just regular seated bike, not the recumbent one. And then I've got the most recent episode of Beast Games to watch. I, uh, squid games, only seven episodes of season two left a little bit of a hole in my, a little bit of a hole in my heart. Because I was getting ready for another 10 freaking episodes. So the real version is definitely tied to me over. So I saw that guy drop today. I knew to save it for later. So another little hack with the cardio, at least in terms of being a little bit more efficient or effective and kind of consistent with it. Save yourself a showman. You know, if you know you've got a 45 minute episode of something that you're going to watch anyway. And you're going to watch you just sit in the round, you know, doing nothing else. And then saves for later post workout, you know, pop a squat. And if it's to show you actually enjoy watching. Guess what? That cardio is going to happen like that. Like nothing. And then you get to go home with, uh, a known you watch to get episode of something or other. And you did your cardio. And you had a good lift. Only upsides from my perspective. But I think no more chatting. It's not too cold today, which is nice for me. So not, uh, I don't feel like I need to warm up as much. What is it? What's it in there? So I think no more discussing it. Let's just make it happen. So dieting down is especially given the fact that I'm not trying to do insanely hefty sets. The warm up phase much quicker, right? Because I don't have to sit here and get my lats ready for like a full stack set of pull dents. I mean, for a lot of stimulation. You know, so I mean, I get to play around here. But this is basically the first working set. And especially as a light squeezing movement. I mean, how much prep do you really have to do? You know, so that's one, uh, one little tip I can say. If you're ever in a bit of a rush, like, let's say you get an arm day and like, you're on the clock, you gotta be done in 45 minutes. Maybe it's in your best interest to start with light squeezing rope extensions. Instead of real heavy strape our push downs or something, because you don't have to warm up as much, right? So a little bit of time can strain thing, but if that's ever situation you're in, not about approach. But for me, it's just because I don't need to go that heavy right now. So five reps, five reps alternating with a good squeeze. Then we'll just go from there. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. One more. One more. I was considering moving on, but I think one more. Then jump something new. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Let's do some kind of rowing movement next. I really don't even need straps. Like this rubber pull down handle has enough grip, and this is light enough. I really don't think my forms would be a limiting factor, but just for the sake consistency. Let's do some straps on. I really want to feel my shoulder blades touch. They're not going to, but that's what I'm trying to envision by pulling the bar. I'm not pulling with my hands down here. I'm not thinking about any of this. I'm thinking, you know, you're working. That's what I mean before. Then light weight. So, very squeeze focus and control. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh my god. One or two more of those. Yeah, that's really good. I never felt so much lower lat-activation or lower trap-activation, I've freaking life. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay. I think I've got a plan for what the last two steps I've been looking like. One more pull-and-s, then a superset. And back up, you ready to check out. No. No. No. Oh my goodness. That might have been too heavy. All right. Let's do a little hold-and-slaze-roll. That'll be all she'd freaking wrote. Assuming this is it. Well, assuming this is good, this will be it. Lat-focused stretch. Mid-back-focused squeeze. And I sit a half and a half. Pull-and-slaze-roll. No. No. No. No. No. Let's pull this down. Let's do it. Let's see how we're looking through the shirt first. And then get down to real business. I can tell you something. There's definitely something blood flow related going on back there. Let me show you. Actually sharp and focus. So you tell me, is this freakier or less freaking in the last few back days? I think that shot definitely was, but let's say. Let's keep running through a few here. No, man. No shoulder pump. Much thinner than it was three months ago. But I wouldn't call this stage ready yet. Oh, my goodness. Oh, geez. Well, backpumped. I'm tired. I don't need to torture myself by waiting any longer than necessary to get the cardio started. No. Okay. That was actually a very quick 30 minutes of cardio. Sometimes I have a, well, I always cover the clock. Like the cardio bike itself has a little timer. And sitting there staring at it, watching it just creep by extra slow. Let me just say this, no fun whatsoever. So it's always been in my best interest to cover that up and keep it a mystery even myself. So the time kind of passes a little faster if I can get a little bit more enthralled into the clash game or to the show that I'm watching. But luckily enough, right when I flipped over my jacket, so look at the timer. 29 minutes, 30 seconds. I was kind of, well, I was hoping I wasn't going to flip it over and see it read like 15 minutes. The early stuff checked it before was like 10. Well, I mean, I probably checked it all sort of in our roles, but what really sucks is if you think you've done like 25, and you've really only done like six. Absolutely no fun. But that was a really good back day, frankly, I felt a bit stronger than expected. Like muscular kind of endurance, everything else. Yeah, I think easing back to only one hour of cardio a day is about my limit. Because you gotta think there is a balance of, and I've said this a couple times. There's a balance of trying to burn extra calories every day, right? Increase my energy expenditure as well as decrease my calorie intake, right? And this gap in between is me burning body fat, you know what I'm saying? So the logic there, some might say, well, I don't want to do any extra cardio, just eat less food, which you have some logic there for sure, but if you don't do extra cardio, then you're kind of getting a slow down your metabolism a little bit, because it's going to be in pretty much direct relation to your activity level. So I don't think zero cardio only reducing your calories is the way to do it, but you also can't do four hours of cardio every day. So somewhere in the middle is a sweet spot. And for me, I think 30 minutes of cardio in the morning, followed by 30 minutes of cardio, post lift, combined with my calorie deficit, is about there. Now, I don't think I like screwed myself for the last month or so doing the two hours of cardio a day. I think it definitely worked in terms of fat loss, but I think I was overdoing in terms of the energy expenditure in relation to my recoverability. But that's something, you can't just guess that, you can't have to find out. So now I know. And I'd rather be the guy who did the two hours of cardio a day for weeks on him, and then realized, okay, I should tone it back rather than the guy who would never even consider and think, oh, two hours, cardio weights are free and much roof. You know what I'm saying? There is certainly a difference in holding yourself back from doing something versus not being capable of doing something in the first place. Like it's such a classic trope of like, oh, dude, if I locked in, I could be jacked. Like dude, if I went to the gym every day and I did my cardio and I like really locked into my diet. Like for the, if I did that for the next four months, dude, I'd be yoke. It's like, yeah, man, you would. Are you gonna? I'm sure if somebody just popped in your mind. Yeah. I mean, it's true though. They definitely would get themselves in solid shape. Like if you lock in, it's not a question of if. I mean, serious gains can be made at any level, but the if is, are you even gonna do it, right? So that's what separates the lifters from the non lifters I feel. But now I get to go home. Have a protein heavy meal. I think in egg whites melted cheese and a side of something or other. Maybe I'll do a yogurt with some frozen fruit and some sugar-free maple syrup. I think that sounds pretty dang good to me. And then chill. Added this a little lift together and then that'll be the end of it. So we're getting close. We are closer to the end of this dieting phase than the beginning. That is for freaking sure. And I am definitely, like I'm definitely looking forward to the bulk that lies ahead. But, you know, before that, before that sunrise and the dawn, I've still got some things and some freaking business to keep taking care of in terms of this calorie deficit. So holding strong got me another month and a half ish or so. And then I'm talking carb-dub. Skins splitting muscle exploding. Weight-thrashing, stack slamming. Every other descriptor under the sun of a crazy ass, bulking lift. But I'm not, so when it comes to when that bulk is going to start, I'm not just going to open the floodgates. You know, I am going to ease into it, of course. Because if I started eating five freaking thousand calories off the rip, all I'm going to do is totally oversaturate my ability to load up on those carbs. And then just spill over and start packing on body fat with your joints of my own. So the same logic with the dieting phases, going into a cut versus the bulk, it's an easing into a kind of process. So as a little bit of kind of summary of how this diet has gone so far, the first month going from like 270 to 260 to 55 or so. That was just going from bulking diet to eating as much as I was hungry for, which was not very much. I mean back in the, oh my goodness. Yeah, back in October during the, during the Olympia, when I got to live with hers after that chest ache, we stopped at this kind of like Chipotle style restaurant. And you know, we each got a big bowl like rice and chicken, whatever. I barely had half of it. Like my appetite was freaking crashed because I just finished the bulking phase, right? I was on the diet. But now, oh my goodness, I could probably thrash that same bowl of chicken and rice and 0.4 seconds I'm talking light speed. But that first month, me just eating when I was hungry, and getting my appetite was so low, put me around like 3,000, 3 1,000 calories or so per day. And that was enough of a deficit to lose weight slowly, right? And then that next month, I had a decrease at such more, get into the 3,000 range. Then to be in balance around the 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1,000 range, now getting like 2200 is having some lower days of, you know, 2,000 if I'm not doing like legs or something or other. And now it's just kind of maintaining that deficit and making sure I keep getting the leaner as the day is passed. And I'm not really freaking out about my morning weight with the scale, you know, bounced around kind of 2,30 or so, just because on any given day, I mean, I'm going to have a certain amount of food that's still in my stomach, originally from the night before, or I might be a little more hydrated, maybe a little less hydrated, or let's just say, I mean, you've got more food in your system. What I'm more concerned with is really just visually how much leaner am I getting on a day by day, well, more of a week by week basis. But feel like I'm on track to get in pretty freaky, or at least a few levels freaky than I already am now. So, I gotta do this, keep this momentum up, which boring, you know, acts of a higher power, we are good. So, I'm going to enjoy the fact that it's not absolutely freezing cold out. Hopefully, let's just hope it warm up at least to a reasonable degree. I mean, I don't want to have to jump in the car for cardio and have it be like negative 10. That would kind of put a little bit of a downer on the whole situation. But even if that's the case, what are you going to do? Bundle up, put on a double layer of sweats and get freaky in real, the least, or the less that you can let your routine or whatever else, even just your hype and energy be derailed by any outside source of whatever, the better. Try to imagine yourself as a goddamn unstoppable force or an immovable object. The fact that maybe the cardio bike you were looking forward to was taking, that shouldn't stop you. That should just make you think, alright, let's change it up. Let's pick the seed in a liptical. Let's pick the treadmill. Let's pick this out of the other. Just try to flip it into a little bit of hype if you can. But I think that's all I got. So, I will see you for an arm date tomorrow. Now I'm getting myself real excited.

Alright, whoever came up with these things right here, God dang genius. It's like a blanket for your hands, man. I'm just joking, Kevin. I've been well aware of what gloves were, but for one of the reasons did not have any of the freaking apartment. What the hell? He's taken for granted. I'm sure nine out of ten of you guys have that front door, cupboard, or a front door, a little coke room, or whatever. And you have a million pairs of your families, winter gloves, and it's just a drone about you can never find the right set of any of them. Hopefully this doesn't turn into my own collection of those. But keeping the thing, he's nice and warm. So I don't have to spend extra long warming him up before I go. Hands on steel, hands on with the iron, and the god dang, well, you get the idea. So basic plan for arms is as such. Fill them up with blood, pose down, say holy crap. That's a good pump. And then leave. And I mean it. Don't have to do 30 minutes of cardio afterward, because I did two sessions of cardio today. All right. I wanted to see what it would be like to do, well, just to have a more chill post lift. So Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, the clock cardio in the morning. Followed by two o'clock cardio. Can I just, because I was ready for it. What was doing the else? And then a nap. Some extra time is passed, and now here we are. So I'll probably still do some cardio just out of, I think, yeah, probably just out of habit. But no need for a full 30. And honestly, I mean 15 minutes of post lift cardio on the bike, not the hardest trick thing in the world. I mean, I'm going to sit on my phone for 15 minutes, sit in the car. I really couldn't recommend it enough. But I don't want to turn every talk into a, every talk into a cardio rant. I know that'll probably, probably start to kill something. But I went old school hobby-wise today. I got a 13 by 13 unit, Rubik's Cube. Things, freaking huge. I'm talking, well, it's like small, but pieces wise. So I was sitting there for like two freaking hours trying to get it back together. And it's just a pattern recognition kind of thing. So I used to be really into that when I was younger. So I still kind of remembered how to do it. But I couldn't figure out the last section. So it's still sitting on my desk. Maybe I'll do that way. But a little more excuse to bust that a pre-work at John. It's late. It's a late one. I probably should have came in here a little bit earlier to keep up my normal kind of sleep schedule. 9.35 on a Friday. So it's, I don't bring it up as much because I'm not at school anymore. I'm not really surrounded by it. But it's Friday night. The bars are still open. And if you're in my 18 to 22, 18 to 24 year old demographic, AKA college students, you get in thrashed tonight. Is your crew about to get freaking spawning tonight to the point where you're going to, you're going to get more dad lore. Really? That's the dad lore. Just getting the records on the regular. Whatever suits your boat. But in a games specific context, I really can't speak any worse about it. I mean, you're killing your games. You're going to feel like shit tomorrow. You're legitimately, I mean, it's a performance de-hancer in terms of your, in terms of your actual muscle building capability. Like, after drinking and stressing at your whole system like that, hypertrophy is basically just putting it on a freaking hold because you're making your body deal with that extra stress. And now, of course, that's not rhetorical. It's up to you. And this is your life, right? But for the most part, I only see the negatives. And that's coming from my perspective as a hardcore muscle above all. Kind of kind of kind of guy. So obviously, I've got a little bit of bias. But I mean, it's a pretty good case of things in terms of tips and system effort and everything else that goes along with building muscle, like a bodybuilding nutcase. Typically has a pretty big overlap with just general overall well-being. And I'm not talking about getting to 250 pounds. I'm talking about the cardio, the consistent weight training, getting your diet in order, having a pretty reasonable routine. And then getting even a step further and just kind of like your mental sort of state. It's like if you want to get into any endeavor and a long-term sort of format and you want to do something every day at the same age time, you know, of course, it can vary. And you want to feel good about it while you're doing it, but then you're going to want to have your mental state kind of in control too. So it's like, anything that's going to throw off gains typically just throws off people's enjoyment of life, you know? I mean, who's going to have more fun? Just on a not even on like a long bigger than this guy kind of whatever. Who do you think's going to enjoy their day more? The guy who got a good amount of rest, the guy who's well hydrated, the guy who is eating a reasonable diet. Now, of course, I might not be the guy to go to, to say either reasonable diet. But, you know, I'm hitting a solid amount of, I was going to say healthy. And healthy is kind of a weird word when he picks them up and diet. Because it's like, what are your specific goals, you know? But hitting your protein goals on the regular, not getting like 20 grams of protein per day, and then having the rest of it come only from like crazy high process, whatever. I mean, there's dudes where breakfast, lunch and dinner is all McDonald's, everything else. And you couple that sort of diet with zero work in that at all. It doesn't lead to the best result, I'll say. But obviously, the guy who's got all that in order is just going to feel better, you know? And the better you feel, the better you're going to perform. Even if it's just, you know, walking around doing your regular shit. And what I think sucks is feeling good, like feeling what really well-rested, is a bit understated, you know? Because I think a lot of life is like this. The bar of comfort is right here. Now, being above it, being well-rested, being well-fed, being well-slapped, being well-everything, well-high-dreated. You know, you're in the green. You're not crazy high in the green. It's a pretty, it's not the biggest change. You don't take your multivitamin's and drink a gallon of water, I think. Man, I feel good right now. It's not like that. It's not very hype and do so, you know? So, it's typically overlooked and put on the back burner compared to... Yo, man, you going out tonight, bro? You want to stay home and go to bed early? What do you have frigate, dork? I mean, insert whatever kind of frat style chat you like. You know, the value of, okay, should I get a good night's rest and go to bed early? Or insert Tom Fulher. Usually the scales are going to tip over here. So again, I mean, this is just coming from my perspective, of course. But at least in the long run, set of things, looking back over all days that are in the Green of that comfort level, they add up. Now, of course, it's not as fun, but... I'm alzin' your court, man. Dude, you want? So, that's my little anti-drinking kind of shit dick. But of course, I'm not your dad, so you do you. But for me, I think that within the hour, I'm going to have a rather nasty arm pump. It's going to be a little lengthier, at least, well, not lengthier, but a little more complicated in my last arm day, which was just rope extensions and dumbbell preacher curls. And I got a couple of comments, I'm like, well, see in this. Yeah, that's really a whole workout. All you did was rope extensions and preachers, man, that's not enough to do growth. And I've been getting these comments forever, you know, it's even with the, like all sorts of other lifts, too. It's like, your chest day was only inclined Smith and cable flies. It's like, yeah, it's eight hard sets of chest. You know, it doesn't really... I'm not really one to, you know, be of the, of the mind that it's like crap. If I don't hit eight different movements and suddenly this workout is complete bullshit, you know. Like, it's, it's almost as if somebody could have access to a gym where all it had was a Smith machine. And in their mind, they're going to say, oh, there's only Smith machine here. I guess I can't have a good chest day today. I'm going to skip the gym altogether. Now, I just, I don't get it. But that's, you know, that's coming from me having done a lot of really simple lifts. I mean, a lot of my high school lifts, too, in the beginning, I would just go down to the, you know, the weight room, like, for weightlifting class. And I knew the PE teacher who was teaching it because I remembered him from, like, elementary school, because he used to work there and then he moved to the high school. So he let me work out then there while the other guys are doing their class, which, honestly, if he did not do that, there's no saying if I'd be in this exact specific kind of position I'm in here. So it's, could have been a freaking massive blessing in disguise. But either way, all that was down there was barbells, racks, and dumbbells. And I might do. This is freaking perfect. Chest shoulders, back arms, legs. Now, of course, my hamstring training wasn't really awesome yet. I, uh, I didn't start really training hamstrings at all for, like, six months. Because in my mind, I used to think, well, why would I want the back of my legs to be big? I want the front of my legs to be big. And what my quadstegrot, who gives it freaking, who gives a rat to ask about hamstrings? Little to life, freaking. No. But all that's to say is, if you don't have access to the most cutting edge equipment, you still have access to enough to get a pump, man. You know, I'm talking with Giver up in here. If you give me a gallon jug in a shoe lace, and, you know, 30 minutes in some pre-workout, and then you come check in on me and about, you know, half an hour or so, I'm going to have a skin spilling chest bump. And even if you only gave me a damn pencil, I'd probably pull something out of the jar of wick. But the heat is heating. Let's get these freaking gloves off, and give you a ready start this workout. I am going to start this arm day just like the last one. But I'm definitely not just going to stick to these two movements. And we'll certainly bounce around. Try to set up bicep, try to set up bicep, try to set up bicep, but I know that the rope extension, don't belp, preach your combo. It's pretty good. So that's what I'll start with first. Very light, at least for me, like this is weight, that the first five reps absolutely know a shoe. So what I'm trying to maximize is the fatigue per rep. So I'm not going to sit here and just bust them out. It's not the point. What I want to do is feel my triceps kind of like, gradually loosen loose and loosen loose and loosen. And then have a good hard tight squeeze on the bottom. And I don't know why the squeeze gets no love. Like the flexing kind of contraction is getting absolutely no love right now. It's all about the stretch. It's all about, you know, somebody making a face like, why is he doing it like that? And then it's, it says, though, this is the perfect rep. I mean, what the hell are we talking about here? I know for a fact, my triceps are going to be more pumped in the universe or at the bottom of every rep. I have a good hard, crazy squeeze versus the one where I just like, tap it for a second and then focus more on the stretch. Obviously, there's value in both parts, but it's a complete rep, you know. So don't don't freak about any kind of new age, new wave, style of execution. That's just views for jargon or like new jargon for, you know, views. Like people trying to spice up fitness. Go hard, get a pump, you're good. Like trying new shit too, of course, like spice it up, but you don't need to completely uproot your training routine because so and so is doing it like this. If you know you're working out hard, I think you're good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I know what's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Let's take a second and freaking poach down. Even though I'm a bit lighter, bad ass arm day. Yeah. Yeah. I'm dying here. And I just mean that as though I am going to sleep like a freaking baby. That's for sure. But let's see what kind of pump that arm day related in resulted in. Yeah. Go on old school. The freaking gold's gym take. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think all this freaking cardio and calorie counting is definitely added up to something. That's for freaking sure. No. All right. Now let's get out of here. There is strong potential that tomorrow ends up being a rest day. That is for freaking sure. But anytime you think like that, late, you just finished to work out your extra tired. Is that playing a role in the little bit of a bias in my mind where I'm going to be resting right now. And I'm in a very restful or at least anxious to be a restful situation. Because I'm doing the workout. It's late. I'm ready to go to bed. I don't want that mentality to creep into my plans for tomorrow. Because then you're just not planning based on an actual plan. You're just planning based on how you're feeling the moment. You know, like getting groceries when you're hungry, you're going to be a bit more likely to get some treats and get some extra everything. Whereas if you get groceries when you get a full belly, you might be a little bit more... Not even strict, but you just want to even feel the need to do that. But I've also got a balance out. The hard-headed approach that I've kind of got of like lift every day no matter what. Because right now is definitely not a situation where that's the case. With this calorie restriction for sure, my recoverability is impeded. I don't have a zillion freaking extra grams of carbs to really fuel up and get everything back in working order to come back in the rash tomorrow. So we'll see. If I feel good, then I'll just hit legs tomorrow and then do a rest day afterward. But definitely a rest day either tomorrow or the next day. Just as like a little bit of a reset. I'll still do some cardio too, of course. That's not going anywhere. But I just mean in terms of the actual lift. I'm not sure whether that first portion that posed down is out of focus. But... Definitely getting leaner. Definitely getting freaking leaner. So... Now we wait. Now we freaking wait. So postwork out meal. I plan on scarfing down some turkey. Not ground or deli. You gotta go to Costco and you get this big five pound vacuum sealed chunk of turkey. I'm talking fresh off the bird, not like reconstituted or whatever. And then I'll cut a couple of probably ten ounce or maybe 12 ounce slab there. I don't really... If I'm gonna overshoot calorie-wise, I definitely think it's in my best interest to have some extra protein rather than some extra carbs. So usually if I'm itching for some kind of snack and it's late, I'm gonna go for some straight protein first before I start reaching around. Like some of the yogurt or blueberries or anything else. But... Currently I've been having the same treat on repeat, which has actually been pretty much for your perfect calorie-wise. It's usually two tubs. Sometimes... I mean, well, that's sometimes, yeah, but I could definitely imagine doing it three at once. But two tubs, a little like non-fat, Greek yogurt. So each one's got seven grams of carbs, 15 grams of protein. Mixed with about 20 grams of carbs worth of frozen pineapple. And then like 30, 60-ish milliliters or whatever kind of whatever of sugar-free maple syrup. To give that all kind of a bit of a stir. And then you might think that I would want to blend that up into a bit of a smoothie type situation. But I don't think that would be any better because then rather than getting to actually like, you know, bite into and chew the frozen fruit chunks. You're just drinking it and drinking your calories in a deficit-type situation is not the best way to go about it. You know, because you can definitely... Well, I mean, it's just the nature of a liquid. It's going to want to fill up whatever kind of container you put it in. So drinking a big shake is not going to be so filling as eating that same amount of food in physical form. You know what I'm saying? So I leave that frozen fruit intact just so I feel like I'm actually eating something. And then it's definitely a good little sort of sweet tooth kind of curber. So I think that'll probably be a good pairing next to the mix of that turkey. No, at the same time, I'll probably do it like dinner dessert style, save it for later. And then I'm talking straight to bed soon. So I think that's all I got to say, man. Sweet arm day. Lower back beginning to look extra nuts. And I haven't even really gotten into a peak kind of finishing form. Because not only am I going to get a little bit leaner, but there's also going to be some kind of, you know, water cutting going on in terms of like drying out and carbon up and sort of everything else. So I think I'm definitely in for something coming next month. But no point talking about it now. Well, we'll just see once that actually happens. So plan for tomorrow. Either legs are rest. But in either case, the deficit will be maintained. All right. Make sure you lock in if you're really getting into any sort of calorie restrictions or certain calorie goals that you're aiming for. But that's all I got, man. So I'll see you for whatever tomorrow brings.

Alright, you know something's bad. When walking outside, I think to myself, wow. 30 degrees. This is nice. This is pretty freaking enjoyable. Of course, 30 compared to zero. I'm talking Fahrenheit. I don't know. And I'm not exactly sure what zero degrees Fahrenheit is. Celsius. But either way, I'm talking, you know, freezer butt off cold versus, you know, where a jacket is a little bit cold. But that's nice for me. So I don't have to sit here freeze. I'ma fingers off. I mean, honestly, 30 is alright. 30 is a, oh freaking K with me. So, play it for tonight for likes. I was on the, I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted to make it today or rest day, or save it for tomorrow. And I think that today being the rest day is not necessary. And I might even just make tomorrow extra chill and just do, uh, just do shoulders. And by shoulders, I really do mean like a chill, like probably only four sets of reverse, you know, rear delt work and then four sets of laterals. So certainly not the most stressful workout in the world. But, you know, it's, uh, it's a balancing act right now, you know, because I don't necessarily think there's such thing as, um, over training per se. It's more so a situation of under-recovering, right? I mean, you're pretty tough. We've evolved for a while to be able to handle some pretty damn serious situations and circumstances. But, not having enough food in your system, not getting enough sleep, not getting enough, you know, hydration and recovery, that's going to mess with anybody. Across the board from a damn perfect organism like, Zina Moore fall the way down to, you know, whatever kind of a meat is or floating around. You don't get many food or water. She's going to stop working, right? So right now what I'm balancing is, okay, I would need some weight-based exposure and I want to maintain some strength, I want to maintain my size. I want to keep all the muscle that's already built up, while I reveal that muscle by peeling off the body fat, right, by eating that calorie deficit. But in doing so, I'm limiting my ability to recover from the workouts, because I'm no longer eating, you know, five or six thousand calories a day. I'm down in the low-toes to somehow just two and then on a lower day. Even below that, getting in the 1900s sometimes. So, what that tells me is, maybe I don't need to do five plate squats. Maybe I don't need to do ten plate leg press, and not even maybe those are off the menu for now. So all I'm really aiming for on a lift by lift basis. I mean, really my two goals are only, don't hurt myself and get a pump. And this don't hurt myself as definitely goal number one, and get a pump as followed that. So, if that just means four sets of laying leg curls, and go hard, get a burn, know that I did push myself for my current sort of circumstance. And then some leg extensions with some cyscizy squads as a drop set, you know, certainly not even close to the most weight and my tension that my quads could feel on like a max exertion crazy heavy set of squats. Like I'm not even getting close to that. The amount of quads work that I'm getting from like crazy squats, mid-bulk. I mean, I'm not sure how you could quantify it, but it's probably like, cumulatively, as much as it's being done and like all of these sets kind of combined. Now, maybe not exactly the amount of that amount of that abrupt, but it's just not necessary for an aim at four, right? Which is a little bit of a downer for me, because that's kind of the fun part of the training. I feel like right now the training intensity side of things is getting pushed onto the back burner a little bit, because the trickiest part for me right now, the hardest part, is the diet, right? Not eating in a food, or not eating too much food, right? So the training is, I mean, it's going to be done, it's doing it's serving its purpose, but it doesn't have to be absolute balls to the wall muscular destruction. This is where I'm definitely going to agree with the stimuli, don't annihilate, kind of crowd when they talk about working out, because yeah, that's what I'm aiming for, stimulation. Now, fast forward, you know, three, four months, once I'm getting into a legit surplus and I'm chowing down on all sorts of rice, ramen and everything else, so I'm talking treats will be included within reason. Then yeah, I'm going to be trying to go as nuts as possible, because my results are going to be pretty much determined on how big of a stimulus can I give myself in the gym, and then can I recover from that? On my, you know, out of my, outside the gym or team, right, diet, sleep, hydration, everything else. So as long as the food is being consumed, which, I don't want to speak too early, but to give it to my track record, I've never had a problem with the bulking side of things in terms of my calorie intake, then there's no reason to hold back when it comes to the weights, but right now, not so much, certainly some reason to hold back, get a pump, go hard, be a little bit more, a little bit more controlled on a set by set basis, which is definitely a good thing. A little bit of a break for my knees and my joint to everything else, and I still, uh, make some little reset, because as much food as I'm eating in as much as I can recover, when I'm going too crazy with the weights, constantly every left, it's still, excuse me, definitely kind of accrues some kind of stresses and everything else. So that's one reason I like the bulking and cutting side of things, apart from just the fact that I feel for me, it's my fastest track towards getting bigger, is it's a nice little break, you know, you are almost in season in the training and then off season in the training. But now I can tell I'm just getting a little bit rambly. If I had a, if I had a little blood glucose monitor with me, I'm sure I'm in a very healthy range, I'm talking maybe a little bit too low, right? Because I'm not a huge pre-workout meal or anything else like that. But more than enough food to get a solid leg pump, and I'm hoping to see some brand new veins, cut striations and all sorts of separation and everything else from need a hip. So now that's left to do is the work ethic is going to result in perhaps not a skin splitting pump, but certainly something close to it. So I think no more gent, it's just going to be going to happen. Not even the whole stack, but with these leg curls at the top of every rep, I really want there to be like a momentary. Oops, even if you can't really see it, like two guys can do the exact same set at the same tempo, but for just a moment at the top, like imagine this is my leg. If they have an extra little squeeze, I feel they're going to get more and that set. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Few more just like that. Methods you complicated. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, okay. Two more like that. And then I'll do a fancier, light a squeeze in the set. One more basics that way, then. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I think one more squealing set. And that'll be it for haps. Short squeak. I think a little five, five, five style. Will be perfect in some finisher. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I think that's it. Let's start with some blank extensions and then go from there with quads. Instead of doing the 5, 5, 5 style, let's just take legs to failure. Left to failure, then right to failure. Go from there. Turn it to the inside. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Just like that. A little heavier for the set. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. One more simple one right there. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Let's do some alternating more burnish stuff next. This will be left side, right side, right side, right side. But instead of nasty pumpish, fast reps, much slower with a much more intentional squeeze and up at the top of each one. And as such, a bit lighter. There we go. There we go. There we go. There. There. There. There. There. There we go. There. There. There we go. There we go. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. I think that's all. Give me a moment to really decide. There's one more. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There.

There we go. Okay. Playing for today and insanely early lift. This is crazy. It's 1120 and not 1120 PM in some kind of weird apocalyptic like night sun kind of situation. Early ascortial. And then a reasonably timed lift. So only one pre-workout meal and then added up being a bagel, buttered with 10 grams with the fat of butter as well as 50 grams of protein of egg whites, salt and pepper style, reasonably plain. So it's really just a classic breakfast for breakfast. Which I know is kind of, that's not really much point to say in that sort of twice. But I really do feel like there is a, there's this misconception that you can't just eat regular fucking food. The out of everything calorie wise and planning and protein, simple portion control has got to be the most valuable fucking skill that you can get as a lifter. And then just as a dude, everyone has got to eat. Everybody's got to get a certain amount of calories in and your body is going to run off of what you end up eating. So it's at least worth thinking about. And in my case, that's not so much of like trying to optimize my, like baseline markers or whatever. It's eating for the purpose of the muscular gains that I'll be able to get from a certain bulking kind of diet and then muscle maintenance while I get leaner from a calorie deficit. But it's, you know, it's serving a very specific purpose for me. And if you can manipulate your calorie intake and not just purely each shit because you're, you're hungry for it. I'm, at least lifting wise. I can promise you that is going to improve your performance. With legs, nothing too crazy. Handstrings first laying curls seated curls, RDLs presumably on the Smith machine. And then quads will just be, we'll just be whatever kind of feels right. I'm trying not to overdo it with the weight on quads simply because in a deficit, I, it's like I can hit my quads too hard. And what I mean by that is like if I hit him as hard as I fucking possibly can, even just to regular like seven total set workout form, then I end up overdoing it. And I'm like putting extra stress on my knees and my adductors and just, I think there's no, no point to like a 14 plate set of leg press, even if I could do it fine, just because it's going to end up being so damaging and stressful that by the time I come back to do legs the next day or at least the next plan like day, I can't even do quads. At least not in the same fucking way before. So that's where I don't mind taking quads a little bit easier. And I still want to hit him as hard as I can, but I have to take into consideration that recovery component as well. But hamstrings I can pretty much thrashes hard as I want. And I'll be back for hamstrings again. Next leg day pretty much for sure. Now that's not the same. I'm trying to completely recommend pulling anything, but I do want to stimulate them as much as fucking possible. So, you get pretty much clears up what's about to go down. And we stop just yapping about it and get straight to business. Alright, let's not be too crazy. So we just a moderate, second-ish hold of the top swings get a laying crout. I've been starting with a lot of cdc, so even though it is only a minor change, it is still changing up. So let's, uh, one not check it out. No. One more just like that. Men and women. Maybe too. You So, I'm hoping that the audio didn't cut out for the last couple of sets. I think it didn't, but either way, whatever. Just change the workout. So, leg extensions, I want to ease into it this time. Not just go fucking crazy, false-dax, single leg, that's nuts. I'm talking 115. So the equivalent of 230 double leg, and then I want to do five reps on one side, five on the other. Very like, thoughtfully done. Like, I'm not just doing five like that. Like I want to fold, squeeze, and extra hard contraction, and then a reasonably slow negative of these. Because this is not only serving as like working set number one, but it's also kind of a primer. So before I jump on anything else, I'm going to feel and extra warm and ready for it. But let's go nuts here with reasonably lightweight, and then, uh, so the heads and the right. No. Okay. Alright. Let's go a little heavier for the next one. That is a fucking sweet start. Uh... Yeah.benben!! whoo Alright, let's pick the same weight, but for this set let's make him a little nassier. Let's do some machine like press nice. Not too heavy. This is the stack load. Not the plate load anyone. Okay, so not the heaviest set ever, but it will be a good one. One thing I really like about this machine something about the seat angle. I can still get a ton of quantic division with zilch for glutes. But let's just grab the stack here. And this is going to be a bit more of lengthy kind of set. This isn't like a six reps and eight reps and then that's failure. Like I'm going to be in about 15 inch range for sure and I'm really trying to like get pretty deep to the point where especially with my legs this pumped. I have to kind of like pull the seat into the stretch position. But let's just go nuts here. Where do I put this? Good oop Mmm Whoa. Do it. Let's go back to ligate extensions. Get in this. Like that wasn't a bad set, but I kind of kind of feel it in my upper right quad. Like right next to where it ties into my hips. And since the ligate extensions, you're not doing that. Just go burn out a few more thumbs. And then that'll be good. Oh. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's good. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right. So certainly not the craziest lift ever. But pump wise. Yes, I don't think I'm going to be very disappointed. Now of course there's no way to know that. And so we actually check that. But simply based on the feeling alone. Let's just say there's some blood flow. There's been some blood flow that has occurred. So let's let's just see to what actual extent. Now hamstrings got hit very well. Quads I just said, the pump the brakes on. Just a touch. Just a touch. But even with being a little bit less intense than normal. It's still appear to have reached the reasonably fucking pump state. Oh. You're okay. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So right here I'm trying to smush my hamstring up against itself to make it look extra big and fucking round. And the leaner you get the more pronounced that that sort of thing is going to become. But even fully pumped. Reason all that separation. That little bit of quad feathering, which was done to be revealed a couple of list of go with unpumped quads. Has now disappeared. And that's just the nature of having a fucking quiet apartment. And as you get, I mean you basically just swell up. You're not, you're not so defined and separated. But even so. Man. There's like a very pinchable layer of fat here. And once that is close to the like, you know, forearm level leanness. Because I mean my forearms. I can see all sorts of little like individual fibers and stuff. And I attribute a lot of this backside of the forearm games to doing those reverse. Forearm curls even just with like 10 pound dumbbells. But yeah, once my legs start to get as lean as my arms are. Or I can see like some arm veins and some separation that would be else. Then I'll really be in for a fucking treat. But plan for the rest of the day. Clean up the house basically. Eat my meals. Don't exceed my calorie deficit. And then just go from there. When, as long as though as as long as those three things are met, then I can go to sleep and know on a montrack towards the things I want to make for the cap. But you know it's all you got. It's gonna human back to the car. All right. Yeah. Good lift. Basically succeeded in the fucking goal I wanted to achieve. Pump my quads up. Activate them. Make sure they don't shrink down over the course of this dieting phase. Which of course I mean, I don't think they're gonna. At least not to a seriously noticeable degree. And now just. Not the fucking most positive. You know, this feels like that clip of. His mind's been an old mic mentor quote from one of his. Either a lecture or some kind of something. He's got all sorts of archives of all his. Well, his talks and things, but he basically says. Or one of his clients are talking to him. And one of the clients goes, well. We only worked out for 20 minutes. What the hell if I supposed to do for the rest of the nation to stay longer. You know, and mics fucking nice like baffled. He's like, what are you talking about? You don't know what to do with the rest of your day. Whatever the hell you want, man. He's like, you could start studying. You could start looking into. Whatever, like art. And it's like to the lift or that's. You know, you got to be a little more multi-faceted than just the workout for sure. But. Man, and an op-alpha and something. But good lift. Much better on the hamstring side of things. Yeah, I'm starting to feel a little bit. That's the way I self sabotage the touch from my last leg days when I was doing those extra heavy leg press. Obviously it feels cool to do, but it's I'm paying the price now. My quasi's so sore. And not so on like a tired way, so on like kind of a tender sort of way, which is not what I want at all. That's the complete opposite of what I want my stimulation from these lifts to be like, I want pumps. I want fatigue. I want tired. And I want recoverable as well. So if the. You know, if the meal or that was a good thing. So if the training is pushing it beyond. Recovery, at least within the scheme of like a working out twice a week situation. And it's. Simply doing something fucking wrong. So. Try to hold me to it. Don't let me go too crazy or quize. Oh, over these next coming months. And get a pump. Don't pretty hard. Don't go too hard. Don't go too hard to the point of injury. And that would suck. I don't want to make it better. Knock on the. Maybe take word of the camera. Can't re-medium. But meal wise. Yeah. I've been. I've been sticking to the girl, man. I've been sticking to the girl and it's been working. And what I mean by that is just like mixing a base carb like. You know, be it rice or actually should mainly rice. You know, for breakfast or something, sometimes I'll get the like a bag or something. And then the like oatmeal. I'm not going to mix the oatmeal with like grand beef. But with most of the regular kind of meals like past breakfast into dinner. It's just rice with some kind of protein mix in heated. And then. You know, some kind of sauce or some fat free cheese mixed in. You can. And it works because I can have like a 600 calorie bowl, which is about 25% of my caloric intake. That means I get to eat four of those throughout the day of, you know, 50 grams of rice or 50 grams of carbs worth of rice. 50 grams of protein. Maybe more like 60. Sometimes I snack on some proteins. So I've got like some beef sticks in the fridge or, you know, I might just scoop out some ground beef. That is a separate way and have that contribute towards my, towards my daily protein intake. But you know, 50 grams of carbs, 50 a protein ish. Maybe 20, 15 or so of fats. When I add the like the sauce or whatever cooking oil was involved or anything like that. And then, you know, just kind of makes the whole thing up together. You got a pretty filling meal and it's not particularly exciting. I mean, it's very. It's very much akin to like, even like a dog, you know, same shit all the time. But, you know, that's just the point, you know. That's what makes the, that's what makes this deficit a little bit easier to stick to. So it's a given take, you know, the give is I get a filling meal that tastes like a little bit more. That tastes reasonably good for me, at least, you know, your results may vary depending on your cooking skills and your seasoning and whatever. But to the take is it's pretty plain. No, it's not that. Not insanely exciting. So there is definitely some benefit to the, to the phrase when these guys are like, well, you know, now you're for enjoyment, bro. I mean, for fuel. I mean, for fuel, I don't care how it tastes. You know, that's sort of thing. So with everything, usually it's not a one set of the other type argument. You know, it's kind of a usually a gradient somewhere in between is where that right answer is. So if you actually want to stick to a calorie deficit, then, you know, you can have some food that tastes pretty good. You can't have that much of it. So you got to be a little tougher with your tracking. And also, if you, uh, was a way. So yeah, so you can have food that's kind of good taste. If you track your calories, you make sure you don't over shoot, you don't go crazy with it. But, you know, sometimes you do have to be a bit stern with yourself and say, okay, man, shit. It's three o'clock. I've already eaten 1500 calories today. I only get 2200 for my daily alignment. If I want to keep losing a pound of body kind of weak or so, then, crap. I better not slam those remaining 700 calories in four seconds so that I can actually have some food to eat before I go to bed. Because for me, at least, my number one goal with my deficit on a day by day basis, obviously it's to stay in my deficit. But that's not an answer, right? That's just kind of, that's just obvious. So what I'm trying to do to make that go more achievable is to leave some calories for later. Right? I want to have, at least, a thousand calories or so left to be split between my last two meals or last big meal of the night if I feel like a bigger one. Because for me, to go to bed hungry, just doesn't fucking work, right? I might sit and turn, or maybe if I'm a little more restless and kind of letting myself get the better of me or letting my phone get the better of me. And it's in here scrolling. But likely, I'm just going to stay awake extra long, thinking about food a little bit. Just not even like, man, like, oh, man, I gotta get some crumb like I'm not even talking totally feeding for it. But if I'm just thinking about it in the back of my mind, and I can feel that I'm hungry, I'm still awake. And I'm just going to get up and go to the kitchen and grab some kind of something. It's in increases. It's simply increases. There's no way to get around. So if I can be a bit more responsible during the day with my calorie intake, then come nighttime, you know, come nine o'clock in night. If I've got a thousand calories left, there is basically a hundred percent chance that I'm going to stick to my deficit without blowing over. Because I can make that thousand calorie stretch. And depending on what food I eat, that could be a very billing meal. And then I get to go to bed, you know, sometimes with like a really full stomach. You know, like if I've got a full thousand calories left, and I make a big ol' bowl of like rice, ground beef, some low-sugar barbecue sauce, some fat-free cheese melted in. And then maybe you can do a couple of low-carb, like keto bread, buns on the side, and even like a sloppy joe. That can be an insanely filling fucking meal. So that's what I'm aiming for. And that's just, you know, that's not a, I do think that that's a good approach for anybody. Like, it just makes sense to me, but maybe it only makes sense to me. Like, for me, that approach works pretty well, but maybe you're going to do better if you eat like evenly sized meals, very evenly dispersed throughout the day. I don't mind three meals a day. Like, I don't mind a reasonably big, you know, 800 calorie per workout meal, maybe an hour and a half, two hours before I lift a similarly sized post-workout meal, and then like a big meal a night. Like, that's totally fine for me. You know, is that perfectly optimal instead of eating six smaller meals at two hour intervals? I don't think the difference is insanely huge. So, you know, for me, that works, but if for you, you know, if you can't go two hours without eating something, you're having some kind of plate, then you might want to start eating more food, but not more calories. So, what I mean by that is make use of making use of some vegetables, man, make use of the fluff. I can have a big ass bowl of like a pre-chopped, like Caesar salad or like a mixed green salad or something. And I've definitely thrown, I'm not so deep in the deficit yet that I'm doing it, but this is a pretty good trick I like doing, because I'll take a full bag, like I don't know how many servings just let us in, like, it's really just water and like some five versus not much coloric value. Apart from like some micronutrients. But all the full bag of that makes together some kind of fat-free dressing. And then, you know, if I've got a 50 gram protein bowl of ground beef with a little bit of fat-free cheese, then I'll eat that whole salad first. Maybe adding up to like 20 grams of carbs total, maybe, usually like 15. And then I've already got a ton of stuff in my stomach, which is given my body to the cue saying, okay, you get a lot of food in your man. You're getting close to full. And then when I finish that half pound of ground beef or turkey or whatever, then I really feel like I've had a full stomach. And I can go back whatever the hell else I want to do without feeling like I got to come back to the kitchen and get more. So, it's not only a question of like making sure that these meals are enjoyable enough where you're not just going crazy for sweets on a meal by meal. But also, so that you're full enough for long enough where you don't feel like you have to come to the kitchen 30 minutes later and start grabbing some crew times. Or start grabbing some cheese or some goldfish or whatever kind of like random snack you've got lying around. Because those are the hot ticket items which love to creep into your diet and add calories. They are sneaky. You wouldn't think that one little handful of goldfish would screw you over. And maybe you're right. One small handful might be like 10 grams of carbs or 12, you know, 12, maybe 15 or something like 70 calories. 70 calories is probably within the realm of variability of your daily intake anyway because a lot of these nutrition labels aren't even like 100% accurate. There is a little bit of like, you know, up and down with some of them. But, you know, sure one handful might not mess with it. What happens is throughout the day you don't even think about it and you've hit five handfuls and some of those handfuls turn into two handfuls. And then maybe you didn't even just do one, you reached around, you were snacked around in the cupboard, right. Even though you might seem like you're in a safe place, nobody can see you doing it. It's just you and the snacks. Yes, what? It's got repercussions. And all those little handfuls add up potentially to like five or six hundred calories easily. And then, you know, you might think you're in a deficit and you tracked everything else. But it's just those little things that you didn't track, which are now screwed you. So that's why I can't help but highlight the necessity of what may feel like a bit of the OCD style approach with the calorie tracking because all of these calories really do add up. There's no way to get around it except for trying to count them all. So that's not to say that you can't have random snacks like that. You know, if I'm coming home from the lift, or if I do send a shit workout in the venue machine has like, you know, some random protein bar. I might say, huh, I'm kind of hungry. I like how that protein bar tastes sort of like a way for cookies with some chocolate coatings. Okay. I like that. You got bang and I wanted to pay the dollar fifty for like double price if you got it in the store. And then I flip it over, read the nutrition label, okay, 12 grams of fat, 15 grams of carbs, 10 grams of protein, boom. And that just adds into my, you know, overall total for the day. Now that's not to say that I want to eat my entire, you know, daily calories from that kind of food. I'm really trying to maximize more plain foods, right? So like, ground beef like basically just wanting gradient things like that. Just makes me feel more full doesn't thrash my digestion. Like I think my gut biome has definitely improved in health from not only just eating less food, but also eating much more plain and simple foods. Like my ratio of treats to regular shit is like 90 to 10 right now. Like I feel pretty good. You know, I blood sugar's not over the place. But if I'm thinking of myself, I want a couple of scoops of better juries. I want to have them. Take the tub out, put it on your food scale, zero with, read out, okay, one serving is 200 calories and that's 46 grams. Okay, so if I have 26 grams or no, if I have a, if I have 21 grams of ice cream, one big scoop. Okay, I weighed it. Look guys, you're coming back and it's up. Dr. Macros. You can still completely be on track for your fat loss goals, man. You know, it's not necessarily a question of like, okay, you can never anything to make too good ever. And I think that's kind of a stigma that dieting gets unfortunately, just because, you know, most people who are really into dieting and working out are very like meat head-ish about it. I mean, the devil is a value to kind of a sort of simplistic brutal approach. You know, like stick to this plan, stick to it consistently, you get the results from it. But he doesn't have to be so torturous. You know, there's a, there's a lot of ways to skin that cat of dieting. So, that's how he got him. I could probably go on to, we can hours about the calorie counting. I should, I should see if I could do a TED talk about it. Let me really funny. But, legs pumps, I'll definitely feel him tomorrow. Especially on those leg extensions, I was really feeling sort of tear-droppy kind of a kind of hell of a question. So, the quadricep, I don't know, I don't know all the names of the insertions. But the tear-dropper was really squeezing at the top of those leg extensions, I bet I'm going to feel that tomorrow too, especially during the, during 35 minutes of cardio on the bike. But, I tell I got, I got chest tomorrow, which I'm already excited for. And then I've got back to the next day, which is get me going, I'm going to get arms the next day, and then leg the chest and then back and then arms the, and the loop continues. The loop continues to infinity. So, I will see it tomorrow for some hopefully crazy chest action.

Alright, not so much bright and early, more like freaking dark and early. I'll set my alarm for 5 o'clock, 515, and then 6. I kinda thought I was gonna sleep through the first two, but load behold, last is up. Yeah, it feels way cooler doing your cardio extra early. It doesn't change anything. I'm still gonna burn my regular 30 minutes and 300 or so calories. But there is kind of a cool misfactor of getting up extra early. Everybody else is asleep, well you're grind. But on a more real note, you just keep it better schedule like that. This is nice. So one little trick that helps me wake up a touch earlier. Even part of it is you just have to want to. When your alarm goes off, you kinda, well I don't even tell you this, you know. But you gotta have something you wanna do when you wake up. So, it's for each or two. What? I got a bunch of cold brew coffee like in the tub. You know, it's like a leader, leader in the half or so. Just plain cold brew coffee. And I had a bunch of zero calories, sweetener and cream. So that maze will have 250 milligrams of caffeine worth of, like a goddamn Starbucks drink. But, you know, not in a Starbucks cup. In a freaking empty gallon jug. Honestly, it felt kind of, well, tasted pretty good. But whether that was from, you know, that little kind of extra steps to make it a drink in the morning. Have it a monster or what I really think is the best is just get a little caffeine capsules. So instead of having to, you know, make something or, you know, a freaking monster is like two bucks. Which, whatever, but I mean, if you do want to a day for a long time, that kind of shit has up, you know. And it's like, Jesus Christ. You go back over your, you go back over your, like, if you could see your product specific spending for like a whole year. It's like, what the hell? Let's say, let's say, so it needs to two monsters a day. It's like, like, a $1,500 that year on monsters. Oh, but yeah, so I tried to just slam one of those instantly. Somehow get some caffeine in my system and have some kind of tub of water next to, with electrolytes typically. So a leader, so, a leader, so some kind of electrolytes water paired with something caffeinated, or even just like a little 200-millimeter caffeine capsule. That's what I try to get down basically instantly. So I already had that ready, makes it all, I mean, that little coffee thing tonight. But I had that water jug with the electrolyte makes already ready. So as soon as I get up instantly, sit up, slam it, then move on. But, plan for, yeah, plan for today after this cardio, just trying to have a bit of an earlier chest day later. And then let's do some, let's do a little bit of pose and down as well. So this will be a good baseline look. And it's pretty drastic how, uh, well, forgive me for the on-hand edge of wake up. But it's pretty drastic how different I can look, unpumped in the morning versus pumped up later tonight. Like to the point where it's pretty fucking serious change. You know, so I think I'm gonna, I'll try to do the exact same poses. So I'll do the same like front-lats, front-lats, front-side chest and stuff, and I'll line them up side by side. I guess I don't want to spoil it, so I'll save that for the chest pump later after the actual workout. But, I mean, not only veins wise, but physically wise. Pretty crazy. So that's where it's, you know, it's like as good of a reference for my leanness as the little check-ins are unpumped underfed, like just waking up. It's not exactly doing me the same justice as looking at yourself extra pumped up, at least in a like a bodybuilding show context. Because you don't just roll into there completely flat, and you know, just hop up like mountain like you do kind of, you do got some pumping up activations in the beginning. So that's where even though I feel like my chest is a little bit behind, relative to everything else. As they chest and arms are, some two parts I really want to bring up over the course of time. If it just gets a pump it up specifically, then you can kind of counteract that, you can counteract that weakness because you can simply make it fucking bigger. At least for a little bit. But don't get too fooled by looking at yourself pumped up, right? Try to stay reasonably grounded because it's crazy in sick as it is to see yourself fully vainly, vascularized, but just striations or whatever. And depending on how lean you are, you can have like much more detail when you're pumped up versus unpumped. So don't forget men, you are just you, right? That's pretty much as true as you can fucking say. But with a little more explanation, it's like you just need to take in the consideration the full context of, you know, wherever you are and keep that in mind if you're judging yourself based on how you look at the time. Right? Because not only just on a pump to buy unpumped basis, I think some guys get a bit. You get really say spoiled by seeing themselves fully pumped up and extra cool lighting and, like ever, you got to, you physically took pre-workout, which makes you more vainly and gives you extra kind of blood flow and everything else. It's like, yeah, obviously you're going to look extra crazy. But then you come back to, you know, your regular normal walk around and kind of look. And that doesn't take away from the fact that you look extra crazy when you're pumped up, but don't make it feel like you're coming, don't make your pumped up state feel like normal. And then you have to like come down to an unpumped version where you're going to call a feeling shit right now. It's like, no, man, you should feel normal just walking around. You should feel extra crazy when you're pumped up. And that's, of course, that's going to be easier for me to say, get some already, that's such like a vass level. But even when I was younger, like I never looked at myself unpumped as like 160 pounder and thought like fuck. Oh, it's my last or way too small. It's like, even if I did think that, I knew that I was working out and, you know, eating my food. I wasn't so good about meal tracking back to that, but I did know. And part of it was maybe just like delusion. I wasn't based on anything, but I was pretty convinced from the get-go, like right in the beginning. The harder I work out and the longer I work out, the bigger I'm going to get. So I'm just going to keep that up for as long as necessary. And so far we're six years deep and apparently I still haven't satisfied that need for more softness. And it doesn't look like it's going to be satisfied for at least a considerable while longer. So I, yeah. I don't know exactly what I was thinking right in the beginning, but I definitely had no idea that this is going to take me down. This exact path, which I'm on now, but I am fucking grateful for it. So speaking of that, it's Thanksgiving, right? It's Thanksgiving, but it's time this video will be posted. So yeah, I'll get into, I'll get into a bit more of it in the specific things you've talked. I totally forgot about that. But either way, I'm going to go pop a squat on the Recome Ben Bike, or if it's taken, I will just do the regular seated bike or something for 30 minutes. And then let's just jump straight to the straight to the yoga room. Get some, get some un pumped posing done. All right. 35 minutes in change. Not the hardest thing in the world. I got a little bit of sweat going on, but part of that was because I had to use the seated bike. So instead of kind of having a recline position, I was standing a little bit more upright. So it almost makes you, I guess it's almost like I got more ventilation coming up the shirt. Because on the seated bike, I'm almost laying back a little bit because the pedals are more in front of you. And it kind of shuts off all my kind of interest shirt air flow, meaning the extra sweaty. I should have brought shorts for a little bit of a good little more kind of leg exposure, but what do you want to do? So 35 minutes, 300 in something calories. I'm not running the marathon here. I'm not doing anything too crazy. It's crazy enough to break its wet. It's crazy enough to get my heart up. I'm not just, it is like an active thing. I'm not sitting here like completely mindless. Having a difficulty set at two. And then doing that for 30. It's not going to cut it. It will take a little bit of effort. But it's nothing like a fucking run, man. This is not like do eight laps on the track. It's just pedal. My heart rate's probably actually, I think I might need to start up in the intensity. So I can get up in maybe like the 140 range. But I'm floating around like 135 for the full 35 minutes. That's about right. So it's not a, I don't have like a formula. But usually what I stick to is about 30 minutes or so baseline. That's bulking or cutting down at a difficulty where if I pedal at like a regular specific, I end up pedaling like 85 RPM. Ish. I pick a difficulty where I burn. Early with the machine says I burn is 10 calories a minute. And then 30 minutes 300 calories. That just feels about right. You know, it's some machines are going to be a little bit harder. Like if you can tell you're using the same settings like difficulty nine, 80 RPM and your pedaling and you're not feeling anything, then you wouldn't want to up it a little bit. But that's for, I guess that's only a tip for anybody who's already doing their cardio. So it might be a smaller percentage than I would like. But let's, let's run through a couple of impose. So even just standing like trying to, yeah, totally abs like reasonably relax. The apartment just like the activation of standing up. And we're getting somewhere. I'm, I got to, I got to go back and get a look at a clip of like the beginning of this dieting phase. But just standing here. Yeah, we are looking far leaner. Plus getting into a little bit more of a like wide shoulders relax pose. Yeah, it's sweet. So instantly, what's the start of dieting down? And it dropped like 12 pounds. That was not like in a week. That was not 12 pounds of fat. Those are not 12 pounds of water only. And it wasn't just 12 pounds of muscle either. Half of what it was. That's at least five or so pounds over the course of those couple days. We're just extra kind of food, flow and enemy. You know, because if you're eating upwards of 5,000, you know, into the five and a half, thousands calories per day, it's kind of just a constant stated digestion. You know, even throughout the night into the morning, if I'm eating a ton of food, I ain't up still having something like residually working my way through me. So after a few days of, you know, a more chill intake, like 25, 3000ish. Yeah, probably come back 3000 in the beginning of this dieting phase. Now my stomach's much more empty, right? Like I got nothing in there. So that's one boost for anything posing related. If you got an empty stomach, that's when you're going to want to practice a vacuum. But we'll have what we talk about that in a second. Just run through your supposes in here. So I'm trying to get my arms in like the exact same angle to each other. Sometimes I got a tendency of leaving this right one out a little more like this. So that's where this little camera set up helps a lot because I'm kind of copying like a posing room set up. Is that what I really love. There's this mirror and then I love one behind me overhead a little bit of downward angle. Because then I'd be able to see myself backward, same thing over here. So if you ever look back at your posing shots and then maybe you set up your tripod or something. And you're like a little off kilter or maybe you get a little lean. Having a little reflector like that is going to help. So no one legit benefit of busting out the tripod. You know you put it in front of you selfie camera facing the mirror. For any back pose, if you've got it like maybe right here above your like shooting through this gap between your head and your arm. You can adjust those little nuances. And as much as it's like you can look at the picture in the just seeing yourself while you're doing one of those. Very different because it's so much easier, you know, but yeah back is getting considerably leaner, especially. All this freaking is where it's separating like lower erectors to where my lap like actually inserts. I'm getting really excited to be like peeled in the back because I'm definitely lean. But especially like down here, there's a pretty pinchable layer of stuff which right now is only serving to like muffle all this kind of fanciness down here right in the waist. And as these weeks pass, every pound that I continue to lose is going to be more impactful into like the fucking freak factor because I mean, I've referenced this before. If you've got to lose a hundred pounds of fat. If you lose one pound, that's only a one percent change. But after you've lost enough to the point where maybe you're in the 20 pounds of excess fat range, one pound of fat now that's a 5 percent change. You get down and you got 10 pounds of fat left that you want to get off like you're getting lean now. Every pound they lose is a 10 percent boost in your leanness. So it's, that's probably one of the only things in training where the more advanced you get. The faster the rate of return ends up being. But it's also trickier because of course, obviously to lose any amount of weight is going to be a little bit hard. And those last few pounds are definitely a bit lose or they're a bit harder to lose. So greater reward, not greater risk, but like more difficulty to get it. But let me do, let's see what else is there. Oh, and then maybe yeah, yeah vacuum or am I thinking, and then after this we get into here. So this is where I'm really trying to blow all the air out of my, out of my lungs, not only like regular, but I kind of crunch down. And I really sense my abs and it kind of just helps squeeze those last little bits out. There's every breath you can blow out means more of a deeper vacuum and a crazier ratio of your waist to shoulder. And in terms of executing it. It's really just practice, you know, everyone knows how to like kind of suck in their stomach a little. So if you just keep doing it with a little more, a little more, you will get used to it. But if you ever try to practice that in the morning before you beat anything is the time. I would never even want to try a crazy vacuum with a full stomach, you just wouldn't even work like I'd sit here like. I said, I'd have too much food in here to even, to even move it around. Oh my goodness, alright. Cardio complete. Bad ass, pumpless, pose down complete. So now I just get to go home, eat a couple of meals. And then how about I meet you in the car on the way to chest in a couple hours. How to do a little, how to do a little check to make sure there's still open. Yeah, regular hours, regular freaking hours tomorrow be a little different. Because tomorrow will really be Thanksgiving. So I guess if you're watching this video that I got posted tomorrow for me is today for you. We give the gist, but yeah, so I'm going to try not to go too crazy. I guess I should talk about tomorrow now. But when it comes to the Thanksgiving meal, I really meals, can't imagine around a couple. I'm not going to go crazy, I'm not going to go insane. And that may sound me even saying that may sound kind of wild. I'll get a lot of comments where it's Sam. Why would you ever want to do a dieting phase during the holiday season? How the hell are you going to do it? Because you got Thanksgiving, you got Christmas, you got New Year's, you got anything else in between where eating a lot of food is pretty much part of the fucking course. And you would be right, you definitely not wrong. But what the heck, man? Just because everybody else is doing something doesn't mean you have to. It gets kind of tricky, that's for sure. I mean peer pressure is not a negligible component of your day, but there are tricks. There are little tricks that I'm going to employ to make sure I don't completely blow my calorie deficit out of the water. So for one, I only have, actually doing a couple days of Thanksgiving. I've got like the first day up to, I think, the third day of Thanksgiving kind of spread across a few. But my plan to at least make sure I get to have a reasonably sized meal is to save calories for later. It's not going to kill me to do like 500 calories as a later in the day like pre-work at meal. So let's say I worked out a four clock. I might skip breakfast, skip everything, like drinks and water and electrolytes of course actually still be hydrated. But only have my first meal at like two. 500 maybe make it 600 so it's reasonably sized. I just that sort of, you know, kind of reap the benefits of getting some extra carbs into my system. Go hit whatever that lift is. We're just going to be back. And then come back straight to Thanksgiving dinner. You know, because I can work out a four, that's probably not really even going to be back in shower and then going to my parents house until like six or maybe even six thirty seven when it's kind of a bad to start. And then I've got 2,000 calories left in the tech or so. And a 2,000 calorie plate is very large. I don't even anticipate eating a 2,000 calorie plate. I'll definitely eat a good chunk. I've used at least my level of guest-dominating skills on like how many grams of fats and carbs and proteins I'll eat. But by saving some calories from earlier the day until later I can kind of, you know, even though it might feel like a big plate of food right then, if you didn't really eat much beforehand, it's not going to be that trick, you know? So one more thing is when I actually get to my Thanksgiving plate, it is going to be very protein focused. You know, I'm talking a lot of turkey. I'm talking a lot of ham. I'm talking a lot of maybe just some kind of green vegetable. Maybe I'll have my mom make it kind of broccoli. Go, go real bodybuilders style. Have a huge ass. I'll have broccoli next to the protein stew. And then I'll have to back off in the devil's eggs a little bit. I'll still have a couple. Historically, I have my sister will take pictures of me sometimes. Or I've got a full size dinner plate. And half of it down the middle is like, you know, basically six whole eggs with the devil eggs. So like 12 of them in a little spread. Cut that down to like two, so four halves. But it can be done. It doesn't have to be so crazy. And, you know, if you really don't want to think about it, there is value in finding a ratio where you can actually stick to a legit deficit for however long. And then every so often, you can say to yourself, okay, I don't want to worry about calories today. I just want to eat what I'm hungry for. You don't go too crazy and do like a 10,000 calorie fucking challenge. If you eat an extra, you know, 1,500 calories above your deficit, like one day out of like the month. Or like one day out of every three weeks. And I know that doesn't, that sounds pretty sparse, which you definitely is. You can do that. You know, you're not going to immediately gain four pounds of fat. Really on a refeed day like that. Game much fat at all. All you'll really end up doing is filling back up with carbs and glycogen and water. At least as long as you didn't eat like an extra, you know, 10,000 calories above your maintenance. So, you know, you'll fill back up. You will gain some weight that morning. You might be two or three pounds heavier. But it's nothing that can't be sort of tuned back into your routine. Frankly, I do a refeed every so often. Usually I just time it to when I'm feeling like that. And I'm like, oh, how do you eat something? I'm fucking sure. Let's make today a refeed. Which usually is only like once a month at the, at the high end. But I haven't even really done one of those yet. And I'm almost a month and number two. No. But there is a value to it. You can't have to get your metabolism going again. Not that it ever stops. But you can't have a ramp up. So you're adding, you know, putting a few more sticks into the fire. It's going to burn a little bit hotter for a second. But what I don't like to see is The abuse of the word refeed Because, you know, somebody could say they're dieting. And it's a very easy excuse to just completely blow your deficit out of the water and tell yourself, and I really do mean tell yourself, guys, you're kind of lying themselves. I'll just make today a refeed day. Yeah, yeah, I had a couple refeed days last week. I'm still locked in them. I'm still getting leaner. Yeah, I think it's time for a refeed. Dude, the guy's not even dieting anymore. You know, he might do a few days of a deficit. But I think, yeah, it's not that crazy to say that a week of good dieting, you know, a week of a, basically 300 or so calorie deficit every day. So what that would mean is, like, if you're eating 20, let's say you need a 2500 calories a day to stay the exact same weight. Like, if you eat 2500 today, you will not gain weight, you will not lose weight. That's your maintenance. So if for a whole week, you're in a 300 calorie deficit, then across that week. Now, you basically just burned 3000 calories, ish on or from your internal energy stores, right? Your fats. Like, policies. If that burning, you know? So that's about a pound. A good way of measurement is usually 3000 calories or so, is about a pound of body fat. You know, so if you picked it, or no, no, no, no, no, no, my sin. 2,100 calories, yeah, week is not 10 days long. But if you're in a 300 calorie deficit for a whole week, seven whole days, you just burned 2100 calories from internal energy stores, from your fats. If that next day, you went crazy and you had a 45, a 4500 calorie day. You just completely blew your deficit, now you're way over, you know? Because when you're dining down, it's not just about how hard you dieted for one day or two days. There's three to, even five fucking days. It's about your prolonged average. So if for this entire, what's 50 divided by seven? That's seven. Seven in change. If for these last seven weeks, deficit, Monday through Saturday. And then Sunday, I just ate whatever I wanted to had a ton of food. I wouldn't have lost any fucking weight. I'd still be sitting at like 252, 255 or so. Like not bulking weight, but just maintain maintenance weight. Because if you looked at the average, I wouldn't be in a deficit. I'd still just be eating a calorie maintenance. So there are tricks to go about it. You know, there are insane. There's a lot of value to like eating specific meals and getting the low calorie buns and diet sodas and like saving breakfast for a little later in the day, shortening or eating window, biasing more filling foods. But you can't get around being hard on yourself in the sense that there is no work around being in a deficit. You know, increase your cardio, of course, that's going to help. Maybe increase your frequency of the gym. And by that, I mean, if you're lifting three times a week, if you started lifting four or five, you would be burning more energy throughout the week. That would help increase your average energy expenditure. But apart from, you know, increasing your activity level, the only fucking method I feel is controlling your calorie intake. So if you can't do it, then you got to figure out how. You know, and it's funny. I was just reading the comment by somebody. It was like, what the fuck happened to Sam? He used to eat so much fucking shit. And now he's like crazy strict. What happened? Well, dude, what happened is I'm dieting. You know, I'm kind of, it's like when I flip the switch, it flips pretty hard because bulking up. Like, I'm not, I'm in no way, am I saying this is the greatest method ever, right? But, me historically, if you eat enough food, you will start to gain fucking weight. You know, whether it's from the occasional canyac combo with some extra tenders, or if you're just doing straight rice and chicken, like a baller, if you eat enough food, you're going to keep growing. So, you know, I leaned, at least I have leaned a bit more towards the dirty side of things. My bulks are getting a bit cleaner, and I am starting to see the benefits. Just less stress on my whole system and my gut, and everything else. Like, the, all the, and if you've ever said like, Sam, you got to start eating more like conventional bodybuilders, style meals, like plain ingredients, oats, rice, potatoes. You're totally fucking right. You know, that is, it definitely helps. But it's still a question of if you eat enough food, you're going to grow. And if you stay within a certain limit of food, you're going to get leaner. It's no way around it. So, if you can flip the switch like that, it is going to do you good. Plus, it's, I almost feel like the harder you bulk, the easier it is to die down. Because for this first month of the dieting, it didn't even feel like I was trying it. Like, the first month of this dieting phase is just like a fucking relief, because I didn't have to eat so much food, because I was getting, like I was getting sick of it, it was just too much. So, it's like, it's like a little yin and yin kind of up and down, Evan Flow sort of thing. Because it's like, I bulk hard enough to the point where I'm like, so done with it that I'm ready to get into a deficit. And then I die down, usually hard enough, where at the end of it, I'm like, all right, I'm really ready to get bulk it up now. So there's never too much of a low, which, which is done me pretty. But in a, in a calorie talk, what's my plan for chest? I do have a plan. I at least I have, what was it about to say? Well, I've got a basic plan. You know, I've got an outline. It's, uh, some pressing of some variety, probably Smith machine, some cable, converging press with an inclined bench as such. And then some fly base movements, you know, and I might change the order things, but at its core, those are going to be the primary movements. And I'll still get these comments. It's like, you only did one heavy press. I mean, you know, I did like three sets of it. What's the, I don't think I'm going to get more out of chest if I do, like, two sets of inclined Smith, then two sets of hammer strength press, then two sets of dumbbell bench, then do like, do you pressing movement? Go hard, of course. But after I've done three or so sets of a heavy press, sometimes for if for whatever reason I've got some extra kind of strength and endurance on that day. But usually three at least in this deficit, it's like, okay, let's move on to something a bit more, direct squeezing, because I can feel my chest on a press. But I can feel it a lot more. I'm like a cable squeezing kind of press, or a peck fly kind of thing. So, I mean, your bicep does your chest doesn't know that it's doing a dumbbell bench, or if it's doing a Smith venture barbell, it knows if it's getting wrecked. So, if you want to have a workout where you do ten different movements, if you're fully pumped at the end of it, and you're growing, you're good. But usually I like to keep it a little bit simpler. And then that helps me keep the workout moving a little faster, because all the time that you're unloading machines, and loading machines, and moving from this to that to here, and then you're waiting for this guy to be done. It, you know, just taking time and energy away from what you should be focusing on. You've set by set basis, f***ing hype. But no more chatting. Let's just get started. No lift off of nothing. I think I might have like 12. I'll see you here. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, let's go. Whoop. Probably there's one more of those. Yeah. Yeah, still going on. That's enough of that. Reasonably light. Very squeeze focused. And I want to get a beep stretch at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One more. Same weight. Same freaking weight. No. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Let's see one more a little lighter then move on to some kind of fly. move on. All right, let's do some flies. Let's do some heavy-ish bent-over flies. Much more pumping style fashion, because after those heavy sets of pressing, and then the solid squeezing stretch-focused sets of the cable press, my primary concern right now is to give as much blood in my Texas possible. And some good stretch flies with a hard squeeze, I like it. I most certainly fucking like it. Wait within a reason, but still reasonably have to do. All right. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah. That was good. Next, it'll be a slightly different execution. But honestly, I didn't get after that. I could, yep. Let's do some early style flies first, and then finish with some deep-lying flies, sort of as a super-setting style action. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Money make this a triple drop set. No. That's good. Oh. Yeah. Let's go pose this shit down, man. We done. Just completes. Just complete to a satisfactory degree. He thought it was going to say, saddest, ethonth factory degree. Try not to, I promise. I don't swear so much in regular life. Something about the one on one here just gets me going. But basically exactly what I predicted. Heavy pressing, squeezing pressing, and then fly base stretched up at the end. Guess what? That is a certain recipe. That's a recipe for a freaking pump. And let's just say it's time to pull out of the oven and see what we're working with. And as these lifts progress, or at least chest-wise. My chest will only continue to get more and more separated and vein-y and, like, and strike-y. And everything else under the sun. I'm excited for it. But I mean, I kind of, that goes with that saying. So let's just, let's see what we're working with. Oh. Oh, yeah. I promised that it'd be far just then, as little like armpit action. And then, I'm going to do this. Oh, okay. That was officially the vanias pose of this diet. I've seen fucking stars after that. Be careful about doing a flex where you really won't your breath. I'm fucking squeeze like that. Especially after hard lifts. And if you're carb-depleted from having dieted down, you need fucking pass out for real. I've taken a wobbly step after a, you know, vani can pump, pump-check like that. So be mindful, be mindful, not joke. That's why the deadlift, you guys. They'll finish your deadlift and then, okay. Just a little bit of, hmm. What you call that? Rapid onset hypoxia? Not exactly, but whatever. So one of us says they're chest-wise. Maybe just classic double-buy. Oh, man. All right. Let's get one more little relax, most muscular. I know what you have here. So shoulders are beginning to get more and more straightened, which is good for me. And that will just continue to kind of increase and freaking this factor as time progresses. So right now it's kind of just in a waiting game, you know? I'm dropping weight at the rate that I want. I'm staying, you know, a size that I'm comfortable with. Let's just keep going, man. You know? Spea, slow, but smooth. And smooth as fast. So let's get in the car and discuss some other tantalizing topic. There we go. That was good. That, that wasn't just good. That was freaking crazy. Especially with that breath-holdy flex at the end. That gap. That small softness factor. Separating, you know, separating veins and muscle from skin of some, let's just say, some adipose tissue, right? Some fat. The thinner that gets, the freaky of this diet, will get. And I've never been diced. Like, I've been lean. Like, I've been pretty lean. But I've never been like, even close to like, show kind of ready diced. So that's part of the plan for this, for the next few months, just to get to that level. And I don't mean part of the plan, like, you know, an arbitrary sense, like, maybe maybe not. That is the plan. So, we'll just have to keep riding out. See, exactly how far this should go. But, you're ready for some kind of something. And it is right. It's not even like a prediction. It's simply an observation. You know, so postwork at a meal, not really sure. But I know it'll be something with a good chunk of protein. Might just do some, might just do some ground beef and rice, man. It works, you know, no reason to complicate it any further than that. But, we'll just have to see. I did a breakfast, with a pack of ramen, with 50 grams of protein, worth of egg whites. And a little bit of red hot, wing sauce. Fat free. Well, might have like half a gram of fat per serving. But that was good. That was pretty good. And you might say, see, you are never going to get lean. If you eat a pack of fucking instant ramen. Well, for one thing, it's just not true. But, you know, you're, I'm not going to say you're wrong. And, would it have been better? Would I have had a better workout? If I had 50 grams of carbs from, like a sweet potato, with those, with those egg whites, maybe. But, do I think it would be very noticeable? Not exactly. You know, got some extra fucking electrolytes from all the sodium in there. Drink more than enough water to counteract it, so that I use it for, you know, hydration instead of dehydration. Because there's, you know, the misconception about your salt intake is that, you know, if you take into much salt, you're going to dehydrate yourself. You know, like drink it, see water, but you need a certain amount. Because that's what runs your whole fucking body's process. You know, I'm talking all the way from, just basically a stand-live, but also listening. You know, your muscles don't just, they don't just suddenly move. It's all about a potassium sodium, magnesium, all sorts of other shit sort of balances, and outs of positive and negative ions and stuff, where that's what actually makes your muscles contract or release. You know, that's why when guys get insanely dehydrated, and they're running on the zilts for potassium, then it's just physically dangerous, if you don't do it right, because then they're completely, like, rung dry of all of those necessary kind of, you know, well, would you call it an electrolyte on micronutrient? I guess you would. But, you know, if you don't have any that shit running around, you're asking for a fucking trouble. But, a salty meal, more than the fluids to make up for it, hit my protein, and then 15 grams of fat, or actually ended up being 20, because there was, I cooked the eggs in about five grams of olive oil. So, all that's up to about a 500 or so calorie meal, reasonably filling, and I think the kicker behind it all is I liked it. You know, like there is a, there is a certain balance that you have to take any consideration, because you could write out, the most insane workout regimen, or the most insane diet regimen, or whatever, but if you can't enjoy it to some degree, then what sort of likely that do you have? Basically, do you have to stick to it for a fucking long period of time? You know, it's like zero. So, don't just suddenly jump to, like, you have to do it exactly perfectly, or else there's no point at all. I want to go all in, everything absolutely perfect. Wow. If I can't see it all the way, I don't want to do it all the way. Oh, man, that's just fucking, but we noticed, if you've worked out for long enough, you know that you've got to have a routine that you can't stick to, in perpetuity, and then build up from there, right? Because you can have the perfect for protein, or you can write out the perfect routine, or you can have your perfect routine. And you are a different guy that everybody else in the fucking planet, not only just, like, genetically and subjectively, in your own life experiences, and what gets you amped up in what kind of, you know, turn it off, but also your schedule's way different than everybody else. So that's where you can't look for a specific answer, and like, how do I do this? And which, like, there are a lot of overarching values to be taken about working out, calorie counting, training intensity, for the most part, work at frequency, you know, twice a week kind of deal. I mean, a lot of the grunt work in terms of figuring out how working out and building muscle works. It's already been done, like it's not, you don't have to reinvent the wheel there. But you just have to, you know, accommodate yourself to be able to do that on repeat for a while, because some guy who burns himself out in two weeks, if he was trained in twice as hard as the dude who got into the gym has been working out for now six months deep, and he's gonna keep doing it for years to come, and who's better. And that guy has so much more time to build up and get used to it, you know, it's not a sprint man. Like if you're thinking about working out, and you're excited about what your build is next year, or when six months, or after like a four month Balkan phase, or like maybe try to widen your horizons just to touch, because hopefully once you start working out, that's a forever situation. Like I am, the body building insanely bulky kind of approach. That's not forever for me, but the gym itself, I mean, at this point it's fucking hardwired. I'm not even talking like encoded into my mind. May as well have taken a, like a hammer and chisel, like the metal kind of like presses where it stips, like an engravings, and me as a little bit lifter right in the front of my, what do you want cerebral cortex or whatever else? That's not going anywhere. You know, so like it is a long game man. And if you can get excited about that part of it, then you are ahead of fucking everybody else, you know, because you got a constant source of motivation, because you know you want to just keep working out it for a long time. And I feel a little bit out of place when I talk like this. When I say like you know, it's constant workload, it's constant efforts because it, I mean it is like you are constantly working out it, it is definitely you're putting physical effort into this thing. It's taking a lot of time, but it's like I want to do it, you know, it doesn't feel like work. It feels like an activity. And half of that is the fact that I've got a routine, or I mean just like an approach to working out where it really gets me fired up, you know, like I've got a routine that I like to do, every part of it, at least in some way for me, I have a good understanding like okay this is going to do this for me. Now I want to do it even harder, right? Because if you put somebody in the gym who's never worked out before, and you write out like a workout program for me, give them like a, you know a chess workout, a back workout, just some basic stuff, full-lands, rows, pullovers, bench flies, pack that current like you write somebody to push pull legs workout. And you say, here you go, you get free range, follow these workouts for a while, keep going. It's probably in a suck man. You feel like you're doing a, a damn to do list. Now of course you got to get used to working out and build up some training experience from zero. So you do have to go through the process of learning how to do a curl and do in bench and you know having a reasonable form. But to have a deeper understanding of why you're doing some of these things, it just adds up so well to how hard you can go at it. You know? So what I'm trying to say there is like, if you tell somebody to do a couple of, if you tell somebody, dude, tuck your shoulders in, keep your elbows a little bit beyond 180, like don't bench parallel, like put them at a little bit of a camera, and like whatever, like you, this is now getting into example of like explaining some form style tips. But if you just tell somebody like that, do it like this. This is the right way to do it. That's not how you teach anything. That's not how you, that's not how you would still fucking knowledge or whatever, right? It's, whereas if somebody were to be explained like, okay, if you do these curls in this way, you're going to feel much more of a kind of burning sensation of the top, and the harder that you can do that, the more beneficial the curl is going to be for you. Like if you can explain the process of like, the what and the why, and not only like for somebody explaining it, but if you can get that, and you really have a grasp of the what, the why, the how, then it no longer becomes a guessing game. It's simply okay, if I follow these steps, I will get the results that I want. And it's, I think it's just an ignorance as bliss type situation. Why not so many guys are looking in the macro tracking, or counting the calories, or you know, making sure they're taking all their multivitamin to try to get their sleep done, because if you don't think about it, you don't have to worry about it. You know, somebody who doesn't have a good grasp of like, okay, if I get a really good night's sleep, not only am I going to feel much better than next day, but in a lifting context, I am going to be so much more recovered. I'm going to be able to go harder. I'm going to have a better workout. I'm going to enjoy it more. And I'm going to get better results of the work that I'm putting in is going to pay off, you know, much denser way that if I'm just scrapping around. The guy who doesn't give a shit about his sleep, he doesn't have to worry about that. You know, he just gets to say, man, I didn't get any sleep last night. All right, let's do some chest. You want to do legs today now? No, no, no, come on, let's do arms. Right? If you turn away from it, you don't have to worry about it. Right? But I think that's the more, I mean, especially right now, you've basically got the entire damn freaking world that your finger tips with your phone. So, to not look into it is, I would say that's a, that's a conscious fucking choice. You know? But if you got those basics down, then it's really, you know, you're going to get them into a question and just how bad you want it. And I don't mean that like an overarching sense, like, all right, like sometimes shickets in the way, you know, whatever. But by going to set by set basis, the lift by lift basis, and then just on a day by day, like making sure you leave a good chunk of time for you to have your workout, whether you want to schedule that for like six o'clock, or maybe you just save it for like, okay, I'm going to lift around seven or eight or so, then come back, like having that ready for you, makes it so much better. Because it doesn't, because eventually, it'll no longer feel like a chore. It will just feel more like an activity that he gets a duke and a joy. And, you know, it's like guys where they, ah, well, I mean, just imagine this, right? Who, who do you think is going to have more fun? The dude who works at MicroCenter and is putting together computers for work, or the guy who is like, oh shit, this is probably somebody, specifically, who's about to get a badass, like set of PC parts for Christmas, and he's better put it together to play some games to get to enjoy. He is going to love putting that fucking thing together. He's like, oh man, I can't wait for this, I can't wait for what lies after this, where is the guy who's kind of forced into it, and he's like, ah, it sucks, you know. So, whether or not that came across, how I intended, he get the gist, right? Try to work out in a way that you enjoy, and if you enjoy it, you'll go harder at it. You'll get better results from it. And once you start getting some results, I'm not even talking and insane, like, you know, get a 315 bancher, like simply making any noticeable changes in your progress, be it size, leanness, strength. That is such an awesome validation of the fact that what you've been doing has been working. And once you know that, it doesn't become like, if I do this, then this will happen. It's like, if this happens, I'm going to do this. And then it's just upwards from there. That's why I feel that the matter. So, if you know somebody who's part of the new year's resolution crew, make sure that they get into it in the right way. And that's actually, I read that, that's such an open end piece of it. That doesn't even, that doesn't even try to, it's a piece of advice that's silly. But, you know, try to, if you know something like that, try to ease them into it, and make sure it's a positive environment. The last thing you want to do is like, look at somebody say, why the fuck you bunching like that? So, this guy's been in the gym for a week. What the fuck he's talking about, you know, so that's my shit there. I, yeah, so I, I always better say something I tell him to forget. Well, either way. Why does back day tomorrow? So, I'm going to go eat something. I'll just see that.

I'm not even sure I really need the glasses. It's kind of muggy out today, but even though it's just cloudy, I see the comments saying it's not winter yet. Freak it feels like winter. It's like 31. When I got up to the car, this morning, I even just went to the apartment gym I got. I was freezing. Yeah, yeah, I can, that's one thing which I get jealous of anybody. You know, none of the Southern coasts I'm talking for to California, at least at your other bottom side. You know, starting to miss the warmth, but maybe I just got to start dressing appropriately. You know, a t-shirt and the thin pants, I'll have to swap them out for some more thick kind of sweat suit style stuff. But regardless of temperature, it'll not hinder the pump, even if the weather gets close to not even close to literally just emergency level. These lifts will still go on some way or another. I've never had to do like a dory in the eights walk to the gym, kind of thing. Usually I just, I guess you can say, got a risk where even if the rows are kind of un-plowed or whatever, still just try to drift in. Probably usually within reason. Like if it was actually too crazy, just do the home gym kind of a kind of a lift. But yeah, one time in school there was a really bad kind of snowstorm. I think it was, trying to think about maybe two years ago. No, no, no, no, no. It's more like three and a half, four. Not four. Probably three years ago, two years ago or so. When I was at school, everything fucking shut down. Class, gyms, and I called ahead in the plane and fitness that was about 20 minutes. I think east. They said they're open. So I get in my car. I could barely go over 20 honestly. Like the roads were actually really fucking slick. I already drank my pre-workout. I'm excited for some legs and low and behold, shut down. Whew, I guess they can staff in which would make sense. And then the problem had even allowed to force, you know, to force somebody to come in and work if it's an actual fucking snowy emergency. So I'm sitting there in, you know, basically 40 minutes away from the house. Stimmed up, but luckily enough, there was actually a pretty hard chord gym. There was 24 hour about 15 or so minutes further. And that's snow time, not like regular drive time. So, you know, I roll in there and ended up saving me. And that gym was actually pretty cool for a while. But yeah, that day I didn't, did not pay for a day pass. The people that were working there just weren't there. You know, obviously it was like extra snowy. So I just roll in. Whew. Ask, uh, asked to the guys next to me if I need to do anything. They tell me the same shit. And like, yeah, we would pay for anything either. You know, we just came here because everything else was closed. But with, uh, with a couple of these 24 hour gyms. Yeah, there is, uh, a part from catastrophe. There's really nothing stopping from getting to work at it. So that's part of the reason why I like having a couple of different memberships. Just let's you change it up. But today with arms, tries buys. I want to do a touches, touch of shoulders. Nothing crazy. I mean, um, mainly side delts. Maybe like touch a rear delt. So really, I think at the end of arms, I'll just do like a couple sets of side lateral raises just to really kind of pump them up. But arms specifically, I've had a lot of luck with triceps these last like six or so months, maybe even more like seven. Bicing a lot more. Squeezing extensions, you know, like if you fast, uh, oh, I guess you can say fast reverse, like a year and a half and you click an arm day that was, you know, that far back. All my triceps stuff was way different than I do it now. It was all like two plates slapped on the stack. Really heavy. Not even breaking 90 degrees on my on my tricep angle and just kind of bounce them down there. Which, I mean, it worked like a totally full like I was thrashed my triceps, but I was definitely missing out on a stretch position. So that's something I've really been trying to work on. I actually have been working on it. I am now executing. Like with the rope, especially in the, the dead machine too, but mainly the rope or single iron push down, I can really feel like I get... Oh, it's too, uh, almost to the point where like my arm is just running into itself because it just can't bend any further and then going back into the squeeze position. And not only do I think I've seen a little bit of extra tricep gains that way. It just feels better. Simply getting more pumped quicker and with less weight. So my elbows are barely ever tender. Only if I accidentally like, you know, bump it on the corner or something, do I have to kind of, you know, hold back a little bit on the triceps side of things. And then curls, and then I'm not simple enough. Maybe some self-assisted reps, some, you know, dumbbell preachers with some, like, assisted concentric and then ride the negative. But I think we'll just have to see this really not much point in guessing what the curling portion of the lift is going to look like. Because I got to finish the whole tricep portion first and then be able to decide there. And depending on how that portion of the lift goes, it might change what I think would be good to start. Like, right now, even just guessing I could say, all right, I would probably like some regular alternating dumbbell curls to start. But, you know, who knows, maybe I actually finish triceps, move on to a couple of light dumbbell curls to warm up and I say to myself, yeah, let's start with some creatures here for whatever reason. That's what I'll do then. So it's almost a, uh, it's really a start that set when you get there. Kind of deal. But as long as you're nuts, your lifts finish fully pumped, you can feel legit fatigue and you know that you actually push yourself. You weren't just lying. Then I think you're good. All right, change it up. But if you've got a basic skeleton, kind of framework of how your workouts look, no need to flip it onto its head just for the sake of, uh, you know, the fact that you watch some video tell you, like, oh, this is the greatest way to hit arms, like, you know, get a pump go hard and then the rest should begin to fall into place over time. But I think that's all I got there in terms of an arm introduction. Let's just go start this arm destruction. Yeah, there we go. Took a second to find a rhyming word. That's not getting too crazy. Just start with some moderately weighted ruby acceptance. And these I want like a good second hold, release waves. I can try to bend my arm backwards, hyper extending itself. I'm so you can't. But like that's what I'm trying to imagine. And then go from there. I can't handle the wires. I can't lose the wireless headphones. I tried. But this disconnect is too nice. But let's, uh, let's get real here. Actually, one not checking that. Yeah, I got dropped the weight. But let's do one more. Failure is much more abrupt. When you do a full kind of stretch like that, because I mean the strength curve of your triceps is actually a little bit easy up here. It gets hardest when your arms are 90 and then almost gets like easier again. Just because you have better leverages. So now it's surprising that's the sticking point. But keep my head. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. One more with that weight. And then maybe do it. Yep. Next or something? Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's move on. This will be a little on the lighter side, at least relatively forming for these dips. And basically just going to do them in the exact same executed style as the rope. Deep stretch. Holder and squeeze position. Maybe some partials at the end is a burn out and you know, some shit like that. All right. Not that I can go a little heavier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, crap. Let's do more and more with the same weight. But maybe make this next one a drop set. The pain of how many reps I can actually pop out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's just do one more straight style. And that actually might be it. I think some overhead extensions might have some value after this. But yeah. That's probably about seven sets of tries and that's sort of some curl. That's the one I'm fully pumped at the end of my mind. I may make reasons a little bit faster this. Now the time a bit. I'll let it slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not done. I just want to make this like a rest-post. So those reps are going to be hard. I'm going to give myself a second to breathe. And then be able to get more than if I were to just got a regular failure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's enough of those. Fuck. I think I'm really feeling the extra carbs from fucking yesterday. Yesterday's the day after Thanksgiving. I don't think I've got much room, pump-wise for two more biceps sets. I think one more good one. Well, probably fucking at least in this fully cooked. Now, what do I want to do? You need to move on to the side, but I'm sure it'll be a reasonably good decision. Reasonable strong probability. This is going to be it. So I think I'll probably turn into a bit of a drop superset. But the first portion will be underhanded by set by a pull-outs. So you know, it looks like I'm doing a fucking pull-down. I'm not trying to activate my last, my traps or anything in my back at all. I'm trying to purely isolate my biceps. And this is the moving I'm doing. I need to fucking curl. Now, it's a little funky because it's like way up here. And my arm is changing angles. But at its core, I'm still just pulling my hand towards my shoulder. Trying to use everything in between. Except for my forearms, of course. But after this sort of first burn-out portion, I think I'm going to drop the weight. Back to seat up and burn out with some light cable curls. This will definitely result in some bicep pumpage. I wish there were some way to like have a sensor or something that like some kind of electrode that could actually portray it. But until then, you just have to take my word for it. Okay. I just saw that. Yeah, what's in here? Now. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That is all she's bringing a rope for bicep. Let's go fuzz down. Well, no one need for the side ladders. They're not today. Alright, little, little spits softly lit in this kind of pose down room. But well within reason. Plus, if you're standing right under a light, no matter what the orientation is, it's probably going to do something for you. But let's just see how pumped arms were after that reasonably. I mean, I reasonably use the right word. Relatively lower volume arm day. At least compared to what the last few have been like. But I say, oh, I just from looking, you'd never know it. Ooh. Let's start with the start with a little back pose from already facing this way. No. Yeah. Let me actually step forward a little bit. No, okay, that's it. Alright, let's see what else is there. I'm part of this classic kind of fucking most muscular. Oh my gosh. I'm getting excited to get extra lean in this portion specifically because the lean arm's get and also just my waist in general. It makes your arms look like there extra beefy. I mean, I'm getting to the point out where the waist arm ratio, at least where arms are pumped. Like, that's not enough in bouncing around in there, you know. There we go. Yeah, we got something going on. But that is most certainly a solid arm day, especially due to this one little caveat. I didn't have any carbs yet today. I, you know, given that I kind of overdid it a little bit yesterday. I have a little bit of a Thanksgiving refeed. Now nothing serious, but like, enough where it's something that I do have to take into account. I might be a little bit extra sparse today in kind of an immediate, like, reactive sense. Just to sort of jumpstart the getting back on track. But the whole point of the refeed is you kind of, I mean, basically just poke the fire that is your get running through shit. So it's like, okay, I got to run off some extra energy now. Oh, I get to get used to extra. And then when you go back to your regular deficit, it almost feels a bit more intense. And not like feels for you like subjectively. I mean, feels like like, oh, shit. Now I'm burning extra calories. Because you don't want to completely crash your metabolism off the rip. If you're about to start trimming down, because then you'll have nowhere to go. I'm bulking up and coming down. I've, and it's not like I discovered this people in the same this for a while just took me, it took me a little bit to really grasp it. But it really does help to ease your way into it and to increase the stimulus that is that diet. Be it like the amount of extra food you're eating in a bulk or like just how low below your maintenance you eat in a dieting phase. Because if you shoot it too far in either direction, then you're just going to burn yourself out. And I don't mean like mentally. I mean physically, you'll notice results begin to fucking cease. You know, I've been bulking for so many months on end over the course of time where I was like, oh, I'll just, I'll suddenly break through this plateau. But really, I had just eaten so much food so quickly already that it like totally gas my whole system got biome thrashed. I've known his way better results. Increasing calories throughout the bulking phases and slowly decreasing calories throughout these dieting phases. And that just jump and straight to like, I'm freaking starvation mode. But arms wrecked. And you're stomach at it here. It's gonna go. Arms complete. Arms very well complete. Might I add? Might I freaking add? And quickly note just as a general recommendation. I think there are two kinds of people. There really are two kinds of people in the world. You know, the people who have not watched a berserk and the people who have, right, a little bit of a, a little bit of a plug there. I, uh, I'll tell you something. I, uh, I think Netflix took berserk off of the three movies. I think they used to be on Netflix and other gone. And those three basically covered like a good chunk of the story. So if you can handle it, it's a little long. But you know, go on to read it. Look up berserk redux. Because it's got, uh, you know, there's like an old show from the 90s. And then there's some newer movies. But each one of those iterations individually skipped a couple parts. So if you look up, um, if you watch that, this guy basically really like, methodically clips together the two so that it was a cohesive kind of story to live. But just trying to put you on, man. I'd tell you, I think I've probably rewatched it maybe three times. And it's not the whole story, but it's, you get the gist of it. Uh, it's, uh, unrelated to the arm day, but just, uh, just something I wanted to say. But that was good. Those, uh, I could definitely tell that pump was, what's the opposite of hindered? It was aided by the fact that I had so many extra carbs yesterday from Thanksgiving. So I actually kind of got extra pumped extra quick to the point where it's like, okay, that's it. You know, no need for really much more. But it's, uh, it's kind of a fine line, right? Because you want to do enough where you actually stimulated growth, obviously. But you don't want to do too much to the point where you're just working for no reason, tiring yourself out, you know, increasing your training stress without increase your training stimulus. And usually I think a good little, uh, detector for where that line is, as long as it, as long as your sets are done with a pretty reasonable amount of intensity. Then I would say whenever you're just about ready to be fully pumped, that's usually a good key you've done enough. Now that's, um, that's not like a blanket statement because obviously for somebody who isn't so in tune with just straight up getting a pump. It's kind of a heart of the tell, right? So that's where as a beginner, for not even as beginner, but earlier in your training career, it might make a bit more sense to stick to like a specific number of sets per lift, like I'm due legs, eight set to quad, eight sets of hamstrings, chest, eight sets, four of pressing one of a squeezing or light of pressing the two of a fly, arms, eight sets of push downs, eight sets of curls, dry a couple, you know, bounce them around because it's just a little bit trickier to, uh, to know where that line is, and to you've built up enough experience to be able to say it. And I'm not trying to say that like, like a flex, like it just, it does take a little while to be able to tell like, okay, should I do one more, or should I call it there? Because that's kind of the enigma of every workout, you know, zero sets will induce zero gains, but infinity sets will not induce infinite fucking gates, right? If anything, if you sat in there and did, uh, bicep curls for eight hour straight, you're probably just going to, totally, after you feel better. Well, yeah, this is having that. You're totally just going to burn yourself out. You're not going to grow. You're just stressing out your system, you know, so clearly infinity is the answer, and zero is the answer. Right? It's the way we're that implied, somewhere in the middle, and not really in the middle, just somewhere along that line. So usually, I've, uh, it's taken me a while to bring it down, uh, in the beginner for whatever, or in the beginning, for whatever reason I had it in my mind, that I wanted to do 25 set workouts twice a week. So everybody part, 25 sets from the get go. So 25 sets of leg curls, or 25 sets of hamstrings, which I wasn't even doing hamstrings for like eight months, because I didn't, in my mind, wave hack then. I was like, why do I want the back of my legs to be big? Oh, my quad should be big. All right, thank you. Didn't, uh, I didn't have all these same values I have now, way back when before I knew it would be better. Right? So really just goes to show the fucking evolution over time. But for arms and back and chest, five movements, five working sets each, to go from there twice a week. So I'd have two chest days a week, and each one would be 25 of a con set total. And so five sets of bench, five sets of inclined bench, five sets of Smith, five sets of cable flies. Five sets of sopen. Oh, five sets of peck deck, you know, whatever, which was definitely overkill. That amount of volume was not necessary for the amount of stimulus that that volume was giving me. But it did do me some good, and actually not some, I think, a lot of good, because it gave me a lot of training experience. You know, so I was doing three times the sets that somebody else might have been doing, and maybe a bit of a more optimal workout. But I was also getting three times the experience in three times the amount of reps under my belt, which I think definitely ate it in my comfortability with these lifts. Because with anything that more often you do it, and the more comfortable you get with it, the easier it's going to become to do. And the better that you'll get at it, right? I mean, you put, uh, you try to put me on a tight rope. I'm not going to make a few steps, but if you thought somebody practice it for years on end, to guess what? The guy can do a freaking double back flip, land on his leg, like laying on his back, double front flip, land again. You know, that sort of thing. So, don't, uh, if you can't feel your chest when you're doing a bench, or you can't really feel your lats, you know, you're kind of, uh, when guys say, you know, really activate your mind most of the connection. And it kind of puts you here a little bit of a loss. Don't freak, you know, do not freak. That is something that is just going to come with time and training experience. And it's a pretty cool feeling when that training experience kind of manifests itself as a realization. One, uh, probably the most abrupt I ever had was when I was in my basement gym at my parents house, doing chest one night. I'm doing incline. I got a mirror on the wall, so I could see myself do it. Mmm. Mmm. There, I'm sorry. That's just the nature of the deficits, making me sleep here. But, uh, they're not even like sleepy, people just like a little bit more, uh, a little bit less energized. But, so I'm in the basement gym. Inclined bench, barbell. Probably only had like one, probably only had like two or five of the bar. Maybe actually one like one, eight, five, something like that, you know, and, uh, Well, it's got a lot of it. But, I'm looking at myself in the mirror, and as I'm doing these reps of incline, something in my mind just clicked, where I could actually feel my chest, pulling my elbows upward, rather than just feel my hands pushing the weight upward. And those are very, uh, that's a very different feeling. So, I think another thing that kind of helped me with that is, uh, if you ever look at like just human anatomy, or just try to imagine like what's really going on, because I don't think a lot of people think about like, okay, if I'm going to pick something up, I'm not just like, my hand is not just something moving, and then my hand is raised from like, some non-existent force. Like, you are just this mechanical system of fucking pulleys and levers, where it's all about, uh, you know, contractions. So, rather than think of like pushing, you really never push anything. There is no push in muscle fiber, it's only pulling against opposite kind of levers. Like your tricep is pulling this part of your elbow toward itself, and that's resulting in your hand moving that direction, right? Your chest doesn't push, your chest pulls your upper arm towards itself, right? Your hamstrings are, well, your quads, and you're doing a leg press, you're not pushing that weight up. You're actually just pulling your shins into a stretch position and pulling your thighs into a straight position for your glutes, and that's what's actually moving way to right. And it's not like you have to think about that or think about it like that to be able to imagine it. But for me it helps. Like for me that really clicks. So when I'm doing those tricep, push down to those dips or the concentration, uh, preacher curls, or just the preacher curls, that's what I'm thinking. Like I'm trying to put my mind into whatever muscle I'm working, or at least just, you know, be extra sensitive about it, and really try to feel where that contraction is pulling. And in doing so, I swear you can squeeze harder. So just something to think about, right? And then the long thing you do it eventually, you'll get to the point where you can just like flex all sorts of muscles all over the place, like nothing. You know, I'm talking like pop in your peck style, that's sort of stuff. And it's kind of funny. I catch myself doing it a lot, especially on back, like when I edit my back day videos. Like sometimes I'll sit and I'll like squeeze and like tense up my lats. While I'm watching the reps, I think I'm, I think I might have lost it a little bit on the lifting side of things if I'm, if I'm doing that. But I mean, it's just, that's just part of it, you know. And the more you can do that, like the more isolated of a contraction signal that you can send to whatever muscle across your build, the better. Because it just makes you more efficient. If I'm trying to do set of curls and I use the straps which definitely helps. And I only send signals to my biceps to really curl and not to my forearms and my, like, break your, I think, break your radio alicir or something. The part of your forearms that gets worked and like a hammer curl. Like if all of that can stay relatively relaxed or at least as relaxed as I could make it. And the target in muscle on trying to work is the one that ends up doing all the work. Then I've succeeded in doing a well isolated set. It's a little different if you're doing like a compound, or especially if you're trying to work on like a strength vector, like your power lifter. I've seen you want to lift as much weight as possible. Then it's almost a complete opposite. Like you want maximum muscle recruitment of everything. They completely tight tense and brace. Like I think that's where power lifting and body-building really differ the most. Because body-builder is still going to do a relatively heavy set. Like not for one rep, but, you know, for eight or 12, like still hitting failure. But it's in a way where it's much more concentrated. It's like a stipe of rifle versus a shotgun. Dealers, dealers, choice there, I guess. But whether or not that analogy made sense, just keep it in mind. Before you know it, you'll be sitting here just fucking flexing your chest and your triceps and your lats and your glutes and everything else. You start to understand what these guys mean. And they talk about that mind muscle connection. Because it really is just an experience thing. So eventually it'll begin to click, click, click, and click. And then you'll be the guy telling somebody else that, like all you do to get a feel of your lats broke. You have to relax your forms and your biceps. Pull with your elbows, not your hand, pull with your elbows. Your hands just need to act as a hook. Like, you know, all the classic kind of phrases. But, playing for the postwork at meal. Might do a breakfast for dinner, type situation, egg whites and a half a bagel. So only 25 grams of carbs, maybe a little bit of butter, five grams, seven grams worth. And then go from there. My primary objective is not eating a ton of food here. It's really trying not to eat a lot. So it's, but I'd say it's still just as tricky, even though it's the absence of effort. Because when you're bulking up hard, I mean, it's hard to eat a lot of food. But in a complete opposite spectrum, it's also hard to not eat a lot of food. But if you're getting ready for a dining phase, or if you've already done a couple of dining phases, you don't even talk about it. I think that's all I got. I'll see if I hope to be a wild, like-day tomorrow. I know I'm gonna thrash hamstrings, but if I had to take quads a little bit lighter. I was hitting quads a little bit too hard. The last three lifts a week and a half ago and before. And I can tell I kind of like stressed a little bit. Not like a serious muscular pull or anything, but just like little kind of twinches. Where if I were to keep doing a really heavy quad day lift after lift after lift, it would add up to potentially some more serious tweaks. But we'll just soon read it there. And of course 30 minutes of cardio in the morning. Don't skip your cardio. That's one of my main pieces of freaking advice for anybody. So I'll, I'll, I'll just see it for legs then.

I don't think it's necessarily anybody's fault specifically, but training legs legs getting a love. The lower body does not get as much love as chest arms, shoulders, at least not for enough of the male demographic. It's kind of crazy to complete opposite on the other side of the spectrum. But yeah, we want to say it legs, man. It's hard. It's not a lot of fun. And I think the thing with legs is there's not much to, there's not much to flex about with legs. And what I mean by that is if you do an a crazy S arm day, even if you're 180 freaking pounds, your arms are fucking pumped up. You get bigger arms. That looks pretty fucking cool. And arms aren't a lift where you get crazy props for lifting super heavy. You never bad S arm day, which is a 30 pound set of dumbbells, doing some curls. There's no point. So the showoffee part is just kind of in doing it. But with legs, not so much. Where's what are you supposed to do? For anybody who's rapping above three plates is kind of a rarity. So it's like the flex of it takes a little while. Because it takes a bit to even get to that level of strength. And then I think people just don't feel as cool if you're sitting doing like a set of leg curls compared to doing some kind of shit. Rherended. You fucking, I got to go to, man. Holy shit. Not Jesus. Well, either way, three current pile up here. I was about to say, oh, now I'm getting distracted. Yeah, so it's, I think it's just not cool. If you're sitting doing a set of leg extensions, there's a little bit of hype there. But hamstrings especially, now breaking down legs in a subculture. There's not as much hype when you're doing a, you know, when you're doing a set of leg curls compared to anything else. So that's where you got to be. That's a probably legs is the lift where you've got to have the most sort of contact with your delayed gratification. And, you know, it's easy to get hyped up about legs, at least for me. Because usually the way I think about is like, oh, yeah, nobody wants to do it. Nobody wants to do the hard shit. Everybody wants to sit around and fucking, you know, do bench and back and shoulders and arms. There's a reason you don't see a lot of guys. Well, actually, there's a legitimate reason. You know, it's a lot of guys post leg day videos like any kind of, you know, influencer character. And it's not just because they were skipping legs or anything. That's how I'm saying. People don't watch them. You know, legs not only gets no love from a consistency standpoint of anybody else, but yeah, I'm not sure what the solution to that is, you know, I'm not necessarily making a, I've gotten those suggestions on doing it's making an observation. So if you're on the edge, if you're teetering around, you know, some of your buddies are going to say, oh, come on, we're all lifting the Friday at five. We're all doing chest. You're really going to do arms. You're, you're really going to do legs. You're really going to leave us and then, you know, go do your own thing. But the fuck man. So the peer pressure is strong. So not only legs are hard, you know, getting to kind of like extra satisfaction pound leg pump. And then also, you get dudes at your gym physically trying to get you to skip legs. You know, the odds are against you. But that's where you can pull sort of an underdog move, right? Hit legs like a nutcase anyway. And then fast forward how many months, even during a bulking phase, you should be able to see some pretty noticeable differences. But it is going to take off. So in terms of the progression of my leg training, it is much different than when I was a beginner. So it's not like you have to make any of these changes right this second. You know, I mean, back when I started, I didn't even do hamstrings in my mind. I thought, why do I want the back of my leg to be bigger? That doesn't make any sense for cares. I'll just work my quads. So I think I probably went six or seven months maybe with like very minimal hamstring training. Like it took me a while to even get to the point where I started doing that even. But after that, yeah, just kind of increase from there. Hamstrings and hamstring curls and leg extensions there, my bread and butter. But I think it was maybe four years deep, four in something. I don't know. I like that work, but I wasn't doing a crazy mental leg press or squats. Once I started doing the squats, I can see something that's where it's, well, maybe not like just the rate of growth. I mean, it's completely different depending on the dude. But that's where I saw better results for me. Just because I'm getting into deep kind of press, it's like taking somebody who only ever does cable flies or pectech and then showing them like a chest press. Once you figure that out, like, oh shit, I should be doing this. Why the hell have I not been doing this? So for a while, I think I almost took it a little bit too far. Kind of, you know, it's kind of being a squat supremacist in a way, because I would say in the quads, I'm looking back at all the Tom Plats clips. Why would you ever do leg press? Why would you do an inferior movement, right? I think he might have gone a little overboard. But when it comes to leg training, there's not much room for criticism, for Mr. Plats. Of course. There is a big difference between the lift or who squats on the regular and the one who does it. I'd say it's a similar difference between someone who really goes nuts on squats versus someone who just is kind of leg extensions and maybe some leg press. And then somebody who only does, well, upper body, right? Not to be a leg day skipping basher, but it's kind of a, so. Oh, that's just a, with this lift tonight, given that I'm dieting down, I'm just trying to maintain and not tweak anything. Probably not going to see a five plate squat, but I will make sure I get a nasty ass squat pump more than stimulating enough to maintain all the beef I've got built up. So hamstrings, very similar to normal, Artiels, laying curls, seated curls of some variety. I might even have some supersets in there if I feel crazy. And quads will just be, whatever quads that's not being, you know, some leg squeezing, leg extensions, maybe get a little heavier if everything feels kind of good. And leg press of, yeah, not going to go so crazy and the leg press might just do some single leg kind of stuff. And then maybe back to some Sissy squat, leg extension, the supersets, and that'll be the end of it. And I'll probably camp out of the ad-ductor machine as well. That's one thing I can't really, I can't really stress enough. The ad-ductor machine, right, like the ball crusher when you're sitting there, squeezing your legs together. That's not just a random ass move that really strengthens all sort of stabilizers. Intra, you know, what's this bone? Femur to spine, or wreckters, all sorts of stuff. It, yeah, can't speak highly enough of that. Because if I, you know, squat or doing a leg press or anything, and I haven't been doing much ad-ductor work or any ad-ductor work at all, it really does kind of show in my feeling of stability and confidence when I'm pressing. Because if your ad-ductor's in a week, man, I mean, sure you can have pretty fucking strong quads, but if you start pushing too hard or too heavy, it's probably gonna end up pulling something. You know, it's like so counter-intuitive, right? It's like, I'm doing a squat, why would my ad? I'm not squeezing my legs together. If you're really pressing, they do end up getting a pretty good amount of activation. So like anything, you know, same thing with your rotator cuff, make sure your whole system is moving. So before I even do a set of amphrine curls, I'm gonna camp out of the adductor machine for at least a couple of sets just to kind of get the area warm with a little bit of extra blood flowing. But until then, I think let's just, let's all get to say. So let's get this leg day started. Let's keep the classic. So with the heavy set of leg curls, slow and fucking controlled, I think, well, you probably shouldn't go that heavy anyway. But I think I'm kind of at a point where the stack is reasonable weight. Because this is gonna be like a set of 10 minimum with a full contraction, pause, and a slow eccentric. But the real gist I'm trying to get at is like, you know, pick a weight that's heavy enough. With something like hamstrings, they get no love. I feel like they just get treated like an accessory movement, which depending on the movement isn't a bad thing. You know, sometimes doing some stuff for your rotator, especially as a warm up. I mean, I'll catch myself just, I mean, I'm literally listening to like a video on my phone while I'm sitting here doing some kind of warm up stuff. Every set doesn't have to be like a ball to the wall, explosion of intensity. But with a regular working set, this is legit muscle group I want to build. Don't take it too easy. Like, you know, push yourself to legit failure. Maybe not for a weight that's so heavy on you, fight reps. But within that 10 to 12 range, I say, go as heavy as you can where that 10th rep is like a legit run. But that's a, it's too couple of these and then we'll move on to something else. Oh, my, okay. Yeah, Robbie, I wanted to more like that. And then I think, well, either land crawls or artiels would be next. Yeah, that was good one. ooh violent Oh my god Okay Looks hard Let's move on. But not to another hamstring movement. I think if you have a change of plans for the form of that a this like day, which I'll explain in one second. It's been a while, but on occasion, more so for arms, sometimes I like doing two sets of tries, two sets of buys, back and forth, back and forth like that, maybe you kind of have a, I wouldn't say super setting, but almost like tandem workout. So I do it sometimes with legs and usually only when I'm diving. Something maybe it's like some of the extra rest, because hamstrings now get basically two sets of rest while I do quads. So it's almost like I can build up some strength again, or kind of let them have a little bit of in-set recovery, but half of it is also, once this workout's over, since I've been doing hamstrings in quads at the same time, my legs are pumped front to back. Usually if I do all hamstrings then all quads, my quads are fully pumped, but my hamstrings it's kind of deflated at touch. And especially in a dieting phase, it's just the nature of a man, your pump is fucking fleeting. So let's start with some single leg leg extensions alternating reps. So 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, not too heavy either. Like actually this is pretty moderate weight. So this would be more of a burning out, it's kind of set, really just half working set, half like warm up so that when I move on to something like a leg press or whatever else, likewise there are almost primed for it. But either way, I want to squeeze the shit out of everyone in these reps. I'm gonna give a quads burning with a different song though. No right now. questa use Oh my gosh. All right. Let's go a little heavier and then do one more. And this next one I might make a little bit faster paced. A little more of a burnout style than a slow squeeze style. But one more and then back to some kind of curl. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Let's do some light curls now. No. This one will be on the lighter side. But again, I really want to get a good squeeze out of it. So imagine curling 50s versus 25s. If from curling 50s, just doing the rep is the hard part. If from curling 25s, I can really give it a hard squeeze at the top. Which occurs damage very quickly. Like I get a so much hate on the squeeze. Like it's I don't know why it's the meta to be like you only have to focus on the stretch position. Dude, if I did all these reps and I was barely contracted in the stretch position and all I do is bounce around the stretch position. Oh, it's rewind if you say it's if I didn't squeeze during the squeeze position and all I did was bounce around the stretch position. My pump would not be as far as good. You got a contrast with the squeeze with the stretch. Right? And we're getting in the game. I've said that a couple times, I'll probably say it a few more. It's kind of a good analogy. But this will be a squeezing set. Relatively faster pace though. Not too slow. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh, you're acting. Oh. That was good actually. I think one more just like that'll be nice. No. Oh, I got it. That was good. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Let's make this one a bit lighter. With the reps is done in a bit of a different way. Right? Yeah. You're going to have to pick up. This will be sort of like a half a rep style sort of thing. So half way up. Pause completely stop the momentum. And then I can't just ride the weights movement because I stopped it. So I have to send extra signals and really squeeze my quad, which is obvious. Right? I mean, it's it's a simple. I go obviously you have to flex your quad to move the weight. But it's usually so typical that like we exert our hardest signals at the bottom of a rep to get it started. And then once the weight is already moving, you know, it's like why I don't really love dumbbell rows. Why I'd rather do it the cable row because if you launch it at the bottom, you can just ride that weight up to it at the top. And then just keep launching it like you're a spring like that's the activation. So doing a pause rep like this, it does help me get a good kind of connection with okay. That's what it feels like to really squeeze instead of just down here at the bottom. But after this one, I think back to leg curls and just go from there. And I am aware I just said in the car all that shit about how I'm trying to change up my quad training from doing the leg extension leg curl stuff. This is not a building workout per se. There's as much more in tune with maintaining the quasi of already built. We'll have you up there. Alright. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay. One more like that. It's slightly heavier though. This one's just going to be as many reps as possible. Burning out and probably the simplest way there is. No. No. No. No. No. I can't get up. I like that. I can't close the bat. I'm really supposed to have a point. No. No. No. No. No. Oh my god. Yeah. That's enough. Alright. So paired with the badass song, which I have yet to pick. This is going to be a reasonably torturous. Like per se. I want to mean by that is like it's not. I'm million pounds is going to crush me if I fail. It's that it's actually light enough that I can do 10 quick. I can do like maybe 14 or something without like pausing at the top. But then it's kind of gets extra challenging. It's like a little bit hard. You're long. Obviously you're fucking breathing. You're working the biggest muscle on your body requires. But yeah, it's just a different way to go back. And sets of leg press like this. Higher rep lighter weight. I want to really get my quads pumped up. Like heavy sets definitely do it. But some of these lighter more. I guess kind of volume focus sets. Really just final blood in here like. Well, what gets funneled. Alright. Some shit like that. But let me pick a good sign. Give this out. Bring me the horizon fails to let me down. In a while though, let me see what comes up. Yeah. King's lighter action. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh my god. I'm going to give myself some assistance with the press. I might own quads at the top of those. Oh my god. Yeah. This is a good leg pump. A little bit of hamstring activation from the leg pressing too. Not to be forgotten about. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You're good. Oh, I did okay. Oh, yeah. I think that's finished with one more set of those leg extensions. That would be it. A little less pressing than I had in mind, but a lot more leg inflation than I had predicted either. So, you're good little given give. But one more. And then I think let's suppose that, see, it legs look off of 120 grams of carbs. Let's sum... Let me think about this. I want this to be a very pumping set. So, if you could call each of the sets of done so far and experiment on, like, what the set wise versus how it felt for today, the sets of quads, they made my quads, well, just feel the most pumped. At least of the leg extensions, or the ones where I kind of threw the weight around a little bit. Like, not to the point where does this as ludicrous? This is stupid. Like, if someone's doing a set and you see this, like, they kick it into the air and catch it. That's, you know, I think you're within the realm of goofiness, beyond, like, stimulus, right? But a quicker rep, which still has tension all the way through. That's in the green, and that's good. So, I think let's just do alternating reps, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, until quad destruction. A little heavier. How about 145? 145 paired with... paired with what? Yeah, in the night, GXX got dang it. ......... yukaaaak, Let's get a surprising. Right leg went out before the left. Ooh, yeah, we're good. Let's not waste any time talking. Get straight to the mirror. And see if there's any new veins. All right. Quads, hamstrings, both complete. And I would say both equally complete. Not so much bias towards one or the other. Well, last couple of quad days, or the last couple of leg days, I've had a back off a touch on quads just because of my own stupidity. I was going to wait to have a couple of lifts like two weeks back, like 12 plate leg press. And you know, in like the lower 2000s of a calorie intake, that doesn't really match in terms of the rest and recovery set of things. You know, so I've had to take it a touch easier on quads. Which I still am, you know, at least in like the weight department. But I think now back, so now I just have to curb my ego, quad-wise, and not go so fucking crazy. But one thing that I think might change soon, might start busing out some shorts just for legs. Well, okay, actually maybe not. I don't like bare skin on the leg extension pad. That's not really something I'm into. Yeah, that's really things up. See, I've got so many older pairs of shorts, which I used to really like, and which now I just can't even fucking wear anymore. They don't fit my quads. All right, cool problem to have, but honestly, I have like, like these shorts fit a second to go. I don't have a lot of shorts like that that I actually would wear. But I'm actually kind of telling myself to shut up just from looking at this. Yeah, about we get a little extra zoom just for this sort of display purposes. So this is this is just the veins that are out purely from standing. No breath hold, no nothing like these ones are just here. So let me take in a big breath really squeeze and see just how many we can force out. But either way, yeah, this one especially is probably the freakier side. There's some, there's some veins in here. And the right leg is actually a little bigger up in this quadrant of a quad, but yeah, I think the left side has the vein, the vein superiority, whatever. Oh, no. No, I got it. And then I'm even just standing, glutes are going to fucking be exceeded by the thickness of the hamstrings, eventually not yet. I mean, like my hamstrings are small, but they're not overpowering, but which is why you're not going to catch me do any like hip thrust. Like glute wise I'm all right, I need more quad and hamstring. But let's see what the arm looks like, you know, here. No, oh my gosh. Oh, well, I would, I would pop a squat and do a little bit of post lift model I'll just right now, but the music is so loud, let's just cut to the car. But yeah, man, I mean, nothing to fucking complain about. And then they're only going to get freaky from here. Let's try to pay at least a sense of an homage. Yeah, not the same fucking freak factor, but it's still a quad nonetheless. So it's going to car. I have a post lift discussion and then get ready for, I guess you're ready for bed, then. It's fucking late. That was a really good fucking leg pump. Right. And half of that is to do with the fact that that lift was pump oriented. And what I mean by that is like my main goal was not necessarily like complete destruction a little bit more so in the stimulating kind of side of thing. Right, you know, that was cool. That's a, so that's one thing I have kind of implemented before is I've had a couple of really cool shirts like a long sleeve, whatever a couple of like some all like short sleeve. Just let me just play that fucking church and they used to be very baggy. Like they used to be like draped over me and you know, I just didn't get rid of them or anything. You know, even if they get tears or holes because over time. And I've kind of filled them up. Even, I mean, I've had shirts that I, you know, were extra big on me when I was one. 60 and then once I got up to like 200 or so by the end of high school, I was like, whoa, that shirt is a little tight. That shirt is coming out of the daily roster. You know, got to be retired, got to make a pit stop and find something else. So same thing with the shorts. It's just a, it's a cool physical milestone where you're like, okay. Hmm. I was, or I used to fit into these. And now I'm now I don't. And that might seem like pretty arbitrary to be uninitiated, right, to the non-lifter. But, you know, it's anybody who's really been putting in a lot of effort into working out and trying to make physical progress. Right. I mean, usually just for it's own sake, you know, or, I mean, if you're doing some kind of sports specific thing, that's a little different. You got a different metrics that you're aiming for. But, you know, it's as simple as shit, man. You know, something that I, something that I couldn't do before. I can do now. All right. Guess it's kind of a reverse. Something you used to fit into before you can't now. But, I mean, that's just cool. You know, again, it's a very, it's a very validating kind of thing to see that, right? I mean, that's, and then it just feeds into your motivation. You know, I'd say out-growing clothes, seeing people you haven't seen for, you know, at least like six or so months. And then they noticed that you've like beefed up a touch or in reverse. I mean, I run, I'm bouncing around all sorts of gyms. So I see it on both ends. You know, in my, at my level of things, like, and especially how I'm doing it, I've got insane weight fluctuations. I'm, I'm damn near 35 pounds lighter right now than I was, like six months ago, or four months ago or something. Or whenever, you know, my peak hadiest was. So, I mean, if somebody, if I even run into somebody for like six months or so, they don't know what the fuck they're going to run into, right? They're either like, like either extra big and soft or a bit leaner and dice peel, kind of, I'd say, in a subjective sense, better looking. I mean, like, do not give me wrong. I love the bulk look. But it's kind of just, like, a stepping stone to get into just big and lean. But I mean, fast forward a couple more weeks of dieting. I mean, I'm already feeling the hunger even when I was doing that. When I was walking into legs there, I was like, I could tell I probably wouldn't mind slamming, you know, some kind of random ass protein bar or something, just to have, like, something in my stomach, right? But until then, you know, it's, I like both sides of the same coin, right? bulk up, cut down, big and strong, leaner and crazier looking. It's a good little back and forth, you know? But, but yeah, I mean, seeing legit third person sort of validation or objective, like, values where you said holy crap. I've been trying to beef up. I've been trying to, like, bulk and count my calories. I haven't stepped on a scale for a few weeks. I'm six pounds heavier. Or I'm however, I'm pounds heavier and whatever time frame. Holy shit. What I've been doing has been working. And usually it doesn't take much. It does not take much to feed that sort of, uh, drive to say, hold crap. Okay, if what I've been doing has gotten me these results, and I like these results, then if I keep doing what I'm doing, or I do what I'm doing even harder, more diligently, then I'm going to get even more results, right? And it's just kind of, uh, sort of an upward positive style. I mean, I kind of want to say a addictive thing, right? Because, I mean, the second that you, um, you know, go to grandma's house and you haven't been there for a year or something, and she says, who is that? That is not my grandson, I don't know. Like, that's a cool feeling, you know? So, it's not the end all be all of life, of course, just being bigger, but it is certainly a fun aspect to it. And I'm sure I take it a bit too far, but, you know, what are you going to do? Right? Everybody needs a thing. My thing just also happens to be the work and out. And it's like, it doesn't have to be just lifting, you know? I think everybody should be working out, but not everybody has to take it to such a crazy level, you know? Like, don't be, don't be fooled. I'm like, I'm self aware that I'm taking this to totally, it's just crazy point of like time and dedication and effort, but, you know, just wire like that, right? You'd say the same shit about somebody who was like, cooped up in their car, I do work in hours and hours upon like, like, welding and modding cars and sort of shit like that, or like getting really crazy into coding. One of my friends, he told me, or he keeps me updated sometimes. One of his brothers is like a crazy ass high level, like, coder, like national world level competitions. It's just crazy to see what happens when he's do something for hours on end, on repeat, and you're doing it actively. And usually that only lines up with things that you like. So for you, I mean, you're your own dude, you've got your own life experiences and preferences, and you've got your own like, narrow pathways. Like, two guys can live pretty similar up or things and be like completely different on the outside of it. You know, I can't even be predicted. So I think there is a bit of an overlap of certain things for certain people, where it's like, okay. I like this. I have a little bit of a natural kind of like aptitude for it, and I like it, that's usually it. I like it, and I've got an aptitude for it. So if you can combine those two things, or potentially find something that you can really dive into, like that, and just put hours upon hours of time and effort into, and then you get some kind of something back, and it doesn't have to be like, it's not monetary, it's not like competing wise. It's, I mean, it's really just taking a hobby to the extreme, you know, because you get a certain, like, development, I think, from having something like that. And it just feels better, you know, because regardless of whatever kind of random shit you got to do that day, or that week or that whatever, if you've always got something to spend a couple hours on, or even just an hour, like on, doesn't have to be every day, every couple of days, whatever, where you can get really excited about it. You're just enjoying your time for the sake of enjoying it in the moment, like it's not for any other purpose, like that's just fucking fun, you know? So that's where I say, everybody's got to have a thing like that. Or at least it would be nice if everyone did. And if you feel like you don't, then that should just be a cue that you haven't found it yet. You know, and you got to start looking around, right? Try new shit, you know, pick up, well, I don't know, right? It's up to you. And it really comes down to like, okay, what do you think would be cool to be good at? There's a beginner stage for everything. And honestly, right now, is probably the peak time period of being able to utilize all the information on the internet to learn shit. Right? We're a little bit before the age of like, near a link, whatever, where, you know, if you want to get good at working out, you can just download like, you know, the work and out update into your mind. Hopefully you think, don't get that crazy, but you know, whatever. So it's like any niche interest or whatever that you want to get into. There is already hours upon hours of information that's been documented. And with everything, there's always a place for people to talk about instructions and how to do it and how to get into it and different tips and all sorts of everything. So it's like the barrier to entries, it's on your end. I mean, if you think something could be cool to get into for whatever reason, I think go for it. And then the worst thing that happens is, eh, I don't know if I really, I don't know if I actually really care about that. And then you just, you know, you had a face. And afterward, shipment, you probably learned something. Or if you didn't learn much, you at least learned okay. I don't really like that. Let's try some other shit, right? And then just by pure statistics, eventually you should find something where you're really into it. Right? Be it, ah, the fact man, I'm, you know, what else do people do, right? Who knows, maybe you could be the next world championship boulder. I mean, I don't know, right? That's, it's not for me to tell. It's for you to find out. But I like it. Because then I can go to bed and say, oh, I did that. I had a really good lift. I was sweet, okay. I really pushed myself. Or I can say, oh man, I can't wait to go eat chest tomorrow. Which, I can't wait to go eat chest tomorrow. I'm already getting myself like an excited about it. But you know, it's, it's just nice. Because like regardless of if you're planning to have, like, you know, hang out with somebody or like go do something extra, like just for fun. You've always got something to look forward to and to enjoy on a daily basis. So, that's where I, that's where I say, you gotta find something to fill that void. So, I mean, just a little tip, which I'm kind of spoiled. I found mine a while ago. All right, like this working out thing is, not at the end of it yet. And I don't seem to be for, well, forever. And this is kind of going to be a, a long term type situation, which the longer the better. All right, I mean, if you were like, done with it in just a couple of months, I think that's where some of you guys could learn from some long term thought processes, and then you could enjoy like one piece or, you know, or anything else long like that. That is the crazy shit ever. So people will totally watch all of the game of thrones, but then they'll hate on one piece and say it's too long. And if I can nuts, I'm not going to have to do that. But either way, that's all I got for a little post-lift talk. Good leg session. Now I'm ready to go eat something. I predict ground beef. I predict your ground beef. And then whatever sides will be paired with R to be determined. And half of that is just to be determined by what I've got. I think a grocery trip is long overdue. So I can guarantee that I'll see you tomorrow for chest. And a grocery haul, or I guess the amount of you can haul just a grocery trip, you know, popular cart. That is also in the near future. But I'll see you for chest tomorrow.

It's officially winter. It's gotta be. It's fucking December 1st. So honestly, I should have been a little smarter called the video. Because all these videos are on a one day delay. I should have titled the one I posted today the first day of lift-less. Even though technically it's today because today's the first. But anyway, the first day of lift-less. I'm not going to be hitting some chest. Some chest with a touch of shoulders. Just for kicks. Just for fucking kicks. And the reason I say that is my shoulders are overdeveloped. You know, like when I have an arm pump and I do like a back-to-l-by-shot. When my arms are a little extra bigger than normal, then it's like okay, we're working with some work-a-cooking fire here. But in a lot of other, like side-chairs, anything. A little bit delt dominant. So, you know, for that reason I just don't do much much. But they do need some activation every now and again. For probably too full, right? Just to get a moving. But also, I'm just like I'm going to shoulder pump every so often. So probably the last couple sets of chest. All, uh, all superset them. And not like a legit superset. I mean just kind of in-between sets of flies. I might just do four, uh, four or something. That's a lateral raises. Not the hardest thing in the world. But, uh, a little boring for some, you know. The shoulders, um, shoulders gets a lot of hate. Shoulders and arms, I feel, for the same reason. Because it's always like, oh, one of my supposed to do. Just eight sets of side lateral raises. What am I supposed to do? Just eight sets of curls? I mean, I don't see it like a ton or anything. But that is the argument, you know, hype it up like doing back or chest or something instead. Even legs. Because these guys are like, oh, well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit in one spot with the 30 pound dumbbells. And just do sets a lot of raises back to back to back with that really. Change anything up. It's like, I mean, yeah, man. Kinda, you know. And I see that as a positive. So all that means for me is, all right, it's window. Methodist shoulders. I don't have to move on to different kind of machines or anything else. I can set up camp, you know, pop a squat on a bench or a little seat or something. And then, just go nuts, right? So I see that as a simpler being better, not simpler being boring. But with just, I know I want to start with a reasonably heavy press. I've been doing a lot of incline smith or barbell. So I think that might be off the table. And I might want to swap it with like a plate loaded flat press or Pensually a hammer strength press. I'll just have to see. I'll just have to see when I get in there. But after that, I kind of get free range. I'll move on to some kind of fly some kind of cable press perhaps kind of a superset between the two. And then, without a pro-chman, just always leased me with a pump chest. So there's a certain skeleton of a workout plan that I have. But the actual details and like the, you know, the order of everything. It can fluctuate based on the day. And for me, at least that works really well. Because it makes me excited. Because I know that every workout isn't the exact same workout I just did. You know, it's not giving me like, day job, ooh, like, oh, I just did this chest day. Last chest day. Okay. You know, we're like some shit like that. So I also think that lets you accommodate for any, you know, particular ins and outs of how you might be feeling on the day. Because if you, if you just stick to a random, and not random, but a set routine without much variability, then I feel like what can happen is you can actually, like, put yourself in a position to, I mean, even get hurt. Because if I roll in and I'm doing lateral, uh, or I'm doing like, rotate a couple of warmups. I could tell my right shoulder is a little, uh, it's a little funky, it's a little, and something's awful. Like nothing, nothing jarring, but like I could feel something's off. Maybe that's a good indication or I shouldn't try to do, you know, three plates or access on the incline barbell, or this or that or whatever. You know, like there's a lot of little warning signs that you can feel for and kind of just have a sense for in your warming up phase, where that's what I want to have complete before I decide to say, okay, what should I do next? Because if you don't, I mean, they feel like you're just going in blind. And of course, that's a bit easier for me to say, because I mean, by now I've done almost like 2,000 lifts. So split between body parts. That's like 500 or so chest days, probably actually maybe a little more. But, you know, I've done them that many times. I've got a bit of a feel for like, okay, if I do this and then this and then here and, you know, I know this is going to add up to a workout that's going to feel good for me. If it's easy to pump up, you know, that's kind of what I'm aiming for, right? If it's easy to pump up. So after, you know, having be able to look back on that bank of experience, I think I'm getting a little smarter, or I can say, okay, maybe 4 plates Smith machine isn't a good idea right now. Maybe I should maybe I should go in the lighter, or maybe I should do just some cable presses today, make it a bit more squeeze focus. Like some guys do like a heavy quad day versus a light one, you know, maybe they do heavy leg press, Smith, Swat, whatever, and then they counter that by doing more squeezing stuff. The next leg day, just so they don't kind of start to a crew stress like in your hips or knees and everything else. So all that's to say is just have a good try to develop a bit of a lift or sense for whenever anything is a little bit off-kilter. And not only that, but if something is like if you're patch the point of like, okay, I'm hurt. Don't do the same shit that just hurt you before, or like if you're if your forums on fire right in the pity or elbow when you do like really heavy curls. That's a pretty clear indicator of a, you know, of sensory response, maybe don't do those curls anymore, you know, maybe do something a little lighter. Just get the area warm while you sort of recover it. And I know it obviously sounds simple here in the third person, right, but I've seen guys where every lifts to my shoulders like really screwed. I get, I can't even bench and I'm watching the guy say that as he's batching, you know, it's just doesn't compute sometimes, but either way, five, 25. It feels like it's freaking eight o'clock based on how dark it's getting. So I'd say within, before the top of the next hour, we're going to do in a freaky pose down, preferably, or at least hopefully with some veins creeping across my chest. And then I'll say, uh, I'll probably end up saying some shit like holy crap. Whoa, you know, it is something silly like that. But I think there's nothing else to discuss. This just makes this chest slash shoulder day happen, pose down and come home. I, uh, I've only eaten one meal today. It was like a late, actually more like just like a late lunch, and then I took it now. So, I mean, I've been up for a while, but I did, uh, yeah. So, we're in a little lower food-wise, but that's kind of the whole point of the diet, so that's good with me. All right, the fact that I've got 1,800 or 1,700 calories left to eat after this workout. All that means is I get to go to bed with a full stomach. So that's, uh, honestly, that's pretty much a W every time, or at least every day that I'm dieting. Because going to bed with going to bed hungry, ah, just sucks. Plus, but likely, how you're going to get up, find the randomest snack you've ever found in your club, in your, uh, like in your cupboard that you've never even thought of eating before and say, to yourself. I don't know if I'm kind of hungry, you know, maybe I should just eat some, some, whatever. Maybe it's, uh, try not to try to save some calories before bed just to hold you off and see you fall asleep. But yeah, no more chat and let's get started. I'll be honest with you. I don't think this is, because there's a ton of different hamster-string chest presses, and this one's good, but my favorite. And then this isn't like a grading scale, which one's better, just like my preference, but they've got like a really incline one. I guess this is the other version of their flat press, and I got more of a decline. Usually the flat presses my favorite, but this one's just something about it, not perfect, but for what I get available, this will do the trick just right. So three plates into 25, which like, it is heavy, but I don't feel like I'm going to hurt myself. Like the three, three filler reps, the three plates felt very doable. So I mean, I can see this being a 15 reps set. But one thing with a lot of these machines is I'm going to put these plastic clips that spacers, because if I don't, I feel like I'm going to hurt myself. Because I'm like, I'm going to get a stretch, but I don't start at that starting position. I feel like I'm just asking the trouble. That's like putting somebody onto a, a cambered bench bar, where they get an extra two inches range of motion. I don't know where. I can, well, a freaky, but by adding these two spacers, and as soon as I lift off the fall of the ground, and then I can get into it. But, you know, I think left me to do this pick a good song and go nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh my god. Three plates of the 25 was too much. Let's lose the 25. But it really gets started though. One thing I like about the chest presses specifically, much more cost and tension. I'm going to work the whole time. But that's kind of a get out. Let's do the next one. I was just going to do that. Let's groove. Kind of old school. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, good. That was a good starting machine. But I think I've got my, you said of it. Let's move on. I got a little faster pace because I'm dying now. It's not like I need five minutes. It's like really tips to the damage that my sets do in a bulked up state when I've got extra energy. Extra fucking like glycogen, extra everything. I can really swing and fucking heavy hammer. But dying down. I'm going to get more of like a, like a nail hammer, right? So I can swing and start as I want. It's just not doing as much damage. You know, like fully carved up and bolt. I mean, this would be like 25 reps. But it's not about the numbers. It's about the subjective intensity. No matter where you're at. So if you wake up week one day, the musician, man, failure is still failure, whether you're doing three plates or one. But let's move on to something else. Maybe, uh, well, I guess we'll find out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm surprised I can even rip out three plates after those sets of chest press. So I'd say the heavy portion of this lift is complete. So I want to totally contradict it with this set. 35 pound flies, which very doable at this point. But kind of a high angle. And then I'll just go back to the shoulders back here and keep my palms up. Because whenever I do any kind of fly or even chest press with cables, once you start pushing like this, especially for me, I'm already prone to hunch. As soon as I got my hands over here, front delts pump to help. So keep my palms up. Help to keep my front delts out of it because it almost like rounds them out of the way. So it's more chest. So to do these, maybe a superset afterward, or close to done more than halfway for sure. I mean, four crazy sets of pressing done. That's about right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let me make some adjustments. I think I got a lower heat scapula for the next one. Another set of flies. But this one is going to be a bit more pump focus. And what I mean by that is of course, that ass value through a slow controlled set. But you don't need great. Don't neglect. I don't know what words I'll try to combine there. But I think there is still a value of doing some pump out reps like quicker faster pace. Just constant tension the whole way through. Not even crazy slow. And I mean, I can't explain the myel fibular process, which makes my chest inflate with more blood than normal. But I can say this, my chest is going to be more pumped after this set than if I were to do something else. So 35 is again the same weight. And nothing crazy still pumps up. But instead of taking a few steps forward, I want to say right in the middle and bend over. It sort of gives a similar effect. But now I don't have to worry about back and forth balance. All you got to do is worry about. Keep my shoulders out of it and go nuts. Oh, I think that's good. And I think I lied about the shoulders. Wow. Yeah. Let's go search. Let's just go straight to the pose down space. Alright. So that was two sets of chest press. Two sets of incline. Two sets of gables. Six hard sets. All done pretty quickly. I said some shit in the car before. Yeah. I think I said before seven, I'd be fully pumped. It's 630. So obviously not the longest workout in the fucking world. But it just doesn't have to be. And that's. That's not a blanket statement. Don't forget the fact that right now I'm simply trying to like stimulate my chest as much as I can. But there's no point really in me trying to overdo it because I'll simply end up stressing my system out from overwork. And it'll just like totally throw up my whole time frame of getting lean or anything else. So I want to get to a point where I'm fully pumped. I'm fully fatigued. I've done some stimulating work. But not exceed into overreaching too many sets. Like physically. If I were to do three more sets today, it would do me no good. It might not do me that much bad. If anything, maybe it would be good because I've burned more calories for the day. But for the most part, dieting especially. I want to do as much as I need. Post down and be done. Your home needs something. And that last portion that same is extra legit today. I got a lot of food eat still. Which is a nice feeling considering I am in a fucking deficit. But no more. No more chat in there. I'm just going to get ready to get the car. So. Oh, we can't. Yeah. So the leaner I get. Obviously the trimmer my waist becomes. And then I mean even just standing no pose no nothing. I feel like a total fucking freak show. Which I guess should be the point by now, right? But still. Maybe it's just something I don't have. But it never ceases to fucking give me some feel. Give me some feel. Goods in my mind. To see myself pumped up in the mirror. But let's, let's run through some shit. Oh my gosh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. I can hold these poses after I fall on chest A is getting tricky but as I'm sure it's coming off. Very goorainee getting much ges die. As freaky is this may look, now. But oh my gosh Yeah, we're definitely getting somewhere with this fucking side profile. This was uh This was the coolest shit ever for me. It's obviously or maybe not obviously, but I'm a huge a Bucky fan Like I was watching the uh the 90s show Bucky or the 90s version when I started working out like that was an awesome source of hype for me So the first time I can see myself do like Like a side profile like this and it's just like that one frame That really got me fucking going, but let's uh, let's see if I can reach around and do a side choice Which with a full chest pump it's harsh me to pull my fucking shoulders back that far I A lot of the uh a lot of the bodybuilder characters that always tell me I want my like this shoulder up Which I'm not saying they're wrong or anything, but I kind of like the freak factor like the full on sideways looking Oh goodness, but either way feeling quite fucking freaky And I just don't even want to leave I want this pump to last fucking forever But the fact that it doesn't is what really gives it a true value Oh, yes, all right Enough pump checking I Yeah, this is I mean this is just crazy cool for me. I don't and it's hard to translate because obviously I'm like 240 No, like 238 239 right now But even at 170 look at myself pumped up like just going back and remembering like my sort of level of satisfaction of like looking at myself with a pump back then versus right now It's really not that much different because You know it's like how Getting something is usually less enjoyable than chasing it. I I'm trying to think of an example, but like whatever, you know like something that you used to think was like oh once I have this I'll be crazy happy and then you get it and it just doesn't work it's like You know you get spoiled over time, but with the pumps It doesn't matter if you've been working after two months or two fucking decades Every time you get a pump and you look at yourself extra-freaky extra-vani or even an A bolt's context just a little bit extra big and like defined That's just cool man and it's simply a boost from your baseline That's what gives you it's satisfaction So whether you're walking around at two 80 lean like an absolute freak or at 180 on a irregular character Dude the feeling of satisfaction of raising yourself from that baseline at least in a post-down context and This might only have to do with You know anybody who's got the fucking Jim bug and they're nuts about it, but honestly I mean everybody watch the original spider-man and use when we saw Toeim Aguire a little extra beefy in the mirror. You don't think everybody was like man That would be cool that would be cool to wake up jacked right? I mean if you could press a button everybody would do it But when you put it in the reality it's okay You know workout for this many years do all this cardio do this diet, you know don't eat pure just regular food the taste good all the time Makes people take your step back, but You know now I'm just getting into random ass rambles. Let's get in the car This was a fucking awesome night All right, so this is not actually immediately post lift I had a little bit of a pit stop There was a need a little bit of a pit stop before the car and that was just 10 quick little minutes on the seated bike difficulty level nine RPM 85 or something which when that all adds up together that puts me at about a hundred calories a minute the Machine said I'd burned and oh holy shit a hundred a minute would be insane No ten calories a minute so that put me at a I was at probably actually pedaling a little faster So that put me at about 114 calories in those ten minutes that's what the machine said and I mean they I'm sure they're based on some kind of metric actually if you if anybody is aware of exactly How they're calculating that I'd be kind of curious to a to read that comment because I mean It's That value is not gonna be the same for everybody because everyone has different levels of efficiency You know and what I mean by that is like if you take somebody who's a serious Marathon Would you say marathon cyclist or would you just say competitive cyclist? Well, either way that guy Is much more efficient at his cardio than I would be you know so for us to both pedal at Let's say Well, they're same difficulty level nine 80 80 RPM for 10 minutes Both of the machines are gonna read the same amount of calories But his heart rate is gonna be much lower than mine You know for him that he might even just stay at 80 and barely even get raised above I mean get get raised above baseline a little but he's just more efficient, you know whereas I'm gonna be up at like 120 130 like I'm That's what you're really aiming for so it's a it's not necessarily aiming for like a specific number It's just making sure that your heart rate is elevated to a certain zone for a period of time And it doesn't have to only be from sitting around doing cardio, you know if you've got a crew Where every lift at like five o'clock, you know, they're playing basketball for an hour That is cardio that is fucking legit, you know and if you've got like a little techie Like Apple Watch or some kind of heart rate monitor and you can look back and say oh shit for the past 45 minutes of playing basketball my heart rate was 120 on average, you know maybe it spiked up a little when you're really going for it and if you You know if you back off and defense maybe it gets a little bit lower but if the average is elevated Dude, you just did some cardio you're good and it really just adds up throughout the day so I You know I added a little extra 10 minutes post lift Which not that hard, you know 10 minutes post cardio you guys have no excuse and I'm not saying you specifically I just mean in general like 10 minutes on the cardio bike post workout as like a little bit of a Dip your toes into what cardio is like Dude, not the trickiest thing in the world and then just work your way up from there You know of course I'm gonna be saying do your 30 minutes of cardio every morning on its own like having it be a tone of vent Underrelated to the lift so you can really optimize that lifting portion but yeah, just easing into it, you know Let's say you just finish arms You're not totally dead. You're not totally fatigued like I'm gonna go Yeah, it's just arms man, you know even if you went extra hard your whole system is not so stressed after like a leg there Something you have some energy left in the tank and before you know that 10 minutes is gonna turn into 15 And then maybe you're feeling extra excited to watch and like some hype tick talk at it's I mean I'll get into that pretty seriously where not even watching a video or anything I'm just scrolling through some of my saved shit that gets me up it up and like I'll be I'll be like don't heart in the cardio I'll up it to um Up the difficulty a little bit for a couple minutes and like really if I can get into it You know because it's not a and that really helps for me because then you're not treating like a chore you're treating it like like an activity I mean why do you think all the cycling classes or Like the pellets on classes and stuff they're trying to get you excited about they're trying to like turn it Like maybe that game of five but like make it make it an exciting thing because it's more fun to do it that way, you know like get If you can get into it it's I mean it'll it just makes sense you go harder So whatever Whatever gets you known I say go for but that's one benefit of The phone right and just like scrolling social media style stuff Or like watching all sorts of YouTube videos or catching up on your shows if you get 30 minutes of cardio Then I mean I don't I don't feel bad plan on my phone for a half hour straight if I'm on the cardio bike Because I'm like dude. I just got to pass the time anyway, right? You know scroll away so That's why that's why you're not gonna catch me do the stair master too often or like The treadmill Like I I know a lot of guys love the incline walk But I want my hands free, you know I want to sit here and Fill around and before I know it that 30 minutes is over like I don't even think about it I if I'm feeling really crazy sometimes I'll do an hour But not not on a regular basis and hour every day I'm not that level of I'm not at that level of dieting yet I think it's gonna happen I mean today was a 45 minutes total 35 in the morning 10 post workout But yeah, so what I'm trying to do is just increase my overall energy output like that And then simultaneously Decrease my calories as necessary because those are the two opposing forces Which will either put you in calorie A calorie surplus calorie maintenance or calorie deficit Bolking maintaining or Dining down getting leader Right, I can lose any fat if you're bulking up and Do not I don't like when people talk about well When I when I first started working out at gain five times a muscle and they got leaner at the same time That is true That is for sure, obviously There's somebody recomp Value as a beginner because you've never trained before like you're Really getting a new stimulus But I'm talking like once you've been lifting year year and a half you're legit like you've sort of got those new begins down Which are I feel like sometimes people say new begins like kind of arbitrarily But it seriously is just a phenomenon if you take somebody and you change nothing about their diet You change nothing about their sleeper Hydration or anything and you just add weight training five days a week Not even like crazy way training we just like some basic shit or if you take a weight training class in high school or some shit like that not to Feel like it is such shit 10 times enough in a freaking row But purely adding Weight based training like that you're gonna see gains as a beginner that's enough to put you past the The threshold of No results into results but over time That threshold increases and now instead of Seeing some progress with just five workouts a week reasonable intensity, you know, just getting into it Breaking a bit of a sweat It's hard to do so that's where I think that the calorie side of things the dieting side of things is like It's like cheat coats. I mean it seriously is you know if you take somebody who knows anything about uh I mean it's like having a having your maintenance matchups do and if you know all the tricks and you know all the moves and everything else It's so much easier right so If you if you're the guy where you're like oh man, you know Which I could get a little bit leaner and which I could Man, but it's you know the actual like Action step of what you should do to start to approach that goal is a little bit arbitrary Fuck man cardio bike Macro tracker Those are some pretty damn powerful tools if you utilize correctly and they're so unassuming, you know it's not It's not so flashy It's simply a question of doing doing this stuff on the regular and before you know it well Never seen latstriations before Never seen that vein before never seen you know it's but The tricky part is it just takes a long time and depending on the guy I mean if you take uh If you take a beginner dude and hundred sixty pounds He starts working out He gains 20 pounds a muscle over the course like three years or 15 or however many like he goes from more of it Just regular looking dude to like this guy lifts Which it doesn't take that much you don't have to be 230 lean to look like you work out I mean when I look back at the pictures when I was 180 lean Yeah, man, I like fun cool. I wasn't as big but that's not like a negative and I was just at that love You know so there's a you don't have to be a freaking 260 pound But don't don't don't think I'm trying to say that But Oh, that was a better say But you know when I hear that That's not so impressive to me and I'm not trying to like take away from it Anybody's gains but what really gets me going is when I hear the stories or I run into somebody of the gym and they show me some before and after pictures Where like they used to be a hundred pounds overweight And over the course of like I mean they always like a year year and a half They're down to like a 15% body fat That's what really gets me excited because these guys as a beginner I mean like he being introduced into weights Now they did have that extra difficulty you have to have an idea with that fat loss in the beginning which I mean I think nine times out of ten not even the dudes fault especially if you're younger that's uh that's really wrong I'm gonna put a lot of blame on the You know any of you guys who are parents Right trying to try to it's a feed your kids too much junk Because it does add up and Man in the future You're giving them a problem to solve later really I mean it really sucks So it's I'm never gonna look at somebody who's overweight and think man what do Sometimes that you can't even fucking troll it man you know you just get a you just draw some bad cards But the guys who show me those sort of progress pictures those journeys like my My eyes light up Because they know They know about the cardio they know about the calories they get it they've done it they've seen it happen And until you've really gone through that and made like Significant body recomp changes by way of you know extra cardio calorie restriction like and simply just having Gone through the process of like Straight up half in the mental toughness of okay I'm hungry But if I overeat that's not conducive with my goals all right I can I can handle I can handle this Like that's what's most impressive to me because those guys Usually are the ones where they go the first and they work out the longest they stain Reason will shape for the longest that I kind of and half of this is me just kind of guest-imating But from what I've seen that's kind of what I've what I've got the gist of because for them to get into fitness The barrier to entry was much higher So If you overcome a hard to challenge you're gonna be tougher at the end of it So I mean a lot of the times that's what gets me fucking excited because anybody can start working out But to really get a good grasp of like You know I'll say the same shit every time I'm like okay, so you know about the calorie track you're actually doing your cardio God damn right because it's the only way to do it Right and I'm not saying it's easy but that's what gives it its value the fact that it's hard and you can look back and say holy crap I lost 50 fucking pounds this year like that isn't saying I'd say that's cooler than saying I gained five pounds of muscle this year Just because it's got more It's just got like a fucking cool as factor to it, you know, so that's where That's where you get a whole strong right when it takes a year two years or However long those results are there waiting for you If you can get all these sort of things in place. I mean that's why I'm never gonna stop talking about the calories and the cardio and the like getting a good Sort of sense of just you know how the food that you're eating is gonna react So that's how too live is kind of flash and over in the field or something distract me But you get back to what I say and like If you can get a good grasp of really how this food that you're eating affects your end result Lifting wise performance wise just overall like feeling wise like I feel pretty good right now Just subjectively like my end state is not me walking around at like two 90 bolts like I'm gonna be a leaner baseline state not really pounding down food Just feel better you know I sleep well. I feel a pretty decent amount of energy I'm much more flexible like I'm I'm certainly in the realm of like being Reasonally muscle bound but when I'm dieting down and I'm not so like full of carbs and just like Like I feel like if I like when I get a I'm sure on some of these leg pumps Into this next bolt and face like I'm probably gonna get a new stretch mark somewhere like It like a day it'll happen and won't just accrue slowly like oh that was a crazy leg pump Oh shit that's a fresh one really outside of a quad like that's you know, but that's not forever Going to get to point where I got This is about as big as I want to be let's stay here for a while. Let's stay here and let's stay here and just kind of Enjoy the being right but Clean is freaking us stretch but yeah, so you know it It's just nice so all that's to say do your cardio Think about oh yeah, I'm not I'm not done yet. I lost my train of thought, but I found it So that's where I'm I'm never gonna stop talking about that because it's such a powerful fucking tool If you take a guy who's worked that for two years He's got a good grasp of working out he knows uh, I mean, I was I'm soon he's really you know trying to learn about it But he knows all sorts of curls he does good workouts. He pushes himself hard. He doesn't go easy Like he's an experienced lifter To take that guy where he's like you know he just kind of eats whatever He might get a he might do a protein shake every now and again, but apart from that He's not really leveraging the diet to you know target whatever goals he's really aiming for And not everybody has to there is definitely a draw to not worrying about your diet at all because working out versus not working out Is already a massive boost You know not everybody wants to be dealing with counting calories all the time But I'd be I mean I feel like I'd just be holding back information if I didn't really say Like dude If you can get a good grasp of these of your calorie intake Carb's fats proteins meal timing like how to maybe you're trying to diet down you want to leverage more meals later in the day So that it's easier to stay in a deficit like Dining but it doesn't have to be torture like you can make it easier on yourself It takes a while to get there because like anything you gotta learn about it You know it's gonna take some Basic just skill acquisition and practice But once you've got reasonably or a reasonably good grasp on it I promise things that used to feel like a crazy plateau like this bench number or these this body weight or this level of leanness Those things will I promise Expand Beyond like what you thought you'd be able to do before it's just that powerful you know So you know we're gonna hear me You know you're never gonna hear me shut up about the cardio over the or the diet like I mean obviously go hard That's what separates Some guys versus even some others but that's all you gotta say there I am very fucking hungry. I'm gonna I don't know what I'm gonna slam I got about a pound of ground beef left I might do some My do some deep constructed burger So that's where I take uh I'm doing like a pound of ground beef Catch up low sugar mustard mayo Relish gonna make the whole thing up And it's like you know getting burger esc no carbs but it's uh yeah I mean that that's the kind of shit you start to get into but I'll get into some more dieting stuff soon enough I get it uh I'll add um I'll try to record a couple of those and make like a little Dating Cooking series. I might just do I'll probably just do one long video with like Four or five different little meal recipes that I like doing like the ground beef balls love them Some peanut butter or some powdered peanut butter stuff with some low-court low-carb tortillas With like sugar free maple syrup like I got a couple tricks here but I'll uh I'll try to put it into something soon enough So play for tomorrow slam back Yeah, I think I'll add some calves to have haven't really been smack and calves around too hard and then Come back all meet something go to sleep and repeat that's kind of gonna be the plan for the next couple of months Actually, well, go home eating sleep as a plan forever But in a dieting phase just the next couple of months So that's all I got I'll see you for back tomorrow

It's been a little less since I gave the critters an update. This is kind of a classic little 3P spot. Rocky, Rio, Rascal, little triple R. This is just lucky. That was his name already. They have no comprehension. They've got no idea what a back pump is or what lifting straps are. Reptent reserve and a little jealous. They probably live a little more, a little more purely than we do, right? But rather than just lounge around, how about we go get this freaking back day started? Let's get the car. Speaking of updates, two-thirties have finally been broken into. I'm talking morning body weights 238.6. Of course, that's just like the low of that of today. I mean, if I, I get to start, I get to actually track in it. I'm like a little graph up in it's like, but if you look at your weight on a day by day basis, up and down, all freaking over the place. It gets hard to really look at your actual sort of progress. If you're really focusing on the cocaine. I'm five pounds, everything that was yesterday. Crap. You didn't just gain five pounds of math. Five pounds of fat. Move gain five pounds of muscle loose. It's all, you got a pretty solid amount of water, car based fluctuation, which can really throw off your daily readings. So all that's to say is, you know, don't freak about the daily. Try to find it like a weekly trend. And if you're headed upward or downward, or if whatever reason you want to just main gain, you're on track for whatever that trajectory, or I guess intended trajectory is, then you're fucking good. But let's say, so cat update, weight update, a little bit of a clothing update. The freaking t-shirts are almost sold out. The smalls and the mediums are gone. There's a, which, it's come on. I was on the impression that three XLs would be the first to go. Yeah, I'm just kidding. But we'll see. So feedback noted, the over the shoulder lettering, a little much, a little much. But yeah. It's, so that's where I less is more turned out to be the actual, the sweet spot. But you know, since there's a new thing, I think I subconsciously wanted to be like a little, a little more out there with it. But we'll make some adjustments. I, yeah. I think next, the next time we do a little re-stock, it'll be, it'll mean new stuff. It won't just be the same shit every time. Especially now in the beginning, you know, it's changed it up. Different styles, different all sorts of, all designs, whatever. But that's, that's kind of the, that's the behind the scenes. But in terms of today specifically, with back, I'm talking the same stuff as normal, man. I did a, hmm, I did sort of a low, mid back row to start last back day. I think I might, well, I'll see. You know, I'll make sure I change it up enough from the last back day, so that this one is a bit different. But, you know, for the most part, as long as you change up your movements, and you finish pretty well-fati, pretty well-pumped, and you're good, you know. And I think some guys take it a little too far. I mean, especially older, there's a lot of quotes of like, more power lifter, like guru style guys, and I don't mean that, like, these guys were the shit in terms of power lifter and training and knowledge, and, you know, they'll say pretty blank at statements. Like, I would never start a workout with the same movement twice in a row. I would never do that. And I think it's just a, you know, a testament to you should change it up and the benefit of variability. But if you got like a badass chest-day, and you love doing inclined Smith, pecdec, pec-press, and then one like superset of, like cable flies or something, if that's your bread and butter, it's not too bad for doing the same one a couple times, but still it's going to be good to kind of just explore the space, try new shit, and, you know, sometimes even stuff that doesn't really connect with you in the mall, I mean, for a long time, you would never catch me do a chest-day starting with, you know, any kind of pec-fly or cable press, like it was always heavy bench-only, heavy dumbbell bench, or heavy dumbbell press only. Like, start with your heavy shit, then move on light or stuff at the end. But, you know, I'll throw in the occasional chest-day where I start with cable flies as like a pre-exoster, and then move on to some of the clip-pressant. Which I think both have their positives and negatives, you know, you're going to be pre-fifteen so you're losing that kind of maximum workload and tension from the heavy pressing, but then you've already got some pre-activation some by the time you move on like a Smith bench, even if you're not doing three plates, you know, you back it off to one or, and I want it to lean. Two or so, then, you know, you are kind of already pumped. It's a good little, like it's pre-fifteen, it's kind of just the right word. But, you know, we're changing you up, man. And then there's only two outcomes, either, wow, I did not really like that workout. I'm going to go back to what I do like. And then if you went hard, it's still going to be good. You know, I could just roll a dice that had like seated road, dumbbell row, pull over, pull down, chest-supported row, hammer strength row. I could just roll that seven times for this workout. And then as long as I went crazy and whatever set that ended up landing on, like a wind-hard push myself to failure, did reasonable reps. I would still have a good back to me. So it's not like your exercise selection is the most important thing in the world. But it's just something to think about, you know. And the other scenario, if you try some news that you haven't tried before, is you say, holy crap. Single on pullovers. It feels so much better than double on pullovers. What the hell have I been doing? You know, and then you got a new little, a new little bonus to your workout arsenal. But for 14, reasonably early lift, even though it feels like seven o'clock, without muggy it is. But that's alright. And that's alright. You got to make use of the grunge to speed it back into your internal hype. But I doubt it's going to be too packed. It's getting cold. I feel like people are, you know, anybody who's not really locked in, they might want to stay home. Stay nice and warm. Come on. Not fucking cool. So have I, have I, no more talking? Let's just go get this lift started. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That's all right, Yalike. Oh, you got to say. I don't mind leaning back a little bit on those. I'm kind of trying to get lads, but a little bit of lower and good bats too. But let's just repeat that. Keep it simple. You go from there. We'll pull that out start for today. Yeah. It's. Oh, I'm going to say. Let's switch to a row. Feel back and forth. Let's see some. Well, I guess individually loaded double arm seated rows. Little more upper back focus than regular seated with. Because the cables are lower than, you know, chest height. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, one more. I'm going to say, let's see a little two-wing two-stop. Two rows, two-pole nands, two rows, two-pole nands. Until I'm too pumped. Let's move on. Well, that way now, I'm going to say, let's see one more. Then move on. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think let's say right here, get some single on pullovers done on this cable. As one more benefit of being a little more open instead of rigid. With your workout plan, I already got this cable open. Mayors won't make some extra use of it. But let's get the pullover started. It's not like I was saying in the car. I am definitely a thin of the single arm pullover instead of both at once. I just feel like I can, like, if I'm doing double the rope, I can get some like here. But I want to be like down here, like, almost hit, hit distance. Oh, either way, light-ish. And then you can also kind of hold on to the top part of some extra stability. That's good for me. I'm trying to isolate my lats. Now work my whole system, trying to bounce. But let's go nuts here. Let's that first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go a few pants lighter. But we're on that chin up one more time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at a really dealt activation on those two. Not a problem. I don't really do many of those dealt sets anyway. But let's, uh, it's fine if real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. It's trying overhand a set of unusual techniques. And then one match lighter. That's all too patty for this. Fortunately, the lift. Yeah. I think I know exactly what the finish was. And if all some cables in the bench. I'm sure some of you already know it's all good. As I'm sure some of you predicted. Just this sort of long double D handle. Pull down. Slatcher row kind of combination. Just does the trick for the end man. Really get my whole back fucking hot. But I think this will be it. We can go do a little pose down and it's ground. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got it. We know it's next. That's fine. That's what I'm saying. So reasonably simple and quick back day done. Doesn't take much. So that was, uh, let me go back to the beginning. Two sets of pull downs. Very like squeeze focus on the bottom. I didn't hold it, but like that's what I was trying to do. Like, Oh, that's sort of just a little momentary extra like flex. But two of those. Two cable rows also pretty squeeze focused. Two pullovers. So that puts me six. Two. Well, shit. Wait a second. Two pull downs. Two cable rows. Two pullovers. Two machine rows. Yeah. That's a good work, man. Nine sets. That's more than I'm actually usually fucking doing right now. But all that's to, uh, all those sets. Add it up to the pump. And we're about to see. And carb-wise. Not doing so hot. Carbon take today so far. Well, I mean, it's good that it's low. Obviously, I'm, I'm trying to die down. I want it to be low. But I definitely felt it a little bit in my endurance. Set by set. So it's not always the best idea to completely save all your calories for later. Like after the lift. Because you get to run on something. But yeah. 70 grams of carbs, 43 a fat, 115 a protein so far. All adding up to about 1200 net calories. Which I want to track for fucking, you know, my fat loss. But I definitely feel that lack of, uh, glycogen. But more hype and kind of excitement in dozing that is feeling the lack of fucking body fat. I mean, this is way more like abs and strations. And I've seen for quite a while. I've, you know, I bulk up and I cut down. But time-wise, I've been much more bulk than I have been cut for a while. I kind of want to even those scales out. Over these next couple of months really see what everything is kind of added up to. But let's run through some shit here. Oh, he grabbed it. Then same thing for the back. And this is one awesome benefit of bust and out the camera instead of your phone. Because I'm looking at my own reflection right now. So I can see if one shoulder's a little bit skew and when I last spread. Because if you can't see yourself doing that, you can't really begin to build some bad habits. For a long time, every time I do a double-by-shot. Here. Oh, he's... Oh, he's... Oh, well, let's just do the pose before we say anything else. Alright, I think that actually... That warrants a zoom in. Let's get a little tighter here. Now, I would not go so far as to say even close to Hanma back status yet. But definitely getting somewhere. Oh, yeah, there we go. Holy crap. So that's why I've been... Oh my gosh. You can't see it. But I can see the autofocus like eye tracker. And it literally thinks this chunk of shit right under my rear delt is an eyeball. Oh my god. And it might not even seem that crazy. Like relative to my last back day or the last one, especially for anybody watching this clip like in the third person. I guess that's the only way you could be watching it. But it might not seem like much. Like, oh, you can see a few more fibers and maybe some veins in there. But... For my perspective, this is fucking nuts. Let me get one more double-by-subscibe in here. I don't want to stop fucking posing, man. There we go. Yeah, so... I think without exaggeration, that might be the freakyest my back has ever looked. Like, just a combination of today's pump, the lighting, maybe whatever level of hydration or like sodium intake. But I think some of those were my craziest back poses ever. And that is such a fucking insane thing to say. That's what's extra cool about the workin' out is if you don't take your foot off the gas and you're just kind of constantly in a state of progress. And it doesn't even have to be the craziest progress in the friggin' world. Let's say you're bulking up. Yeah, I'm three pounds heavier this week. Or this month and I was last month. Or I'm one pound like if you don't slow down. Now, obviously not everybody's gonna begin a crazy amount of muscle in the beginning. Or at the end or whatever else, I mean, it's all different kind of rates. But as long as you're on track to some kind of progress, eventually you should get to a point where you're constantly breaking new ground. And that is the most motivating shit ever. As much as there's value of like, oh, you know, just grind even if you don't fucking feel like it or like, you said you would do it. Like there's some legit mentality like self-discipline there. Obviously, if you want long-term results, you kind of have to put in long-term effort. But it's so much nicer if you just enjoy it. So that's why I really hate all of the kind of gatekeeping that a lot of dudes will get into. Like if you see the like all the, what do they even call them? It's like the panel videos where there's like five guys like five from the fitness industry. And then I mean, they specifically just get like five people who don't work out or like kind of I'm a heavier side of things. And they put them in this debate and then some of the real like, I guess, rude or guys are like, you guys are just, you're just back because that's what you want to do. You're not willing to put in the work. Like you can be right, but you can still be an asshole, you know. So that's where the guys who I find make the most gains are the ones who are just doing a routine that they enjoy. And that takes a little bit of time to like learn. There's definitely some upfront effort of like getting into it and getting to feel for everything, you know, have some guys who already work out who you know, take you under their wing shadow and for a couple workouts. But before you know it, you're going to have a macro track on your phone. You're going to be doing cardio every so often lifting on the regular and dude in two years. You can be a completely different guy on wreckage. As bad as better drop one there on wreckage freakingizable. So I, I just want to rewatch that fucking posing clip, but let's let's get in the car. Back day 10 out of 10 done. Well done. Lots of fun. New ground being broken into this diving phase. Getting me up to up. That right there, that lean air slightly, veiny back pump check. That's part of my, that's part of my primary motivation that's keeping me from having a quick pit stop at a. At a certain establishment. Red hair girl. Pig tails. Makes a mean spicy chicken sandwich and a vanilla frosty with fries. And hold off. I am going to hold off a little while longer. And one thing that also makes it easier for me to be a bit more chill is the fact that a. That just makes me feel like shit, you know. It's different when I'm in a bulking phase. And that sounds kind of bad because it's like, I'm used to eating a lot more junk food. But in a way, like, you really are, you know, because right now I'm being a bit more. I'm a thautical. And not even a bit more like very freaking methodical about the foods that I'm eating. I mean there's no treats right now. Treats are off the fucking menu. I've got four pounds of ground beef that I cooked this morning sitting in a big. Tapper wear ball. So every couple hours I end up scooping about 50 grams of protein worth of that. Some sugar free catch up or some barbecue sauce or something. And then a carb of some variety. I'm kind of chilling on like big carb meals because I don't have that many to work with. You know, I'm in the sub 200 range right now. So if I have a 50, you know, if I've got like a lunch or some kind of meal with 50 grams of carbs worth of rice or something. That's that's one third of my whole day, you know. So what I end up doing is like I've got some granola in the, I'm, why don't I keep calling it the cupboard in the pantry. Yeah, what the hell? There were pantry has like a looted me the last couple days. But I've got like some little blueberry granola stuff in the pantry and like some, I've got some Graham crackers floating around and some all sorts of stuff. I'll just, I mean, I'll do some oatmeal too. But my carbs kind of just sort of seat in throughout the day. I mean, earlier when I had a, when I had like some ground beef with the catch up, the mustard, the, like, basically relish and a bit of like fat free. We're not fat free, but lower fat man is with some low carb buns. I'd add it that man. You know, with the catch up, you know, it's no sugar added, but there's still sugar. I mean, there's still a 20 carb meal. That's 20 carbs, you know, you don't have a lot to play with. So the, you know, the benefit of pretty much classic bodybuilding eating is the fact that it just simply works in a dieted phase, you know. Protein heavy meals, minimal, you know, minimal on the side department, beat carbs or fats. It's just kind of the only way to do it, you know, because I mean, yeah, this is a rare occurrence. I mean, more protein than I am carbs when I'm bulking up, it is the other way around by like a pretty big fine degree, you know, to the point where I'll be eating on a, once I really get into a bulking phase, basically not seven, but about like five or six times as many carbs as I'm eating in a whole day is what I get to, you know, I get a fifth of that now. So it's kind of crazy to think like in a couple of months when I start bulking up again. I'll be eating a weeks where the carbs right now per day. Oh, goodness. I don't even like to think about it. But, you know, that's all right. So until then, I can held off. I can hold off. I got some mental fortitude there. No, oh shit. You know, let me, I'm trying to remember last time I had a crispy cream. That's kind of, that's like my version of a crumble for everybody else. And with the crumble, I'm not sure I see the appeal. Like, you know, you tell me, but I've gotten crumbled before way too sweet. And I know that's crazy for me to say, but it's like just way, it's too much. It's like all frosting. Some of their plain stuff is cool. Like it's hard to screw up a classic like chocolate chip cookies, I'm thin. But at that point, like I'd rather, I'd just rather have something else, you know, but insert. If you really want to make gains, you should never eat any kind of junk food like that. Hey, man, near the, you might be right, right? But I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to be in some crispy cream on this next Balkan phase. I'm sure. Not a ton, but I'll have a little. A little like an urgent tube bed. And it's just, you know, it's fuel for the fire. So you're trying to bulk up. There is benefits who simply getting those calories down. Now it's not the best method, of course. You want to optimize it. Like, I feel so much better. The protein's always the same. I kind of, I don't remember the last time I had a, well, that's not true. I've got a bunch of like pre-made little protein shakes in the fridge just for like if I've got to stop at the house really quick and then go somewhere else. I'll grab one, you know, like the 40 gram, whatever. But for the most part, all the protein is just, you know, meats, eggs, protein, or obviously eggs. Eggs, beef, turkey, ground turkey. I, um, I've been like in the can to chicken. It's just so easy. You know, I'll see, some of you guys are commenting saying, why would you ever eat can to chicken? Cook it yourself. I don't see that, like, did the can to chicken. It's right there. It takes one second. And you don't make a whole mess because you're not getting the whole pan dirty and, you know, it's kind of instant. So that's the benefit there if you're curious to my thought process. But, you know, kind of just plain where I really try to indulge sweet this wise is you have, like, like, I think I've got like 10-2 liters of my, in the pantry too. All diet soda. I've got some, uh, got some diet dew. Got some sugar-free red faggo, some Sprite Zero, all sorts of shit like that. So that's kind of, uh, that's my sweet for the day. And I don't know if, uh, I'm, you know, am I crazy for this? My crazy for flattening the soda in, like, a separate gallon jug and then drinking it. Because it's like, what are you supposed to do? Drink a, drink two liters of carbonated something or other? It's just, you know, I, uh, doesn't, I'm just looking for something sweet to drink. So that's kind of, that's right, get after it. Crystal light, that's sort of thing. In fuckin' words, man. You know, and I think the craziest thing I've ever heard is when guys, uh, are somehow under the impression that the diet version is worse for you, or, like, makes you gain weight faster than the full sugar version. Right? Out of every misconception, that one is, like, the absolute freaking gnarliest that I've ever heard. Oh, my goodness. But, you know, if you know anything about macro tracking, which hopefully you do, hopefully you're getting into it, you can, and we can relate. We're on the same wavelength when it comes to that. But I think this puts me a day fifty seven. And we're day fifty seven for this dieting phase. So we'll get up, uh, oh, yeah, shit. This will, is this gonna be the first dieting phase that extends beyond day one hundred? I think it might. I don't think I've ever dieted down for more than three months straight. So yeah, shit. Fast forward, uh, you know, just about six weeks. I'll be into some new territory, even some new ground. But until then, I'll just stick to this deficit, not to go too crazy. Uh, and at this point after, you know, bulking up and cutting down so many times, I think I'm pretty resilient to the, to the allure of having a crazy, cheap day, refeed. I, uh, I'll keep you updated. I mean, if I, if like, for whatever reason tonight, I, um, like I stopped at the store. I got two tubs of, um, two tubs of what? Like two tubs of Ben and Jerry's, and then like I stopped at, like, I mean, I'll tell you, but I don't think it's gonna freaking happen. So really, it's just a, uh, staying on track. Because I know that the cardio and the calorie deficit and the training is resulting in continuous fat loss for me. So if I know that's the setup, which I'm trying to follow, then I'll just stick to it if I actually want the results there. So that's where I think a lot of the, disconnect from, you know, really lock an indesum shit. Just comes from lack of information, you know? Because I think everybody would probably like to get into, at least, a position of a bit more control with their diet and their food and their training. But sometimes it's, uh, it just feels so far off from what you, you know, what you know how to do. So that's where I use your, you know, user two thumbs on the most powerful invention ever created by man. I would say to cell phone, right, information. And, you know, just start looking at the shit up. It's, uh, the information's out there. So readily available to those who want to find it. But until then, I've got arms tomorrow, which I'm already getting, uh, which I'm already getting excited for. But no, uh, no point talking about arms today. I get it. Just get back home. He's not going to pass out. I was, uh, I was rolling around last night to make a while of fall asleep. One of Fetch's start to melt at tone it again. Well, anyway, I'll, uh, I'll keep you updated. So I'll see for arms tomorrow.

Alright I've got one word to describe the camera. This is December 3rd and it's December 3rd Tuesday evening. It's a cold man starting to feel it. It might get to the point where I do where I double up the pants even instead of just pop on a sweater or something. But the lift goes on. The temperature would have to get to a point where well if he's subatomic zero to great Kelvin level to keep this arm punk from happening. I was about to say something almost. I'm getting into it. I'm watching land man get to
